            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# TV Game\n\nThere is a new TV game on BerTV. In this game two players get a number A consisting of 2n digits. Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on the \"TV Game\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to solve this \"TV Game\" problem. The core of it seems straightforward: we have two players, Homer and Marge, taking turns to build their numbers, and the goal is to maximize the sum of those numbers. The input's a bit rigid, a string of digits `A` of even length `2n`, and both players get `n` turns each.\n\nThe examples are helpful.  In the first example (`A = \"1234\"`), it's clear the solution isn't trivial.  I need to consider all possible sequences of 'H' and 'M' to see what the maximum sum is. Brute-forcing isn't feasible as `n` gets bigger. The second example (`A = \"9911\"`) really highlights that we need to be strategic. Simply taking the largest digits might not be the optimal approach.\n\nIt looks like the key is determining when to grab those big digits for yourself and when to let the other player take them. I'm already thinking about potential greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, or perhaps a recursive approach with memoization to explore the search space efficiently. Let me get into outlining the code structure and defining the best function signature for my needs. The examples suggest that simply taking the numbers in order might not be optimal. It's a subtle balance that needs to be struck.\n",
