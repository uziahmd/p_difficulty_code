He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem: find all positive integers 'n' whose factorial (n!) has exactly 'm' trailing zeroes. We need the count of such 'n's and the integers themselves, sorted. My first step is to figure out the core concept: how do we count those trailing zeroes?\n\nAha! It's all about prime factorization. Trailing zeroes are created by factors of 10, which means pairs of 2 and 5. Since there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is simply the number of 5s in the prime factorization. This is where Legendre's formula comes into play: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` This keeps going as long as the powers of 5 are less than or equal to 'n'.\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of this `Z(n)` function. It's non-decreasing, obviously; more 'n' means (at least) the same number of zeroes. Crucially, it only *increases* when 'n' is a multiple of 5. I ran through some examples to confirm this.\n\nI'm noticing something vital: If `Z(n) = m`, then `Z(n+1), Z(n+2), Z(n+3), Z(n+4)` are also likely to be `m`, as long as `n+k` isn't a multiple of 5. But when we hit a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` will jump. The jump size depends on the power of 5: jumps of 1 for multiples of 5, jumps of 2 or more for multiples of 25, jumps of 3 or more for multiples of 125, and so on. Understanding this jump behavior is key to efficiently finding the 'n's. This points towards an approach involving a search with jumps guided by powers of 5.\n",
