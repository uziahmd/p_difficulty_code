He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Python String Validation Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about how to efficiently determine if a given string `S` conforms to this specific, somewhat unusual pattern.  It essentially boils down to three sequential steps, each adding a new letter to the end: 'a', 'b', and 'c'. I need to write a Python script for it.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the rules thoroughly. There's an \"A step\" where we have some number of 'a's, at least one. Then a \"B step\" where we append 'b's, again, at least one. Finally, there's a \"C step\" where 'c's are added. This step is where things get interesting, because the number of 'c's must equal *either* the number of 'a's *or* the number of 'b's, or potentially both!\n\nSo, the fundamental criteria are that the string must have this strict `a...b...c` ordering, and also that there's at least one of each letter. The final key constraint is the relationship between the number of 'c's and the counts of 'a's and 'b's.\n\nMy approach will be straightforward, based on this understanding. I’ll initialize counters for the 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's to zero, and then iterate through the string.  I'll use a phased approach – first counting 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's.\n\nIn each phase, I’ll check if the character is the expected one. If it's not, or if I find 'a's after 'b's or 'c's, that's an immediate invalid string. I'll meticulously update the counters in each phase. Once I've finished the iterations, I'll assess whether the final count of 'c's indeed matches either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's, thus determining the string's validity according to the outlined pattern. This looks like a solid and performant solution.\n",
