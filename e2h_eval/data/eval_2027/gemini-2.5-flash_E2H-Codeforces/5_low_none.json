Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Colored Boots Problem: A Greedy Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Colored Boots\" problem and immediately thinking competitive programming. The goal is clear: maximize compatible boot pairs from two lists of boots, each with a color (a character or '?'). Compatibility rules are straightforward: exact matches are best, then \"?\" with any color, and \"?\" with \"?\".  My initial thought is to go for a greedy solution. This screams \"match the most restrictive cases first.\"\n\nMy plan is to build lists to index left and right boots based on their color. `left_boots[char]` and `right_boots[char]` will hold indices for left and right boots of color `char` (including '?').\n\nThe core strategy? Prioritize exact matches (specific color with specific color), then move to \"?\" matches strategically.\n\n1.  **Exact Matches (c, c):** For each color from 'a' to 'z', I'll iterate through `left_boots[c]` and `right_boots[c]`.  As long as there are boots of color 'c' on both sides, I'll pair them up immediately. This is the most restrictive scenario.\n\n2.  **`?` with Specific Color:**  Next, I'll handle the \"?\" boots. It's more efficient to match \"?\" with specific colors *before* matching \"?\" with \"?\". I'll iterate through colors again ('a' to 'z').  I'll form pairs:\n    *   Left \"?\" with Right specific color.\n    *   Left specific color with Right \"?\".  It doesn't matter the order, as long as I prioritize these two.\n\nBy focusing on the most restrictive cases first, I believe this greedy strategy should yield the optimal solution. I need to make sure I'm careful with the indices and how I manage the lists.  It looks like a manageable problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs and to output these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color '?' is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n3. Two different specific colors are not compatible (e.g., 'f' and 'g').\n\nWe need to use a greedy approach to maximize pairs. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, as this leaves the more flexible '?' boots available for other matches.\n\nHere's the matching strategy:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices:** First, we'll organize the boots by color. We can use lists or stacks to store the original 1-based indices of boots for each color.\n    `left_boots[char]` will store a list of indices of left boots with color `char`.\n    `right_boots[char]` will store a list of indices of right boots with color `char`.\n    We'll do this for all lowercase letters 'a' through 'z', and for '?'.\n\n2.  **Match Exact Specific Colors (c, c):**\n    These are the most restrictive matches. A left boot of color `c` and a right boot of color `c` can only form a compatible pair with each other or with a '?' boot. It's best to pair them directly to satisfy their strict color requirement.\n    Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'. While there are available left boots of color `c` and right boots of color `c`, form a pair. Add these pairs to our `result` list.\n\n3.  **Match Left '?' with Right Specific Colors (?, c):**\n    After exact matches, we might have remaining specific color boots and '?' boots. A left '?' boot can match any specific color right boot. It's generally better to use '?' boots to match specific colors rather than other '?' boots, as specific colors are less flexible.\n    Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'. While there are available left '?' boots and right boots of color `c`, form a pair.\n\n4.  **Match Left Specific Colors with Right '?' (c, ?):**\n    Similar to the previous step, a right '?' boot can match any specific color left boot.\n    Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'. While there are available left boots of color `c` and right '?' boots, form a pair.\n\n5.  **Match Left '?' with Right '?' (?, ?):**\n    Finally, any remaining '?' boots can be paired with each other. This is the least restrictive match, so it's done last.\n    While there are available left '?' boots and right '?' boots, form a pair.\n\nBy following this greedy strategy, we ensure that specific color boots are matched first with their exact counterparts, then with '?' boots, and finally '?' boots are matched with each other. This maximizes the total number of pairs.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`l = \"abaca?b\"`, `r = \"zabbbcc\"`\n\nInitial lists (1-based indices):\n`left_boots`: `a:[1,3,5]`, `b:[2,7]`, `c:[4]`, `?:[6]`\n`right_boots`: `a:[2]`, `b:[3,4]`, `c:[5,6,7]`, `z:[1]`\n\n1.  **Exact (c, c):**\n    *   `a`: `left_a:[1,3,5]`, `right_a:[2]`. Match `(1, 2)`. `result = [(1,2)]`.\n        `left_a:[3,5]`, `right_a:[]`.\n    *   `b`: `left_b:[2,7]`, `right_b:[3,4]`. Match `(2, 3)`. `result = [(1,2), (2,3)]`.\n        `left_b:[7]`, `right_b:[4]`. Match `(7, 4)`. `result = [(1,2), (2,3), (7,4)]`.\n        `left_b:[]`, `right_b:[]`.\n    *   `c`: `left_c:[4]`, `right_c:[5,6,7]`. Match `(4, 5)`. `result = [(1,2), (2,3), (7,4), (4,5)]`.\n        `left_c:[]`, `right_c:[6,7]`.\n    *   `z`: No left 'z', so no match.\n\n    Current `result`: `[(1,2), (2,3), (7,4), (4,5)]`\n    Remaining:\n    `left_a:[3,5]`, `left_c:[]`, `left_?:[6]`\n    `right_a:[]`, `right_c:[6,7]`, `right_z:[1]`, `right_?:[]`\n\n2.  **Left '?' with Right Specific Colors (?, c):**\n    *   `a`: `left_?:[6]`, `right_a:[]`. No match.\n    *   `c`: `left_?:[6]`, `right_c:[6,7]`. Match `(6, 6)`. `result = [(1,2), (2,3), (7,4), (4,5), (6,6)]`.\n        `left_?:[]`, `right_c:[7]`.\n    *   `z`: `left_?:[]`, `right_z:[1]`. No match.\n\n    Current `result`: `[(1,2), (2,3), (7,4), (4,5), (6,6)]`\n    Remaining:\n    `left_a:[3,5]`, `left_c:[]`, `left_?:[]`\n    `right_a:[]`, `right_c:[7]`, `right_z:[1]`, `right_?:[]`\n\n3.  **Left Specific Colors with Right '?' (c, ?):**\n    *   `a`: `left_a:[3,5]`, `right_?:[]`. No match.\n    *   `c`: `left_c:[]`, `right_?:[]`. No match.\n    *   `z`: No left 'z', `right_?:[]`. No match.\n\n    No new matches.\n\n4.  **Left '?' with Right '?' (?, ?):**\n    No left '?' and no right '?'. No new matches.\n\nFinal `result`: `[(1,2), (2,3), (7,4), (4,5), (6,6)]`. Total 5 pairs.\nNote that the example output is `5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2`. The pairs are the same, just in a different order and potentially different indices for '?' matches (e.g. `(6,5)` vs `(6,6)`). This is allowed (\"If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\"). My specific sequence of matches for '?' could lead to `(6,6)` if `right_c[0]` was `6`. The example output implies `right_c[0]` was `5` and `right_c[1]` was `6` for the `c` matches, and then `right_c[2]` was `7` for a `?` match. My specific indices for `r_c` were `[5,6,7]`. So `(4,5)` is correct. Then `(6,6)` is correct. The example output used `(4,6)` and `(6,5)`. This is just a difference in which specific indices are picked from the available lists, which is fine.\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is 5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-based indices for each color\n    # Using defaultdict to automatically create lists\n    left_boots = defaultdict(list)\n    right_boots = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_boots[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_boots[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # 1.
