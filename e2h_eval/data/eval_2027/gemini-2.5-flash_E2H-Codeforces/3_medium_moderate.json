            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Lanterns\n\nVanya walks late at night along a straight street of length l, lit by n lanterns. Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got this Vanya and Lanterns problem figured out. The goal is to find the smallest radius a lantern needs to have so that every part of a street, from 0 to 'l', is lit. The street has 'n' lanterns at different positions.\n\nFirst, the input data: the street length 'l', and a list of lantern positions `a_i`. My strategy revolves around these steps:\n\n1.  **Sorting:** The `a_i` list *must* be sorted. This organizes the lanterns in ascending order, which is essential to find gaps or overlaps in the street.\n\n2.  **Leftmost and Rightmost:** The first lantern, the one at the smallest position (call it `a_0`), must reach the street's beginning, point 0. That's a minimum radius of `a_0`. Similarly, the last lantern (at `a_{n-1}`) must cover the street's end, point `l`, requiring a radius of at least `l - a_{n-1}`.  We take the larger of these two as an initial minimum.\n\n3.  **Gaps between Lanterns:** The sorted list lets me identify potential gaps. For any two adjacent lanterns, the midpoint needs to be lit. The distance between them must be covered. For any `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the radius has to be at least half the distance between them: `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. To cover the complete gap, the radius should be the largest such value among all lantern pairs.\n\n4.  **Combining Conditions:** The overall minimum radius, `d`, is the *maximum* of: the left end coverage requirement (`a[0]`), the right end coverage requirement (`l - a[n-1]`), and the half-distances between each pair of adjacent lanterns, `(a_{i+1} - a_i)/2`.\n\nI'll use a `max_d` variable, initialized to zero (or better, initialized to `float(a[0])`). After sorting, I'll loop through the lantern positions calculating all the potential maximum radii and updating `max_d` each time. Finally, the value of `max_d` holds the answer.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n\n    # Ensure left side of street is illuminated\n    max_d = max(max_d, float(a[0]))\n\n    # Ensure right side of street is illuminated\n    max_d = max(max_d, float(l - a[n-1]))\n\n    # Ensure gaps between lanterns are covered\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap_distance = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        max_d = max(max_d, float(gap_distance) / 2.0)\n\n    print(f\"{max_d:.10f}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nThat should cover the bases and handle edge cases too, like a single lantern or all lanterns at the same point. The code should give an accurate result formatted with the precision needed. Let's see it run!\n",
