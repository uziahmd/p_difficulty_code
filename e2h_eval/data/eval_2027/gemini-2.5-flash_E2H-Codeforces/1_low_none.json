The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Gilded Cells Calculation - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The input parameters are `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).  Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle. The rings are nested, getting smaller as you go inwards.\n\nHere's the problem breakdown in my mind:\n\n*   I need to iterate through each of the `k` rings.\n*   For each ring `i`, I need to calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle. The formula is `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  Let's call these `current_w` and `current_h`.\n*   Then, I have to calculate the number of border cells for that `current_w x current_h` rectangle. That's the tricky part, ensuring I handle all edge cases correctly.\n\nInitially, I thought perimeter was the way to go.  `2 * (W + H) - 4` would give me the number of unique border cells, right?  But then I realized that breaks down when you get to a 1xN or Nx1 rectangle.  I've got to be more careful.\n\nLet's rethink the border cell count:\n\n*   For a rectangle `W x H` (where W and H are the dimensions), I can consider each side separately.  Top and bottom have `W` cells each.  Left and right sides have `H-2` cells each, excluding the corners.  This is a better way.\n*   So the general formula for a `W x H` rectangle is `2*W + 2*(H-2)`.  That's valid for `W > 1 and H > 1`.\n*   If `W=1`, it's a single column with `H` cells.  Or `2*1 + 2*(H - 2)` which gives `2H-2`. This isn't correct.  The right way to deal with this is to consider top and bottom, then the sides.\n*   If `H=1`, it's a single row of `W` cells.\n\nI will need to consider these special conditions:\n\n* If either width or height of inner rectangle equals 1. In this scenario, perimeter calculations will be wrong.\n\nI should be able to iterate through the rings, calculating the `current_w`, `current_h`, and then use the revised border cell counting logic to sum up the gilded cells.  Time to get to it.\n",
