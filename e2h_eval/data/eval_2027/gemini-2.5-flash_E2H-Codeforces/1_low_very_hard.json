The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "**Gilding Cell Calculation - A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm tasked with writing a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate.  Let's break this down. I need to consider the width (`w`), height (`h`) of the plate, and the number of gilded rings (`k`).  Each ring is essentially a border of cells on an inner rectangle.\n\nThe core idea is this: the `i`-th ring is the outer edge of a rectangle with dimensions `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. So, the first ring is the edge of the whole plate, the second ring is inwards, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\nMy first thought is to derive a general formula. For the `i`-th ring, the formula to calculate the number of cells would need to incorporate the dimensions of the inner rectangle.  The perimeter of a rectangle is `2W + 2H - 4` to account for the double-counting of the corners.  This formula should handle edge cases like when the inner rectangle shrinks to a smaller dimension. I need to check if dimensions of the inner rectangle are greater than or equal to 1. \n\nLooking at the problem constraints, it's clear I can't just keep subtracting 4 from each dimension indefinitely. The constraint `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)` is important.  This tells me that the inner rectangle dimensions must always be valid. Let's see how:\n\nLet `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`. The constraint on `k` means the minimal dimension of the inner rectangle must always be valid. We have:\n`4k <= min(w, h) + 1`\n`4k - 4 <= min(w, h) - 3`\n`4(k - 1) <= min(w, h) - 3`\nThis implies that `min(w - 4(k - 1), h - 4(k - 1)) >= 3`, which assures a valid border at all times.\n\nSo, I need a loop or iteration, where I calculate the number of gilded cells for each ring, from 1 up to `k`. The dimensions of the inner rectangle change with each `i`, but the perimeter formula should work for all rings as long as the dimensions are greater than 0. I will need to use this perimeter equation in my script and ensure it is called repeatedly for each ring.\n",
