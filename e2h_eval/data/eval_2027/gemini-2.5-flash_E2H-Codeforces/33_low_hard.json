You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Path to Maximum Digit Replacement**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The core is straightforward: given a number `a` and a set of replacement digits `s`, I need to maximize the resulting number. The ground rules are simple: I can only use each digit from `s` *once*, and I want to change as few digits as necessary in the input number `a`.\n\nMy thought process starts with the obvious: to maximize a number, I need to make its most significant digits as large as possible.  Since the length of `a` remains constant after replacements, that guiding principle is key. This means I'll have to iterate through `a` from left to right, checking each digit.\n\nHere's my algorithmic breakdown:\n\n1.  I'll treat `a` as a sequence (initially a string or convert it to a list of characters for easier modification) to make individual digit access easier.\n\n2.  Similarly, I'll convert `s` to a list of characters. The *crucial* step here is to **sort** `s` in *descending* order.  This ensures I pick the largest available replacement digit at each step.\n\n3.  Now, I'll loop through each digit of `a`.  For each `a[i]`, I'll iterate through my sorted `s`. The logic is clear: find the *first* digit in `s` that is *larger* than `a[i]`. If I find one, I replace `a[i]` with it and then remove that digit from `s` to ensure it's not reused. I keep iterating through `a` even after I have no more options.\n\nThe first step ensures that if I'm able to find a replacement candidate, I take it from the largest possible number. I'm going to start with the first digit of `a` and for each digit in `s`, replace it if it's strictly greater than the current digit in `a`. If I find no replacement I will skip the digit. After each change, I will remove the used digit from the list, since each digit can only be used once.\n\nThis is a pretty clean approach, and I think it'll work reliably. Let's get to coding this.\n",
