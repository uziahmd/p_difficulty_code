            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Substitutes in Number\n\nAndrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string s, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The plan is clear: a Python script to tackle the \"Substitutes in Number\" problem head-on.** We're dealing with string replacements that can blow up in size if we're not careful. The key insight? We need to avoid building that enormous string entirely. Instead, let's keep track of each digit's final value and length after all substitutions.\n\nLet's break it down: for each digit (0-9), we'll maintain two pieces of information: its numeric value (modulo 10^9 + 7) and its \"length\" (modulo 10^9 + 6, for exponent calculations). The \"length\" is crucial because it tells us how much each digit will contribute to the overall number's value, which depends on powers of 10.\n\nNow, the trick is processing the queries in *reverse order*. This way, when we update a digit's value based on a replacement string, we already know the *final* values and lengths of the digits in that string. It's like working backward to see the end result of all the substitutions.\n\nWhen updating a digit `di` with a replacement string `ti`, we work from right to left in `ti`. For each digit in `ti`, we calculate how it contributes to the overall value, taking into account its position and the *final* length of the digits to its right. We'll track the \"current power of 10\" and accumulate the value (modulo 10^9 + 7) and length (modulo 10^9 + 6) of `di` step by step.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, we compute the value of the initial string. We do it in the same way, from right to left, using the final values and lengths we've calculated for each digit.\n\nWe'll handle edge cases like empty replacement strings and leading zeroes, making sure everything behaves correctly under modular arithmetic. Empty strings just mean a digit disappears (value 0, length 0). Leading zeroes? No problem; they are naturally handled by our calculations. Let's make sure the `pow` function is correctly dealing with exponents, ensuring the result remains accurate. It seems the core logic, time and space complexities are good. With careful use of modulo and reverse processing, the code should be efficient and accurate for the constraints given. I'm ready to write the code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit substitutions in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. The string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct simulation impossible. We need a more efficient approach.\n\nThe key insight is to realize that the value of a number `d_k d_{k-1} ... d_1 d_0` can be expressed as `d_k * 10^k + d_{k-1} * 10^{k-1} + ... + d_1 * 10^1 + d_0 * 10^0`. This means we need to know two things for each digit that appears in the string:\n1. Its effective numerical value after all substitutions.\n2. Its effective length after all substitutions (to correctly determine the powers of 10).\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nSince lengths are used as exponents for powers of 10, and we need `a^b % M` where `M` is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem: `a^b % M = a^(b % (M-1)) % M`. So, for lengths, we'll use modulo `MOD_EXP = MOD - 1 = 10^9 + 6`.\n\nWe can define two arrays, `val` and `length`, both of size 10 (for digits 0-9).\n- `val[d]` will store the numerical value that digit `d` ultimately represents after all substitutions, modulo `MOD`.\n- `length[d]` will store the length of the string that digit `d` ultimately represents after all substitutions, modulo `MOD_EXP`.\n\nInitially, before any queries:\n- For each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n    - `val[d] = d` (the digit `d` represents its own value).\n    - `length[d] = 1` (the digit `d` has length 1).\n\nThe crucial part is the order of processing queries. If a query `di -> ti` is processed, and `ti` contains other digits `c`, these `c`s will themselves be subject to later queries. This suggests that we should process the queries in *reverse order*. When processing a query `di -> ti` in reverse, the `val[c]` and `length[c]` for any digit `c` appearing in `ti` will already reflect the effects of all subsequent (original order) queries.\n\nAlgorithm to process queries in reverse:\nFor each query `di -> ti` (starting from the last query and going backwards to the first):\n1. Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n2. Initialize `current_power_of_10 = 1`. This variable will keep track of `10` raised to the sum of `length`s of digits processed so far from the right of `ti`.\n3. Iterate through the string `ti` from right to left (let `char_c` be the current character, `digit_c = int(char_c)`):\n    a. Update `new_val_di`: `new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[digit_c] * current_power_of_10) % MOD`. This adds the value of `digit_c` (after its own substitutions) multiplied by the correct power of 10 for its position in `ti`.\n    b. Update `new_len_di`: `new_len_di = (new_len_di + length[digit_c]) % MOD_EXP`. This accumulates the total length of `ti`.\n    c. Update `current_power_of_10`: `current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD)) % MOD`. This prepares `current_power_of_10` for the next digit to the left. `pow(base, exp, mod)` is used for efficient modular exponentiation.\n4. After iterating through all characters in `ti`, update `val[di] = new_val_di` and `length[di] = new_len_di`.\n   If `ti` is an empty string, `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` will remain 0, correctly reflecting that `di` effectively disappears.\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` for each digit `d` will contain its final effective value and length after all substitutions.\n\nFinally, calculate the value of the initial string `s`:\n1. Initialize `final_result = 0`.\n2. Initialize `current_power_of_10 = 1`. This will keep track of `10` raised to the sum of `length`s of digits processed so far from the right of `s`.\n3. Iterate through the initial string `s` from right to left (let `char_c` be the current character, `digit_c = int(char_c)`):\n    a. Update `final_result`: `final_result = (final_result + val[digit_c] * current_power_of_10) % MOD`.\n    b. Update `current_power_of_10`: `current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD)) % MOD`.\n4. The `final_result` will be the answer.\n\nExample: `s = 222`, `2->0`, `0->7`\n1. Initial: `val = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`, `length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n2. Query `0->7` (last query in reverse):\n   `di=0`, `ti=\"7\"`.\n   `new_val_0 = val[7] = 7`.\n   `new_len_0 = length[7] = 1`.\n   Update: `val[0]=7`, `length[0]=1`.\n3. Query `2->0` (first query in reverse):\n   `di=2`, `ti=\"0\"`.\n   `new_val_2 = val[0] = 7` (using the *updated* `val[0]`).\n   `new_len_2 = length[0] = 1` (using the *updated* `length[0]`).\n   Update: `val[2]=7`, `length[2]=1`.\n4. Final `val` and `length` after all queries:\n   `val = [7,1,7,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n   `length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n5. Calculate for `s = \"222\"`:\n   - Rightmost '2': `final_result = (0 + val[2]*1) = 7`. `current_power_of_10 = (1 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) = 10`.\n   - Middle '2': `final_result = (7 + val[2]*10) = (7 + 7*10) = 77`. `current_power_of_10 = (10 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) = 100`.\n   - Leftmost '2': `final_result = (77 + val[2]*100) = (77 + 7*100) = 777`. `current_power_of_10 = (100 * pow(10, length[2], MOD)) = 1000`.\nResult: `777`.\n\nComplexity:\n- Initialization: O(1) for 10 digits.\n- Processing N queries: Each query involves iterating through `ti`. The sum of lengths of all `ti` strings is at most `10^5`. Each character in `ti` involves a few arithmetic operations and one modular exponentiation `pow(10, exp, MOD)`. Modular exponentiation takes `O(log(exp))` time. Since `exp` can be up to `MOD_EXP` (`10^9 + 6`), this is `O(log(10^9))`. Total for queries: `O(sum(|ti|) * log(MOD))`.\n- Final calculation for `s`: Similar to query processing, iterating through `s`. Length of `s` is at most `10^5`. Total for `s`: `O(|s| * log(MOD))`.\nTotal time complexity: `O((sum(|ti|) + |s|) * log(MOD))`, which is approximately `(10^5 + 10^5) * 30`, well within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(sum(|ti|) + |s|)` to store input, plus O(1) for `val` and `length` arrays.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries_raw = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries_raw.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_EXP = 1000000006 # For exponents, by Fermat's Little Theorem (a^b % M = a^(b % (M-1)) % M for prime M)\n\n    # Initialize val and length for each digit 0-9\n    # val[d] = numeric value represented by digit d after all substitutions, modulo MOD\n    # length[d] = length represented by digit d after all substitutions, modulo MOD_EXP\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    # This ensures that when we process di -> ti,\n    # val[c] and length[c] for any digit c in ti already reflect all subsequent replacements.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        query_str = queries_raw[i]\n        di_str, ti = query_str.split('->')\n        di = int(di_str)\n\n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_len_di = 0\n        current_power_of_10 = 1 # Accumulates 10^(total length of processed suffix of ti)\n\n        # Iterate through ti from right to left\n        for char_c in reversed(ti):\n            digit_c = int(char_c)\n            \n            # Add value of digit_c (after its own substitutions) * current_power_of_10\n            new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[digit_c] * current_power_of_10) % MOD\n            \n            # Add length of digit_c (after its own substitutions) to total length\n            new_len_di = (new_len_di + length[digit_c]) % MOD_EXP\n            \n            # Update current_power_of_10 for the next digit to the left\n            # It needs to be multiplied by 10^(length of digit_c)\n            current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD)) % MOD\n        \n        # Update val and length for di\n        val[di] = new_val_di\n        length[di] = new_len_di\n    \n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_result = 0\n    current_power_of_10 = 1 # Accumulates 10^(total length of processed suffix of s)\n\n    # Iterate through s from right to left\n    for char_c in reversed(s):\n        digit_c = int(char_c)\n        \n        # Add value of digit_c (after all substitutions) * current_power_of_10\n        final_result = (final_result + val[digit_c] * current_power_of_10) % MOD\n        \n        # Update current_power_of_10 for the next digit to the left\n        # It needs to be multiplied by 10^(length of digit_c)\n        current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD)) % MOD\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
