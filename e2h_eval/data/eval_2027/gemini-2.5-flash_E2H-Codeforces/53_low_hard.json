Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string. Overlapping occurrences are fine, which simplifies things a bit.  The input string is made up of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is manageable, between 1 and 100 characters. Since the string length is small, a brute-force approach seems perfectly acceptable.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\nFirst, I'll iterate through all possible substrings. For each substring, I'll count how many times it shows up in the original string. I'll need to keep track of the maximum length of a substring that meets the \"at least twice\" criteria.\n\nTo optimize, I'll start by iterating through potential substring lengths, working downwards from the maximum possible length (N-1, where N is the length of the string).  If I find a substring of length L that appears twice, then L is the answer, and I can stop immediately. This is because I'm iterating in decreasing order, so the first substring that meets the criteria will be the longest one.  If no substring is found, the default is 0.\n\nSo, I'm thinking:\n\n1.  **Outer Loop (Length):**  Iterate through substring lengths `L` from `N-1` down to `1`.\n2.  **Inner Loop (Starting Position):** For each length `L`, iterate through all possible starting positions `i` within the string. A substring of length `L` starting at `i` will be `S[i : i+L]`.\n3.  **Counting Occurrences:**  For each substring, count its occurrences within the original string. I'll need another loop to go through all possible starting positions `j` and compare `S[j : j+L]` to the substring.\n4.  **Update Maximum:**  If the count is greater than or equal to 2, I've found a valid substring. I'll update the `max_len` to `L` and immediately return the value or exit the script.\n\nIf no substring of length 1 or greater appears twice, then the `max_len` variable will remain at 0.  I'll initialize `max_len = 0` to handle the case where no duplicate substring exists.\n",
