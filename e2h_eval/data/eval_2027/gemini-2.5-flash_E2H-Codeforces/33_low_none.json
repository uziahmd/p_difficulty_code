You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. Essentially, the goal is to maximize a given number 'a' by replacing its digits with digits from a sequence 's', using each digit from 's' at most once.\n\nMy initial thought is to go for a greedy approach. To make 'a' as large as possible, I want to maximize its most significant digits first. This means I'll iterate through the digits of 'a' from left to right. At each position, I'll try to replace the digit with the largest available digit from 's' that's greater than the current digit in 'a'.\n\nTo be efficient, I'll sort the digits in 's' in descending order. This makes it really easy to find the largest available digit when comparing.\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n1.  I'll convert 'a' and 's' into lists of characters. This allows me to easily modify 'a'.\n2.  I'll sort the 's' list in descending order.\n3.  Now, I'll iterate through 'a', starting from the leftmost digit:\n    *   For each digit in 'a', I'll check if there's a larger digit in 's'.\n    *   If there is, I replace the digit in 'a' with the largest available digit from 's' and remove that digit from 's' since it's used.\n    *   If there isn't a larger digit in 's' for this position, I just move on to the next digit in 'a'. There's no point in looking for smaller digits in 's' since those wouldn't make the number larger at this significant position.\n4.  Finally, I'll join the modified list 'a' back into a string and print the result. That will be the maximized number.\n",
