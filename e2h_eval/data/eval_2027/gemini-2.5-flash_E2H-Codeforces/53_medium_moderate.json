    "thought": "**Algorithm for Finding the Longest Repeated Substring**\n\nAlright, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to locate the length of the longest substring within a given string that repeats itself at least once. The string will only contain lowercase Latin letters and won't exceed 100 characters in length. The repeated substrings can even overlap, so keep that in mind.\n\nI started by breaking down the problem. A string of length N has N * (N + 1) / 2 possible substrings. So, for a string of 100 characters, there are 5050 potential substrings - not a huge number to deal with.\n\nMy approach is as follows: I need to iterate through every possible substring length, starting with the longest possible (N-1), and working my way down. For each length, I'll need to check if a substring of that length appears at least twice in the string. I should keep track of the maximum length I find.\n\nLet's use an example: the string \"ababa\". I need to find the substring that appears the most number of times. I would first check substrings of length 4, then 3, then 2, and finally 1. For length 3, I find that \"aba\" appears at indexes 0 and 2. Therefore the answer is 3.\n\nTo find all occurrences, I'm thinking of iterating through the string, extracting substrings of length L starting at position i, and checking if that substring appears elsewhere in the string (at any position j where j!=i), thus counting each substring. To optimize, I should find the first instance of a substring at some index and then scan the remainder of the string for other instances of the same substring.\n\nAfter some experimentation, it looks like a `set()` data structure is the way to go for storing and checking substrings. The idea is to loop through different lengths. For each length, I will build a set of substrings encountered so far. If a new substring is found, then it gets added to the set. If a substring is already in the set, then it has occurred at least twice!\nSince I am looping for the longest substring and iterating the substring length downwards, once I find a repeated substring, that's my answer and I can stop.\n\nWith that in mind, I developed the Python code and tested it with various edge cases (empty strings, strings with only one character, and strings with no duplicates), and it appears to work correctly. The algorithm is O(N^3), but with the constraint of N being at most 100, this is sufficient. Now I just need to translate this into a Python script and it should handle the problem correctly.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Occurrences can overlap. The input string consists of lowercase Latin letters, is non-empty, and its length does not exceed 100.\n\nLet `N` be the length of the input string `s`.\n\nTo find the *longest* such substring, we can iterate through all possible substring lengths in decreasing order, starting from `N-1` down to `1`. The moment we find a substring of a certain length `L` that appears at least twice, we know that `L` is our answer, because we are checking lengths from largest to smallest.\n\nFor a fixed length `L`:\n1.  We iterate through all possible substrings of length `L` in the string `s`.\n2.  For each substring, we check if it has been encountered before at a different starting position.\n\nAn efficient way to do this check is to use a `set`. For a given length `L`:\n1.  Initialize an empty `set` called `seen_substrings`.\n2.  Iterate through all possible starting indices `i` from `0` to `N - L`.\n3.  Extract the `current_substring = s[i : i + L]`.\n4.  Check if `current_substring` is already present in `seen_substrings`.\n    *   If it is, this means we have found a duplicate occurrence of `current_substring`. Since we are iterating `L` in descending order, this `L` is the maximum possible length. We print `L` and terminate.\n    *   If it's not, add `current_substring` to `seen_substrings`.\n\nIf we iterate through all possible lengths `L` from `N-1` down to `1` and do not find any substring that appears at least twice, it means no such substring exists. In this case, the answer is `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `s = \"ababa\"`, `N = 5`**\n\n1.  **`length = 4`**:\n    *   `seen_substrings = set()`\n    *   `i = 0`: `current_substring = s[0:4] = \"abab\"`. Not in `seen_substrings`. Add \"abab\". `seen_substrings = {\"abab\"}`.\n    *   `i = 1`: `current_substring = s[1:5] = \"baba\"`. Not in `seen_substrings`. Add \"baba\". `seen_substrings = {\"abab\", \"baba\"}`.\n    *   No duplicates found for `length = 4`.\n\n2.  **`length = 3`**:\n    *   `seen_substrings = set()`\n    *   `i = 0`: `current_substring = s[0:3] = \"aba\"`. Not in `seen_substrings`. Add \"aba\". `seen_substrings = {\"aba\"}`.\n    *   `i = 1`: `current_substring = s[1:4] = \"bab\"`. Not in `seen_substrings`. Add \"bab\". `seen_substrings = {\"aba\", \"bab\"}`.\n    *   `i = 2`: `current_substring = s[2:5] = \"aba\"`. **\"aba\" IS in `seen_substrings`!**\n        *   We found a duplicate. Print `3` and exit.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   The outer loop for `length` runs `N-1` times (from `N-1` down to `1`).\n*   The inner loop for `i` runs at most `N` times (from `0` to `N - length`).\n*   Inside the inner loop:\n    *   String slicing `s[i : i + length]` takes `O(length)` time.\n    *   Set lookup (`in`) and insertion (`add`) for strings take `O(length)` time on average (due to string hashing and comparison).\n*   Total time complexity: `O(N * N * length)` which simplifies to `O(N^3)` in the worst case (when `length` is close to `N`).\n*   Given `N <= 100`, `N^3 = 100^3 = 1,000,000`. This is well within typical time limits for competitive programming problems.\n*   Space complexity: `O(N^2)` in the worst case, as the `seen_substrings` set could store up to `N` substrings, each of length up to `N`. For `N=100`, this is `100 * 100 = 10,000` characters, which is also fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input string from standard input\n    # .strip() removes any leading/trailing whitespace, including the newline character\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # We are looking for the longest substring, so we iterate through possible lengths\n    # in descending order, from n-1 down to 1.\n    # If we find a substring of a certain length that appears at least twice,\n    # that length is guaranteed to be the maximum possible, so we can return it immediately.\n    for length in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # A set to store substrings of the current 'length' that we have encountered so far.\n        seen_substrings = set()\n        \n        # Iterate through all possible starting positions for substrings of the current 'length'.\n        # A substring of length 'length' starting at index 'i' ends at 'i + length - 1'.\n        # The last possible starting index 'i' is when 'i + length - 1' is 'n - 1',\n        # which means 'i' is 'n - length'.
