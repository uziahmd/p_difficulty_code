            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Converting Between Number Bases: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to convert a number, let's call it `c`, from a base `a` to a base `b`.  The input will be given in a specific format: the first line will contain `a` and `b` (or 'R' for Roman numerals), and the second line will be the number `c` as a string.  There are a few constraints I need to keep in mind, specifically the range of the bases, the maximum length of `c`, and the upper limits for the decimal equivalent of `c`.  I see that when `b` is 'R', the decimal value is <= 3000, and otherwise <= 10^15.\n\nThe problem seems to break down naturally into two main parts. First, I need to convert `c` from base `a` into its decimal (base 10) equivalent.  Then, I'll need to convert that decimal number into the final base `b` (either an integer base or Roman numerals).\n\nFor the first part, converting to decimal, I'll handle the input string `c`. It can contain digits and letters (A-Z) representing digits in bases greater than 10.  Given that `a` is at most 25, the largest digit needed is 'O' (24). I'll write a function, `to_decimal(num_str, base)`, to handle this. It should iterate through the input string, calculate the digit's value, and then update the decimal value by multiplying by the base and adding the digit value. A helper function, `get_digit_value(char)`, will be used to extract the integer value from a character representing a digit. The examples given confirm the logic, the calculation is straightforward. The constraints say Python integers can handle arbitrary size, so I shouldn't have any overflow issues.\n\nNow, for the second part, converting the decimal number to base `b`, I'll break it down further into two sub-cases, depending on whether `b` is an integer base or 'R'.\n\nThe next step is working on sub-case 2.1...\n",
