    "thought": "**My Strategy for the \"Good\" Tree Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving \"good\" edge-weighted trees. The goal is to compute the sum of `d(1, n)` across all these \"good\" trees, modulo 998244353. Let's break down what a \"good\" tree entails.\n\nEssentially, a \"good\" tree is an edge-weighted tree with *n* vertices, where each edge weight is either 1 or -1.  The crucial condition is that for *each* vertex `i`, the product of the weights of its incident edges must equal -1.  Formally,  `product_{ (i,j) is an edge } w(i, j) = -1`.\n\nInitially, I thought I'd get a contradiction when I multiplied all the vertex conditions together.  I started by writing out the product of the vertex conditions:  `product_{ i=1 to n } ( product_{ j : (i,j) in E } w(i, j) ) = product_{ i=1 to n } (-1)`. Since each edge weight is either 1 or -1, multiplying by it twice results in a product of 1.  So the left side simplifies to 1, while the right side simplifies to `(-1)^n`.  This led me to the (incorrect) conclusion that *n* had to be odd.  I missed an important point: *even* `n` still has `1 = 1`, while *odd* `n` still has `1 = -1`. So I need to re-evaluate this.\n\nI realized I need to focus on the parity of the edge weights for each vertex. For a vertex `i`, the product of its edge weights being -1 means there must be an odd number of -1 edges connected to it. Let's call that `N_neg(i)`. So, `N_neg(i)` must be odd for all vertices.\n\nNow consider the sum of these `N_neg(i)` across all vertices: `sum_{ i=1 to n } N_neg(i)`. Each -1 edge contributes 1 to two vertices' `N_neg`, so this sum equals 2 times the number of -1 edges. Since this sum is twice an integer, it must be even.  This must be the key condition to ensure a good tree.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of $d(1, n)$ over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo $998244353$.\nAn edge-weighted tree has $n$ vertices, and each edge weight is either $1$ or $-1$.\nA tree is \"good\" if for each vertex $i$, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to $i$ is $-1$.\n\nLet $w(u, v)$ be the weight of the edge between $u$ and $v$.\nThe condition for a good tree is: $\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w(i, j) = -1$ for each vertex $i$.\n\nLet's analyze the condition for the existence of a good tree.\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices $i$:\n$\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w(i, j) \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (-1) = (-1)^n$.\nThe left side of the equation can be rewritten. Each edge $(u,v)$ contributes $w(u,v)$ twice to this product (once for vertex $u$ and once for vertex $v$).\nSo, $\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w(i, j) \\right) = \\prod_{(u,v) \\in E} (w(u,v))^2$.\nSince $w(u,v) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, we have $(w(u,v))^2 = 1$ for all edges.\nThus, $\\prod_{(u,v) \\in E} (w(u,v))^2 = 1^{n-1} = 1$.\nEquating the two results, we get $1 = (-1)^n$.\nThis implies that $n$ must be an even number for good trees to exist.\nIf $n$ is odd, then $1 = -1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, if $n$ is odd, there are no good trees, and the sum of $d(1,n)$ is $0$.\n\nNow, let's assume $n$ is an even number.\nFor any given tree structure (the set of edges), we need to determine if edge weights can be assigned to make it good, and if so, how many ways.\nFor each vertex $i$, let $x_{i,j} = w(i,j)$. The condition is $\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} x_{i,j} = -1$.\nThis is equivalent to saying that for each vertex $i$, the number of incident edges with weight $-1$ must be odd.\nLet $y_{i,j} = 0$ if $w(i,j)=1$ and $y_{i,j}=1$ if $w(i,j)=-1$.\nThen the condition becomes $\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} y_{i,j} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ for each vertex $i$.\nThis is a system of linear equations over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe sum of all equations is $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} y_{i,j} \\right) \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThe left side is $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} (y_{u,v} + y_{v,u}) = 2 \\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} y_{u,v} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe right side is $n \\pmod 2$.\nSince $n$ is even, $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. So $0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, which is consistent.\nThis means the system of equations has solutions. For a tree with $n-1$ edges and $n$ vertices, the rank of the incidence matrix over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is $n-1$. This implies that if solutions exist, there are $2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} = 2^0 = 1$ unique solution for edge weights.\nSo, for any given tree structure, if $n$ is even, there is exactly one way to assign weights to make it a good tree.\n\nThus, if $n$ is odd, the answer is $0$.\nIf $n$ is even, for each of the $n^{n-2}$ tree structures, there is exactly one way to assign weights to make it good. We need to sum $d(1,n)$ over these $n^{n-2}$ good trees.\n\nLet $d(u,v)$ be the sum of weights on the unique path from $u$ to $v$.\nWe want to calculate $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d(1,n)$.\nThis sum can be rewritten as $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{(x,y) \\in P(1,n)} w(x,y)$, where $P(1,n)$ is the path from $1$ to $n$.\nBy linearity of expectation (or sum), this is $\\sum_{(u,v) \\text{ edge}} \\sum_{T \\text{ good s.t. } (u,v) \\in P(1,n)} w(u,v)$.\n\nConsider a specific edge $(u,v)$. What is $w(u,v)$ in a good tree?\nIn the unique weight assignment for a given tree, $w(u,v)$ is determined.\nLet $P_1$ be the set of edges incident to $1$ with weight $-1$. Let $P_n$ be the set of edges incident to $n$ with weight $-1$.\nThe conditions are $\\prod_{(1,j) \\in E} w(1,j) = -1$ and $\\prod_{(n,j) \\in E} w(n,j) = -1$.\nConsider the path $P(1,n)$ from $1$ to $n$.\nLet $w(e)$ be the weight of an edge $e$.\nThe sum $d(1,n) = \\sum_{e \\in P(1,n)} w(e)$.\nIt is known that for an edge $e=(u,v)$ on the path $P(1,n)$, $w(u,v) = \\left( \\prod_{x \\in T_u} \\prod_{(x,y) \\in E} w(x,y) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\prod_{x \\in T_v} \\prod_{(x,y) \\in E} w(x,y) \\right)$ where $T_u$ and $T_v$ are the two components formed by removing $e$.\nEach product $\\prod_{(x,y) \\in E} w(x,y)$ is $-1$ for $x \\neq u,v$.\nThe product for $u$ is $\\prod_{(u,j) \\in E} w(u,j) = -1$.\nThe product for $v$ is $\\prod_{(v,j) \\in E} w(v,j) = -1$.\nThe product for any other vertex $x$ in $T_u$ (or $T_v$) is also $-1$.\nThe product over all vertices in $T_u$ is $(-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nThe product over all vertices in $T_v$ is $(-1)^{|T_v|}$.\nThe product of weights of edges within $T_u$ is $1$.\nThe product of weights of edges within $T_v$ is $1$.\nThe product of weights of edges incident to $u$ within $T_u$ is $w(u,v) \\cdot (\\text{product of other edges incident to } u)$.\nThis is getting complicated. Let's use a known result for the sum of $d(u,v)$.\n\nA standard result for $d(u,v)$ in such a system is derived from the fact that $w(x,y)$ must be $-1$ if removing $(x,y)$ splits the tree into two components, one of size $k$ and the other of size $n-k$, where $k$ is odd. And $w(x,y)=1$ if both $k$ and $n-k$ are even. (This is for a different problem where $\\prod w(i,j)=1$ for all $i$ except two specific vertices $u,v$ where it's $-1$).\n\nFor our problem, each vertex must have an odd number of incident $-1$ edges.\nLet's consider the parity of the number of $-1$ edges.\nFor an edge $(u,v)$, $w(u,v)$ is $1$ or $-1$.\nLet $S_u$ be the set of neighbors of $u$, $S_v$ be the set of neighbors of $v$.\n$\\prod_{x \\in S_u} w(u,x) = -1$.\n$\\prod_{y \\in S_v} w(v,y) = -1$.\n\nA key observation for this type of problem is often related to the number of vertices in subtrees.\nIf we remove an edge $(u,v)$, the tree splits into two components, say $T_u$ containing $u$ and $T_v$ containing $v$. Let $|T_u|$ be the number of vertices in $T_u$ and $|T_v|$ be the number of vertices in $T_v$.\nFor any vertex $x \\in T_u \\setminus \\{u\\}$, the condition $\\prod_{(x,y) \\in E} w(x,y) = -1$ holds.\nFor any vertex $y \\in T_v \\setminus \\{v\\}$, the condition $\\prod_{(y,z) \\in E} w(y,z) = -1$ holds.\nThe product of all conditions for vertices in $T_u$ is $(-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nThe product of all conditions for vertices in $T_v$ is $(-1)^{|T_v|}$.\nThe product of squares of edge weights within $T_u$ is $1$.\nThe product of squares of edge weights within $T_v$ is $1$.\nSo, $\\prod_{x \\in T_u} (\\prod_{(x,y) \\in E_{T_u}} w(x,y)) \\cdot w(u,v)^{\\text{if }(u,v) \\in E_{T_u}} = (-1)^{|T_u|}$.\nThis simplifies to $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_u| - 1}$.\nSimilarly, $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_v| - 1}$.\nThis implies $(-1)^{|T_u|-1} = (-1)^{|T_v|-1}$.\nSince $|T_u| + |T_v| = n$ and $n$ is even, $|T_u|$ and $|T_v|$ must have the same parity. So $|T_u|-1$ and $|T_v|-1$ also have the same parity. This is consistent.\nSo, for an edge $(u,v)$, its weight $w(u,v)$ is $-1$ if $|T_u|$ is even (and thus $|T_v|$ is even), and $w(u,v)$ is $1$ if $|T_u|$ is odd (and thus $|T_v|$ is odd).\n\nThe path $P(1,n)$ from $1$ to $n$ consists of edges $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_k$.\nFor each edge $e=(u,v)$ on this path, removing $e$ splits the tree into two components, one containing $1$ and the other containing $n$.\nLet $S_1(e)$ be the component containing $1$ and $S_n(e)$ be the component containing $n$.\nThen $w(e) = (-1)^{|S_1(e)|-1}$.\nSo $d(1,n) = \\sum_{e \\in P(1,n)} (-1)^{|S_1(e)|-1}$.\n\nLet's use the result from a related problem: The sum of $d(u,v)$ over all trees for $u,v$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k(n-k) n^{n-3} \\cdot (\\text{factor based on weights})$.\nFor $n$ even, each edge $(u,v)$ has weight $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_u|-1}$.\nWe need to sum $d(1,n) = \\sum_{e \\in P(1,n)} w(e)$ over all $n^{n-2}$ trees.\nConsider an arbitrary edge $(u,v)$. We want to calculate its contribution to the total sum.\nThe edge $(u,v)$ contributes $w(u,v)$ to $d(1,n)$ if and only if $(u,v)$ is on the path $P(1,n)$.\nThe number of trees where a specific edge $(u,v)$ exists and is on the path $P(1,n)$ is $2 \\cdot n^{n-3}$ (for $n \\ge 2$). This is because we can fix $u$ and $v$ as endpoints of an edge, and then root the tree at $u$ and $v$. The number of trees is $n^{n-2}$. The number of trees where $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge is $n^{n-3}$. No, this is not correct.\nThe number of trees where a specific edge $(u,v)$ exists is $n^{n-3}$ (by contracting $(u,v)$ to a single vertex, we get a tree on $n-1$ vertices).\nIf $(u,v)$ is on the path $P(1,n)$, removing $(u,v)$ separates $1$ from $n$.\nLet $k$ be the size of the component containing $1$ (and $u$). Then $n-k$ is the size of the component containing $n$ (and $v$).\nThe number of trees where $1$ and $u$ are in a component of size $k$ and $v$ and $n$ are in a component of size $n-k$, and $(u,v)$ is an edge connecting these two components, is given by a variant of Cayley's formula:\n$k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} \\cdot k \\cdot (n-k)$.\nThe $k \\cdot (n-k)$ part is for choosing which vertex in the first component connects to which vertex in the second component.\nThis is the number of trees where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and $n$ is in a component of size $n-k$, if edge $(u,v)$ separates them, where $u$ is in the first component and $v$ in the second.\nThis formula counts trees where $1$ is in a specific component of size $k$, $n$ in a specific component of size $n-k$, and these components are connected by a specific edge $(u,v)$.\nThe number of trees where an edge $(u,v)$ separates $1$ from $n$, with $1$ in the component of size $k$ and $n$ in the component of size $n-k$, is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nFor such a tree, the weight of edge $(u,v)$ is $(-1)^{k-1}$.\nSo the contribution of edge $(u,v)$ to the total sum is $w(u,v) \\times (\\text{number of trees where } (u,v) \\text{ is on } P(1,n) \\text{ and } |S_1(u,v)|=k)$.\nThis is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis sum is independent of the choice of $u,v$. Wait, this is the contribution of one specific edge.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{u,v} \\sum_{T \\text{ good s.t. } (u,v) \\in P(1,n)} w(u,v)$.\nNo, this is not right. The sum is over trees.\n$\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d(1,n) = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{e \\in P(1,n)} w(e)$.\nWe can swap the sums: $\\sum_{e=(u,v) \\text{ possible edge}} \\sum_{T \\text{ good s.t. } e \\in P(1,n)} w(e)$.\nThe edge $e=(u,v)$ contributes $w(e)$ to $d(1,n)$ if $e$ is on the path $P(1,n)$.\nFor a fixed edge $e=(u,v)$, the number of trees where $e$ is on $P(1,n)$ and $1$ is in the component of size $k$ (containing $u$) and $n$ is in the component of size $n-k$ (containing $v$) is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nIn such a tree, $w(e) = (-1)^{k-1}$.\nSo, the total sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is a known identity related to trees. It sums over all possible ways to split $n$ vertices into two components of size $k$ and $n-k$ and connect them with an edge.\nThe identity is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-2}$. This sums over all trees.\nOur required sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\n\nLet $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is a sum over $k$.\nFor $n=1$, $0$.\nFor $n=2$: $S = (-1)^{2-1} \\binom{0}{0} 1^{1-1} (2-1)^{2-1-1} = (-1)^1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = -1$.\nThis matches the example output.\n\nFor $n=4$:\n$S = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (4-k)^{4-k-1}$.\n$k=1: (-1)^0 \\binom{2}{0} 1^{0} 3^{2} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 = 9$.\n$k=2: (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{1} 2^{1} 2^{1} = -1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = -8$.\n$k=3: (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{2} 3^{2} 1^{0} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 = 9$.\n$S = 9 - 8 + 9 = 10$.\nThe example output for $n=4$ is $998244343 = -10 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nMy calculation yields $10$, which is $-(-10)$. What went wrong?\n\nThe problem asks for $d(1,n)$, which is the sum of weights.\nEach edge $e=(u,v)$ on the path $P(1,n)$ has weight $w(e) = (-1)^{|S_1(e)|-1}$.\nSo $d(1,n) = \\sum_{e \\in P(1,n)} (-1)^{|S_1(e)|-1}$.\nThe term $(-1)^{k-1}$ is for the edge that splits the tree into components of size $k$ (containing $1$) and $n-k$ (containing $n$).\nThis is correct.\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$ counts the number of times an edge $(u,v)$ that separates $1$ from $n$ appears in any tree.\nThe sum should be $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\n\nLet's recheck the $n=4$ example.\nThe sum of $d(1,4)$ is $-10$. My formula gives $10$. This suggests a sign error.\nThe weight $w(u,v)$ is $-1$ if $|T_u|$ is even, and $1$ if $|T_u|$ is odd.\nSo $w(u,v) = -1$ if $k$ is even, $w(u,v) = 1$ if $k$ is odd.\nThis means $w(u,v) = (-1)^{k-1}$ if $k$ is odd, and $w(u,v) = (-1)^k$ if $k$ is even.\nThis is exactly $(-1)^{k-1}$.\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nCould it be that $d(u,v)$ is defined as the sum of weights, but the example values are negative?\nThe example says $d(1,4)$ values are $-2, -1, 0, 1$. Sum is $-10$.\nMy formula gives $10$.\nThis means my $w(e)$ is the negative of the actual $w(e)$?\nLet's check the condition $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|T_u|-1}$.\nIf $|T_u|$ is even, $w(u,v) = -1$.\nIf $|T_u|$ is odd, $w(u,v) = 1$.\nThis is what I used.\n\nLet's check the conditions for $n=2$.\nTree is $1-2$. $w(1,2)$.\nCondition for $1$: $w(1,2) = -1$.\nCondition for $2$: $w(1,2) = -1$.\nSo $w(1,2)=-1$.\n$d(1,2) = w(1,2) = -1$.\nMy formula: $n=2$, $k=1$. $S = (-1)^{1-1} \\binom{2-2}{1-1} 1^{1-1} (2-1)^{2-1-1} = (-1)^0 \\binom{0}{0} 1^0 1^0 = 1$.\nMy formula gives $1$, but the example says $d(1,2)=-1$.\nThis means my $w(e)$ definition is flipped.\nSo the correct weight is $w(e) = -(-1)^{k-1} = (-1)^k$.\nWith this correction, the sum is $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate for $n=2$:\n$S = (-1)^{1} \\binom{0}{0} 1^0 1^0 = -1$. This matches the example.\nLet's re-evaluate for $n=4$:\n$k=1: (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{0} 1^0 3^2 = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 = -9$.\n$k=2: (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{1} 2^1 2^1 = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\n$k=3: (-1)^3 \\binom{2}{2} 3^2 1^0 = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 = -9$.\n$S = -9 + 8 - 9 = -10$. This matches the example.\n\nSo the formula is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is for $n$ even. If $n$ is odd, the answer is $0$.\n\nThe sum can be written as $n^{n-2} \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\frac{\\binom{n-2}{k-1}}{n^{n-2}} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\right)$.\nThis sum is related to Abel's identity.\n$\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (x+ky)^{k-1} (z+(n-k)y)^{n-k-1} = \\frac{(x+z+ny)^{n-1}}{x z}$. (for $x,z \\neq 0$).\nA specific version is $\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (k+a)^{k-1} (n-k+b)^{n-k-1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}\\right) (n+a+b)^{n-1}$.\nOur sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nLet $j=k-1$. Then $k=j+1$.\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (-1)^{j+1} \\binom{n-2}{j} (j+1)^{j} (n-(j+1))^{n-(j+1)-1}$.\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (-1)^{j+1} \\binom{n-2}{j} (j+1)^{j} (n-j-1)^{n-j-2}$.\nThis is not directly an Abel identity.\n\nLet $F(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{k} (k+1)^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} x^k$.\nNo, the sum is not directly related to $n^{n-2}$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-2}$.\nThis sum is known as a form of Cayley's formula.\nThe sum we need to compute is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nLet $j=k-1$.\n$S = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (-1)^{j+1} \\binom{n-2}{j} (j+1)^{j} (n-j-1)^{n-j-2}$.\nThis is a standard identity: $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (k+a)^{k-1} (n-k+b)^{n-k-1} = 0$ if $a+b \\neq 0$.\nNo, this is not true.\n\nA known identity (related to generating functions for trees) is:\n$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-2}$.\nA more general identity:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (x+k)^{k-1} (y+n-k)^{n-k-1} = \\frac{(x+y+n)^{n-1}}{xy}$\nThis is for $x,y \\neq 0$.\nLet's try to adapt it. We have $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$. Let $N=n-2$. Let $j=k-1$.\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{N} (-1)^{j+1} \\binom{N}{j} (j+1)^{j} (N-j+1)^{N-j}$.\nThis is of the form $\\sum_{j=0}^{N} (-1)^{j+1} \\binom{N}{j} (j+1)^{j} ( (N-j)+1 )^{ (N-j) }$.\nLet $f(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^N \\binom{N}{j} (j+1)^j (N-j+1)^{N-j} x^j$.\nThis looks like an identity involving $T(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty k^{k-1} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$, where $T(x)e^{-T(x)}=x$.\n\nThe identity we need is:\n$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = -(n-2)! \\left[ x^{n-2} \\right] \\left( \\frac{T'(x)}{1+T(x)} \\right)^2$ where $T(x)$ is the tree generating function $T(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty k^{k-1} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$.\nThis is quite complex.\n\nLet's compute the sum using direct computation for $N=n-2$.\n$S = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} (-1)^{j+1} \\binom{N}{j} (j+1)^{j} (N-j+1)^{N-j}$.\nThis needs to be computed in $O(N \\log MOD)$ or $O(N)$.\nPrecompute factorials, inverse factorials.\nPrecompute powers $k^k$. $k^0=1$.\n$k^{k-1}$ can be computed as $k^k \\cdot k^{-1} \\pmod{MOD}$.\n$N = n-2$.\n$j+1$ ranges from $1$ to $n-1$.\n$N-j+1$ ranges from $n-1$ down to $1$.\n$0^0$ is usually taken as $1$.\nFor $k=1$, $k^{k-1} = 1^0 = 1$.\nFor $n-k=1$, $(n-k)^{n-k-1} = 1^0 = 1$.\n\nThe maximum value of $N=n-2$ is $5 \\cdot 10^5 - 2$.\nWe need to compute $k^k$ and $k^{k-1}$ for $k$ up to $n-1$.\nModular exponentiation $a^b \\pmod M$ takes $O(\\log b)$ time.\nSo $O(N \\log N)$ for each term, total $O(N^2 \\log N)$ which is too slow.\nWe need $O(N \\log MOD)$ or $O(N)$.\nPowers $k^k$ can be computed in $O(N \\log k)$ total for all $k$ by precomputing $k^1, k^2, \\ldots, k^{N}$ and then doing modular inverse for $k^{-1}$.\n$k^{k-1} = k^k \\cdot k^{-1}$.\n$k^k$ can be computed in $O(N \\log K)$ using $k^k = k^{k/2} \\cdot k^{k/2}$ or $k \\cdot k^{k-1}$.\nWe can compute $k^k \\pmod M$ for all $k$ up to $N+1$ in $O(N \\log N)$ time.\n$k^{k-1} = k^k \\cdot k^{-1} \\pmod M$.\n$k^{-1} \\pmod M$ can be precomputed for all $k$ up to $N+1$ in $O(N)$ time.\nSo each term can be computed in $O(1)$ after $O(N \\log N)$ preprocessing.\nTotal time complexity will be $O(N \\log N)$.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Handle $n=1$: Output $0$.\n2. If $n$ is odd and $n > 1$: Output $0$.\n3. If $n$ is even:\n   a. Set $MOD = 998244353$.\n   b. Precompute factorials `fact[i]` and inverse factorials `invfact[i]` up to $n-2$.\n   c. Precompute modular inverses `inv[i]` for $i$ up to $n-1$.\n   d. Precompute `pow_k_k[i] = i^i \\pmod{MOD}` for $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$.\n      `pow_k_k[0]` can be $1$ (for $0^0$).\n      `pow_k_k[i]` can be computed as `pow(i, i, MOD)`. This is $O(N \\log N)$.\n   e. Initialize `total_sum = 0`.\n   f. Iterate $j$ from $0$ to $n-2$:\n      i. $k = j+1$.\n      ii. $n_k = n-j-1$.\n      iii. Calculate $\\binom{n-2}{j} = \\text{fact}[n-2] \\cdot \\text{invfact}[j] \\cdot \\text{invfact}[n-2-j] \\pmod{MOD}$.\n      iv. Calculate $(j+1)^{j} = \\text{pow_k_k}[k] \\cdot \\text{inv}[k] \\pmod{MOD}$. (If $k=0$, this is $1$).\n          For $k=1$, $1^0=1$. So `pow_k_k[1]*inv[1]` is $1*1=1$.\n      v. Calculate $(n-j-1)^{n-j-2} = \\text{pow_k_k}[n_k] \\cdot \\text{inv}[n_k] \\pmod{MOD}$. (If $n_k=0$, this is $1$).\n          For $n_k=1$, $1^0=1$. So `pow_k_k[1]*inv[1]` is $1*1=1$.\n      vi. Term = $\\binom{n-2}{j} \\cdot (j+1)^{j} \\cdot (n-j-1)^{n-j-2} \\pmod{MOD}$.\n      vii. If $j+1$ is odd (i.e., $k$ is odd), add `Term` to `total_sum`.\n      viii. If $j+1$ is even (i.e., $k$ is even), subtract `Term` from `total_sum`.\n   g. Adjust `total_sum` to be in $[0, MOD-1]$.\n   h. Print `total_sum`.\n\nSpecial cases for powers:\n$0^0=1$.\n$k^{k-1}$:\nIf $k=1$, $1^0=1$.\nIf $k=0$, this term doesn't appear in the sum. $j+1 \\ge 1$.\n$n_k^{n_k-1}$:\nIf $n_k=1$, $1^0=1$.\nIf $n_k=0$, this doesn't appear in sum. $n-j-1 \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's check $k=1$ and $n-k=1$ terms.\nFor $j=0$ ($k=1$): $\\binom{n-2}{0} (1)^0 (n-1)^{n-2}$. Term is $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (n-1)^{n-2}$. Sign is $(-1)^1 = -1$.\nFor $j=n-2$ ($k=n-1$): $\\binom{n-2}{n-2} (n-1)^{n-2} (1)^0$. Term is $1 \\cdot (n-1)^{n-2} \\cdot 1$. Sign is $(-1)^{n-1}$.\nSince $n$ is even, $n-1$ is odd. So $(-1)^{n-1}=-1$.\nBoth terms are $-(n-1)^{n-2}$.\n\nExample $n=4$:\n$N=2$.\n$j=0: k=1, n_k=3$. Term: $\\binom{2}{0} 1^0 3^2 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 = 9$. Sign $(-1)^1 = -1$. Contribution: $-9$.\n$j=1: k=2, n_k=2$. Term: $\\binom{2}{1} 2^1 2^1 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$. Sign $(-1)^2 = 1$. Contribution: $8$.\n$j=2: k=3, n_k=1$. Term: $\\binom{2}{2} 3^2 1^0 = 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 = 9$. Sign $(-1)^3 = -1$. Contribution: $-9$.\nTotal sum: $-9+8-9 = -10$.\nThis matches.\n\nImplementation details:\nModular exponentiation function `pow(base, exp, mod)`.\nModular inverse function `inv(n, mod)` using Fermat's Little Theorem: `pow(n, mod-2, mod)`.\nPrecompute `fact`, `invfact` arrays.\nPrecompute `inv` array for $1 \\dots n-1$.\nPrecompute `pow_k_k` array for $1 \\dots n-1$.\n\nFinal check on constraints: $n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$O(N \\log N)$ for `pow_k_k` array is $5 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(5 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 5 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 19 \\approx 9.5 \\cdot 10^6$, which is acceptable.\nThe loop for sum is $O(N)$.\nTotal time complexity is fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    if n == 1: # Though n is odd, base case for formula\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n    MAX_VAL = n\n    fact = [1] * (MAX_VAL + 1)\n    invfact = [1] * (MAX_VAL + 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, MAX_VAL + 1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    \n    invfact[MAX_VAL] = pow(fact[MAX_VAL], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    for i in range(MAX_VAL - 1, -1, -1):\n        invfact[i] = (invfact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\n    def nCr_mod_p(n_val, r_val):\n        if r_val < 0 or r_val > n_val:\n            return 0\n        return (((fact[n_val] * invfact[r_val]) % MOD) * invfact[n_val - r_val]) % MOD\n\n    # Precompute powers k^k and modular inverses for k\n    # k_pow_k[i] stores i^i\n    # inv_k[i] stores i^-1 mod MOD\n    k_pow_k = [0] * (n + 1)\n    inv_k = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # 0^0 is usually 1 in combinatorics, but here k starts from 1.\n    # For k=1, k^k = 1^1 = 1.\n    # For k=0, k^-1 is undefined.\n    # We need k up to n-1.\n    k_pow_k[0] = 1 # Special case for (j+1)^j when j=0 => 1^0=1.
