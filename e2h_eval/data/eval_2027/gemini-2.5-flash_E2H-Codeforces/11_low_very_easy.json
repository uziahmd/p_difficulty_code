A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Soft Drinking Problem**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. It's a classic resource allocation problem, and the key is to understand the constraints. First, I need to figure out what I have available: number of friends (`n`), drink bottles (`k` with `l` ml each), limes (`c` with `d` slices each), and salt (`p` grams). Each friend needs a specific amount of drink (`nl` ml), a lime slice (1 slice), and salt (`np` grams) for *each toast*.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the *number of toasts* for all friends, but with the condition that they all get to drink the same amount. This means I can't just maximize the total toasts, but rather the number of toasts per person.\n\nLet's break it down:  First, I'll calculate the total resources: total drink = `k * l`, total lime slices = `c * d`, and total salt = `p`.\n\nNow the core of the problem. I need to figure out how many *individual toasts* I can make based on each resource, with *one toast* requiring `nl` ml, 1 slice, and `np` grams. This is where integer division comes in because you can't have fractional toasts.\n\n*   Toasts from drink: `(k * l) / nl`\n*   Toasts from lime: `c * d`\n*   Toasts from salt: `p / np`\n\nThe *limiting factor* will be the smallest of these three values. That is, the minimum value will be the maximum number of *individual toasts* I can create, which I'll call `total_individual_toasts_possible`.  I need to make all friends drink equal amounts.\n\nSo, I calculate `total_individual_toasts_possible = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)`.\n\nFinally, since there are `n` friends and the toast amount has to be equal, I divide the `total_individual_toasts_possible` by `n` to get the number of toasts each friend can make: `toasts_per_friend = total_individual_toasts_possible // n`. This is the answer I'm looking for.\n",
