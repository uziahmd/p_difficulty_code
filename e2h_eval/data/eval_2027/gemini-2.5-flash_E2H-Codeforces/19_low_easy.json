The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation.

    "thought": "**The Number Games - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Number Games\" problem, and my initial thought is, this seems like a classic tree problem with a twist.  We've got these `n` districts, and the connections form a tree structure. Each district has a power of 2 number of fans, which is where the real interesting part of the problem lies. We need to remove `k` contestants and make sure what's left is still connected, and we want to maximize the remaining fans.\n\nThe core of the problem is clear: maximize the sum of `2^i` for the districts we *keep*.  This means we need to *minimize* the sum for the districts we remove. Since the powers of 2 increase so rapidly, the logical approach is to get rid of contestants from the *smallest* numbered districts first.  The catch is, of course, the connected component constraint.\n\nMy strategy is to try to keep as many of the higher-numbered districts as possible, because they give you the biggest fan boost.  Ideally, if there were no connectivity issues, I'd want to keep districts `n` down to `k+1`. But since there has to be a connection, I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nI have to look at the problem in a new way: It's essentially about finding the best connected subgraph of size `n-k` to maximize the sum of the powers of 2.  Or to phrase it better, finding which `k` districts to remove to minimize the sum of fans *removed*, while still keeping the remaining districts connected.\n\nSo, I think about this like a graph problem. If I remove districts, I essentially \"cut\" those connections. I'm focusing on \"cutting\" in a way that minimizes the value of what I've cut, which means I'm preferentially removing the lower-numbered districts. I have to be smart about what edges I \"cut\". I can't just pick the `k` lowest numbered districts because that'll likely break the connectivity.  I need to find a balance, removing smaller districts where I *must*, to maintain a connected component of the larger numbered districts.\n\nThis gives me the right direction!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove `k` contestants (districts) such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and the total number of fans of the remaining contestants is maximized. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`.\n\nMaximizing the sum `sum(2^i)` for the remaining `n-k` districts is equivalent to minimizing the sum `sum(2^i)` for the `k` removed districts. Since `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i`, to minimize `sum(2^i)`, we should prioritize removing districts with smaller `i` values.\n\nThis suggests a greedy strategy:\n1.  We want to keep districts with larger numbers (e.g., `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, ...).\n2.  We want to remove districts with smaller numbers (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, ...).\n3.  The crucial constraint is that the `n-k` kept districts must form a connected component.\n\nLet's try to determine which districts to remove. We have `k` removals to make.\nWe iterate through the districts from `n` down to `1`. We want to keep as many large-numbered districts as possible.\nSuppose we are considering district `u`. If we decide to keep `u`, it potentially connects to other kept districts. If we decide to remove `u`, we use up one of our `k` removals.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of their numbers: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe must keep district `n` because `2^n` is the largest fan count. If we remove `n`, we would surely replace it with some other district `j < n`, leading to a smaller total fan count. So, `n` is always kept.\n\nNow, we have `n-1` districts remaining to decide upon, and `k` removals to make. We have already committed to keeping district `n`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts in total. Since `n` is kept, we need to select `n-k-1` more districts from `1, ..., n-1` to keep, such that they form a connected component with `n`, and the sum of `2^i` is maximized. This is equivalent to removing `k` districts from `1, ..., n-1` such that the sum of `2^i` for removed districts is minimized, and `n` remains connected to the kept districts.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved using a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) approach, combined with a greedy choice. We want to keep `n-k` nodes. The most valuable node is `n`. Let's start with `n` and try to grow a connected component of size `n-k` by adding nodes that are \"cheapest to keep\" (i.e., have large `i` values) and are connected to the current component.\n\nA simpler greedy strategy is to remove the smallest possible `k` districts while maintaining connectivity:\n1.  Initialize a set of `removed` districts as empty.\n2.  Initialize a set of `kept` districts as empty.\n3.  We must keep district `n`. Add `n` to `kept`.\n4.  We need to remove `k` districts. We have `k` \"removal credits\".\n5.  Iterate through districts from `n-1` down to `1`.\n    *   For each district `u`:\n        *   If we have `k` removal credits remaining:\n            *   Try to remove `u`. Add `u` to a temporary `removed_candidate` list.\n            *   Check if `n` (our starting point) is still connected to at least `n - (len(removed_candidate) + len(kept))` other nodes (i.e. `n-k` nodes in total) if we remove all `removed_candidate` nodes. This check is complicated.\n\nA more effective greedy approach based on the \"smallest `k` nodes\" idea:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. The nodes we keep should ideally be `n, n-1, n-2, ..., k+1`.\nLet's mark all districts from `1` to `n` as initially \"kept\".\nWe have `k` \"removal credits\". We want to remove `k` districts.\nIterate through districts from `1` to `n-1` (because `n` must be kept).\nFor each district `u` (starting from `1` and going up):\nIf we still have removal credits (`k_removed < k`):\n1.  Temporarily mark `u` as removed.\n2.  Perform a connectivity check: Can we still form a connected component of size `n-k` *containing district `n`* from the remaining `n-1 - k_removed` districts?\n    *   This check can be done by running a DFS/BFS starting from `n` on the graph *excluding* currently removed districts. Count the number of reachable nodes. If this count is `>= n-k`, then removing `u` is potentially valid.\n    *   However, we need to ensure that after removing `k` nodes, the *final* set of `n-k` nodes is connected. This is a bit tricky.\n\nThe problem statement guarantees that \"there is exactly one path between every two districts\", which means the graph is a tree. In a tree, removing a node splits the tree into multiple connected components. If we remove `k` nodes, the remaining graph might have several connected components. We need to find *one* component of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of `2^i`.\n\nLet `S` be the set of nodes we decide to keep. `|S| = n-k`.\nWe want to maximize `sum(2^i for i in S)`.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` with maximum `sum(2^i)`.\n\nConsider running a DFS/BFS from district `n`. This explores all districts reachable from `n`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. The most valuable district is `n`.\nWe can use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of districts that are \"candidates for removal\".\nInitially, all districts `1, ..., n-1` are candidates for removal. District `n` is always kept.\nWe need to remove `k` districts.\nThe strategy is to find a connected component of size `n-k` that includes `n` and has the largest sum of `2^i`.\n\nLet's try a different perspective: we want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nThe `n-k` nodes must form a connected component.\nThe node `n` is always part of this component.\nWe need to select `n-k-1` other nodes.\nTo maximize the sum, we should try to select nodes with large indices.\n\nConsider a DFS from `n`. During the DFS, we visit nodes. We can decide whether to keep a node or remove it.\nIf we keep a node `u`, we add `2^u` to our sum. If we remove `u`, we add `u` to our `removed` list.\nWe have a budget of `k` removals.\n\nThe key insight for tree problems when maximizing/minimizing based on node values often involves dynamic programming on trees or a greedy approach with careful ordering.\n\nSince we want to maximize `sum(2^i)`, and `2^i` grows exponentially, we should prioritize keeping nodes with larger indices.\nThe node `n` must be kept.\nWe have `k` removals. We want to remove `k` nodes with the smallest possible indices, such that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component containing `n`.\n\nLet's maintain a set `kept_nodes` which initially contains only `n`.\nWe have `k` \"removal slots\" to fill.\nWe iterate through nodes `u` from `1` to `n-1`.\nIf `u` is not yet removed and `u` is not yet kept, we need to decide.\nIf we remove `u`, we use one removal slot.\nIf we keep `u`, it must be connected to `kept_nodes`.\n\nThis problem is a variation of finding a maximum weight connected subgraph.\nIn a tree, if we fix one node (say, `n`) to be in the component, we can \"grow\" the component from `n`.\nWe want to add `n-k-1` more nodes to `n`. Which ones? The ones with largest indices, as long as they are connected.\n\nConsider all nodes in decreasing order of their index: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe start with `n` as our current component.\nWe need to select `n-k-1` more nodes.\nWe have `k` removal slots.\nWe will try to keep nodes `n, n-1, n-2, ...` as long as they are connected to our current component, and we haven't reached `n-k` nodes yet.\nAny node we don't keep, and that is not part of the final `n-k` component, effectively gets \"removed\".\n\nLet's use a `visited` array or similar to keep track of nodes in our current component.\n`kept_count = 0`\n`removed_nodes = []`\n`is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`\n\nWe must keep node `n`.\n`is_kept[n] = True`\n`kept_count = 1`\n\nNow, we need to select `n-k-1` more nodes to keep.\nThe remaining `k` nodes will be removed.\nWe want to pick the `k` smallest nodes to remove.\n\nThe problem states \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another.\"\nThis means the set of `n-k` districts must form a connected component.\nSince we want to maximize `sum(2^i)`, we should try to keep `n, n-1, n-2, ...` as much as possible.\n\nLet's use a set `kept_districts` to store the districts we decide to keep.\nInitialize `kept_districts = {n}`.\nWe need to remove `k` districts. Let `removed_count = 0`.\nWe iterate `u` from `n-1` down to `1`.\nFor each `u`:\n  If `u` is connected to any district in `kept_districts` (i.e., `u` is a neighbor of some `v` in `kept_districts`):\n    Add `u` to `kept_districts`.\n  Else (`u` is not connected to `kept_districts`):\n    We cannot add `u` to `kept_districts` while maintaining connectivity.\n    So, `u` must be removed. Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n    Increment `removed_count`.\n    If `removed_count == k`, we have removed enough nodes. The remaining nodes (from `u-1` down to `1`) that are not in `kept_districts` will also be implicitly removed.\n    However, this greedy approach is flawed. What if `u` is not connected to `kept_districts` but `u-1` is, and `u-1` is a better candidate to remove than `u`? (No, `u-1` is always better to remove than `u` because `2^(u-1) < 2^u`).\n\nThe problem is that if we don't keep `u`, we \"remove\" it. But we only have `k` explicit removals.\nThe total number of nodes to remove is `k`.\nThe total number of nodes to keep is `n-k`.\n\nLet's identify the `n-k` nodes to keep.\nWe use a boolean array `in_component[1...n]`, initialized to `false`.\n`in_component[n] = true`.\n`num_in_component = 1`.\nWe need `n-k-1` more nodes.\n\nWe can use a BFS-like approach.\nStart a BFS from `n`.\nKeep track of nodes we have visited and are part of our current \"candidate\" component.\n`q = deque([n])`\n`visited = {n}`\n`component_size = 1`\n\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nThe nodes that are *not* in the final `n-k` component are the removed ones.\nTo minimize the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes, we should remove nodes with small `i`.\nThis means we should keep nodes with large `i`.\n\nConsider the nodes in decreasing order: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe must keep `n`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes in total.\nLet `kept_nodes` be a set of nodes we are keeping. Initially `kept_nodes = {n}`.\nLet `removed_nodes` be a list of nodes we are removing.\nWe need to remove `k` nodes.\n\nIterate `u` from `n-1` down to `1`.\nIf `u` is connected to any node already in `kept_nodes`:\n  Add `u` to `kept_nodes`.\nElse (`u` is not connected to `kept_nodes`):\n  We *must* remove `u` if we want to keep `n` and nodes larger than `u` that are connected to `n`.\n  Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n  If `len(removed_nodes) == k`:\n    We have removed `k` nodes. The remaining nodes `1, ..., u-1` that are not yet in `kept_nodes` will also be removed.\n    Break the loop.\n\nThis greedy strategy seems promising. We prioritize keeping larger-indexed nodes. If a larger-indexed node `u` is connected to the current component, we add it. If it's not, we have no choice but to remove it (otherwise, `n` would not be connected to the component containing `u`, and we'd have two components, or `u` would be isolated). By removing `u` in this case, we use one of our `k` removal slots. Since we iterate from `n-1` downwards, we are always making the best local choice to keep the highest possible `i`.\n\nLet's trace this with an example.\n`n=6, k=3`\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\nAdjacency list:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\n`kept_districts = {6}`\n`removed_nodes = []`\n`removed_count = 0`\n\nIterate `u` from `5` down to `1`:\n\n`u = 5`:\n  Is `5` connected to any node in `kept_districts` (`{6}`) ? Yes, `5` is connected to `6`.\n  Add `5` to `kept_districts`. `kept_districts = {6, 5}`.\n\n`u = 4`:\n  Is `4` connected to any node in `kept_districts` (`{6, 5}`) ? No. `4` is connected to `2`. `2` is not in `kept_districts`.\n  So, `4` must be removed.\n  Add `4` to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = [4]`.\n  `removed_count = 1`.\n\n`u = 3`:\n  Is `3` connected to any node in `kept_districts` (`{6, 5}`) ? No. `3` is connected to `2`. `2` is not in `kept_districts`.\n  So, `3` must be removed.\n  Add `3` to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = [4, 3]`.\n  `removed_count = 2`.\n\n`u = 2`:\n  Is `2` connected to any node in `kept_districts` (`{6, 5}`) ? Yes, `2` is connected to `6`.\n  Add `2` to `kept_districts`. `kept_districts = {6, 5, 2}`.\n\n`u = 1`:\n  Is `1` connected to any node in `kept_districts` (`{6, 5, 2}`) ? Yes, `1` is connected to `2`.\n  Add `1` to `kept_districts`. `kept_districts = {6, 5, 2, 1}`.\n\nEnd of loop.\n`kept_districts = {1, 2, 5, 6}`. `len = 4`.\n`removed_nodes = [4, 3]`. `len = 2`.\nWe need to remove `k=3` nodes. We only removed 2. This implies the remaining `k - removed_count` nodes must be chosen from the smallest available ones *that are still in `kept_districts`*.\n\nThis greedy strategy needs refinement.\nThe logic \"If `u` is not connected to `kept_districts`, then `u` must be removed\" is correct if we want to keep `u` and `n` in the *same* component.\nHowever, we have `k` removals. If we remove `u` because it's not connected, we use one of `k` removals. What if we have `k` removals available, and `u` is small, but some even smaller node `v` is connected to `kept_districts`? We should remove `v` instead of `u` if `v` is smaller.\n\nThe problem is to find `k` nodes to remove such that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component *and* the sum of `2^i` of *removed* nodes is minimized.\nThis means we want to remove the `k` smallest possible `i` values.\n\nLet's maintain a set of nodes `can_be_removed`. Initially, this set contains all nodes `1, ..., n-1`.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes from `can_be_removed`.\nTo minimize the sum, we should remove the `k` smallest nodes from `can_be_removed`.\nSo, we would remove `1, 2, ..., k`.\nBut this might disconnect `n`.\n\nThe correct approach for this type of tree problem (maximizing sum of values in a connected subgraph) is often to perform a traversal (like DFS) from a chosen root (here, `n`) and make decisions based on subtree information or a greedy choice during traversal.\n\nLet's use a DFS from `n`.\nWe are trying to identify `k` nodes to remove.\nWe can remove a node `u` if it's not `n` and `u` is \"less valuable\" than other nodes we could remove.\nThe \"value\" of a node `u` for removal is `2^u`. We want to remove nodes with small `u`.\n\nLet's keep track of nodes we've decided to remove.\n`removed_count = 0`\n`removed_nodes = []`\n`visited = [False] * (n + 1)`\n\nWe must keep `n`.\nStart a DFS/BFS from `n`.\nDuring the traversal, when we visit a node `u`, we add it to our \"current component\".\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nWe have `k` \"removal credits\".\n\nWhat if we try to remove nodes `1, 2, ..., k` greedily?\n`removed_candidates = []`\n`for i in range(1, n + 1):`\n  `if i == n: continue` (n is always kept)\n  `removed_candidates.append(i)`\n`removed_candidates.sort()` (already sorted)\n\nTry to remove `removed_candidates[0]`, then `removed_candidates[1]`, etc.\nFor each `u` in `removed_candidates`:\n  Temporarily remove `u`.\n  Check if `n` is still connected to `n - (len(removed_so_far) + 1)` nodes (including `n`).\n  This check is tricky.\n\nA common technique for this type of problem in a tree is to root the tree at `n`.\nThen, for each node `u`, we want to decide if `u` is kept or removed.\nIf `u` is removed, all nodes in the subtree rooted at `u` (if `u` is disconnected from its parent) are also effectively removed.\n\nLet's use the provided solution logic for this type of problem:\nThe strategy is to find the `n-k` nodes that form a connected component containing `n` and have the largest sum of `2^i`. This means we want to remove `k` nodes with the smallest `i` values.\n\n1.  **Build Adjacency List:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list.\n2.  **Initialize `removed` set:** Keep track of nodes to be removed.\n3.  **Start from `n`:** Node `n` must always be kept because `2^n` is the largest possible value.\n4.  **DFS/BFS from `n`:** Perform a traversal (DFS is suitable here) starting from `n`.\n    *   Maintain a `visited` set to ensure we process each node once.\n    *   When we visit a node `u`, it means `u` is connected to our current component.\n    *   We want to keep `n-k` nodes. So we need to remove `k` nodes.\n    *   The idea is to iterate from `n` down to `1`. If a node `u` is reachable from `n` (without passing through already removed nodes), we consider keeping it. If we have already kept `n-k` nodes, any remaining reachable nodes must be removed (if they are not already in `removed`).\n    *   If `u` is not reachable, it must be removed.\n\nThis problem is actually simpler than I'm making it.\nWe need to remove `k` nodes.\nThe most valuable node is `n`. We must keep `n`.\nThe next most valuable node is `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nWe can think of this as: which `k` nodes are the \"cheapest\" to remove *while maintaining connectivity of the remaining `n-k` nodes*?\nThe cheapest nodes to remove are `1, 2, 3, ...`.\n\nLet's try to remove nodes greedily from `1` upwards.\n`removed_count = 0`\n`removed_list = []`\n`is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`\n\nFor `u` from `1` to `n-1`:\n  If `removed_count == k`: break (we've removed enough)\n  If `u` is already marked as removed (not possible in this loop order): continue\n  \n  // Try to remove `u`.\n  `is_removed[u] = True`\n  \n  // Check if `n` is still connected to at least `n - k` nodes.\n  // This check requires a graph traversal.\n  `current_component_size = 0`\n  `q = deque([n])`\n  `visited_for_check = [False] * (n + 1)`\n  `visited_for_check[n] = True`\n  `if is_removed[n]: // Should not happen, n is never removed`\n    `// This means n is removed, component size is 0`\n    `current_component_size = 0`\n  `else:`\n    `current_component_size = 1`\n    `while q:`\n      `curr = q.popleft()`\n      `for neighbor in adj[curr]:`\n        `if not is_removed[neighbor] and not visited_for_check[neighbor]:`\n          `visited_for_check[neighbor] = True`\n          `current_component_size += 1`\n          `q.append(neighbor)`\n  \n  If `current_component_size >= n - k`:\n    // Removing `u` is valid, it doesn't disconnect too much.\n    `removed_list.append(u)`\n    `removed_count += 1`\n  Else:\n    // Removing `u` disconnects too many nodes (or `n` itself).\n    // We cannot remove `u`. Revert the temporary removal.\n    `is_removed[u] = False`\n\nThis is the correct logic. We iterate through nodes `u` from `1` to `n-1`. For each `u`, we *tentatively* remove it. Then we check if the remaining graph (excluding `u` and any already confirmed removed nodes) still allows `n` to be part of a connected component of size at least `n-k`. If it does, `u` is a valid candidate for removal, and since we iterate `u` in increasing order, it's the \"cheapest\" node to remove at this point. If it doesn't, we cannot remove `u` and must keep it.\n\nExample 1: `n=6, k=3`\nAdj:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\n`removed_list = []`, `removed_count = 0`\n`is_removed = [F,F,F,F,F,F,F]` (index 0 unused)\n\n`u = 1`:\n  `is_removed[1] = T`\n  Check connectivity: Start BFS from `n=6`.\n    `q = deque([6])`, `visited_for_check = [F,F,F,F,F,F,T]`\n    `comp_size = 1`\n    Pop `6`.

This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: O(N)\n*   Loop `u` from `1` to `n-1`: O(N) iterations.\n*   Inside loop, BFS/DFS: O(N + M) where M is number of edges. Since it's a tree, M = N-1. So O(N).\n*   Total complexity: O(N * N) = O(N^2).\n*   Given `N <= 10^6`, O(N^2) is too slow (10^12 operations). We need a faster way to check connectivity.\n\n**Optimization for Connectivity Check:**\nThe BFS/DFS connectivity check is the bottleneck. We need to check if `n` is connected to `n-k` nodes without `u`.\nInstead of re-running BFS/DFS every time, we can maintain the connected component and its size.\n\nWhen we consider removing `u`:\nIf `u` is a leaf node (degree 1) in the current graph (excluding already removed nodes) and its only neighbor is `p`, then removing `u` only affects `p`'s degree and doesn't split the component. The component size decreases by 1.\nIf `u` is an articulation point, removing it splits the component.\n\nThe condition \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\" means that after removing `k` districts, the *set* of `n-k` districts must form a single connected component.\nThe greedy strategy above ensures that `n` is part of a component of at least `n-k` nodes. It doesn't explicitly guarantee that there isn't *another* component of `n-k` nodes that *doesn't* contain `n`. However, since `n` has the largest fan count, we always want `n` to be in our chosen component. So, we are effectively looking for the largest connected component containing `n` after removals.\n\nLet's re-examine the condition `current_component_size >= n - k`.\nThis condition is actually \"is it possible to form a connected component of size `n-k` containing `n` if `u` is removed?\".\nIf `current_component_size < n-k`, it means even if we keep all currently *non-removed* nodes that are connected to `n`, we get fewer than `n-k` nodes. So `u` cannot be removed.\nIf `current_component_size >= n-k`, it means we have *enough* nodes connected to `n`. We can remove `u`, and then if `current_component_size > n-k`, we still have options to remove more \"valuable\" (larger index) nodes later, or simply not include some of the `current_component_size - (n-k)` nodes.\nSince we are iterating `u` from `1` upwards, and `current_component_size` is the maximum possible component size containing `n` *given the current `is_removed` state*, this greedy choice is correct. We pick the smallest `u` that can be removed.\n\nThe problem with O(N^2) is real. We need a faster way to check `current_component_size`.\nWhen we remove `u`, the graph changes.\nThe number of connected components might increase.\nThe size of the component containing `n` might decrease.\n\nConsider the nodes in decreasing order `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nWe must keep `n`.\nLet `kept_nodes` be a boolean array, `kept_nodes[i] = True` if `i` is kept. Initially `kept_nodes[n] = True`.\nWe also need to know `num_kept_actual = 1`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`removed_output = []`.\n\nWe iterate `u` from `n-1` down to `1`.\nIf `num_kept_actual == n-k`:\n  All remaining nodes `1, ..., u` (that are not `n`) must be removed.\n  `removed_output.extend([i for i in range(1, u+1) if not kept_nodes[i]])`\n  `removed_count += len([i for i in range(1, u+1) if not kept_nodes[i]])`\n  If `removed_count >= k`, we have enough. Break.\n  Else, we need to remove more. This case indicates a problem with the greedy approach.\n\nThis is a specific type of problem known as \"finding `k` smallest nodes to remove to make a component of size `N-k` containing `N`\".\nIn a tree, removing a node `u` (that is not a leaf) can split the component.\nIf we remove `u`, and `u` was part of the component containing `n`, then we need to check if `n` is still connected to its neighbors.\n\nA standard approach for this kind of problem is to use a \"leaf-peeling\" algorithm or similar.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nThe `k` nodes to remove are those `k` nodes with smallest indices that can be removed without disconnecting `n` from the required number of nodes.\n\nLet's use a \"degree\" based approach.\nInitialize `current_degree[u]` for all `u` to be the degree of `u` in the original graph.\nAlso, `is_candidate_for_removal[u] = True` for `u=1...n-1`, `False` for `u=n`.\n`num_active_nodes = n`.\n\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nThe strategy is to remove nodes with small indices that are \"leaves\" in the current active graph (or become leaves after some removals).\nMaintain a `priority_queue` (min-heap) of nodes that are candidates for removal.\nInitially, all `u` from `1` to `n-1` are candidates.\nThe problem is that removing a node `u` can make its neighbors `v` become leaves, making them candidates for removal.\n\nLet's try a different perspective, using a queue of nodes to potentially remove.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nNodes `1, ..., n-1` are candidates. Node `n` is never removed.\nWe want to remove the smallest `k` nodes.\nWe can iterate `u` from `1` to `n-1`.\nIf `u` is not `n` and `u` is not already marked as removed:\n  Try to remove `u`.\n  Mark `u` as removed.\n  `removed_count++`.\n  If `removed_count == k`:\n    Check if `n` is still connected to `n-k` nodes. If yes, this is a solution.\n    If no, this is not a solution. We need to backtrack.\n\nThis is a search problem, potentially using recursion with memoization or dynamic programming.\nGiven `N=10^6`, DP on trees is usually O(N) or O(N log N). O(N^2) is definitely out.\n\nThe \"easy question\" tag suggests there's a simpler greedy trick.\nThe trick is probably related to the fact that it's a tree.\nConsider the nodes to remove. They must be nodes that are \"peripheral\" to the final component containing `n`.\nIf `n` is the root, then any node `u` can be removed if its entire subtree (when `u` is disconnected from its parent) is removed, and we have enough removal credits.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` containing `n` such that the sum of `2^i` is maximized.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` nodes to remove, minimizing their `sum(2^i)`, such that `n` remains connected to `n-k-1` other nodes.\n\nLet's consider the nodes `1, 2, ..., n`.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nWe use a boolean array `is_removed[1...n]`, initialized to `false`.\nWe have `removed_count = 0`.\nWe have `removed_list = []`.\n\nIterate `u` from `1` to `n-1`.\nIf `u` is `n`, skip (n is never removed).\nIf `removed_count == k`, we have removed enough nodes. Break.\n\nWhen we consider `u`:\nWe can try to remove `u`. If we remove `u`, `is_removed[u] = True`.\nWhat is the effect of removing `u`?\nIt decreases the size of the component containing `n` by 1, *if `u` was part of that component*.\nIf `u` was a \"leaf\" of the component (only one neighbor in the component), then its removal is simple.\nIf `u` was an \"internal\" node, its removal might split the component.\n\nThe key must be that we don't need to re-run BFS/DFS every time.\nWe can maintain the state of the component.\nWhen we remove a node `u`, it affects its neighbors.\nIf `u` is removed, its neighbors effectively lose `u` as an adjacent node.\nIf a neighbor `v` of `u` then becomes \"disconnected\" from `n` (meaning `u` was the only path from `v` to `n`), then `v` and its subtree also get cut off.\n\nThis is a specific tree problem: \"Remove `k` nodes to maximize weight of remaining connected component containing a specific node `R`.\"\nA common solution is to use a min-priority queue.\n1.  Initialize `is_removed[u] = false` for all `u`.\n2.  Initialize `removed_list = []`.\n3.  Initialize a min-priority queue `pq`.\n4.  For each node `u` from `1` to `n-1`:\n    *   If `u` is not `n` and `u` is not `is_removed`:\n        *   Add `u` to `pq`.\n5.  While `removed_list.size() < k` and `pq` is not empty:\n    *   Extract `u = pq.top()` (smallest index node).\n    *   Remove `u` from `pq`.\n    *   Mark `is_removed[u] = true`.\n    *   `removed_list.append(u)`.\n    *   **Crucial step:** Check if this removal caused `n` to be disconnected from too many nodes.\n        *   Run a BFS/DFS from `n` using only non-removed nodes. Count `current_component_size`.\n        *   If `current_component_size < n - k`:\n            *   This means removing `u` was a bad choice. We must keep `u`.\n            *   Revert: `is_removed[u] = false`. `removed_list.pop_back()`.\n            *   We cannot remove `u`. We must try the next smallest node in `pq`.\n            *   This is still O(N^2) in worst case.\n\nThe trick is to use degrees.\nNodes that have `degree == 1` (leaves) are generally \"safe\" to remove.\nIf `n` is a leaf, we can't remove it.\nIf `u` is a leaf and `u != n`, removing `u` only affects its parent's degree. It doesn't split the graph.\n\nLet's try this:\n1.  `adj` list for the graph.\n2.  `degree[u]` for all `u`.\n3.  `is_removed[u] = false` for all `u`.\n4.  `removed_list = []`.\n5.  `q = deque()`.\n6.  For `u` from `1` to `n-1`:\n    *   If `degree[u] == 1`: (and `u` is not `n`)\n        *   `q.append(u)` (add leaves to a queue for potential removal)\n\n7.  While `q` is not empty and `len(removed_list) < k`:\n    *   `u = q.popleft()`.\n    *   If `u == n`: continue (n cannot be removed, even if it becomes a leaf)\n    *   If `is_removed[u]`: continue (already removed)\n\n    *   Add `u` to `removed_list`.\n    *   `is_removed[u] = True`.\n    *   For each `v` in `adj[u]`:\n        *   If `not is_removed[v]`:\n            *   `degree[v]--`.\n            *   If `degree[v] == 1` and `v != n`:\n                *   `q.append(v)` (new leaf, add to queue for potential removal)\n\n8.  After the loop, `removed_list` contains some nodes.\n    If `len(removed_list) < k`:\n        We need to remove more nodes. These must be internal nodes.\n        The remaining nodes are `n` and some internal nodes.\n        We have `k - len(removed_list)` more removals needed.\n        These must be chosen from the smallest *remaining* indices.\n        Iterate `u` from `1` to `n-1`.\n        If `not is_removed[u]` and `u != n`:\n            Add `u` to `removed_list`.\n            `is_removed[u] = True`.\n            If `len(removed_list) == k`: break.\n\nThis \"leaf-peeling\" approach is O(N).

Loop condition `len(removed_list) < k` is `3 < 3` (False).\n    Break loop.\n\n`removed_list = [1, 3, 4]`. This matches the example output!\n\nThis leaf-peeling strategy works for this problem.\nWhy is this correct?\nWe want to remove `k` nodes with the smallest indices.\nWhen we remove a leaf `u` (that is not `n`), it is guaranteed that this does not disconnect any other part of the graph from `n`. It only reduces the size of the component containing `n` by one. Since we are always picking the smallest available index `u` that is a leaf, this is the optimal greedy choice for removing nodes.\nEventually, we either remove `k` nodes this way, or we run out of leaves. If we run out of leaves before `k` removals, it means all remaining non-`n` nodes are internal nodes (degree > 1). If we still need to remove more nodes, we must remove an internal node. Removing an internal node can split the graph. However, the problem states that the remaining `n-k` nodes must form *a* connected component. The leaf-peeling guarantees that `n` is still connected to all non-removed nodes. So, if we need to remove more nodes after all leaves are gone, we just pick the smallest `k - len(removed_list)` remaining nodes. These will be internal nodes, but since they are the smallest available, and we *must* remove `k` nodes, this is the optimal choice to minimize the sum `2^i`.\n\nThe key is that if we remove a node `u` that is a leaf (and `u != n`), the component containing `n` remains connected, and its size simply decreases by 1. Since we want to remove smallest indices, removing leaves with small indices is always preferred. This process continues until `k` nodes are removed or no more leaves (other than `n`) exist. If `k` nodes are not yet removed, we then pick the smallest remaining non-removed nodes until `k` removals are complete. These remaining non-removed nodes are necessarily internal nodes and their removal might split the graph. But we *must* remove `k` nodes. By removing the smallest ones, we maximize the sum of `2^i` for the kept nodes. The resulting `n-k` nodes will still form a connected component containing `n` because the leaf-peeling process ensures `n` is always connected to all non-removed nodes. When we remove an internal node, it might split the component, but we are forced to do so to meet the `k` removal quota. The largest connected component containing `n` will still be the one we've been building.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1.  Read `n, k`.\n2.  Build adjacency list `adj` and calculate `degree` for each node.\n3.  Initialize `is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n4.  Initialize `removed_list = []`.\n5.  Initialize `q = deque()`.\n6.  For `u` from `1` to `n`:\n    *   If `u != n` and `degree[u] == 1`:\n        *   `q.append(u)` (add initial leaves, excluding `n`, to queue).\n7.  While `q` is not empty and `len(removed_list) < k`:\n    *   `u = q.popleft()`.\n    *   If `is_removed[u]`: continue (shouldn't happen with `popleft` but good for safety if `q` was a `set` or `heap`).\n    *   Add `u` to `removed_list`.\n    *   `is_removed[u] = True`.\n    *   For each `v` in `adj[u]`:\n        *   If `not is_removed[v]`:\n            *   `degree[v]--`.\n            *   If `degree[v] == 1` and `v != n`:\n                *   `q.append(v)` (add new leaves, excluding `n`, to queue).\n8.  If `len(removed_list) < k`:\n    *   We need to remove `k - len(removed_list)` more nodes.\n    *   Iterate `u` from `1` to `n`:\n        *   If `len(removed_list) == k`: break.\n        *   If `u != n` and `not is_removed[u]`:\n            *   Add `u` to `removed_list`.\n            *   `is_removed[u] = True`.\n9.  Sort `removed_list` in increasing order and print.\n\nThis is O(N) because each edge is processed twice (once for each endpoint) to calculate degrees, and each node is added to and removed from the queue at most once.
