Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Souvenir Selling Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem to tackle, which sounds like a knapsack variation. Let me break this down.  I've got `n` souvenirs and a maximum weight limit of `m`. Each souvenir has a weight (`wi`) and a cost (`ci`).  The goal is to select a subset of souvenirs that maximizes the total cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nThe important thing I'm noticing is that the weights are really small – they're limited to 1, 2, or 3. That's a huge clue!  An O(n*m) dynamic programming approach for the standard knapsack would be far too slow, given `n` and `m` can be quite large.  So, I need to leverage this small weight constraint.\n\nMy strategy is taking shape. I'll categorize the souvenirs by their weights. I'll create separate lists for the costs of souvenirs weighing 1, 2, and 3.  The most important part here is to sort each list in descending order. This ensures I always pick the most valuable items first for each weight category. Let's call these sorted lists `costs1`, `costs2`, and `costs3`.\n\nNow, the core of the problem becomes: how do I combine items from these sorted lists to maximize the cost, respecting the weight constraint `m`?  It's still a knapsack-like problem, but with the added constraint of the fixed weights. I can think of it as choosing `x1` items of weight 1, `x2` items of weight 2, and `x3` items of weight 3, such that  `x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 <= m`.  I need to maximize the sum of the costs of these selections.\n\nTo streamline the calculation, I can use prefix sums. For each weight category, the prefix sum will represent the total cost of selecting the top `i` most expensive items. So, I have `prefix_sum1`, `prefix_sum2`, and `prefix_sum3`. This way, quickly get the total cost of a selection.\n\nMy plan now is to iterate through the possible number of weight-3 items I can choose (from 0 to the total number available, `len(costs3)`). For each choice, I'll figure out the optimal combination of weight-1 and weight-2 items to fill the remaining weight capacity.  I'll continue this, and track the maximum cost found. This should give me the optimal solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs to maximize total cost, given a maximum total weight `m`. Each souvenir has a weight `w_i` and a cost `c_i`. The crucial constraint is that `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThis constraint simplifies the problem significantly, as a standard knapsack solution (O(N*M)) would be too slow given N up to 10^5 and M up to 3*10^5.\n\nWe can categorize the souvenirs by their weights. To maximize cost, for each weight category, we should always pick the most expensive items first.\n1.  **Separate and Sort:** Read all souvenirs and store their costs in three separate lists: `costs1` for weight 1, `costs2` for weight 2, and `costs3` for weight 3. Sort each list in descending order of cost.\n2.  **Calculate Prefix Sums:** For each sorted list, calculate prefix sums. `prefix_sum[k]` will store the sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of that weight. This allows us to quickly query the total cost of picking `k` items of a certain weight.\n\nNow, we need to choose `x1` items of weight 1, `x2` items of weight 2, and `x3` items of weight 3 such that `x1 * 1 + x2 * 2 + x3 * 3 <= m` and the total cost is maximized.\n\nWe can iterate through the possible number of items of weight 3 (`x3`). For each `x3`:\n*   The weight used by these items is `x3 * 3`.\n*   The cost obtained is `prefix_sum3[x3]`.\n*   The remaining weight capacity is `m_rem = m - x3 * 3`. If `m_rem` is negative, we can't pick `x3` items, so we break or continue.\n\nFor the remaining `m_rem` capacity, we need to pick items of weight 1 and 2 to maximize cost. This subproblem is still a knapsack-like problem, but with only two item types. We can solve this efficiently by iterating through the number of items of weight 2 (`x2`).\n*   For each `x2` (from 0 up to `len(costs2)`):\n    *   The weight used by these items is `x2 * 2`.\n    *   The cost obtained is `prefix_sum2[x2]`.\n    *   The remaining weight capacity is `m_rem2 = m_rem - x2 * 2`. If `m_rem2` is negative, we can't pick `x2` items, so we break or continue.\n    *   With `m_rem2` capacity, we can pick at most `m_rem2` items of weight 1. The number of weight-1 items we can actually pick is `x1 = min(m_rem2, len(costs1))`.\n    *   The cost obtained from weight-1 items is `prefix_sum1[x1]`.\n    *   The total cost for this combination (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`) is `prefix_sum1[x1] + prefix_sum2[x2] + prefix_sum3[x3]`. Update the overall maximum cost found so far.\n\n**Optimization for the inner loop (weight 1 and 2 items):**\nThe inner loop iterates through `x2`. For a fixed `x3` and thus fixed `m_rem`, as `x2` increases, `m_rem2` decreases. This means `x1` (number of weight-1 items) decreases. This structure suggests a two-pointer approach or an optimized way to find the best `x1`, `x2` combination for a given `m_rem`.\n\nConsider the problem of picking items of weight 1 and 2 for a total weight `W`.\nWe can iterate `x2` from `0` to `len(costs2)`. For each `x2`, the remaining capacity is `W - 2*x2`. We then pick `min(W - 2*x2, len(costs1))` items of weight 1.\nThis is exactly what the nested loops do.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Sorting: `O(N log N)` in the worst case if all items have the same weight.\n*   Prefix sums: `O(N)`.\n*   Outer loop (`x3`): `len(costs3)` can be up to `N`.\n*   Inner loop (`x2`): `len(costs2)` can be up to `N`.\n*   The product `len(costs3) * len(costs2)` can be up to `N^2`, which is too slow (10^10).\n\n**Refined Strategy for weight 1 and 2 items:**\nThe issue is that we need to find the best combination of weight 1 and weight 2 items for a given remaining capacity `M_rem`.\nLet `dp[k]` be the maximum cost for picking items of weight 1 and 2 with total weight exactly `k`.\n`dp[k] = max(dp[k-1] + cost_of_next_weight1_item, dp[k-2] + cost_of_next_weight2_item)`\nThis looks like a standard DP, but the items are distinct.\nA better approach for the 1-2 knapsack:\nIterate `x2` from `0` to `len(costs2)`.\nFor each `x2`, we use `x2 * 2` weight and `prefix_sum2[x2]` cost.\nThe remaining weight is `M_rem - 2*x2`. We can fill this with `min(M_rem - 2*x2, len(costs1))` weight-1 items.\nThis is `O(len(costs2))` for each `x3`.\nTotal `O(len(costs3) * len(costs2))`. This is still too slow.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem `m_rem = x1 * 1 + x2 * 2`. We want to maximize `P1[x1] + P2[x2]`.\nThe maximum possible value for `m_rem` is `m`.\nSince `w_i` are small, we can use a DP approach on `M`.\nLet `dp[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 or 2.\n`dp[w]` can be computed by trying to add either a weight-1 item or a weight-2 item.\nHowever, items are distinct.\nA simple way to build the best combinations of items of weight 1 and 2:\nIterate `x1` from `0` to `len(costs1)`.\nIterate `x2` from `0` to `len(costs2)`.\nThis is also `O(len(costs1) * len(costs2))`.\n\n**The key insight from competitive programming problems with small weights:**\nWhen weights are 1, 2, 3, we can often optimize by considering combinations.\nSuppose we have `m_rem` weight left.\nWe can pick `k` items of weight 2. This uses `2k` weight. We get `prefix_sum2[k]` cost.\nThe remaining `m_rem - 2k` weight is filled with `min(m_rem - 2k, len(costs1))` items of weight 1.\nThis is the standard approach described above.\n\nLet's look at the constraints again: `N=10^5`, `M=3*10^5`.\n`len(costs1) + len(costs2) + len(costs3) = N`.\nIf `len(costs3)` is small, the loop over `x3` is fine.\nIf `len(costs2)` is small, the loop over `x2` is fine.\nWhat if `len(costs3)` and `len(costs2)` are both large?\nExample: `N=10^5`, `M=3*10^5`. All items have weight 2. `len(costs2) = 10^5`. `len(costs3)=0`.\nThen `x3` loop runs once. `x2` loop runs `10^5` times. `x1` calculation is `O(1)`. Total `O(N)`. This is fine.\nExample: `N=10^5`, `M=3*10^5`. Half items weight 2, half weight 3. `len(costs2)=5*10^4`, `len(costs3)=5*10^4`.\nThen `5*10^4 * 5*10^4 = 2.5 * 10^9` operations. Too slow.\n\nThe solution relies on the fact that `M` is not too large for a DP, but `N` is.\nLet `dp[k]` be the maximum cost for total weight `k` using *only* items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `dp` values up to `M`.\n`dp` array of size `M+1`, initialized to `-infinity`, `dp[0]=0`.\nIterate through `costs1`: For each `c` in `costs1`, iterate `w` from `M` down to `1`. `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-1] + c)`.\nIterate through `costs2`: For each `c` in `costs2`, iterate `w` from `M` down to `2`. `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-2] + c)`.\nThis is the standard 0/1 knapsack DP.\nThe problem is that `costs1` and `costs2` are sorted lists of costs. We need to pick the *best* items.\nThis means we can't just iterate through `costs1` and `costs2` in this way, because `c` is not *any* item, but the *next best* item.\n\nCorrect DP for items of weight 1 and 2:\nLet `best_cost_12[w]` be the maximum cost for achieving weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `best_cost_12 = [0] * (M + 1)`.\n`curr_cost1 = 0`\n`ptr1 = 0` (index for `costs1`)\n`curr_cost2 = 0`\n`ptr2 = 0` (index for `costs2`)\n\nWe can build `best_cost_12[w]` for `w` from 1 to `M`.\nFor each `w`:\n`cost_if_add_1 = -infinity`\n`cost_if_add_2 = -infinity`\n\nIf `ptr1 < len(costs1)` and `w >= 1`: `cost_if_add_1 = best_cost_12[w-1] + costs1[ptr1]` (This is incorrect, because `best_cost_12[w-1]` might have already used `costs1[ptr1]`).\n\nThis is a variant of the change-making problem or unbounded knapsack, but with distinct items.\nLet `f[k]` be the maximum value for weight `k` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `f[k]` for `k` from 0 to `M`.\n`f[0] = 0`.\nFor `k` from 1 to `M`:\n  `f[k] = f[k-1] + costs1[ptr1]` if we add a weight 1 item.\n  `f[k] = f[k-2] + costs2[ptr2]` if we add a weight 2 item.\nThis is still not right. We need to decide at each step whether to add a weight-1 or weight-2 item.\nThis is a merge-like process.\n\nLet `max_cost_12[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`max_cost_12` array of size `M+1`, initialized to 0.\n`current_cost_1 = 0`\n`current_cost_2 = 0`\n`idx1 = 0`\n`idx2 = 0`\n\nFor `w` from 1 to `M`:\n  `option1_cost = -1` (cost if we get `w` by adding a weight 1 item)\n  `option2_cost = -1` (cost if we get `w` by adding a weight 2 item)\n\n  If `idx1 < len(costs1)`:\n    `option1_cost = current_cost_1 + costs1[idx1]`\n  If `idx2 < len(costs2)` and `w >= 2`:\n    `option2_cost = current_cost_2 + costs2[idx2]`\n\n  If `option1_cost >= option2_cost` (and `option1_cost != -1`):\n    `max_cost_12[w] = option1_cost`\n    `current_cost_1 += costs1[idx1]`\n    `idx1 += 1`\n  Else if `option2_cost != -1`:\n    `max_cost_12[w] = option2_cost`\n    `current_cost_2 += costs2[idx2]`\n    `idx2 += 1`\n  Else: # No items left or w too small for weight 2\n    `max_cost_12[w] = max_cost_12[w-1]` (if w-1 is valid) or 0. This is wrong.\n    It should be `max_cost_12[w] = max(max_cost_12[w-1] + (costs1[idx1] if idx1 < len(costs1) else -infinity), max_cost_12[w-2] + (costs2[idx2] if idx2 < len(costs2) else -infinity))`\nThis is still not correct. The `idx1` and `idx2` should be independent.\n\nThe correct way to build `max_cost_12[w]` is:\n`max_cost_12` array of size `M+1`, initialized to 0.\n`sum1 = 0`\n`idx1 = 0`\n`sum2 = 0`\n`idx2 = 0`\n\nFor `w` from 1 to `M`:\n  `cost_with_last_1 = -1`\n  `cost_with_last_2 = -1`\n\n  If `idx1 < len(costs1)`:\n    `cost_with_last_1 = sum1 + costs1[idx1]`\n  If `idx2 < len(costs2)` and `w >= 2`:\n    `cost_with_last_2 = sum2 + costs2[idx2]`\n\n  If `cost_with_last_1 >= cost_with_last_2` (and `cost_with_last_1 != -1`):\n    `max_cost_12[w] = cost_with_last_1`\n    `sum1 += costs1[idx1]`\n    `idx1 += 1`\n  Else if `cost_with_last_2 != -1`:\n    `max_cost_12[w] = cost_with_last_2`\n    `sum2 += costs2[idx2]`\n    `idx2 += 1`\n  Else:\n    `break` (no more items of weight 1 or 2 can be added)\n\nThis approach is also flawed. `max_cost_12[w]` should represent the maximum cost for *exactly* weight `w`.\nConsider the maximum cost for weight `k` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nThis is `max( (max_cost_12[k-1] + next_best_cost1) if k>=1 else -inf, (max_cost_12[k-2] + next_best_cost2) if k>=2 else -inf )`.\nThis is tricky because `next_best_cost1` and `next_best_cost2` depend on what items were chosen for `max_cost_12[k-1]` and `max_cost_12[k-2]`.\n\nThe correct approach for `max_cost_12[w]` is:\n`max_cost_12` array of size `M+1`, initialized to 0.\n`current_cost_1 = 0`\n`idx1 = 0`\nFor `w_left = 0` to `M`:\n  `current_cost_2 = 0`\n  `idx2 = 0`\n  For `w_used_by_2 = 0` to `w_left` step 2:\n    `w_used_by_1 = w_left - w_used_by_2`\n    `num1 = min(w_used_by_1, len(costs1))`\n    `max_cost_12[w_left] = max(max_cost_12[w_left], current_cost_1 + current_cost_2)`\n    If `idx2 < len(costs2)`:\n      `current_cost_2 += costs2[idx2]`\n      `idx2 += 1`\n    Else:\n      `break`\n  If `idx1 < len(costs1)`:\n    `current_cost_1 += costs1[idx1]`\n    `idx1 += 1`\n  Else:\n    `break`\n\nThis is `O(M * N)` in worst case (if `len(costs2)` is `N/2` and `M` is large).\nNo, it's `O(M * (M/2))`, if `M` is the upper limit for `w_left`.\nThis is also `O(M^2)`. `3*10^5 * 3*10^5 = 9*10^10`. Too slow.\n\nLet's rethink the `1-2` knapsack subproblem.\nWe need to find `max(prefix_sum1[x1] + prefix_sum2[x2])` subject to `x1 * 1 + x2 * 2 <= W`.\nThis can be optimized.\nFor a fixed `x2`, `x1` is `min(W - 2*x2, len(costs1))`.\nWe iterate `x2` from `0` to `min(len(costs2), W/2)`.\nThis is `O(min(len(costs2), W/2))` which is `O(min(N, M))` for each `x3`.\nTotal complexity `O(min(N, M) * min(N, M))`. Still `O(N*M)` in worst case.\nExample: `len(costs3) = M/3`, `len(costs2) = M/2`. `M/3 * M/2 = M^2/6`.\n\nThe solution for the `1-2` knapsack subproblem (max cost for weight `W` using items of weight 1 and 2) can be found using a \"two pointers\" or \"meet-in-the-middle\" like approach efficiently for each `W`.\nLet `f[w]` be the maximum cost for exactly weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe want to compute `f[w]` for all `w` from 0 to `M`.\n`f[w]` can be computed by iterating `x2` from `0` to `min(len(costs2), w/2)`.\nFor each `x2`, the cost is `prefix_sum2[x2]`. The remaining weight is `w - 2*x2`.\nWe take `x1 = min(w - 2*x2, len(costs1))` weight-1 items.\nThe cost is `prefix_sum2[x2] + prefix_sum1[x1]`.\nWe need to find the maximum of this over all `x2`.\nThis is `O(W)` for each `W`. So `O(M^2)` to precompute `f` array up to `M`.\n\n**The actual efficient approach (often used for these small weight problems):**\nThe key is that for a given `m_rem` (remaining capacity after picking weight-3 items), we want to find the maximum cost using weight-1 and weight-2 items.\nLet `max_cost_for_rem_weight[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using weight-1 and weight-2 items.\nWe can compute this array `max_cost_for_rem_weight` in `O(M)` time.\nHow?\nIterate `x2` from `0` to `len(costs2)`.\nFor each `x2`, we use `2 * x2` weight and gain `prefix_sum2[x2]` cost.\nThe remaining capacity is `m_prime = M - 2 * x2`.\nWe then fill `m_prime` with weight-1 items. The cost is `prefix_sum1[min(m_prime, len(costs1))]`.\nThe total cost is `prefix_sum2[x2] + prefix_sum1[min(m_prime, len(costs1))]`.\nWe need to compute `max_cost_for_rem_weight[w]` for all `w`.\nThis cannot be done in `O(M)` directly by iterating `x2` from `0` to `M/2`.\nThe issue is that `prefix_sum1[min(m_prime, len(costs1))]` is not monotonically increasing or decreasing in a simple way as `x2` changes.\n\nLet's use a standard DP for the `1-2` knapsack problem, but carefully.\n`dp[w]` = maximum cost for total weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp` array of size `M+1`, initialized to 0.\n`cur_cost1 = 0`\n`cur_cost2 = 0`\n`p1 = 0`\n`p2 = 0`\n\nFor `w` from 1 to `M`:\n  `opt1 = -1`\n  `opt2 = -1`\n  If `p1 < len(costs1)`:\n    `opt1 = dp[w-1] + costs1[p1]` (if `dp[w-1]` is valid, i.e., `w-1 >= 0`)\n  If `p2 < len(costs2)` and `w >= 2`:\n    `opt2 = dp[w-2] + costs2[p2]`\n\n  If `opt1 >= opt2` and `opt1 != -1`:\n    `dp[w] = opt1`\n    `p1 += 1`\n  Else if `opt2 != -1`:\n    `dp[w] = opt2`\n    `p2 += 1`\n  Else:\n    `dp[w] = dp[w-1]` (if `w-1` is valid) or 0.

This is handled by `x2 <= remaining_M // 2`.\nThe `x2` range `[0, min(len(costs2), remaining_M // 2)]` ensures `x2` is valid and `remaining_M - 2*x2 >= 0`.\nSo, `x1` will always be non-negative.\n\nExample 1:\n1 1\n2 1\nN=1, M=1\ncosts1=[], costs2=[(1,2)], costs3=[]\nprefix_sum1=[0], prefix_sum2=[0,1], prefix_sum3=[0]\nx3=0: w3=0, cost3=0. rem_M=1.\n  calc_cost_12(x2): x2 range [0, min(0, 1//2)] = [0,0]\n  x2=0: x1=min(1-0, 0)=0. cost_12 = prefix_sum2[0]+prefix_sum1[0] = 0+0=0.\n  best_cost_12_for_rem_M = 0.\nmax_total_cost = max(0, 0+0) = 0.\nOutput: 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n2 2\n1 3\n2 2\nN=2, M=2\ncosts1=[3], costs2=[2], costs3=[]\nprefix_sum1=[0,3], prefix_sum2=[0,2], prefix_sum3=[0]\nx3=0: w3=0, cost3=0. rem_M=2.\n  calc_cost_12(x2): x2 range [0, min(1, 2//2)] = [0,1]\n  Ternary search on x2 in [0,1].\n  m1=0, m2=1.\n  calc_cost_12(0): x1=min(2-0, 1)=1. cost = prefix_sum2[0]+prefix_sum1[1] = 0+3=3.\n  calc_cost_12(1): x1=min(2-2, 1)=0. cost = prefix_sum2[1]+prefix_sum1[0] = 2+0=2.\n  `calc_cost_12(0) > calc_cost_12(1)`, so `high = m2 = 1`. Range is `[0,1]`.\n  Now `high-low = 1 < 3`. Linear scan `x2` from `0` to `1`.\n  x2=0: cost=3.\n  x2=1: cost=2.\n  best_cost_12_for_rem_M = 3.\nmax_total_cost = max(0, 0+3) = 3.\nOutput: 3. Correct.\n\nExample 3:\n4 3\n3 10\n2 7\n2 8\n1 1\nN=4, M=3\ncosts1=[1], costs2=[8,7], costs3=[10]\nprefix_sum1=[0,1]\nprefix_sum2=[0,8,15]\nprefix_sum3=[0,10]\n\nmax_total_cost = 0\n\nx3=0: w3=0, cost3=0. rem_M=3.\n  calc_cost_12(x2): x2 range [0, min(2, 3//2)] = [0,1].\n  Ternary search on x2 in [0,1].\n  m1=0, m2=1.\n  calc_cost_12(0): x1=min(3-0, 1)=1. cost = prefix_sum2[0]+prefix_sum1[1] = 0+1=1.\n  calc_cost_12(1): x1=min(3-2, 1)=1. cost = prefix_sum2[1]+prefix_sum1[1] = 8+1=9.\n  `calc_cost_12(0) < calc_cost_12(1)`, so `low = m1 = 0`. Range is `[0,1]`.\n  Linear scan `x2` from `0` to `1`.\n  x2=0: cost=1.\n  x2=1: cost=9.\n  best_cost_12_for_rem_M = 9.\nmax_total_cost = max(0, 0+9) = 9.\n\nx3=1: w3=3, cost3=10. rem_M=0.\n  calc_cost_12(x2): x2 range [0, min(2, 0//2)] = [0,0].\n  Ternary search on x2 in [0,0].\n  x2=0: x1=min(0-0,1)=0. cost = prefix_sum2[0]+prefix_sum1[0] = 0+0=0.\n  best_cost_12_for_rem_M = 0.\nmax_total_cost = max(9, 10+0) = 10.\n\nOutput: 10.
