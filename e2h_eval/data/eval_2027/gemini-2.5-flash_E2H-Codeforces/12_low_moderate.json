The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving Xenia and the Ringroad: My Pythonic Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I need to whip up a Python script to tackle this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break down my thought process, keeping in mind the key elements: the circular road, tasks, and the constraint of clockwise movement only.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the input: `n` houses (1 to `n` in a circle), and `m` tasks. Each task `a_i` specifies the house where Xenia needs to go.  The goal is minimum travel time.\n\nMy initial mental state is: Xenia starts at house 1, and the time counter is zero.  I need a `current_house` variable initialized to 1, and a `total_time` variable to 0.\n\nNow, for each task, I'm thinking I'll iterate through `a_i`. The core logic is calculating the travel time from the current house to the target house. Because it's a ring, and movement is clockwise, there are two distinct cases.\n\n*   **Case 1: `target_house >= current_house`:**  Direct clockwise movement. The time is simply the difference: `target_house - current_house`.  Easy peasy.\n\n*   **Case 2: `target_house < current_house`:** Xenia needs to go the \"long way\" around the circle. My mind goes through the steps: from `current_house` to `n`, then from `n` to 1, and finally from 1 to the `target_house`.  The time here is calculated as `n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nI'll calculate the time for the task using this logic, add it to `total_time`, and then update `current_house` to be the `target_house` for the next iteration.\n\nI'm verifying my approach now in my head to confirm it's correct. Using some small examples with `n=4` like `current=3`, `target=2`...  The logic seems to work.\n\nFinally, I'll need to print the final `total_time`. With this logic refined in my thoughts, I feel ready to start coding!\n",
