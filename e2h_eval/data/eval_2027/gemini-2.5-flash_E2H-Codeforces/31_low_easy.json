Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to \"Vanya and Cards\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Vanya and Cards.\" The goal is to figure out the fewest cards Vanya needs to find to bring the total sum to zero.  Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the input. I have `n` cards with values ranging from `-x` to `x`.  My task is to calculate the current sum of the existing cards. That's the first step. Then I need to determine what sum the new cards need to produce to balance the total to zero. This, naturally, is the negative of the current sum, making that value my \"required_sum_from_new_cards.\"\n\nNow, the core idea is to *minimize* the number of additional cards. Since I can pick cards within `-x` to `x`, I need to select values that will reach the `required_sum_from_new_cards` using as few cards as possible. If the `required_sum_from_new_cards` is positive, I'll use cards with the value `x`, and if it's negative, I'll use `-x`. Essentially, I'm trying to use the maximum possible value for each card.\n\nTo calculate the number of new cards I need, I'll take the absolute value of the required sum (let's call it `target_value`) and divide it by `x`. Since I need a whole number of cards, I need to round up this result, which is `ceil(target_value / x)`. Using integer division and the correct logic, I can get that correct.\n\nFor example, if the sum of existing cards is 2, then the sum of new cards must be -2. Since the largest negative value is `-x`, and `x` is the maximum value a card can have, then I just need `ceil(2 / x)` cards that sum to -2.\n\nFinally, I'll write the code that implements all this logic.  I'm confident I can efficiently determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs, considering this straightforward methodology.\n",
