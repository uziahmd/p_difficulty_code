    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Gluttony\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm facing this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core is finding a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any proper subset of indices, the sum of elements in `a` doesn't equal the sum in `b`. With `n` up to 22, brute-force subset checking is out. I've realized that the small constraints strongly imply a pattern or trick.\n\nFor `n=1`, trivial. `n=2`, reversing the order of the array seems to work. The crucial part lies in the subsets. A simple cyclic shift seems like a good starting point to test. I see the example inputs and outputs, and the simple cyclic shift `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]` could be the key if the example output is some more complicated permutation.\n\nLet me try to prove this cyclic shift approach will always work. I'm imagining the differences between the sums and trying to avoid getting to zero for any subset. If I can prove that my cyclic permutation always avoids zero-sum differences for any proper subset, then I've got a valid solution. I am trying to prove the cyclic shift with a sorted array, that can never have a zero difference in sums for any non-empty proper subset.\n\nI'm thinking to sort the array `a`. After sorting, create `b` by shifting the elements. Now, for the subsets, let's look at the differences of the element sums for each of them. I think about sorting `a` first, because that will allow me to analyze the differences in sums.\n\nThe sorted `a` and then using a cyclic permutation of it, this makes me hope it's always valid.\n\nIf `S` does not include the last element `n-1`, it is fine. If `S` does include the `n-1` element, it must not sum to zero. I think this will work. With small cases, like `n=3`, where a cyclic shift has always worked. For the case where a = [1,2,3,6] The cyclic shift works as well. It looks like it could have something to do with subset sums and avoiding duplicate sums. I'm going to formulate a condition where a valid permutation can be formed, in terms of subset sums and differences of cyclic-shifted elements.\n\nThe cyclic shift creates a chain, so a cycle, which could be the property that prevents subset sums from being duplicated in `a` and `b`. The key is avoiding the subset sums being equal when comparing sums within proper subsets. I am going to try and build my solution assuming this cyclic shift, after sorting the values is the solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` of `n` distinct integers such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i`. The constraints are `1 <= n <= 22` and `0 <= a_i <= 10^9`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition: `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i`.\nThis can be rewritten as `sum_{i in S} (a_i - b_i) != 0`.\n\nConsider the simplest non-trivial permutation: a cyclic shift.\nLet's sort the input array `a` first. This doesn't change the set of elements, and `b` must be a permutation of `a`. Sorting might reveal structural properties. Let the sorted array be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` such that `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\n\nNow, let's construct `b` by a cyclic shift: `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}` for `i = 0, ..., n-1`.\nSo, `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\n\nLet `d_i = a_i - b_i`.\nFor `i = 0, ..., n-2`, `d_i = a_i - a_{i+1}`. Since `a_i < a_{i+1}`, these `d_i` are all negative.\nFor `i = n-1`, `d_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0`. Since `a_{n-1} > a_0`, this `d_{n-1}` is positive.\n\nWe need to show that `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0` for any non-empty proper subset `S`.\n\n1.  **If `n=1`**: The condition `0 < k < n` means there are no subsets `S` to check. Any permutation `b` (which must be `[a_0]`) is valid. The cyclic shift `b = [a_0]` works.\n\n2.  **If `n > 1`**:\n    *   **Case 1: `n-1 not in S`**:\n        All indices `i` in `S` are from `{0, ..., n-2}`. For these indices, `d_i = a_i - a_{i+1} < 0`.\n        Since `S` is non-empty, `sum_{i in S} d_i` will be a sum of one or more negative numbers, thus `sum_{i in S} d_i < 0`.\n        Therefore, `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0`. This case is fine.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `n-1 in S`**:\n        *   **Subcase 2a: `S = {n-1}`**:\n            `sum_{i in S} d_i = d_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0`. Since `a_i` are distinct and `n > 1`, `a_{n-1} > a_0`, so `d_{n-1} > 0`.\n            Therefore, `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0`. This case is fine.\n        *   **Subcase 2b: `S` contains `n-1` and at least one other index `j` from `{0, ..., n-2}`**:\n            In this case, `sum_{i in S} d_i = d_{n-1} + sum_{j in S, j != n-1} d_j`.\n            `d_{n-1}` is positive. `sum_{j in S, j != n-1} d_j` is a sum of one or more negative numbers, so it's negative.\n            For `sum_{i in S} d_i` to be `0`, we must have `d_{n-1} = - (sum_{j in S, j != n-1} d_j)`.\n            Let `K = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`. `K` is a non-empty proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\n            The condition for failure becomes `a_{n-1} - a_0 = sum_{j in K} (a_{j+1} - a_j)`.\n\n            We know that the sum of all `d_i` is a telescoping sum:\n            `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) + ... + (a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} - a_0) = 0`.\n            This means `d_{n-1} = - sum_{i=0}^{n-2} d_i = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (a_{i+1} - a_i)`.\n            This is an identity: `a_{n-1} - a_0 = (a_1 - a_0) + (a_2 - a_1) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2})`.\n\n            So, `sum_{i \\in S} d_i = 0` implies `sum_{j \\in K} (a_{j+1} - a_j) = sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (a_{j+1} - a_j)`.\n            Since all terms `(a_{j+1} - a_j)` are positive, this equality can only hold if `K = {0, ..., n-2}`.\n            But `K` is defined as `S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`. If `K = {0, ..., n-2}`, then `S = \\{0, ..., n-2\\} \\cup \\{n-1\\} = \\{0, ..., n-1\\}`, which is the full set of indices.\n            The problem statement explicitly excludes the full set of indices (`0 < k < n`).\n            Therefore, `K` cannot be `{0, ..., n-2}`.\n            Since `K` is a proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}` and all `(a_{j+1} - a_j)` are positive, `sum_{j \\in K} (a_{j+1} - a_j) < sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (a_{j+1} - a_j)`.\n            This means `sum_{j \\in K} (a_{j+1} - a_j) < a_{n-1} - a_0`.\n            So, `d_{n-1} - sum_{j \\in K} (a_{j+1} - a_j)` will always be positive (not zero).\n            Therefore, `sum_{i \\in S} d_i != 0` for this case as well.\n\nCombining all cases, the cyclic shift `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}` (after sorting `a`) always satisfies the condition.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Create a list of pairs `(value, original_index)` for stable sorting. This is crucial if we need to reconstruct `b` based on its original positions, but here we just need to output the permuted values.\n4. Sort the array `a` to get `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` in ascending order.\n5. Construct `b` by a cyclic shift: `b = a[1:] + a[:1]`.\n6. Print the elements of `b`.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 2`\n`a = [1, 2]`\nSorted `a` is `[1, 2]`.\nCyclic shift: `b = [2, 1]`.\nOutput: `2 1`. Matches example.\n\n**Example 2:**\n`n = 4`\n`a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\nSorted `a` is `[1, 10, 100, 1000]`.\nCyclic shift: `b = [10, 100, 1000, 1]`.\nOutput: `10 100 1000 1`. This is a valid answer, although different from the example output `100 1 1000 10`. The problem states any valid answer is fine.\n\nThis approach is efficient: sorting takes `O(N log N)` time, and constructing `b` takes `O(N)` time. For `N=22`, this is very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        # For n=1, there are no non-empty proper subsets (0 < k < n is not met).\n        # So, the array itself is a valid permutation.\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Sort the array a.
