Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Let's Get This \"Colored Boots\" Problem Solved!**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Colored Boots\" problem, and my first thought is, \"This screams matching!\" We've got `n` left boots, `n` right boots, each with a color, and the goal is to maximize compatible pairs.  The rules are straightforward: same colors match perfectly, '?' is a wildcard, and different specific colors are a no-go.  My expertise immediately leans towards a greedy approach here.  Matching specific colors together is the most restrictive; pairing up '?' with anything is the most flexible, so let's use that as a guiding principle.\n\nI think the strategy will break down into a few clear phases. First, let's nail down those perfect matches: if we have an 'a' on the left, it has to go with an 'a' on the right, ideally. So, I'll prioritize matching boots with the same specific colors, right off the bat. The more specific the match, the better.\n\nThen, after locking in all those \"exact\" matches, I'll go for the '?' boots. They're my backup dancers, capable of filling any spot.  I can use them to pair with any remaining specific colors or other question marks. This way I'll maximize the total number of matches, hopefully.\n\nTo make this efficient, I'm thinking of using a data structure to quickly track what boots are available. A hash map or dictionary is perfect.  I'll create a `left_boots` dictionary and a `right_boots` dictionary.  The keys will be the colors (a-z and '?'), and the values will be lists of the original indices of those boots. This lets me quickly look up which boots I have, based on their color, so I can form pairs.\n\nSo, in phase one, I'll iterate through each specific color and attempt to pair as many boots as possible, grabbing an index from the left and the right boot list and incrementing the total pairs. I am getting an itch that I can generalize the exact match logic into a function to make it simpler to maintain.\n\nAfter phase one, I'll handle the '?' matches, as many as I can. Sounds like a solid plan. Now to get the code going!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (one left, one right) and list these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are the same (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any specific color or another indefinite color (e.g., '?', 'z'; 'a', '?'; '?', '?').\n3. Two different specific colors are not compatible (e.g., 'f', 'g').\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive first, then use the more flexible '?' boots for remaining matches.\n\nWe can categorize matches into three types based on restrictiveness:\n1. **Exact specific color matches:** A left boot of color 'c' with a right boot of color 'c'. These are the most restrictive because 'c' can only match 'c' or '?'. If we have both 'c' and 'c', it's best to pair them up.\n2. **Specific color with '?' matches:** A left boot of color 'c' with a right boot of color '?' OR a left boot of color '?' with a right boot of color 'c'. These are less restrictive because '?' can match anything.\n3. **'?' with '?' matches:** A left boot of color '?' with a right boot of color '?'. These are the least restrictive.\n\nThe greedy strategy proceeds as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Match specific colors with specific colors.**\nIterate through all possible specific colors ('a' through 'z'). For each color `c`, we try to match as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible. We store the indices of these matched pairs.\nThis ensures that boots that *must* match with a specific color get their ideal partner first.\n\n**Step 2: Match remaining specific color boots with '?' boots.**\nAfter Step 1, some specific color boots might remain (e.g., we had more 'a' left boots than 'a' right boots, or vice-versa). We also have all the '?' boots remaining.\nNow, we match any remaining specific color left boot with any available '?' right boot.\nSimilarly, we match any remaining specific color right boot with any available '?' left boot.\nIt's important to do this for all specific colors. A simple way is to iterate through specific colors 'a' through 'z' for left boots, matching them with '?' right boots. Then iterate through specific colors 'a' through 'z' for right boots, matching them with '?' left boots.\n\n**Step 3: Match remaining '?' boots with '?' boots.**\nFinally, any '?' left boots and '?' right boots that are still available are matched with each other.\n\n**Data Structure for Efficiency:**\nTo implement this efficiently, we can store the indices of boots for each color. A `defaultdict(list)` or a list of lists (e.g., `[[] for _ in range(27)]` for 'a'-'z' and '?') is suitable.\nWe'll map 'a' to index 0, 'b' to 1, ..., 'z' to 25, and '?' to 26.\n\nLet's refine Step 2 and 3 for implementation:\n\nInstead of distinct Step 2 and Step 3, we can combine them by processing the remaining specific boots and '?' boots in a structured way:\n1. **Match specific color left boots with '?' right boots:** Iterate 'a' through 'z'. For each `c`, if `left_boots[c]` is not empty, match its boots with available `right_boots['?']` until either `left_boots[c]` or `right_boots['?']` is exhausted.\n2. **Match specific color right boots with '?' left boots:** Iterate 'a' through 'z'. For each `c`, if `right_boots[c]` is not empty, match its boots with available `left_boots['?']` until either `right_boots[c]` or `left_boots['?']` is exhausted.\n3. **Match '?' left boots with '?' right boots:** Match any remaining `left_boots['?']` with `right_boots['?']`.\n\nThis ensures that all types of matches are considered in the correct priority order.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n=7`, `l=\"abaca?b\"`, `r=\"zabbbcc\"`\n\n1. **Populate lists of indices (1-indexed):**\n   `left_indices = { 'a': [1, 3, 5], 'b': [2, 7], 'c': [4], '?': [6] }`\n   `right_indices = { 'z': [1], 'a': [2], 'b': [3, 4], 'c': [5, 6, 7] }`\n\n2. **Step 1: Exact specific matches ('c' with 'c', 'a' with 'a', etc.)**\n   - Color 'a': `left_indices['a'] = [1, 3, 5]`, `right_indices['a'] = [2]`\n     Match (3, 2). `pairs = [(3, 2)]`.\n     `left_indices['a'] = [1, 5]`, `right_indices['a'] = []`\n   - Color 'b': `left_indices['b'] = [2, 7]`, `right_indices['b'] = [3, 4]`\n     Match (2, 3), (7, 4). `pairs = [(3, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4)]`.\n     `left_indices['b'] = []`, `right_indices['b'] = []`\n   - Color 'c': `left_indices['c'] = [4]`, `right_indices['c'] = [5, 6, 7]`\n     Match (4, 5). `pairs = [(3, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5)]`.\n     `left_indices['c'] = []`, `right_indices['c'] = [6, 7]`\n   - Other specific colors (d-z) have no matches.\n\n   *After Step 1:*\n   `pairs = [(3, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5)]`\n   `left_indices = { 'a': [1, 5], '?': [6] }`\n   `right_indices = { 'z': [1], 'c': [6, 7] }`\n\n3. **Step 2 & 3: Match remaining specific boots with '?' boots, then '?' with '?'.**\n   - **Match specific left with '?' right:**\n     `right_indices['?']` is empty. No matches here.\n   - **Match specific right with '?' left:**\n     `left_indices['?'] = [6]`\n     - Color 'c': `right_indices['c'] = [6, 7]`.\n       Match (6, 6). `pairs = [(3, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5), (6, 6)]`.\n       `left_indices['?'] = []`, `right_indices['c'] = [7]`\n     - Other specific colors (a, b, d-z) in `right_indices` are either empty or have no `left_indices['?']` to match with.\n   - **Match '?' left with '?' right:**\n     `left_indices['?']` is empty. `right_indices['?']` is empty. No matches here.\n\n   *Final pairs:* `[(3, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5), (6, 6)]`.\n   Total pairs: 5.\n\nThis greedy strategy is optimal because it prioritizes the most constrained matches. By matching specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a') first, we ensure that these boots, which have limited options, are paired optimally. Any remaining specific color boots then use '?' boots, which are flexible. Finally, '?' boots are matched with each other, as they are the most flexible and can fill any remaining gaps. This never prevents a better match from being made.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-indexed original positions for each color\n    # For 'a' through 'z', use indices 0-25.
