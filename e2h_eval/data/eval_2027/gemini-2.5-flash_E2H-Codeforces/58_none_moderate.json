You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

This is impossible for a simple graph as it would imply multiple edges between\n    #      some pair of nodes if we add an edge.\n    # So, if w=0 for t=1, it implies that if there are any components with more than 1 node, all possible\n    # same-color pairs are already connected. This can only happen if all components are single nodes.\n    # In other words, if m=0 and n > 0.\n    #\n    # So if t=1 yields 0 ways, it means we need to add at least 2 edges.\n    # An odd cycle with 2 added edges can be formed in two ways:\n    # 1. Connect two distinct vertices `u` and `v` that are in the same connected component,\n    #    and then connect `v` to `u` again with another edge. This is not allowed as it would\n    #    create a parallel edge or a loop.\n    # 2. Connect three distinct vertices `u`, `v`, `x` such that `u` and `v` are in one component,\n    #    and `x` is in another component (or `x` is also in the same component but not connected).\n    #    This is not how it works.\n    #\n    # The valid ways to form an odd cycle by adding 2 edges are:\n    # a) Connect two different connected components. Let's say component A and component B.\n    #    Pick u in A, v in B. Add edge (u, v).\n    #    Pick x in A, y in B. Add edge (x, y).\n    #    This forms an even cycle (u-v-y-x-u) if u,v,x,y are distinct.\n    #    This doesn't form an odd cycle.\n    #\n    # The problem statement says \"simple cycle of an odd length\".\n    #\n    # Consider two distinct vertices u and v.\n    # If we add edges (u, x) and (v, x) for some x, then u-x-v path is formed.\n    # If u and v are already connected by an odd length path, then u-x-v + u-path-v forms an odd cycle.\n    # If u and v are already connected by an even length path, then u-x-v + u-path-v forms an even cycle.\n    # This is getting complicated. Let's simplify.\n    #\n    # An odd cycle needs at least 3 vertices.\n    #\n    # If t=1 is not possible (w=0), it means the graph is bipartite and either:\n    #   - All components are single isolated vertices (m=0).\n    #   - There are components with multiple vertices, but all pairs of same-color nodes are already connected\n    #     (which is impossible for simple graphs).\n    # So, if t=1 and w=0, it implies m=0.\n    #\n    # If m=0:\n    #   - All n vertices are isolated.\n    #   - To form an odd cycle, we need at least 3 vertices.\n    #   - Pick 3 vertices, say u, v, x. Add edges (u,v), (v,x), (x,u). This forms a cycle of length 3.\n    #   - Number of ways to pick 3 vertices: C(n, 3).\n    #   - This requires 3 edges. So t=3, w=C(n,3).\n    #   - This is only if n >= 3. If n < 3, it's impossible.\n    #\n    # Let's re-evaluate the problem statement: \"minimum number of edges that must be added ... to form a simple cycle of an odd length\".\n    #\n    # If t=1 and w=0, it means we cannot find two vertices u, v in the same component of the same color such that (u,v) is not an edge.\n    # This implies that if there are any components with more than 1 node, then for any two nodes u,v in the same component and same color,\n    # (u,v) is an edge. This can only be true if there are no such pairs, or if such pairs are already connected.\n    # If a component has at least 3 nodes of the same color, say A, B, C, then if (A,B) and (A,C) are edges, but (B,C) is not, we can add (B,C).\n    # This would mean w > 0. So if w=0, there are no such pairs.\n    # This implies that within each component, there are no two non-adjacent nodes of the same color.\n    # This can only be true if each color class is a clique.\n    # But for a bipartite graph, a color class cannot have edges within itself.\n    # So if w=0 for t=1, it must be that for every component, for every pair of nodes u,v of the same color, (u,v) is an existing edge.\n    # This is only possible if there are no such pairs. i.e., count0 <= 1 or count1 <= 1 for each component.\n    # If a component has count0 <= 1 and count1 <= 1, it means the component has at most 2 nodes.\n    # If it has 2 nodes, (u,v), then u and v must have different colors. So it's a single edge.\n    # So if w=0 for t=1, it means all connected components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\n    # In other words, the graph is a matching (possibly with isolated vertices).\n    #\n    # If the graph is a matching (or isolated vertices), then to form an odd cycle:\n    # We need to add 2 edges.\n    # Pick two distinct vertices u, v.\n    # Add an edge (u, v).\n    # Pick a third vertex x, distinct from u and v.\n    # Add an edge (u, x) or (v, x).\n    #\n    # Consider two vertices u, v that are not connected.\n    # Adding (u, v) and (v, u) is not allowed.\n    #\n    # If we add 2 edges, (u,v) and (v,x), where u,v,x are distinct.\n    # If u and x are already connected, then u-path-x + x-v-u forms an odd cycle if path is even.\n    #\n    # The simplest way to form an odd cycle with 2 added edges is:\n    # Take two distinct vertices u, v.\n    # Add edges (u, x) and (v, x) for some *new* vertex x (not connected to u or v).\n    # This creates a path u-x-v. If u and v are connected by an odd path, then u-x-v-path-u is an odd cycle.\n    # If u and v are connected by an even path, then u-x-v-path-u is an even cycle.\n    #\n    # Let's consider the number of vertices not involved in any edge.
