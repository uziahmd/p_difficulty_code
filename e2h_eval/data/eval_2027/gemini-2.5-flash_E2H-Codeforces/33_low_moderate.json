You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing the Replaced Number**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Replacing Digits\" problem.  The goal is to take a number, represented as a string `a`, and replace some of its digits with digits from another string `s` to get the largest possible number.  We have to use each digit in `s` at most once.\n\nHere's my thinking: To make the number as large as possible, I need to focus on the leftmost digits first, the most significant ones.  It's like making decisions from left to right, because the leftmost digit has the biggest impact on the overall value. If two numbers have the same length, the bigger one is the one with the biggest digit at the first different position, moving from left to right.\n\nThe strategy boils down to iterating through `a` digit by digit. For each digit in `a`, I want to find the largest digit in `s` that is *strictly* greater than the current digit in `a`. If there's no such digit in `s`, or the largest available is not greater, then I move on to the next digit in `a`. The strictly greater condition is crucial, as using an equal digit from `s` is generally not optimal. Using a digit from `s` is a resource (digit) I would like to maximize as well.\n\nLet's refine this a bit more. I want to find the largest possible digit. In each step, if a digit in `s` is greater than a digit in `a`, and there are multiple such digits in `s`, I should pick the largest one.\n\nFor example, if `a` is \"123\" and `s` is \"45\", I should replace the \"1\" with \"5\". That leaves me with `s` having \"4\". Then, \"2\" is replaced with \"4\", resulting in \"543\".\n\nSo, I think I've got a solid plan: Iterate from left to right through `a`, for each digit, find the largest strictly greater digit in the remaining `s`, make the replacement if possible, and move on. This should give me the optimal solution.\n",
