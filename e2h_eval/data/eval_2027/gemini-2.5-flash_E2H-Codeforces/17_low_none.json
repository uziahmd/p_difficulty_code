He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, let me break this down. I've got a competitive programming problem on my hands, and I need to whip up a Python script to handle it. The input comes from standard input, and the output goes to standard output. Straightforward so far.\n\n**Initial Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core of the problem is reconstructing a string, 's', of length 'n' from a list of its improper prefixes and suffixes. There are some guarantees about the input: there will be exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. These are either prefixes or suffixes of 's'. That's the critical piece of information. The output is a string of 'P's and 'S's to indicate whether each input string is a prefix or suffix.\n\nMy approach will be this: I need to identify the prefixes and suffixes. I know there are two strings of length n-1. One must be a prefix of length n-1, and the other must be a suffix of length n-1. That's the linchpin.  I'll start by examining those two longest strings.\n\n**The Crucial Insight**\n\nHere's where it gets interesting:  Let's call the two n-1 length strings 'str1' and 'str2'. There are essentially two possibilities for how they relate to the original string 's'. It has to work like this... if 'str1' is a prefix, then 'str2' is a suffix or if 'str2' is a prefix and 'str1' is a suffix.\n\nLet's assume 'str1' is the prefix, then 'str2' is the suffix and vice versa.  I'll check if the condition, `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`, holds. If it does, I can reconstruct 's' in a straightforward way, either by concatenating the first character of the prefix and the entire suffix or the prefix with the last char of the suffix.  This helps to reconstruct the original string 's'\n\n**The Execution Plan**\n\nMy code will follow this path:\n1.  Read 'n'.\n2.  Read all the input strings. Store them, maybe keeping track of their original order.\n3.  Focus on those two length (n-1) strings.  Check the strings to see how they can be used to construct the candidate for the original string 's'.\n4.   With the candidate 's', verify that all the other shorter strings can be classified as prefixes or suffixes.\n5.  Based on this classification, output the 'P' and 'S' string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify `2n-2` given strings as prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from `1` to `n-1`, and that these strings correspond to the prefixes and suffixes of some valid string `s`.\n\nThe key insight comes from the two strings of length `n-1`. Let these two strings be `s_len_n_minus_1_1` and `s_len_n_minus_1_2`.\nOne of them must be the prefix `s[0:n-1]` and the other must be the suffix `s[1:n]`.\n\nThis gives us two potential candidates for the original string `s`:\n\n**Candidate 1:**\nAssume `s_len_n_minus_1_1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `s_len_n_minus_1_2` is `s[1:n]`.\nFor this to be true, the substring `s[1:n-1]` must be common to both. That is, `s_len_n_minus_1_1[1:]` must be equal to `s_len_n_minus_1_2[:-1]`.\nIf this condition holds, the string `s` can be reconstructed as `s_len_n_minus_1_1 + s_len_n_minus_1_2[-1]`.\n\n**Candidate 2:**\nAssume `s_len_n_minus_1_2` is `s[0:n-1]` and `s_len_n_minus_1_1` is `s[1:n]`.\nSimilarly, `s_len_n_minus_1_2[1:]` must be equal to `s_len_n_minus_1_1[:-1]`.\nIf this condition holds, the string `s` can be reconstructed as `s_len_n_minus_1_2 + s_len_n_minus_1_1[-1]`.\n\nSince we are guaranteed that a solution exists, at least one of these two candidates for `s` will be valid. We can pick either one that satisfies its respective condition and then verify it.\n\n**Verification Process:**\n\nOnce we have a candidate string `s`:\n1.  Generate all its actual prefixes: `s[0:1], s[0:2], ..., s[0:n-1]`.\n2.  Generate all its actual suffixes: `s[n-1:n], s[n-2:n], ..., s[1:n]`.\n3.  We need to match the input strings to these generated prefixes and suffixes. A `multiset` or frequency map is suitable for this.\n    *   Create a frequency map (e.g., `collections.Counter`) for the input strings.\n    *   For each generated prefix, decrement its count in the map.\n    *   For each generated suffix, decrement its count in the map.\n    *   If at any point a count drops below zero, or if the map is not empty after processing all prefixes and suffixes, then the candidate `s` is invalid.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Store all `2n-2` input strings along with their original indices. Let's call this list `input_strings_with_indices`.\n3.  Identify the two strings of length `n-1`. Store them as `str_n_minus_1_a` and `str_n_minus_1_b`.\n4.  **Attempt 1:**\n    *   Let `potential_s_a = str_n_minus_1_a + str_n_minus_1_b[-1]`.\n    *   Check if `str_n_minus_1_a[1:] == str_n_minus_1_b[:-1]`. If this holds, `potential_s_a` is a valid candidate.\n    *   If `potential_s_a` is valid, try to classify the input strings based on it.\n        *   Initialize an answer array `ans` of length `2n-2` with empty strings.\n        *   Create a temporary `collections.Counter` from the input strings (just the strings, not indices).\n        *   For each `i` from `1` to `n-1`:\n            *   `prefix = potential_s_a[0:i]`\n            *   `suffix = potential_s_a[n-i:n]`\n            *   Decrement counts for `prefix` and `suffix` in the temporary counter.\n        *   If all counts in the temporary counter are zero, then `potential_s_a` is the correct `s`. Proceed to step 5.\n5.  **Attempt 2 (if Attempt 1 failed or if we didn't pick the first valid one):**\n    *   Let `potential_s_b = str_n_minus_1_b + str_n_minus_1_a[-1]`.\n    *   Check if `str_n_minus_1_b[1:] == str_n_minus_1_a[:-1]`. If this holds, `potential_s_b` is a valid candidate.\n    *   If `potential_s_b` is valid, try to classify the input strings based on it using the same counter verification logic.\n\nSince the problem guarantees a solution, one of these two `s` candidates will work. Let's say `s_final` is the chosen valid string.\n\n6.  **Final Classification:**\n    *   Initialize `ans_chars = [''] * (2 * n - 2)`.\n    *   Create `seen_prefixes = collections.defaultdict(int)` and `seen_suffixes = collections.defaultdict(int)`.\n    *   For each input string `s_in` at original index `idx` in `input_strings_with_indices`:\n        *   If `s_in` is a prefix of `s_final` (i.e., `s_final.startswith(s_in)`) AND `seen_prefixes[s_in]` is `0`:\n            *   `ans_chars[idx] = 'P'`\n            *   `seen_prefixes[s_in] = 1`\n        *   Else (it must be a suffix):\n            *   `ans_chars[idx] = 'S'`\n            *   `seen_suffixes[s_in] = 1`\n    *   Print `\"\".join(ans_chars)`.\n\nThe `seen_prefixes` and `seen_suffixes` maps are necessary because for each length `k`, there are two strings: one prefix and one suffix. Both `s_final.startswith(s_in)` and `s_final.endswith(s_in)` might be true for a given `s_in` (e.g., `s = \"ababa\"`, `s_in = \"aba\"` is both a prefix and a suffix). We need to ensure we classify exactly one string of each length as a prefix and one as a suffix. The problem guarantees that for each length `k`, there are *two* strings provided. The first time we encounter a string `X` of length `k` that is a prefix, we mark it as 'P'. The second time we encounter a string `X` of length `k` (which could be the same string `X` if `s` is palindromic, or a different string `Y` if `s` is not), it must be the suffix.\n\nA simpler approach for final classification (without needing `seen_prefixes` and `seen_suffixes` maps):\n\n1.  After finding `s_final`, generate all its actual prefixes: `P_set = {s_final[0:i] for i in range(1, n)}`.\n2.  Initialize `ans_chars = [''] * (2 * n - 2)`.\n3.  Create a `collections.Counter` for `P_set` to track which prefixes have been assigned.\n4.  Iterate through `input_strings_with_indices`:\n    *   For each `s_in` at original index `idx`:\n        *   If `s_in` is in `P_set` AND `P_set_counts[s_in] > 0`:\n            *   `ans_chars[idx] = 'P'`\n            *   `P_set_counts[s_in] -= 1`\n        *   Else:\n            *   `ans_chars[idx] = 'S'`\n5.  Print `\"\".join(ans_chars)`.\n\nThis simplified classification works because for each length `k`, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. If `s_in` is the prefix of length `k`, it will be in `P_set`. If it's the suffix of length `k` (and not also the prefix), it won't be in `P_set` (or its count will be 0 if it was already used as a prefix). This handles cases like `s=\"ababa\"`, where \"aba\" is both a prefix and suffix. The first \"aba\" encountered will be marked 'P', and the second \"aba\" encountered (which must be the suffix) will be marked 'S'.\n\nExample 1: `n=5`, strings `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\nStrings of length `n-1=4`: `abab`, `baba`.\nCandidate 1: `s_a = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\"`. Check: `abab[1:] == \"bab\"`, `baba[:-1] == \"bab\"`. Match! So `s=\"ababa\"` is valid.\nNow classify:\n`s_final = \"ababa\"`\nPrefixes: `a, ab, aba, abab`\nSuffixes: `a, ba, aba, baba`\n\nInput strings (with original indices):\n`['ba', 0]`\n`['a', 1]`\n`['abab', 2]`\n`['a', 3]`\n`['aba', 4]`\n`['baba', 5]`\n`['ab', 6]`\n`['aba', 7]`\n\n`P_set = {\"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\"}`\n`P_set_counts = {\"a\": 1, \"ab\": 1, \"aba\": 1, \"abab\": 1}`\n\n1.  `s_in = \"ba\"` (index 0). Not in `P_set`. `ans[0] = 'S'`.\n2.  `s_in = \"a\"` (index 1). In `P_set`, `P_set_counts[\"a\"] > 0`. `ans[1] = 'P'`, `P_set_counts[\"a\"] = 0`.\n3.  `s_in = \"abab\"` (index 2). In `P_set`, `P_set_counts[\"abab\"] > 0`. `ans[2] = 'P'`, `P_set_counts[\"abab\"] = 0`.\n4.  `s_in = \"a\"` (index 3). In `P_set`, but `P_set_counts[\"a\"] = 0`. So this must be 'S'. `ans[3] = 'S'`.\n5.  `s_in = \"aba\"` (index 4). In `P_set`, `P_set_counts[\"aba\"] > 0`. `ans[4] = 'P'`, `P_set_counts[\"aba\"] = 0`.\n6.  `s_in = \"baba\"` (index 5). Not in `P_set`. `ans[5] = 'S'`.\n7.  `s_in = \"ab\"` (index 6). In `P_set`, `P_set_counts[\"ab\"] > 0`. `ans[6] = 'P'`, `P_set_counts[\"ab\"] = 0`.\n8.  `s_in = \"aba\"` (index 7). In `P_set`, but `P_set_counts[\"aba\"] = 0`. So this must be 'S'. `ans[7] = 'S'`.\n\nResult: `SPPSPSPS`.
