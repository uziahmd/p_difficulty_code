Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Dissection and Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. The core is figuring out the best moves for Homer and Marge to maximize their combined score from a given number. It's all about strategic digit allocation.\n\nInitially, I got caught up in thinking about forming the actual numbers S1 and S2, but then I realized the critical point is the *place value* of each digit. When a player snags a digit, it's appended to the end of their number, shifting the existing digits to the left. The dynamic programming approach seems fitting because we can build up the optimal solution incrementally.\n\n**State Definition and Calculation**\n\nI'm thinking, let's define a state `dp[h][m]` which holds the maximum total score we can achieve when Homer has made 'h' moves and Marge has made 'm' moves, after processing the corresponding digits. The current digit would be at the (h+m)th position in A. Each state needs to know which player took that digit.\n\nWe need to iterate through possible moves, looking at the contribution of taking a digit to each player's number based on their current move count. The key is in how the place value increases as you make more moves.\n\n*   **Homer's move**: `digit * 10^(n - 1 - h)`\n*   **Marge's move**: `digit * 10^(n - 1 - m)`\n\nWe need to compare these contributions to the previous states ( `dp[h-1][m]` or `dp[h][m-1]`) to find the best move for each state. At each step, store the \"choice\" ('H' or 'M') to reconstruct the optimal sequence.\n\n**Implementation Details and Refinement**\n\nWe initialize the `dp` table and iterate over it building up the solution.\n\nI kept running into issues with the place value calculations during the manual tests, and this made me re-check the logic.\n\nI reevaluated how each digit's position contributes to each score.\nThe crucial part is the index of the digit that affects place value during calculations. Then calculate each scenario and store the best score and the decision that led there. And also store the chosen move in each cell.\n\nFinally, we trace back from the final state `dp[n][n]` to get the sequence of moves.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of `2n` moves (Homer 'H' or Marge 'M') such that Homer makes exactly `n` moves and Marge makes exactly `n` moves, and their total prize `S1 + S2` is maximized. `S1` and `S2` are numbers formed by concatenating the digits they take, in the order they take them.\n\nLet `A` be the given `2n`-digit number. The digits are `A[0], A[1], ..., A[2n-1]`.\n\nWhen a player takes a digit `d`, it is appended to their current number. If this is the `k`-th digit (0-indexed) taken by that player, it will occupy the `k`-th position from the left in their final `n`-digit number. This means its place value will be `10^(n - 1 - k)`.\n\nFor example, if `n=2` and Homer takes `d_a` then `d_b`:\n`d_a` is the 0-th digit taken by Homer, contributes `d_a * 10^(2-1-0) = d_a * 10`.\n`d_b` is the 1-st digit taken by Homer, contributes `d_b * 10^(2-1-1) = d_b * 1`.\nSo `S1 = d_a * 10 + d_b * 1`.\n\nThis structure suggests a dynamic programming approach.\n\n**DP State:**\nLet `dp[h][m]` be the maximum possible sum `S1 + S2` when Homer has made `h` moves and Marge has made `m` moves.\nThe total number of digits consumed from `A` to reach this state is `h + m`. The current digit being considered for `A` is `A[h+m-1]`.\n\n**Base Case:**\n`dp[0][0] = 0` (no moves made, no prize). All other `dp` values are initialized to a very small number (e.g., -1) to signify unreachable states.\n\n**Transitions:**\nTo calculate `dp[h][m]`, we consider two possibilities for how we reached this state:\n\n1.  **Homer took the last digit:** This means Homer made his `h`-th move. The previous state was `dp[h-1][m]`.\n    The digit Homer took was `A[h+m-1]`. This was Homer's `(h-1)`-th digit taken (0-indexed).\n    Its contribution to `S1` is `int(A[h+m-1]) * 10^(n - 1 - (h-1)) = int(A[h+m-1]) * 10^(n - h)`.\n    So, `value_if_Homer_takes = dp[h-1][m] + int(A[h+m-1]) * 10^(n - h)`. This is valid if `h > 0` and `dp[h-1][m]` is reachable.\n\n2.  **Marge took the last digit:** This means Marge made her `m`-th move. The previous state was `dp[h][m-1]`.\n    The digit Marge took was `A[h+m-1]`. This was Marge's `(m-1)`-th digit taken (0-indexed).\n    Its contribution to `S2` is `int(A[h+m-1]) * 10^(n - 1 - (m-1)) = int(A[h+m-1]) * 10^(n - m)`.\n    So, `value_if_Marge_takes = dp[h][m-1] + int(A[h+m-1]) * 10^(n - m)`. This is valid if `m > 0` and `dp[h][m-1]` is reachable.\n\n`dp[h][m]` will be the maximum of `value_if_Homer_takes` and `value_if_Marge_takes`.\n\n**Storing Choices for Path Reconstruction:**\nWe also need to store which choice ('H' or 'M') led to the maximum value for `dp[h][m]`. Let `choice[h][m]` store this character.\n\n**Iteration Order:**\nWe iterate `h` from `0` to `n` and `m` from `0` to `n`. This ensures that `dp[h-1][m]` and `dp[h][m-1]` are computed before `dp[h][m]`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe maximum total prize is `dp[n][n]`.\n\n**Path Reconstruction:**\nTo get the sequence of moves, we backtrack from `(n, n)` to `(0, 0)`.\nIf `choice[h][m]` is 'H', it means Homer took the `(h+m-1)`-th digit. We append 'H' to our path and move to state `(h-1, m)`.\nIf `choice[h][m]` is 'M', it means Marge took the `(h+m-1)`-th digit. We append 'M' to our path and move to state `(h, m-1)`.\nSince we build the path in reverse order, we need to reverse the final sequence of characters.\n\n**Constraints and Data Types:**\n`n` is up to 18. `2n` is up to 36.\n`dp` table size: `(n+1) * (n+1) = 19 * 19 = 361` states. Each state computation is constant time. Total time complexity: `O(n^2)`.\nThe maximum value of `S1` or `S2` can be `n` nines, e.g., `99...9` (18 times). This is approximately `10^18`. The sum `S1 + S2` can be up to `2 * 10^18`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this automatically.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=2, A=\"9911\"):**\n`n=2`. `A = \"9911\"`.\n`dp` table `(3x3)`, `choice` table `(3x3)`.\n`dp[0][0] = 0`. All other `dp` values are `-1`.\n\n`h=0, m=1`: `k=0`. `A[0]=9`.\n  `val_M = dp[0][0] + 9 * (10**(2-1)) = 0 + 90 = 90`.\n  `dp[0][1] = 90`, `choice[0][1] = 'M'`.\n\n`h=1, m=0`: `k=0`. `A[0]=9`.\n  `val_H = dp[0][0] + 9 * (10**(2-1)) = 0 + 90 = 90`.\n  `dp[1][0] = 90`, `choice[1][0] = 'H'`.\n\n`h=0, m=2`: `k=1`. `A[1]=9`.\n  `val_M = dp[0][1] + 9 * (10**(2-2)) = 90 + 9 = 99`.\n  `dp[0][2] = 99`, `choice[0][2] = 'M'`.\n\n`h=1, m=1`: `k=1`. `A[1]=9`.\n  `val_H = dp[0][1] + 9 * (10**(2-1)) = 90 + 90 = 180`.\n  `val_M = dp[1][0] + 9 * (10**(2-1)) = 90 + 90 = 180`.\n  If `val_H >= val_M`, pick 'H'. `dp[1][1] = 180`, `choice[1][1] = 'H'`.\n\n`h=2, m=0`: `k=1`. `A[1]=9`.\n  `val_H = dp[1][0] + 9 * (10**(2-2)) = 90 + 9 = 99`.\n  `dp[2][0] = 99`, `choice[2][0] = 'H'`.\n\n`h=1, m=2`: `k=2`. `A[2]=1`.\n  `val_H = dp[0][2] + 1 * (10**(2-1)) = 99 + 10 = 109`.\n  `val_M = dp[1][1] + 1 * (10**(2-2)) = 180 + 1 = 181`.\n  `dp[1][2] = 181`, `choice[1][2] = 'M'`.\n\n`h=2, m=1`: `k=2`. `A[2]=1`.\n  `val_H = dp[1][1] + 1 * (10**(2-2)) = 180 + 1 = 181`.\n  `val_M = dp[2][0] + 1 * (10**(2-1)) = 99 + 10 = 109`.\n  `dp[2][1] = 181`, `choice[2][1] = 'H'`.\n\n`h=2, m=2`: `k=3`. `A[3]=1`.\n  `val_H = dp[1][2] + 1 * (10**(2-2)) = 181 + 1 = 182`.\n  `val_M = dp[2][1] + 1 * (10**(2-2)) = 181 + 1 = 182`.\n  If `val_H >= val_M`, pick 'H'. `dp[2][2] = 182`, `choice[2][2] = 'H'`.\n\nFinal `dp[2][2] = 182`.\n\nReconstruct path from `(2,2)`:\n1. `(2,2)`, `choice[2][2] = 'H'`. Path: `['H']`. Next: `(1,2)`.\n2. `(1,2)`, `choice[1][2] = 'M'`. Path: `['H', 'M']`. Next: `(1,1)`.\n3. `(1,1)`, `choice[1][1] = 'H'`. Path: `['H', 'M', 'H']`.
