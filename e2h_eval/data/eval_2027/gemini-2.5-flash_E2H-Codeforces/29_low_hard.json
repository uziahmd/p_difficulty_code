Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the String Replacement Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem and it's all about string manipulation and modular arithmetic. Essentially, I'm given an initial string of digits, and then a series of replacement queries.  Each query tells me to replace a digit with a string. The final goal is to calculate the numerical value of the modified string modulo 1000000007.\n\nThe first thing that hits me is that directly applying these string replacements to the initial string could be incredibly slow, especially given the constraints.  The length of the string could explode exponentially, making brute-force string operations totally infeasible.\n\nNow, the fact that we're dealing with modular arithmetic (mod 10^9 + 7) should be a huge clue.  It implies that I shouldn't try to build up the entire massive string. I need to find a way to compute the numerical value directly.  That means I can't construct the potentially giant intermediate strings in memory.\n\nMy key insight here is that the replacements are based on *digits*. This points me towards a recursive or dynamic programming strategy.  I'm thinking I should focus on the final state of each digit after all the queries. Let's call the final string each digit transforms into `final_string[d]`. I can also consider the numerical value of each final string as `value[d]` and its length as `length[d]`.\n\nThe queries \"di->ti\" are applied sequentially. Initially, a digit represents itself. For example, a query \"2->0\" means every time I find a \"2\", I replace it with a \"0\". But it's not simply that. If I have \"0->7\" later, then this means that if a \"2\" becomes \"0\", and a \"0\" subsequently becomes \"7\", a \"2\" effectively becomes a \"7\". The problem's examples clarify this sequential, and subsequent-replacements-affecting nature.\n\nThis *reverse* processing of the queries seems critical. I need to think about the final mapping of each digit after all of the replacements have been applied. I need to determine what each digit eventually becomes, accounting for all the sequential transformations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to compute the numerical value of a string `s` after a series of digit-to-string replacements, modulo 1000000007. The replacements are sequential, meaning a digit replaced in one step might be further replaced in a later step. For example, if `2` becomes `0`, and then `0` becomes `7`, an original `2` ultimately becomes `7`. The string `s` can become extremely long, so we cannot perform actual string manipulations.\n\nThe key insight is to process the queries in reverse order. This is a common technique when replacements are cumulative.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nFor each digit `d` from 0 to 9, we want to know what it ultimately transforms into. Let's maintain two pieces of information for each digit `d`:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value of the string that `d` transforms into, modulo `MOD`.\n2.  `length[d]`: The length of the string that `d` transforms into, modulo `MOD - 1` (because `10^(MOD-1)` is congruent to `1` by Fermat's Little Theorem, and we need `length` for exponents of `10`).\n\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` transforms into itself:\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `length[d] = 1`\n\nNow, consider the queries `di -> ti`. We process them from the last query to the first.\nWhen we process query `k: di -> ti`:\nThis query tells us that any `di` encountered *at this stage* will be replaced by `ti`. Since we are processing in reverse, `val[x]` and `length[x]` for `x` in `ti` already represent their final transformations after all subsequent queries.\nSo, to find the new `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on `ti`:\nWe iterate through `ti` from right to left (to correctly calculate place values).\nLet `new_val_di = 0` and `new_length_di = 0`.\nFor each character `c` in `ti` (from right to left):\n*   `digit = int(c)`\n*   `new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[digit] * pow(10, new_length_di, MOD)) % MOD`\n*   `new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[digit]) % (MOD - 1)` (We use `MOD - 1` for length because it's an exponent).\n\nAfter processing `ti`, we update `val[di]` and `length[di]` with `new_val_di` and `new_length_di`.\n\nAfter processing all `n` queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` will correctly represent the final transformation of each digit `d`.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of the initial string `s`. We iterate through `s` from right to left.\nLet `final_ans = 0` and `total_length = 0`.\nFor each character `c` in `s` (from right to left):\n*   `digit = int(c)`\n*   `final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit] * pow(10, total_length, MOD)) % MOD`\n*   `total_length = (total_length + length[digit]) % (MOD - 1)`\n\nThe final `final_ans` is the answer.\n\n**Example Trace (from problem description):**\n`s = 222`, `n = 2`\nQueries:\n1. `2->0`\n2. `0->7`\n\n`MOD = 1000000007`\n\n**Initial state:**\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Process Query 2 (0->7):**\n`di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n`new_val_0 = 0`, `new_length_0 = 0`\nChar `c = '7'`: `digit = 7`\n`new_val_0 = (0 + val[7] * pow(10, 0, MOD)) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n`new_length_0 = (0 + length[7]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\nUpdate `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n\nState after Query 2:\n`val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Process Query 1 (2->0):**\n`di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n`new_val_2 = 0`, `new_length_2 = 0`\nChar `c = '0'`: `digit = 0`\n`new_val_2 = (0 + val[0] * pow(10, 0, MOD)) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n`new_length_2 = (0 + length[0]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\nUpdate `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n\nState after Query 1:\n`val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Calculate final value for initial string `s = \"222\"`:**\n`final_ans = 0`, `total_length = 0`\n\nChar `c = '2'` (rightmost): `digit = 2`\n`final_ans = (0 + val[2] * pow(10, 0, MOD)) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n`total_length = (0 + length[2]) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n\nChar `c = '2'` (middle): `digit = 2`\n`final_ans = (7 + val[2] * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = (7 + 7 * 10) % MOD = 77`\n`total_length = (1 + length[2]) % (MOD - 1) = (1 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 2`\n\nChar `c = '2'` (leftmost): `digit = 2`\n`final_ans = (77 + val[2] * pow(10, 2, MOD)) % MOD = (77 + 7 * 100) % MOD = 777`\n`total_length = (2 + length[2]) % (MOD - 1) = (2 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 3`\n\nFinal answer: `777`. This matches the example.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   `N` queries, `sum_len_ti` is the total length of all `ti` strings.\n*   Processing each query: iterate through `ti`. This takes `O(|ti|)` time.

Since `exp` can be up to `MOD-2`, this is `O(log MOD)`.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(sum_len_ti * log MOD + |s| * log MOD)`.\n*   Given `|s| <= 10^5`, `sum_len_ti <= 10^5`, `MOD = 10^9 + 7`, `log MOD` is around 30.\n*   The complexity is roughly `10^5 * 30`, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split(\"->\")\n        d_char = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        queries.append((d_char, t))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n\n    # Initialize val and length for each digit 0-9\n    # val[d]: numerical value of what digit d transforms into\n    # length[d]: length of the string that digit d transforms into\n    #            (used for exponent, so modulo MOD-1 by Fermat's Little Theorem)\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for d_char, t in reversed(queries):\n        d_int = int(d_char)\n        \n        new_val_d = 0\n        new_length_d = 0\n\n        # If t is an empty string, d transforms to 0 (value) and 0 (length)\n        if not t:\n            new_val_d = 0\n            new_length_d = 0\n        else:\n            # Iterate through t from right to left to correctly calculate place values\n            for char_t in reversed(t):\n                digit_t = int(char_t)\n                \n                # Add val[digit_t] * 10^(current accumulated length)\n                new_val_d = (new_val_d + val[digit_t] * pow(10, new_length_d, MOD)) % MOD\n                \n                # Add length[digit_t] to the accumulated length\n                new_length_d = (new_length_d + length[digit_t]) % (MOD - 1)\n        \n        # Update the val and length for digit d\n        val[d_int] = new_val_d\n        length[d_int] = new_length_d\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    total_length_s = 0\n\n    # Iterate through s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Add val[digit_s] * 10^(current accumulated length of s)\n        final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit_s] * pow(10, total_length_s, MOD)) % MOD\n        \n        # Add length[digit_s] to the accumulated length of s\n        total_length_s = (total_length_s + length[digit_s]) % (MOD - 1)\n\n    print(final_ans)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
