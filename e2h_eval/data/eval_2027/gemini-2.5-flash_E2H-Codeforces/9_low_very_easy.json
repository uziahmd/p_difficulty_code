Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Souvenir Selling Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which is basically a knapsack variation. I've got `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and a cost `c_i`, and a total weight limit `m`. The goal is to maximize the total cost of the souvenirs I choose without exceeding `m`.\n\nThe constraints are pretty clear: `n` can be up to 100,000, `m` is capped at 300,000, the individual weights are between 1 and 3, and the costs are up to a billion.\n\nThe key here is that the weights are small, only 1, 2, or 3. This is screaming \"group by weight\" at me. I'll make three groups: weight 1, weight 2, and weight 3 souvenirs. To maximize the cost, I'll sort each group in descending order of cost. Let's call these sorted lists `costs1`, `costs2`, and `costs3`.\n\nNow, how do I actually choose? It's like an unbounded knapsack, except I can only pick each souvenir once. A standard dynamic programming knapsack approach would be `O(N*M)`, which is way too slow given that `m` can be 300,000.  The `N` is fine, but that `M` is killer.\n\nSince the weights are small, I can try iterating through the number of items I pick from each weight group. Let's say I choose `k3` items of weight 3. That takes up `3 * k3` weight, and gives me `sum(costs3[0...k3-1])` cost.  I'm left with `m - 3 * k3` capacity, and I can choose from the weight 1 and weight 2 groups.\n\nBut that's still a knapsack problem with the remaining capacity.  I could iterate through different values of k3 from 0 to the length of costs3.  The remaining capacity, `m - 3*k3` can still be too large to manage.\n\nAlternatively, I could try iterating over the quantities of weight-1 items and weight-2 items I pick.  Could this be done with DP? Let `dp[w]` represent the maximum cost I can achieve with a total weight of `w`.  This is `O(M)` states.  For each souvenir `(w_i, c_i)`, I'd update `dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w_i] + c_i)`.  That looks promising, potentially leading to an efficient solution.\n",
