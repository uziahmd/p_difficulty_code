Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "**The Pythonic Pursuit of Maximum Function Value**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm staring at this \"Find Maximum\" problem, and I'm convinced digit DP is the way to go.  We've got this function, `f(x)`, which sums up elements in an array `a` based on the set bits in `x`. The goal is to maximize `f(x)` while keeping `x` less than or equal to `m`, where `m` is this number represented as a binary string, `s`.  The key here is that `s` is given MSB first (most significant bit).\n\nMy initial thought is that a greedy approach might be possible, but to ensure accuracy, I'm leaning heavily towards a dynamic programming strategy, specifically a digit DP approach. The constraint `0 <= x <= m` screams for this.\n\nI'm thinking of building up `x` bit by bit, from the MSB (most significant bit) to the LSB (least significant bit). At each bit position, I have to decide if that bit of `x` should be 0 or 1.\n\nThe `tight` flag is crucial. It tells me whether the prefix of `x` I've built so far is the same as the corresponding prefix of `m`. If it's tight, I have fewer options for the current bit.  This all means I'm defining a DP state `dp(idx, tight, current_sum)`.\n\nNow, the greedy part.  When I'm at a bit position in `m`, I have two choices:\n1.  Set the corresponding bit in `x` to 0. This \"breaks the tie\" (makes x strictly smaller than m) at that bit.\n2.  If the bit in `m` is 1, I can set the bit in `x` to 1, maintaining the tight condition.\n\nThe thing is, I realized that if the `m` bit is 0, setting the corresponding bit in `x` to 1 leads to an `x` value that exceeds `m`. Thus it is not an option.\n\nI need to precompute some sums for optimization. So I'll compute `sum_up_to_i_exclusive[k] = sum(a[j] for j < k)`.\n\nFinally, after iterating, to maximize the value, I have to compute `f(m)` for the maximum value.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum value of `f(x)` for `0 <= x <= m`. The function `f(x)` is defined as the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` where the `i`-th bit of `x` is set. The array `a` has `n` elements, `a0, ..., an-1`. The number `m` is given as a binary string `s0s1...sn-1`, where `s0` is the most significant bit (corresponding to `2^(n-1)`) and `sn-1` is the least significant bit (corresponding to `2^0`).\n\nThis problem can be solved using a digit DP-like approach. We want to construct `x` bit by bit from most significant to least significant, maximizing `f(x)` while ensuring `x <= m`.\n\nLet's process the bits from `n-1` down to `0`. The input string `s` has `s[0]` corresponding to bit `n-1`, `s[1]` to bit `n-2`, ..., `s[n-1]` to bit `0`.\n\nWe maintain two variables:\n1.  `max_f_x`: The maximum `f(x)` found so far. Initialize to 0.\n2.  `current_f_x_prefix`: The sum of `a[j]` for bits `j` that we have already decided to set to `1` and where `x_j` matches `m_j`. This represents the `f` value for the prefix of `x` that is currently equal to the prefix of `m`.\n\nWe also need an efficient way to calculate the sum of `a[k]` for all `k` less than a certain `bit_pos`. Let's precompute prefix sums of `a`:\n`prefix_sum_a[k]` will store `sum(a[j] for j in range(k))`.\n`prefix_sum_a[0] = 0`\n`prefix_sum_a[k+1] = prefix_sum_a[k] + a[k]` for `k` from `0` to `n-1`.\nSo, `prefix_sum_a[k]` correctly gives `a[0] + ... + a[k-1]`.\n\nNow, iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`. `i` is the index in the binary string `s`.\nThe actual bit position corresponding to `s[i]` is `bit_pos = n - 1 - i`.\n\nInside the loop, for each `bit_pos`:\nLet `m_bit_val = int(s[i])`.\n\n1.  **If `m_bit_val == 1`**:\n    This means the `bit_pos`-th bit of `m` is `1`. We have two choices for the `bit_pos`-th bit of `x`:\n    a.  **Set `x_bit_pos = 0`**:\n        If we set this bit to `0`, `x` becomes strictly less than `m` at this position (or was already less). This means for all subsequent bits `j < bit_pos`, we can set `x_j = 1` to maximize the sum, because `x` will still be less than `m`.\n        The sum for such an `x` would be `current_f_x_prefix` (sum from higher bits where `x_k = m_k = 1`) plus `sum(a[k] for k < bit_pos)`.\n        Update `max_f_x = max(max_f_x, current_f_x_prefix + prefix_sum_a[bit_pos])`.\n    b.  **Set `x_bit_pos = 1`**:\n        If we set this bit to `1`, `x` continues to match `m` in its prefix. We add `a[bit_pos]` to `current_f_x_prefix`.\n        `current_f_x_prefix += a[bit_pos]`.\n\n2.  **If `m_bit_val == 0`**:\n    This means the `bit_pos`-th bit of `m` is `0`. We must set the `bit_pos`-th bit of `x` to `0` to ensure `x <= m`. If we set it to `1`, `x` would become greater than `m`.\n    So, `x_bit_pos` must be `0`. `current_f_x_prefix` remains unchanged (as we don't add `a[bit_pos]`).\n\nAfter the loop finishes, `current_f_x_prefix` will hold the `f(m)` value (if `x` is chosen to be exactly `m`). We should compare this final `current_f_x_prefix` with `max_f_x` one last time.\n`max_f_x = max(max_f_x, current_f_x_prefix)`.\n\nThe final `max_f_x` will be the answer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description, with corrected `m` interpretation):**\n`n = 5`\n`a = [17, 0, 10, 2, 1]` (a0, a1, a2, a3, a4)\n`s = \"11010\"` (m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16 + 8 + 2 = 26)\n\n`prefix_sum_a`:\n`[0, a0, a0+a1, a0+a1+a2, a0+a1+a2+a3, a0+a1+a2+a3+a4]`\n`[0, 17, 17, 27, 29, 30]`\n\n`max_f_x = 0`\n`current_f_x_prefix = 0`\n\n`i = 0` (`s[0] = '1'`, `bit_pos = 4`, `a[4] = 1`):\n    `m_bit_val = 1`.\n    Option 1 (`x_4 = 0`): `max_f_x = max(0, 0 + prefix_sum_a[4]) = max(0, 29) = 29`.\n        (This corresponds to `x = 01111` (binary) = `15`. `f(15) = a0+a1+a2+a3 = 17+0+10+2 = 29`. `15 <= 26` is true.)\n    Option 2 (`x_4 = 1`): `current_f_x_prefix += a[4] = 1`. `current_f_x_prefix = 1`.\n\n`i = 1` (`s[1] = '1'`, `bit_pos = 3`, `a[3] = 2`):\n    `m_bit_val = 1`.\n    Option 1 (`x_3 = 0`): `max_f_x = max(29, current_f_x_prefix + prefix_sum_a[3]) = max(29, 1 + 27) = max(29, 28) = 29`.\n        (This corresponds to `x = 10111` (binary) = `23`. `f(23) = a4+a0+a1+a2 = 1+17+0+10 = 28`. `23 <= 26` is true.)\n    Option 2 (`x_3 = 1`): `current_f_x_prefix += a[3] = 2`. `current_f_x_prefix = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n\n`i = 2` (`s[2] = '0'`, `bit_pos = 2`, `a[2] = 10`):\n    `m_bit_val = 0`.\n    Must set `x_2 = 0`. `current_f_x_prefix` remains `3`.\n\n`i = 3` (`s[3] = '1'`, `bit_pos = 1`, `a[1] = 0`):\n    `m_bit_val = 1`.\n    Option 1 (`x_1 = 0`): `max_f_x = max(29, current_f_x_prefix + prefix_sum_a[1]) = max(29, 3 + 17) = max(29, 20) = 29`.\n        (This corresponds to `x = 11001` (binary) = `25`. `f(25) = a4+a3+a0 = 1+2+17 = 20`. `25 <= 26` is true.)\n    Option 2 (`x_1 = 1`): `current_f_x_prefix += a[1] = 0`. `current_f_x_prefix = 3 + 0 = 3`.\n\n`i = 4` (`s[4] = '0'`, `bit_pos = 0`, `a[0] = 17`):\n    `m_bit_val = 0`.\n    Must set `x_0 = 0`. `current_f_x_prefix` remains `3`.\n\nAfter loop:\n`max_f_x = max(max_f_x, current_f_x_prefix) = max(29, 3) = 29`.\n\nThe maximum value is 29.
