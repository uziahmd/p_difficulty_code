A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Soft Drinking Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I need a Python script to tackle this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. It's about maximizing the number of toasts everyone can make, given limited resources. \n\nLet's break it down: I have `n` friends, and I need to figure out the maximum number of toasts each of them can have, keeping in mind that they all need to have the same amount.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the available resources. I have `k` drink bottles with `l` milliliters each, `c` limes with `d` slices each, and `p` grams of salt. Each friend needs `nl` milliliters of drink, 1 slice of lime, and `np` grams of salt per toast.\n\nMy initial thought was to calculate how many toasts each resource allowed per *person* and then find the minimum, but I now realize that's not quite right. Instead, I need to calculate the *total* number of toasts possible, factoring in that *every* friend needs to be able to have the *same* number of toasts. I need to find the limiting factor based on the collective resources, not individual ones.\n\nSo, I need to figure out how many *group* toasts are possible, where a group toast means one toast for each friend. Let me calculate that for each resource:\n\n1.  **Based on the drink**: I have `k * l` milliliters of drink total. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters for each friend. So, the number of group toasts possible from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n\n2.  **Based on the lime**: I have `c * d` total lime slices. Each toast needs 1 lime slice for each friend. So the number of toasts is just the total lime slices, `c * d`.\n\n3.  **Based on the salt**: I have `p` grams of salt. Each friend needs `np` grams of salt. Total salt divided by the salt per friend per toast gives us `p // (n* np)`.\n\nNo, wait, I'm thinking about it wrong... the amount of resource per individual is stated in the prompt, so that should be the basis of my calculations.\n\n1.  **Based on the drink**: `(k*l) // nl` total toasts.\n\n2.  **Based on the limes**: `(c*d) // 1 = c*d` total toasts\n\n3.  **Based on the salt**: `p // np` total toasts.\n\nThe minimum of these values, then is my total possible number of toasts for all the friends collectively. Then divide that by the number of friends, `n`, and that's the answer.\n",
