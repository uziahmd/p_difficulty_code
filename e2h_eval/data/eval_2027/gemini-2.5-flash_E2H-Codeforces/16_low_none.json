            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Crazy Town\n\nCrazy Town is a plane on which there are n infinite line roads. Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and I need to figure out the fewest steps between the home and university blocks. The core of this seems to be about figuring out how many roads separate the starting and ending points.\n\nThe input gives me the home and university coordinates, and a list of roads defined by linear equations.  The crucial insight here is the use of half-planes. If two points are on opposite sides of a line (a road), I know I need to cross that road to move between them.  That means the key is checking the signs of `ax + by + c` for the home and university coordinates for each road.  \n\nIf the signs are different (i.e., the product is negative), then I increment my step count. The problem constraints ensure the home and university aren't *on* any road, making the sign check clean and reliable.\n\nSo, the algorithm is straightforward: loop through each road, calculate the values `ax1 + by1 + c` and `ax2 + by2 + c` for the home and university, respectively, and see if their product is negative. If it is, increment my step counter.  The example walk-through solidifies the strategy; I just need to translate this into a Python script.\n",
