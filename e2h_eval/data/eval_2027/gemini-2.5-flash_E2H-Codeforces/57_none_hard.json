His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

Vasya gets the smallest possible sum `S_V` such that `S_V >= x`.\n    # 2. The remaining `N-1` participants are paired up such that as many as possible get `sum >= S_V`.\n    # This is still not quite right because Vasya is one of the `N` participants.\n    # It's about finding a permutation `P` of `b` such that for some `k`, `a_k + b_{P[k]}` is Vasya's score,\n    # and the number of participants `i` for whom `a_i + b_{P[i]} >= a_k + b_{P[k]}` is maximized.\n\n    # Let's consider the scores possible. The minimum possible sum is 0, maximum is 2e5.\n    # We can iterate through all possible sums `S` from `x` to `2e5`.\n    # For each `S`, we want to check if Vasya can get this score `S`.\n    # And if so, what is the maximum number of participants that can score `S` or more?\n    # This is equivalent to finding `S_V` and then counting.\n\n    # Let's try to determine the number of participants who can achieve a score >= T.\n    # `count_ge(T)` function:\n    #   `res = 0`\n    #   `j = n - 1`\n    #   For `i` from `0` to `n - 1`:\n    #     While `j >= 0` and `a[i] + b[j] < T`:\n    #       `j -= 1`\n    #     If `j >= 0`:\n    #       `res += 1`\n    #       `j -= 1`\n    #   Return `res`\n    # This `count_ge(T)` function is correct. It finds the maximum number of pairs that can sum to at least T.\n\n    # Now, for the worst rank:\n    # We want to find the smallest possible score `S_V` for Vasya (such that `S_V >= x`).\n    # And then, compute `count_ge(S_V)`. This will be Vasya's worst rank.\n    # The smallest possible score `S_V` for Vasya:\n    # Iterate through each `a_i` as Vasya's first tour score.\n    # Find the smallest `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n    # This gives a candidate `S_V = a_i + b_j`.\n    # We want to find the `S_V` that maximizes `count_ge(S_V)`.\n    # No, we want to find the `S_V` that maximizes `count_ge(S_V)` *subject to Vasya being able to achieve `S_V`*.\n\n    # The actual worst rank is `max(count_ge(S))` over all possible `S` that Vasya can achieve.\n    # What scores can Vasya achieve?\n    # Vasya can achieve any score `a_i + b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n    # We need to find `max_{i,j: a_i+b_j >= x} (count_ge(a_i + b_j))`.\n    # This is still N^2 * log N or N^2.
