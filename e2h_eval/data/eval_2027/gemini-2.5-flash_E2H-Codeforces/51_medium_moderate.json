Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving the \"Amusing Joke\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out if a pile of letters is just a rearranged version of two names combined. My immediate thought is that this is a permutation problem. I've got three strings, `guest_name`, `host_name`, and `pile_of_letters`.  The `pile_of_letters` should contain all and only the characters from the other two strings combined, just in a different order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a successful \"joke.\" It's not just about lengths being equal; it's also about *character counts* matching up exactly. If the combined guest and host names have an \"A\" three times, then the pile of letters must also have an \"A\" three times, and so on for every character.\n\nI started by visualizing a few examples, to solidify my understanding.  I looked at examples with characters appearing once, and also repeated. I made sure to test cases that return \"YES\" and \"NO\" to confirm the logic.\n\nMy initial approach is to combine the `guest_name` and `host_name` into a single string.  Then, I'd need to compare this combined string to the `pile_of_letters`. I've got a couple of ideas for the comparison:\n\n1.  **Character Counts:** I could create a dictionary or use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the `pile_of_letters`.  Then, I could compare the two dictionaries.\n\n2.  **Sorting:** An equally appealing approach is to sort both the combined string and the `pile_of_letters`.  If they are permutations of each other, their sorted versions will be identical. Sorting is simpler and has less overhead, so I'm going with this.\n\nThe sorting approach seems the most elegant to me and handles the length check implicitly.\n\nI think the Python `sorted()` function is ideal for this. It returns a sorted list of characters, and directly comparing two lists (element by element) gives me the result I need. I tested this with both the \"YES\" and \"NO\" examples and it worked perfectly. I had one small issue visualizing a sorted string as an output. I have to remember that `sorted()` returns a list, not a string. I can combine the list back to string using `\"\".join()` to print if required, but it's not strictly necessary for the comparison to work.\n\nAlso, I considered the constraints. The maximum string length is 100 characters, so the combined string can be at most 200 characters long. Sorting a string of length 200 is fast enough for the competitive programming environment.  The problem states that there are only uppercase letters, so no need to handle case-sensitivity. The problem also specifies the input is not empty, so no need to handle empty string edge cases.\n\nI've got both approaches in mind. However, the `sorted()` approach, seems a bit more concise, easier to write and easier to understand, so I'll go with that. My final code will read the three strings from standard input, combine the guest and host names, sort them both, and then compare them. If the sorted lists are equal, I print \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO.\" I'll also add comments to the code for clarity.\n",
