For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Beautiful Multiset Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. I need a Python solution to count the ways I can choose these `c_s` values for binary strings. The crux is that the *maximum* size of a \"beautiful\" multiset must be exactly `f`. Each `c_s` is an integer from 0 to `k`.  A beautiful multiset, to be clear, means that for every binary string `s`, the number of strings in the multiset having `s` as a prefix is limited by `c_s`.\n\nMy first instinct is to zero in on what *actually* determines the biggest possible beautiful multiset, given a particular set of `c_s` values.  We're dealing with strings of length `n`, so there are `2^n` possibilities.  Each string has a count, `m_i`, and the total size of the multiset is the sum of these counts.\n\nThe core constraint is where it gets interesting.  For any string `s` of length `L`, we look at all the strings of length `n` that *start* with `s`. The sum of the counts of those strings can't exceed `c_s`.  Mathematically: `sum_{S_j in P(s)} m_j <= c_s`. I need to maximize the sum of all the `m_i` values, subject to this constraint, and, of course, that each `m_i` is a non-negative integer.\n\nThis *feels* like a max-flow or min-cut situation.  The branching nature of binary strings suggests a tree-like structure. Consider the relationships between `s`, `s0`, and `s1`.  The number of strings with `s` as a prefix is the same as the sum of those with `s0` and `s1`.  So, `count(s) = count(s0) + count(s1) <= c_s`. We're effectively working with a complete binary tree of depth `n`. The leaves are the final strings of length `n`, and the constraints relate to the nodes.\n\nThinking about the leaves (strings of length `n`), I'll call the exact count of strings matching one of these leaves `x_s`.  For a shorter string `s`, `count(s) = sum of x_t`, where `t` is any string of length `n` with `s` as a prefix. I want to *maximize* the sum of the `x_t` values, subject to these `count(s) <= c_s` constraints.\n\nI'm initially tempted to just do some sort of division with `min_s(c_s / weight(s))`, but that doesn't seem to capture the relationships between constraints correctly. I have to really think about how `count(s0) + count(s1) <= c_s` interplays with the maximum size.  I need to go deeper into the dependencies.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for all binary strings $s$ of length 1 to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how to determine the maximum size of a beautiful multiset for a given set of $c_s$ values. A multiset consists of strings of length exactly $n$. Let $x_t$ be the count of string $t$ in the multiset, where $t$ is a binary string of length $n$. The total size of the multiset is $\\sum_t x_t$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L \\in [1, n]$, let $N(s)$ be the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix. The condition is $N(s) \\le c_s$.\nIf $s$ is a string of length $n$, then $N(s) = x_s$. If $s$ is a string of length $L < n$, then $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$.\nThis structure defines a binary tree where nodes are strings and children are formed by appending '0' and '1'. The leaves are strings of length $n$.\nThe problem of maximizing $\\sum_t x_t$ subject to $N(s) \\le c_s$ and $x_t \\ge 0$ can be solved using a greedy approach.\nFor any node $s$ in the tree (representing string $s$), the maximum number of strings that can have $s$ as a prefix is $c_s$.\nIf $s$ is a leaf (length $n$), then $x_s \\le c_s$.\nIf $s$ is an internal node (length $L < n$), then $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1) \\le c_s$.\nTo maximize the total count, we want to make $N(s)$ as large as possible for all $s$.\nThe maximum possible value for $N(s)$ is $\\min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))$ if $s$ is an internal node, and $\\min(c_s, \\infty)$ (i.e., $c_s$) if $s$ is a leaf.\nThis means we can compute the maximum $N(s)$ values bottom-up.\nFor leaves $s$ (length $n$), $N(s)_{max} = c_s$.\nFor internal nodes $s$ (length $L < n$), $N(s)_{max} = \\min(c_s, N(s0)_{max} + N(s1)_{max})$.\nThe total maximum size of the beautiful multiset is $N(\\text{empty string})_{max}$, if we consider the empty string as the root. However, constraints are given for strings of length 1 to $n$.\nThe total maximum size is $N(0)_{max} + N(1)_{max}$.\n\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$, such that for a specific string $s_0$ of length $L-1$, the maximum possible value for $N(s_0)$ is $val$.\nThis DP state is for a single subtree rooted at $s_0$. Since the structure of constraints is identical for all subtrees of the same depth, we can compute this value for a generic subtree.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for strings $s$ in a subtree rooted at depth $L-1$ (i.e., $s$ has length $L$ to $n$ and $s$ is a descendant of the root of the subtree), such that the maximum total count for this subtree is $val$. The length of the string $s_0$ is $L-1$.\n\nBase case: $L=n$. Strings are of length $n$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $N(s)_{max} = c_s$. We need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nSo, for each $val \\in [0, k]$, there is 1 way to choose $c_s$ such that $N(s)_{max} = val$ (namely, $c_s=val$).\n$dp[n][val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le k$.\n\nRecursive step: For $L \\in [n-1, 1]$.\nWe want to compute $dp[L][val]$.\nThis represents a subtree rooted at depth $L-1$. Its children are at depth $L$. Let's call them $s0$ and $s1$.\nWe need to choose $c_{s_0} \\in [0, k]$.\nWe also need to choose $c_s$ for all descendants of $s0$ and $s1$.\nThe maximum count for $s0$ is $val_0$, and for $s1$ is $val_1$. These values are determined by $dp[L+1][val_0]$ and $dp[L+1][val_1]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of $s0$ to get $val_0$ is $dp[L+1][val_0]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of $s1$ to get $val_1$ is $dp[L+1][val_1]$.\nThe total count for $s_0$ (the root of the current subtree) will be $\\min(c_{s_0}, val_0 + val_1)$.\nWe want this total count to be $val$.\nSo, we iterate over all possible $val_0, val_1 \\in [0, k]$.\nFor each pair $(val_0, val_1)$:\n  Let $S = val_0 + val_1$.\n  The number of ways to achieve $val_0, val_1$ is $dp[L+1][val_0] \\times dp[L+1][val_1]$.\n  We need to choose $c_{s_0}$ such that $\\min(c_{s_0}, S) = val$.\n  Case 1: $val < S$. Then we must have $c_{s_0} = val$. There is 1 choice for $c_{s_0}$.\n  Case 2: $val = S$. Then we must have $c_{s_0} \\ge S$. The possible values for $c_{s_0}$ are $S, S+1, \\dots, k$. There are $k-S+1$ choices for $c_{s_0}$.\n  Case 3: $val > S$. This is impossible, as $\\min(c_{s_0}, S)$ cannot be greater than $S$.\nTherefore, for a fixed $val$:\n$dp[L][val] = \\sum_{val_0=0}^k \\sum_{val_1=0}^k dp[L+1][val_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][val_1] \\cdot (\\text{choices for } c_{s_0})$\nwhere:\n  if $val_0 + val_1 = val$: choices for $c_{s_0}$ is $k-val+1$.\n  if $val_0 + val_1 > val$: choices for $c_{s_0}$ is $1$ (namely $c_{s_0}=val$).\n  if $val_0 + val_1 < val$: choices for $c_{s_0}$ is $0$.\n\nLet $P[L+1][S] = \\sum_{val_0=0}^k \\sum_{val_1=0}^k \\left( dp[L+1][val_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][val_1] \\text{ if } val_0+val_1=S \\text{ else } 0 \\right)$.\nThis is a convolution $dp[L+1] * dp[L+1]$.\nThen $dp[L][val] = (k-val+1) \\cdot P[L+1][val] + \\sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} P[L+1][S]$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} P[L+1][S]$ can be computed efficiently using prefix sums (or suffix sums). Let $SuffP[L+1][X] = \\sum_{S=X}^{2k} P[L+1][S]$.\nThen $dp[L][val] = (k-val+1) \\cdot P[L+1][val] + SuffP[L+1][val+1]$.\nAll calculations are modulo 998244353.\n\nThe maximum possible sum $val_0+val_1$ is $2k$. So $P[L+1]$ will have size up to $2k+1$.\nThe DP state $dp[L]$ is an array of size $k+1$.\nThe final answer is $dp[1][f]$.\n\nThe maximum value of $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum length of $n$ is $15$.\nThe convolution step $P[L+1] = dp[L+1] * dp[L+1]$ takes $O(k^2)$ time naively, or $O(k \\log k)$ using NTT.\nSince $n$ is small, $k^2$ per step for $n$ steps would be $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^{10} = 6 \\cdot 10^{11}$, which is too slow.\nWe must use NTT.\nThe modulus $998244353$ is a prime number and is suitable for NTT.\n\nLet's trace the dimensions:\n$dp[n]$ has size $k+1$.\n$P[n]$ has size $2k+1$.\n$dp[n-1]$ has size $k+1$.\n...\n$dp[1]$ has size $k+1$.\n\nComplexity:\nFor each $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n1. Compute $P[L+1] = dp[L+1] * dp[L+1]$ using NTT. This takes $O(K \\log K)$ where $K$ is the smallest power of 2 greater than $2k$.\n2. Compute $SuffP[L+1]$. This takes $O(K)$ time.\n3. Compute $dp[L]$ using the formula. This takes $O(k)$ time.\nTotal time complexity: $O(n \\cdot K \\log K)$.\n$K \\approx 4 \\cdot 10^5$. $K \\log K \\approx 4 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(4 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 4 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 19 \\approx 7.6 \\cdot 10^6$.\n$n \\cdot K \\log K \\approx 15 \\cdot 7.6 \\cdot 10^6 \\approx 1.14 \\cdot 10^8$, which should be acceptable.\n\nImplementation details for NTT:\n- Modulo $M = 998244353$.\n- Primitive root $g = 3$.\n- Need functions for `ntt`, `inv_ntt`, `convolve`.\n- `ntt` requires padding to a power of 2 length.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    for length in range(2, n + 1, 2):\n        wlen = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = inv(wlen)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1\n            for k in range(length // 2):\n                u = a[i + k]\n                v = (a[i + k + length // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + k] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + k + length // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\ndef convolve(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n    \n    ntt(a_padded, False)\n    ntt(b_padded, False)\n    \n    c_padded = [(x * y) % MOD for x, y in zip(a_padded, b_padded)]\n    \n    ntt(c_padded, True)\n    \n    return c_padded[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # dp[L][val] stores the count of ways for a subtree rooted at depth L-1\n    # such that its max total count is val.\n    # We use a list to represent dp[L], where dp[L][val] is the element at index val.\n    # Max possible val is k.\n    \n    # Base case: L = n.
