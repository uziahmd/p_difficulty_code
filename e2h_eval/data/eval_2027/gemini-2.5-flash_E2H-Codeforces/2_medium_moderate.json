Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script that determines if an `n x n` grid of characters forms an \"X\" shape according to specific rules.  I've broken the rules down. First, the two main diagonals must contain the same character. Second, all the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the *same* character, but that character must be *different* from the diagonal character.  The input grid size, `n`, is guaranteed to be an odd number between 3 and 300.\n\nI'm going to represent the grid as a 2D list called `paper`. My approach will be to read `n` and then read the grid data into `paper`. I'll initialize variables `diag_char` and `nondiag_char` to `None`.\n\nThe core logic is going to involve two nested loops to iterate through each cell of the grid.  Inside the loops, I need to check if the current cell is on one of the diagonals.  If it is, and `diag_char` hasn't been set yet, I'll assign the current cell's character to `diag_char`. If `diag_char` is already set, and the current cell's character *doesn't* match `diag_char`, then it's not an \"X\", and I can print \"NO\" and stop. If it's *not* on a diagonal, the logic will be similar: check if `nondiag_char` is `None` and assign it if so, otherwise ensure the current character matches `nondiag_char`.\n\nA crucial optimization will be to use a boolean flag, `is_x`, which is initially `True` and set to `False` as soon as a rule violation is detected. This lets me break out of the loops early and avoid unnecessary computation.\n\nAfter the loops finish, if `is_x` is still `True`, I need to do the final check: ensure that `diag_char` is different from `nondiag_char`. If they are the same, then it's not an X, and I print \"NO\". If they are different, I print \"YES\".\n\nI've considered edge cases. Because `n` is odd, the diagonals will always intersect. The condition `3 <= n < 300` ensures a reasonable problem size. The algorithm has to handle the intersections and correct character checking.\n\nI'm confident this logic and the code I've written handles the examples and potential corner cases correctly and efficiently. I've also made sure to use `sys.stdin.readline` and `sys.stdout.write` for fast input/output, which is a good habit for competitive programming.\n",
