Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**The \"Selling Souvenirs\" Knapsack Challenge**\n\nI'm tackling the \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, a variation of the classic knapsack problem, and the goal is to maximize the total cost of souvenirs within a weight limit.  The trick lies in the constraint that souvenir weights are only 1, 2, or 3. This simplifies things considerably, and I need a Python script to do it.\n\nA standard knapsack DP approach, which would be O(n*m) would be too slow, so that's out.  My first instinct is to separate the items by weight.  I sort each group (weight 1, weight 2, weight 3) in descending cost.  Then I'm thinking I can iterate to the best total cost.\n\nI realized I can pre-calculate prefix sums for each weight group, representing the total cost of the 'k' most expensive items of that weight. This lets me quickly compute the cost of picking a certain number of each type.\n\nThe idea is to find k1 (weight 1 items), k2 (weight 2 items), and k3 (weight 3 items) such that total weight is <= m, and to maximize the sum of prefix costs. I've tried multiple approaches to calculate how to choose k1,k2,k3 to meet this requirement.\n\nMy initial approach of iterating through all combinations of k2 and k3 to solve it. But I realized this would be slow with the given m. I need to iterate only through the outer loop of a single variable, and then to calculate the inner loop in a linear time.\n\nI tried to compute dp[w] as a maximum value of some items given the capacity, but that also proved inefficient. I've been digging into the core of knapsack solutions.\n\nThe key is to leverage the small weight constraint. I am thinking I could combine items of weight 1 and 2 to reduce the problem size. Computing `max_cost_for_w12[w]` is the core and I need to solve that fast!\n\nThe general form `P_1[k1] + P_2[k2] subject to k1 + 2*k2 <= W` comes up repeatedly, and I need a better way to solve this. I can compute a two-pointer approach, to solve this. The problem is solved by iterating to the smallest number, and then greedy to the others. I can make an efficient script now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs to maximize total cost, given a total weight capacity `m`. Souvenirs have weights `w_i` and costs `c_i`. A crucial constraint is that `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3. The number of souvenirs `n` can be up to `10^5`, and capacity `m` up to `3 * 10^5`. A standard `O(n*m)` knapsack DP is too slow.\n\nThe small number of distinct weights suggests a specialized approach.\nFirst, we separate the souvenirs by their weights and sort them by cost in descending order. This is because to maximize cost for a given number of items of a certain weight, we should always pick the most expensive ones.\nLet `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, `costs_w3` be lists of costs for souvenirs with weight 1, 2, and 3 respectively, sorted in descending order.\nThen, we compute prefix sums for these sorted cost lists.\n`P1[k]` = sum of the `k` most expensive souvenirs of weight 1.\n`P2[k]` = sum of the `k` most expensive souvenirs of weight 2.\n`P3[k]` = sum of the `k` most expensive souvenirs of weight 3.\n\nLet `k1, k2, k3` be the number of items chosen from weight 1, 2, and 3 categories, respectively.\nWe want to maximize `P1[k1] + P2[k2] + P3[k3]` subject to `k1*1 + k2*2 + k3*3 <= m`.\n\nWe can iterate over the number of items of weight 3, `k3`.\n`k3` can range from `0` to `min(len(costs_w3), m // 3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n1. Add `P3[k3]` to the current total cost.\n2. Calculate the remaining capacity: `m_rem = m - k3 * 3`.\n3. Now, we need to maximize `P1[k1] + P2[k2]` subject to `k1*1 + k2*2 <= m_rem`.\n\nThis subproblem (maximizing cost using only weight 1 and weight 2 items for a given capacity `m_rem`) can be solved efficiently.\nLet `max_cost_w12[w]` be the maximum cost for capacity `w` using only weight 1 and 2 items. We can precompute this array for all `w` from `0` to `m`.\n\nTo compute `max_cost_w12[w]` for `w` from `0` to `m`:\nWe can use a two-pointer approach, or a combined greedy strategy.\nConsider the marginal value of adding items. We have items of weight 1 (from `costs_w1`) and items of weight 2 (from `costs_w2`).\nWe can think of this as having two \"queues\" of items, one for weight 1 and one for weight 2. We want to pick items greedily.\nThe candidates for picking are:\n- The next best weight 1 item (cost `c1`, weight 1).\n- The next best weight 2 item (cost `c2`, weight 2).\n- Two next best weight 1 items (cost `c1_a + c1_b`, weight 2).\n\nThis suggests comparing `c1` with `c2/2` or `(c1_a + c1_b)/2`.\nA more systematic way to compute `max_cost_w12[w]` efficiently for all `w`:\nLet `p1_idx` be the current index for `costs_w1` and `p2_idx` for `costs_w2`.\n`current_cost = 0`.\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  `max_cost_w12[w] = current_cost`.\n  If we have capacity `w+1` (to compute `max_cost_w12[w+1]`):\n    We compare two options for filling the next unit of weight:\n    1. Take a weight 1 item: `costs_w1[p1_idx]` (if `p1_idx < len(costs_w1)`).\n    2. Take a weight 2 item, but this uses 2 units of weight. So we need to compare `costs_w2[p2_idx]` (if `p2_idx < len(costs_w2)`) with `costs_w1[p1_idx] + costs_w1[p1_idx+1]` (if `p1_idx + 1 < len(costs_w1)`). This is problematic if we are only considering adding 1 unit of weight.\n\nA correct way to compute `max_cost_w12[w]` in `O(m)`:\nInitialize `max_cost_w12` array of size `m+1` to `0`.\nIterate `k2` (number of weight 2 items) from `0` to `min(len(costs_w2), m // 2)`.\n  `current_weight_w2 = k2 * 2`.\n  `current_cost_w2 = P2[k2]`.\n  Remaining capacity for weight 1 items: `w_for_w1 = m - current_weight_w2`.\n  Number of weight 1 items to take: `k1 = min(len(costs_w1), w_for_w1)`.\n  Total cost for this `k2`: `current_cost_w2 + P1[k1]`.\n  This is still `O(m)` for each `k3` loop. We need `O(1)` lookup.\n\nThe trick is that the problem for weights 1 and 2 can be solved in `O(M)` time.\nLet `dp_w12[w]` be the maximum cost for capacity `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute `dp_w12` array in `O(m)` time using a single pass:\nInitialize `dp_w12` array of size `m+1` with `0`.\n`p1 = 0` (index for `costs_w1`), `p2 = 0` (index for `costs_w2`).\n`current_cost = 0`.\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `cost_w1 = costs_w1[p1]` if `p1 < len(costs_w1)` else `-1`.\n  `cost_w2 = costs_w2[p2]` if `p2 < len(costs_w2)` else `-1`.\n\n  If `w=1`:\n    If `cost_w1 != -1`:\n      `current_cost += cost_w1`\n      `p1 += 1`\n    `dp_w12[w] = current_cost`\n    Continue to next `w`.\n\n  If `w >= 2`:\n    `val1 = -1` (value of taking next best weight 1 item)\n    `val2 = -1` (value of taking next best weight 2 item)\n    `val1_pair = -1` (value of taking two next best weight 1 items)\n\n    If `p1 < len(costs_w1)`:\n      `val1 = costs_w1[p1]`\n    If `p2 < len(costs_w2)`:\n      `val2 = costs_w2[p2]`\n    If `p1 + 1 < len(costs_w1)`:\n      `val1_pair = costs_w1[p1] + costs_w1[p1+1]`\n\n    If `val1 == -1` and `val2 == -1`: // No more items to pick\n      `dp_w12[w] = current_cost`\n      Continue.\n\n    If `val1_pair != -1` and `val1_pair >= val2`: // Two weight 1 items are better than one weight 2 item\n      `current_cost += val1`\n      `p1 += 1`\n    Else if `val2 != -1`: // One weight 2 item is better than two weight 1 items\n      `current_cost += val2`\n      `p2 += 1`\n      // We must handle the case where we take a weight 2 item, but the current `w` is odd.\n      // This means we might have an unused weight 1 item from an earlier step.\n      // This greedy approach of picking the \"next best\" item is tricky with different weights.\n\nA simpler and correct approach for `max_cost_w12[w]` for all `w` in `O(m)`:\nInitialize `max_cost_w12` as a list of `0`s of size `m+1`.\n`current_cost_w1 = 0`\n`p1 = 0`\n`p2 = 0`\n\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  // Option 1: Take `k1` weight 1 items and `k2` weight 2 items.\n  // The crucial observation is that we can always iterate through the number of items of one type (say, weight 2)\n  // and then greedily fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n  // The `O(m)` precomputation for `max_cost_w12` is not trivial.\n\nLet's use the property that `P1[k1]` and `P2[k2]` are concave.\n`max_cost_w12[w]` can be computed by iterating `k2` from `0` to `min(len(costs_w2), w//2)`.\nFor each `k2`, the cost is `P2[k2] + P1[min(len(costs_w1), w - 2*k2)]`.\nThis is still `O(W)` for each `W`.\n\nThe standard solution for this type of problem (small number of distinct weights) is to iterate over one or two types of items and use a data structure for the remaining types, or DP.\nGiven `m` up to `3 * 10^5`, `N` up to `10^5`.\n`O(M log M)` or `O(M)` or `O(N log N)` or `O(N)` is acceptable.\n`O(M * (number of item types))` is also acceptable if number of types is small.\n\nLet's fix `k3` from `0` to `min(len(costs_w3), m // 3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `current_cost = P3[k3]`\n  `m_rem = m - k3 * 3`\n  We need to find `max_{k1, k2: k1 + 2*k2 <= m_rem} (P1[k1] + P2[k2])`.\n  This subproblem can be solved in `O(m_rem)` time by iterating `k2` from `0` to `min(len(costs_w2), m_rem // 2)`.\n  For each `k2`, calculate `P2[k2] + P1[min(len(costs_w1), m_rem - 2*k2)]`.\n  This makes the total complexity `O((m/3) * (m/2)) = O(m^2)`, which is too slow.\n\nThe constraint `wi <= 3` is very strong.\nThe number of items of weight 3 is at most `m/3`.\nThe number of items of weight 2 is at most `m/2`.\nThe number of items of weight 1 is at most `m`.\n\nLet `dp[i][w]` be the maximum cost for capacity `w` using items of weight `1...i`.\n`dp[1][w]` (only weight 1 items) = `P1[min(len(costs_w1), w)]`.\n`dp[2][w]` (weight 1 and 2 items). This is the value `max_cost_w12[w]` we need.\n`dp[3][w]` (weight 1, 2, and 3 items). This is the final answer.\n\nTo compute `dp[2][w]` for all `w` in `O(m)`:\nWe can iterate `k1` from `0` to `len(costs_w1)`.\nFor each `k1`, we have `P1[k1]` and `k1` weight used.\nRemaining capacity `w_rem = w - k1`. We need to fill `w_rem` with weight 2 items.\nThis takes `P2[min(len(costs_w2), w_rem // 2)]`.\nThis is still `O(m^2)`.\n\nThe solution must be `O(M)` or `O(M log M)`.\nLet's consider the items we pick.\nThe most expensive items are always preferred.\nWe can combine items of weight 1 and 2.\nConsider a \"virtual\" item of weight 2 formed by two weight 1 items. Its cost is `costs_w1[i] + costs_w1[i+1]`.\nWe can merge `costs_w2` and these virtual items (if `len(costs_w1) >= 2`) into a single list of \"weight 2 equivalent\" items.\nSort these combined \"weight 2 equivalent\" items by cost.\nLet this combined list be `combined_w2_items`.\nNow we have items of weight 1 and items of weight 2 (from `combined_w2_items`).\nWe can use a standard greedy approach for this:\nMaintain `p1` for `costs_w1` and `p2` for `combined_w2_items`.\nAt each step, we have `current_capacity`.\nCompare `costs_w1[p1]` (value/weight = `C1`) vs `combined_w2_items[p2]` (value/weight = `C2/2`).\nTake the one with higher value/weight.\nThis works for the fractional knapsack. For 0/1 knapsack, it's not always optimal.\n\nHowever, since we are only dealing with weights 1 and 2, we can do better.\nLet `max_cost_for_capacity_w12[w]` be the maximum cost for capacity `w` using only weight 1 and 2 items.\nInitialize `max_cost_for_capacity_w12` with `0`s.\n`current_cost_sum = 0`\n`p1 = 0` (index for `costs_w1`)\n`p2 = 0` (index for `costs_w2`)\n\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `cost_if_w1 = costs_w1[p1]` if `p1 < len(costs_w1)` else `-1`\n  `cost_if_w2 = costs_w2[p2]` if `p2 < len(costs_w2)` and `w >= 2` else `-1`\n\n  If `cost_if_w1 == -1` and `cost_if_w2 == -1`:\n    `max_cost_for_capacity_w12[w] = current_cost_sum`\n    continue\n\n  `candidate_cost_w1 = current_cost_sum + cost_if_w1` if `cost_if_w1 != -1` else `-1`\n  `candidate_cost_w2 = current_cost_sum + cost_if_w2` if `cost_if_w2 != -1` else `-1`\n\n  // This is still not quite right. `current_cost_sum` is for `w-1` or `w-2`.\n  // We need to compare `dp[w-1] + c1` vs `dp[w-2] + c2`.\n  // But `c1` and `c2` should be the *next available* best items.\n  // This is the issue with standard DP for 0/1 knapsack when item values are not fixed.\n\nThe most common approach for this specific problem (weights 1, 2, 3) is to iterate over the count of the heaviest item type, and then use a \"two-pointer\" or \"merge-sort-like\" approach for the remaining two types.\nLet's iterate `k3` from `0` to `min(len(costs_w3), m // 3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `current_total_cost = P3[k3]`\n  `m_rem = m - k3 * 3`\n  Now, we need to find `max_cost_w12_for_m_rem`.\n  This `max_cost_w12_for_m_rem` can be computed by iterating `k2` from `0` to `min(len(costs_w2), m_rem // 2)`.\n  For each `k2`:\n    `cost_from_w2 = P2[k2]`\n    `m_rem_for_w1 = m_rem - 2*k2`\n    `cost_from_w1 = P1[min(len(costs_w1), m_rem_for_w1)]`\n    `max_cost_w12_for_m_rem = max(max_cost_w12_for_m_rem, cost_from_w2 + cost_from_w1)`\n  This is `O(m)` for each `k3`. Total `O(m^2)`.\n\nThe key to optimizing the `max_cost_w12` part:\nLet `f(k2) = P2[k2] + P1[min(len(costs_w1), m_rem - 2*k2)]`.\nWe need to find `max_{k2} f(k2)`.\nThis function `f(k2)` is the sum of an increasing concave function (`P2[k2]`) and a decreasing concave function (`P1[...]`).\nThe maximum of such a function can be found efficiently.\nThe maximum can be found by iterating `k2` from `0` to `min(len(costs_w2), m_rem // 2)`.\nThe values `P1[k]` are sums of sorted elements, so `P1[k] - P1[k-1] = costs_w1[k-1]`.\nSimilarly `P2[k] - P2[k-1] = costs_w2[k-1]`.\nWe can use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum for `P1[k1] + P2[k2]` with `k1 + 2k2 <= m_rem`.\nLet `k1_ptr = min(len(costs_w1), m_rem)`.\nLet `k2_ptr = 0`.\n`current_max_w12 = P1[k1_ptr]`.\nWhile `k2_ptr <= min(len(costs_w2), m_rem // 2)`:\n  `cost_for_this_k2 = P2[k2_ptr]`.\n  `remaining_capacity_for_w1 = m_rem - 2*k2_ptr`.\n  `k1_ptr = min(k1_ptr, len(costs_w1), remaining_capacity_for_w1)`.\n  `cost_for_this_k1 = P1[k1_ptr]`.\n  `current_max_w12 = max(current_max_w12, cost_for_this_k2 + cost_for_this_k1)`.\n  `k2_ptr += 1`.\nThis is still `O(m_rem)`.\n\nThe problem can be solved by iterating `k2` (number of weight 2 items) from `0` to `min(len(costs_w2), m // 2)`.\nFor each `k2`, calculate `P2[k2]`.\nRemaining capacity `m_rem = m - 2*k2`.\nWe now have `m_rem` capacity for weight 1 and weight 3 items.\nThis is the subproblem: `k1 + 3*k3 <= m_rem`.\nThis is again the same structure!\n\nThe crucial observation is that `m` is up to `300000`.\nIf we iterate `k3` from `0` to `min(len(costs_w3), m // 3)` (at most `10^5` iterations).\nFor each `k3`, we need to find `max_{k1, k2: k1 + 2*k2 <= m_rem} (P1[k1] + P2[k2])`.\nThis function `max_cost_w12(w)` can be precomputed in `O(m)` time.\nHow?\nLet `dp[w]` be the max cost for capacity `w` using only weight 1 and 2 items.\n`dp[w] = max(dp[w-1] + costs_w1[next_w1_idx], dp[w-2] + costs_w2[next_w2_idx])`.\nThis is not correct because `next_w1_idx` and `next_w2_idx` are not fixed.\n\nCorrect `O(M)` precomputation for `max_cost_w12[w]`:\nInitialize `max_cost_w12` array of size `m+1` with `0`.\n`p1 = 0` (index for `costs_w1`)\n`p2 = 0` (index for `costs_w2`)\n`current_cost = 0`\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `val_w1 = costs_w1[p1]` if `p1 < len(costs_w1)` else `-1`\n  `val_w2 = costs_w2[p2]` if `p2 < len(costs_w2)` else `-1`\n\n  If `val_w1 == -1` and `val_w2 == -1`: // No more items to pick\n    `max_cost_w12[w] = current_cost`\n    continue\n\n  `take_w1 = False`\n  If `val_w1 != -1`:\n    If `w == 1`: // Must take weight 1 if possible\n      `take_w1 = True`\n    Else if `val_w2 == -1`: // Only weight 1 items left\n      `take_w1 = True`\n    Else: // Compare taking 1 weight-1 item vs 1 weight-2 item\n      // The decision here is tricky.

But `val1` might have already been taken by `dp[w-1]`.\n\nThe correct `O(M)` precomputation for `max_cost_w12[w]` is:\nInitialize `max_cost_w12 = [0] * (m + 1)`.\n`p1 = 0` (pointer to next best weight 1 item)\n`p2 = 0` (pointer to next best weight 2 item)\n`current_cost = 0`\n\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `cost_w1_item = costs_w1[p1]` if `p1 < len(costs_w1)` else `-float('inf')`\n  `cost_w2_item = costs_w2[p2]` if `p2 < len(costs_w2)` else `-float('inf')`\n\n  // Compare taking a weight 1 item vs. taking a weight 2 item.\n  // Note: we can only take a weight 2 item if `w >= 2`.\n  // The value of taking two weight 1 items might be better than one weight 2 item.\n  // This is the tricky part.\n\nLet's consider the items:\nItems of weight 1: `c1_0, c1_1, c1_2, ...`\nItems of weight 2: `c2_0, c2_1, c2_2, ...`\n\nWe can create a single \"stream\" of items to pick from.\nAt each step, we decide whether to take:\n1.

If two items have the same cost, pick the one with lower weight. If a weight-2 item has cost `C2` and a weight-1 item has cost `C1`, and `C2 > C1`, then taking `C2` is better than taking `C1`. If `C1` is very high, taking `C1` is better.\nThis is exactly what the loop above does.
