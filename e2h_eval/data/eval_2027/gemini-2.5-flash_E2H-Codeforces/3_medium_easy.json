Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Thinking on Vanya and Lanterns**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to write a Python script for the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. The core of this problem is finding the smallest light radius (`d`) needed to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, with `n` lanterns at specific locations (`a_i`).  The key is that a lantern covers points within a distance `d` of its location.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem deeply. I need to sort the lantern positions, `a_i`, which simplifies the coverage analysis.  There are three main cases:\n\n1.  **The Start:** The leftmost part of the street (from 0 to the first lantern's position, `a_0`) must be covered.  This requires `d` to be at least `a_0`.\n2.  **The End:** Similarly, the rightmost part of the street (from the last lantern's position, `a_{n-1}`, to `l`) must be covered, meaning `d` must be at least `l - a_{n-1}`.\n3.  **The Gaps:**  The trickiest part is the gaps *between* the lanterns. For two consecutive lanterns at positions `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, we need to ensure their light reaches each other. That implies `d` must be at least half the distance between them: `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  I need to find the largest of these gaps.\n\nTherefore, the overall solution involves finding:\n\n*   `d_start = a_0`\n*   `d_end = l - a_{n-1}`\n*   `d_max_gap = max( (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 for i in range(0, n-1) )`\n\nThe final answer, the smallest radius, `d`, is the *maximum* of these three values: `d = max(d_start, d_end, d_max_gap)`. This will ensure that all parts of the street are lit. I need to be careful with integer division. Using float division makes sure I account for every possible light radius and prevents possible rounding errors in any intermediate steps.\n\nThe code will then:\n\n1.  Read the input: `n`, `l`, and the list of lantern positions `ai`.\n2.  Sort `ai`.\n3.  Calculate `d_start`, `d_end`, and `d_max_gap`.\n4.  Compute the overall `d`.\n5.  Print the answer with sufficient precision (at least 10 decimal places to satisfy the problem requirement).\n\nI'll also have to consider some edge cases. If there's only one lantern, I need to make sure the start and end of the street are still covered. The formula should work for that too. Or if all the lanterns are at the same point, the calculation for gaps should correctly result in the distance to the edge of the street.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns can light up an entire street of length `l`, from coordinate 0 to `l`. Each lantern `i` is located at `a_i` and lights up the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo find the minimum `d`, we need to consider all parts of the street that might be difficult to light and determine the `d` required for each. The overall `d` will be the maximum of these individual requirements.\n\nLet's first sort the lantern positions `a_i` in ascending order. Let the sorted positions be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n\nThere are three critical types of segments that need to be covered:\n\n1.  **The beginning of the street:** The segment `[0, a_0]` must be lit. The first lantern is at `a_0`. To cover the point `0`, its light must extend at least to `0`. This means `a_0 - d <= 0`, which implies `d >= a_0`. So, the minimum `d` required for the start of the street is `a_0`.\n\n2.  **The end of the street:** The segment `[a_{n-1}, l]` must be lit. The last lantern is at `a_{n-1}`. To cover the point `l`, its light must extend at least to `l`. This means `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`. So, the minimum `d` required for the end of the street is `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** For any two adjacent lanterns at `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the segment between `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` must be covered. The lantern at `a_i` covers up to `a_i + d`, and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` covers from `a_{i+1} - d`. For the entire segment `[a_i, a_{i+1}]` to be lit, these two coverage areas must meet or overlap. This means `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`. Rearranging this inequality, we get `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. We need to find the maximum `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` among all adjacent pairs to ensure the largest gap is covered.\n\nThe minimum `d` for the entire street to be lit must satisfy all three conditions simultaneously. Therefore, `d` must be the maximum of the `d` values calculated for each of these cases.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `l`.\n2.  Read the lantern positions `a_i` and store them in a list.\n3.  Sort the list `a` in ascending order.\n4.  Calculate `d_start = float(a[0])`.\n5.  Calculate `d_end = float(l - a[n-1])`.\n6.  Initialize `d_max_gap_between_lanterns = 0.0`.\n7.  Iterate from `i = 0` to `n-2` (to consider all adjacent pairs):\n    a. Calculate the gap between `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`: `gap = a[i+1] - a[i]`.\n    b. The required `d` for this specific gap is `float(gap) / 2.0`.\n    c. Update `d_max_gap_between_lanterns = max(d_max_gap_between_lanterns, float(gap) / 2.0)`.\n8.  The final minimum `d` is `max(d_start, d_end, d_max_gap_between_lanterns)`.\n9.  Print the result formatted to at least 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach covers all possible scenarios, including edge cases like `n=1` (where `d_max_gap_between_lanterns` remains 0, and `d` is correctly `max(a[0], l - a[0])`) and lanterns at the ends of the street.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and l from the first line of input\n    n_str, l_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(n_str)\n    l = int(l_str)\n\n    # Read the lantern positions from the second line of input\n    a_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = [int(x) for x in a_str]\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions to easily calculate distances and gaps\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Calculate the required 'd' for the start of the street\n    # The first lantern at a[0] must cover point 0.\n    # The distance needed is a[0] - 0 = a[0].\n    d_from_start = float(a[0])\n\n    # Calculate the required 'd' for the end of the street\n    # The last lantern at a[n-1] must cover point l.\n    # The distance needed is l - a[n-1].\n    d_from_end = float(l - a[n-1])\n\n    # Calculate the maximum required 'd' for gaps between adjacent lanterns\n    # For a gap between a[i] and a[i+1], the combined reach must cover the gap.\n    # Each lantern contributes 'd' to cover half the gap from its side.\n    # So, d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n    d_max_gap_between_lanterns = 0.0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        d_for_this_gap = float(gap) / 2.0\n        if d_for_this_gap > d_max_gap_between_lanterns:\n            d_max_gap_between_lanterns = d_for_this_gap\n\n    # The overall minimum 'd' is the maximum of all these required 'd' values.\n    # This ensures that the start, end, and all internal gaps are covered.\n    min_d = max(d_from_start, d_from_end, d_max_gap_between_lanterns)\n\n    # Print the result formatted to 10 decimal places for precision\n    print(f\"{min_d:.10f}\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
