He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing String Formation: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this string validation problem. The user wants a Python script to determine if a given string, let's call it `S`, conforms to a specific set of rules.  I need to break down the rules and figure out the optimal way to check them programmatically.\n\nFirst, the string has a very specific structure. It's essentially built in three steps, which I'll call the 'A', 'B', and 'C' steps.\n\n*   **A's step:**  The string *starts* with some number of 'a's. This number, which I'll call `count_a`, has to be at least one ('a's count >= 1). The string initially looks like `aaa...a`.\n*   **B's step:**  Then, we append some number of 'b's to the end. I'll call this number `count_b`, and it too must be at least one (`count_b >= 1`). Now, the string looks like `aaa...abbb...b`. Since we already know we have at least one 'a', and one 'b', we've satisfied that requirement, implicitly.\n*   **C's step:** Finally, we append some number of 'c's. This number, `count_c`, is the crucial part. It *must* be equal to either `count_a` or `count_b`, or even both, i.e., it can be equal to either.  The string is now `aaa...abbb...bccc...c`.\n\nSo, the string has these mandatory features:\n\n1.  It's just 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's.\n2.  There's at least one 'a'.\n3.  There's at least one 'b'.\n4.  There's at least one 'c'.\n5.  The 'c' count equals either the 'a' count or the 'b' count.\n\nThinking about the string's structure, I can see that it has to be in the `a...ab...bc...c` format.  This is key, all the 'a's together at the start, then all the 'b's, then the 'c's. No mixing allowed!\n\nOkay, so the most efficient approach is likely to iterate through the string, keeping track of the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c', and making sure the characters appear in the correct order.\n\nLet `S` be the input string and `n` its length.\n\nI think I need to figure out where the 'a's end and 'b's begin and where 'b's end and 'c's start.\n\nHere's how I envision the script working:\n\n*   I'll start with an index, `i`, pointing to the beginning of the string.\n*   **Step 1:** While `S[i]` is 'a', I'll increment `i` and count the 'a's (`count_a`). If `count_a` ends up as zero, I know it's invalid.\n*   **Step 2:** After the 'a's are counted, `i` now points to the first character that isn't 'a'. I'll then move the `i` pointer while `S[i]` is 'b', and count the 'b's (`count_b`).\n*   **Step 3:** The `i` pointer is now pointing to a 'c' or the end.  If it's not a 'c', it's invalid. From here, I'll count 'c's. Then I'll check if the condition of 'c' count equal to either 'a' count or 'b' count is satisfied.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Now, it's time to start coding this up.\n",
