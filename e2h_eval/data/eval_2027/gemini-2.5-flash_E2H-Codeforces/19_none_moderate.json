The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

We want to end up with `n - k` nodes.\n    # We can remove `k` nodes.\n    # The best `k` nodes to remove are those with the smallest indices.\n    # But we must ensure the remaining `n - k` nodes form a connected component.\n\n    # Consider the nodes `1, 2, ..., n`.\n    # We want to remove `k` nodes.\n    # Iterate `i` from 1 to `n`.\n    # If node `i` is a leaf (degree 1) in the current graph, and we still need to remove nodes (`removed_count < k`),\n    # then we can remove node `i`.\n    # If `i` is removed, decrement `degree[neighbor]` and potentially add `neighbor` to the candidates for removal.\n\n    # This is a standard greedy approach for finding the maximum weight connected subgraph in a tree.\n    # We want to find a connected subgraph of size `N_prime = n - k`.\n    # The nodes to keep are `N_prime` nodes.\n    # The nodes to remove are `k` nodes.\n    # We want to remove `k` nodes such that the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes is minimized.\n    # This means removing nodes with the smallest indices.\n\n    # Algorithm:\n    # 1. Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n    # 2. Initialize `is_removed` array to all `False`.\n    # 3. Calculate initial degrees for all nodes.\n    # 4. Create a min-priority queue `pq` to store nodes that are candidates for removal.\n    #    A node `u` is a candidate if `degree[u] == 1` (it's a leaf)\n    #    or if `u` is an isolated node (degree 0, but this won't happen initially in a tree).\n    #    Add all initial leaves to `pq`.\n    # 5. While `removed_count < k` and `pq` is not empty:\n    #    a. Extract the node `u` with the smallest index from `pq`.\n    #    b. If `is_removed[u]` is already `True`, continue (it might have been added multiple times or its neighbor was removed).\n    #    c. If `n - removed_count - 1 < n - k`, meaning if we remove `u`, the remaining number of nodes `n - removed_count - 1`\n    #       would be less than the target `n - k` (i.e., we would have fewer than `n - k` nodes left), then we cannot remove `u`.\n    #       In this case, `u` and any other nodes currently in `pq` (which are also leaves) must be part of the final `n-k` component.\n    #       So we stop. (This condition can be simplified: if `n - removed_count == n - k`, we have exactly `n-k` nodes left, so we cannot remove any more).\n    #    d. Mark `u` as removed: `is_removed[u] = True`.\n    #    e. Add `u` to `removed_nodes` list.\n    #    f. Increment `removed_count`.\n    #    g. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n    #       i. Decrement `degree[v]`.\n    #       ii. If `degree[v] == 1` and `not is_removed[v]`, add `v` to `pq`. (It becomes a new leaf).\n\n    # The condition `n - removed_count - 1 < n - k` is equivalent to `k - removed_count > 0` and `n - removed_count == n - k`.\n    # This means if `removed_count == k`, we stop.\n    # So the loop condition `while removed_count < k` already handles this.\n    # The critical part is that we must ensure the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component.\n    # The leaf-pruning strategy guarantees this: if we remove a leaf, the graph remains connected.\n    # We keep pruning leaves until `k` nodes are removed or no more leaves can be removed (because the remaining graph has exactly `n-k` nodes, or all remaining nodes are internal to the `n-k` component).\n\n    import heapq\n\n    current_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        current_degree[i] = len(adj[i])\n\n    pq = []  # Min-priority queue for (node_index)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if current_degree[i] == 1: # Initial leaves\n            heapq.heappush(pq, i)\n        elif current_degree[i] == 0 and n > 1: # Isolated node in a non-singleton graph, shouldn't happen for a tree\n            pass\n        elif current_degree[i] == 0 and n == 1: # Single node tree\n            if k == 0: # Keep it\n                pass\n            else: # Remove it\n                heapq.heappush(pq, i) # This case is not handled well by the leaf logic.\n                                      # For n=1, k=0, keep 1.
