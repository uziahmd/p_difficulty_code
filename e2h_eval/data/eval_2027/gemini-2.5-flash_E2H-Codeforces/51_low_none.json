Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Let's Tackle This \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and it seems straightforward enough. We're given two names, a guest and a host, and a pile of letters. The question is: can we form the pile exactly by combining the letters from the two names? Simple. I can see the core of the problem, and my expert intuition tells me this can be handled efficiently with character frequency analysis.\n\nFirst, I'll need to read in the input – three strings, each representing the guest name, host name, and the pile letters.  I'll then combine the guest and host names into a single string for easier processing. Counting character frequencies will be the key here.  I'm thinking `collections.Counter` in Python is the perfect tool for the job – elegant and efficient. It'll give me the counts of each letter in the combined name string and in the pile.\n\nAfter that, it's just a matter of comparing the two counters.  If they're identical – meaning the frequencies of each letter match – we can print \"YES\". Otherwise, it's a \"NO\". The lengths will automatically align if the letter frequencies do, so that's implicit.\n\nNow, let's break down the implementation step-by-step:\n1.  Import `Counter`.\n2.  Read the three strings using `input()`.\n3.  Concatenate guest and host names.\n4.  Create a `Counter` for the combined names.\n5.  Create a `Counter` for the pile letters.\n6.  Compare the counters.\n7.  Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on the comparison result.\n\nSeems solid. I'm going with `collections.Counter` and this step-by-step approach. It's a quick and reliable way to get this done. Let's code it up!\n",
