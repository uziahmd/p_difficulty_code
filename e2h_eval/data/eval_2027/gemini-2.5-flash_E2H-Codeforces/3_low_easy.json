Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vanya and Lanterns problem to tackle, and it's all about ensuring a street of length `l` is fully illuminated by `n` lanterns. Each lantern has a light radius, and I need to find the *minimum* radius needed for complete street coverage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We have a street from 0 to `l`, and the positions of the lanterns are given.  My strategy will be to figure out the maximum gaps between the lanterns, as well as the distances from the edges of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\nI'm thinking I'll sort the lantern positions, `a_i`, because the order they're in is critical to identifying the gaps. Let's call the sorted positions `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`. With the sorted positions, the problem simplifies into identifying the gaps, beginning and the end.\n\nNow, to ensure the street is lit, I have to consider a few key aspects:\n\n1.  **The Beginning:** The start of the street (position 0) must be lit. This means the leftmost lantern, `a_0`, must have a radius large enough to cover the segment up to 0. So, `d` must be greater than or equal to `a_0`.\n\n2.  **The End:** Similarly, the end of the street (position `l`) needs to be lit. The rightmost lantern, `a_{n-1}`, must cover the end. This leads to `d` being greater than or equal to `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **The Gaps:**  This is where things get interesting. I need to make sure there are no unlit segments *between* the lanterns. For any two adjacent lanterns, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, their lighting ranges must either overlap or touch.  This translates to `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. I'll have to find the maximum of these gap distances among all adjacent pairs.\n\nSo, to find the minimum `d`, I'll compute three things:\n\n*   `d_1 = a_0` (to light the beginning).\n*   `d_2 = l - a_{n-1}` (to light the end).\n*   `d_3 = max_gap / 2`, where `max_gap` is the largest distance between any two adjacent lanterns.\n\nThe final answer will be the largest of these three values: `d = max(d_1, d_2, d_3)`.  That should be the *minimum* radius that guarantees the entire street is illuminated. Time to code it up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns can light a street of length `l`. The street spans from coordinate `0` to `l`. Each lantern `i` is at position `a_i` and lights all points within distance `d` from it, meaning it lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo solve this, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Sort Lantern Positions:** It's crucial to know the relative positions of lanterns. Sorting the lantern positions `a_i` in ascending order simplifies finding gaps and determining coverage at the ends of the street. Let the sorted positions be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Maximum Gap Between Lanterns:**\n    For the street to be fully lit, there should be no unlit gaps between adjacent lanterns. Consider two adjacent lanterns at `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. The lantern at `a_i` lights up to `a_i + d`, and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` lights from `a_{i+1} - d`. For the segment between them to be fully covered, these two illuminated regions must meet or overlap. That is, `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`.\n    This implies `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.\n    We need to find the maximum `(a_{i+1} - a_i)` among all pairs of adjacent lanterns and divide it by 2. Let this maximum required radius be `d_gap`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Required Radius for Street Ends:**\n    *   **Beginning of the street (point 0):** The point `0` must be lit. This means there must be a lantern `a_j` such that `a_j - d <= 0`. To minimize `d`, we consider the lantern closest to `0`, which is `a_0` (the first lantern after sorting). So, `a_0 - d <= 0`, which implies `d >= a_0`. Let this be `d_start = a_0`.\n    *   **End of the street (point l):** The point `l` must be lit. This means there must be a lantern `a_k` such that `a_k + d >= l`. To minimize `d`, we consider the lantern closest to `l`, which is `a_{n-1}` (the last lantern after sorting). So, `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`. Let this be `d_end = l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n4.  **Determine Overall Minimum `d`:**\n    The minimum radius `d` must satisfy all these conditions simultaneously. Therefore, `d` must be the maximum of `d_gap`, `d_start`, and `d_end`.\n    `d = max(d_gap, d_start, d_end)`\n\n**Example 1:** `n=7, l=15`, `a = [15, 5, 3, 7, 9, 14, 0]`\n1.  **Sorted `a`:** `[0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]`\n2.  **`d_gap` (maximum gap between lanterns):**\n    *   `(3 - 0) / 2 = 1.5`\n    *   `(5 - 3) / 2 = 1.0`\n    *   `(7 - 5) / 2 = 1.0`\n    *   `(9 - 7) / 2 = 1.0`\n    *   `(14 - 9) / 2 = 2.5`\n    *   `(15 - 14) / 2 = 0.5`\n    `d_gap = max(1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5`\n3.  **`d_start` (for point 0):** `a_0 = 0`. So, `d_start = 0`.\n4.  **`d_end` (for point l):** `l - a_{n-1} = 15 - 15 = 0`. So, `d_end = 0`.\n5.  **Overall `d`:** `max(2.5, 0, 0) = 2.5`.\n\n**Example 2:** `n=2, l=5`, `a = [2, 5]`\n1.  **Sorted `a`:** `[2, 5]`\n2.  **`d_gap`:**\n    *   `(5 - 2) / 2 = 1.5`\n    `d_gap = 1.5`\n3.  **`d_start`:** `a_0 = 2`. So, `d_start = 2`.\n4.  **`d_end`:** `l - a_{n-1} = 5 - 5 = 0`. So, `d_end = 0`.\n5.  **Overall `d`:** `max(1.5, 2, 0) = 2.0`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Calculate the maximum distance between adjacent lanterns\n    # This determines the minimum d needed to cover the internal gaps\n    max_gap_between_lanterns = 0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        current_gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        if current_gap > max_gap_between_lanterns:\n            max_gap_between_lanterns = current_gap\n    \n    # The radius needed to cover the largest internal gap is half of that gap\n    d_from_gaps = max_gap_between_lanterns / 2.0\n\n    # Calculate the distance from the beginning of the street (point 0) to the first lantern\n    # This determines the minimum d needed to cover the start of the street\n    d_from_start = float(a[0])\n\n    # Calculate the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (point l)\n    # This determines the minimum d needed to cover the end of the street\n    d_from_end = float(l - a[n-1])\n\n    # The overall minimum radius d is the maximum of these three values\n    # We need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n    min_d = max(d_from_gaps, d_from_start, d_from_end)\n\n    # Print the result with required precision\n    print(f\"{min_d:.10f}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
