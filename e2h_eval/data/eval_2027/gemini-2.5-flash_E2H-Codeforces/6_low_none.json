Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem that's got me thinking. It's asking me to find two *disjoint* vouchers. \"Disjoint\" means they don't overlap, which is key. I need to find two of these vouchers, let's call them `i` and `j`, whose durations add up *exactly* to a given value, `x`. The goal is to minimize the combined cost of these two vouchers, `cost_i + cost_j`. If there's no suitable pair, I need to output -1.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the criteria: I have two distinct vouchers (i ≠ j) that don't overlap. That's `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i`. The total duration must be `x`: `(r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x`. Then, their cost has to be minimal.\n\nI initially thought a brute-force approach, checking every possible pair, would work. But the constraints, with `n` and `x` up to 2 * 10^5, quickly convinced me that O(N^2) would be a time-out. I need something much faster, ideally O(N log N) or O(N).\n\nLet's break it down further. Let's call the duration of voucher `k` `d_k = r_k - l_k + 1`. So, `d_i + d_j = x`. I need to ensure the vouchers are disjoint. If `i` comes before `j`, that means `r_i < l_j`, and the duration of `j` must be `x - d_i`.\n\nNow, if I fix voucher `i`, I'm looking for a `j` where `l_j > r_i`, `d_j = x - d_i`, and `cost_j` is minimal. That seems like I'm still stuck with a potential linear search over all the `j`'s. I need a trick to speed this up.\n\nSorting the vouchers might help. What should the sort key be? Departure time (`l_i`)? End time (`r_i`)? I'm thinking if I sort by `l_i`, that might allow me to keep track of already-considered vouchers in a way that helps me find suitable `j` values.\n\nThe strategy that's starting to emerge is this: iterate through each voucher `i`. For each one, I need to find a `j` where `d_j = x - d_i`. I'll call this `target_duration = x - d_i`. I'll need to somehow efficiently keep track of previously encountered vouchers to find a suitable `j` that's disjoint and has the required duration. That's the crux of this problem. I think I'm getting closer to a solution.\n",
