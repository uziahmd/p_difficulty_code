There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Tennis Tournament Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. The core of it is building a tournament grid with a specific rule about which players can face each other. Basically, I need to figure out how many games the ultimate winner can play, given the constraints.  Let me walk through my thought process.\n\nFirst, I'm trying to wrap my head around the rule: two players can only compete if the absolute difference in the number of games they've already played is no more than one. And, crucially, they both must have won all their games leading up to the match. This means the number of games played is essentially the same as the number of wins. That simplifies things a bit.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to *maximize* the number of games the tournament winner plays. So, I need to understand how the rule restricts the tournament's structure. I'm focusing on the winner's perspective. Let's call them Player 1 (P1).\n\nIf P1 wants to play, say, `k` games, they'll need `k` opponents. I'm trying to figure out the *minimum* number of players (`f(k)`) required to let P1 reach `k` games following the rule.\n\nI'm starting small. For `k=1`:  P1 plays against P2 (both with zero wins), P1 wins.  That's two players (`f(1) = 2`).\n\nFor `k=2`: After the first game, P1 has won one game, and needs another player.  Now, P1 can play against someone with either zero or one previous games. If P1 plays against P3 (with zero games), they need three players. Alternatively, they can play someone who has already won a match. That is, P3 must have won a game to some P4. This seems like it will lead to more players to keep the sequence going.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games.\n\nLet's denote `f(k)` as the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\nLet the winner be Player W.\n- To play 1 game: W plays an initial opponent. W wins. Total players needed: 2. So, `f(1) = 2`.\n- To play 2 games:\n    - W plays game 1 against Player A (both 0 games played). W wins. W has 1 game played.\n    - Now W (1 game played) needs to play game 2 against Player B. Player B must have 0 or 1 game played.\n        - If B has 0 games: W (1 game) vs B (0 games). W wins. Total players: W, A, B (3 players).\n        - If B has 1 game: This means B must have won a game against Player C. So, B (1 game) vs C (0 games). B wins. Then W (1 game) vs B (1 game). W wins. Total players: W, A, B, C (4 players).\n    To minimize players for 2 games, we choose the first option: W plays against an initial player, then against another initial player. So, `f(2) = 3`.\n\nThis doesn't seem right. The example for `n=4` says the answer is 2. If `f(2)=3`, then for `n=4`, a winner could play 2 games. This matches.\nThe example for `n=3` says the answer is 2. `f(2)=3` also matches this.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `f(k)` more formally. `f(k)` is the minimum number of players needed to produce a player who has won `k` games.\nA player who has won `k` games must have defeated an opponent who had won `k-1` or `k-2` games (to satisfy the `|diff| <= 1` rule, if the winner had `k-1` games).\nLet `P(k)` be the number of initial players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\nConsider the winner, Player W, who plays `k` games.\n- For the `k`-th game, W (who has won `k-1` games) plays against an opponent, say Player O.\n- Player O must have won either `k-1` or `k-2` games.\n- To minimize the total number of players, Player O should be produced with the minimum possible number of players.\n\nLet `N_k` be the minimum number of initial players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\n- `N_0 = 1` (a player who hasn't played yet).\n- To play 1 game: A player with 0 wins plays an opponent with 0 wins. The winner has 1 win.\n  `N_1 = N_0 + N_0 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n- To play 2 games: A player with 1 win plays an opponent. The opponent must have 0 or 1 win.\n  - If opponent has 0 wins: `N_2 = N_1 + N_0 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n  - If opponent has 1 win: `N_2 = N_1 + N_1 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n  To minimize players, we choose the first option: `N_2 = 3`.\n- To play 3 games: A player with 2 wins plays an opponent. The opponent must have 1 or 2 wins.\n  - If opponent has 1 win: `N_3 = N_2 + N_1 = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n  - If opponent has 2 wins: `N_3 = N_2 + N_2 = 3 + 3 = 6`.\n  To minimize players, we choose the first option: `N_3 = 5`.\n- To play 4 games: A player with 3 wins plays an opponent. The opponent must have 2 or 3 wins.\n  - If opponent has 2 wins: `N_4 = N_3 + N_2 = 5 + 3 = 8`.\n  - If opponent has 3 wins: `N_4 = N_3 + N_3 = 5 + 5 = 10`.\n  To minimize players, we choose the first option: `N_4 = 8`.\n\nThe sequence `N_k` is: `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...`\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence! Specifically, `N_k = F_{k+2}`, where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, ...`.\nSo, `N_k` represents the `(k+2)`-th Fibonacci number.\n`N_0 = F_2 = 1`\n`N_1 = F_3 = 2`\n`N_2 = F_4 = 3`\n`N_3 = F_5 = 5`\n`N_4 = F_6 = 8`\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `N_k <= n`.\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. We can generate them iteratively until they exceed `n`.\n\nLet's trace the example cases:\n- `n=2`:\n  `F_2=1`, `F_3=2`. `N_1 = F_3 = 2`. `k=1` is possible.\n  `F_4=3`. `N_2 = F_4 = 3`. `k=2` is not possible since `3 > 2`.\n  Max `k` is 1. Correct.\n- `n=3`:\n  `F_2=1`, `F_3=2`, `F_4=3`. `N_2 = F_4 = 3`. `k=2` is possible.\n  `F_5=5`. `N_3 = F_5 = 5`. `k=3` is not possible since `5 > 3`.\n  Max `k` is 2. Correct.\n- `n=4`:\n  `F_2=1`, `F_3=2`, `F_4=3`. `N_2 = F_4 = 3`. `k=2` is possible.\n  `F_5=5`. `N_3 = F_5 = 5`. `k=3` is not possible since `5 > 4`.\n  Max `k` is 2. Correct.\n- `n=10`:\n  `F_2=1`, `F_3=2`, `F_4=3`, `F_5=5`, `F_6=8`. `N_4 = F_6 = 8`. `k=4` is possible.\n  `F_7=13`. `N_5 = F_7 = 13`. `k=5` is not possible since `13 > 10`.\n  Max `k` is 4. Correct.\n\nThe logic holds for all examples.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Initialize `a = 1` (represents `F_2`, which is `N_0`)\n3. Initialize `b = 2` (represents `F_3`, which is `N_1`)\n4. Initialize `games = 1` (current maximum games for the winner, corresponding to `b`)\n5. If `n` is 2, the answer is 1. (Special case or handled by loop)\n6. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   `temp = b`\n   `b = a + b`\n   `a = temp`\n   `games += 1`\n7. The loop terminates when `b > n`. At this point, `games` holds the value `k+1` (because it was incremented one last time for `b` which became `> n`). So, the correct answer is `games - 1`.\n\nLet's trace `n=2`:\n`a=1, b=2, games=1`\nLoop condition `b <= n` (2 <= 2) is true.\n  `temp = 2`\n  `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `games = 1 + 1 = 2`\nLoop condition `b <= n` (3 <= 2) is false.\nReturn `games - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\nLet's trace `n=3`:\n`a=1, b=2, games=1`\nLoop condition `b <= n` (2 <= 3) is true.\n  `temp = 2`\n  `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `games = 1 + 1 = 2`\nLoop condition `b <= n` (3 <= 3) is true.\n  `temp = 3`\n  `b = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  `a = 3`\n  `games = 2 + 1 = 3`\nLoop condition `b <= n` (5 <= 3) is false.\nReturn `games - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. Correct.\n\nThe maximum `n` is `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. `F_90` is approximately `2.88 * 10^18`. So, the loop will run about 90 times, which is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # N_k = F_{k+2} where F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...\n    # We are looking for the maximum k such that F_{k+2} <= n.\n\n    # F_2 corresponds to N_0 (0 games played, 1 player)\n    # F_3 corresponds to N_1 (1 game played, 2 players)\n    # F_4 corresponds to N_2 (2 games played, 3 players)\n\n    # Let's use two variables to store the last two Fibonacci numbers\n    # a will store F_i, b will store F_{i+1}\n    # We start with F_2 and F_3, which are 1 and 2.\n    # These correspond to N_0 and N_1.\n    \n    # current_fib_val_for_k_minus_1_games = F_{k+1}\n    # current_fib_val_for_k_games = F_{k+2}\n    \n    # Initialize for k=1.
