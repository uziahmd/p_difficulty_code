Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Decoding Sequences from Morse Code Substrings**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. I'm given a string `S` that's built incrementally by appending '0's and '1's. The goal is to count the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding any substring of `S`, after each append operation. We're working with Morse code, where dots are '0's and dashes are '1's, and valid codes have lengths 1 to 4, excluding four specific invalid combinations.\n\nMy initial thought is that I need an efficient solution because `S` can grow quite large.  A brute-force approach, checking all possible substrings and decoding them, would be too slow. So, I need a dynamic programming solution.\n\nMy strategy involves using a `dp` array. I'll define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the substring `S[i...k-1]`, where `k` is the current length of `S`. I initialize `dp[k]` to 1 to represent the empty sequence. Then, I iterate backwards from `k-1` to `0`, calculating each `dp[i]` based on valid Morse code substrings ending at index `i`.  This boils down to checking if substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at index i are valid codes, and summing the `dp` values from those positions.\n\nI'm keeping track of the total number of valid sequences. So, with each append, I calculate the `dp` array for the newly updated string and add the total count to my running sum. This approach ensures I'm considering all substrings by only summing up all values in the final `dp` array.\nThe algorithm iterates over the input string, checking each substring of length 1 to 4 for a total O(m^2) complexity. This solution seems promising.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding substrings of a string `S`. The string `S` is initially empty and grows by appending one character ('0' for dot, '1' for dash) at a time. We need to report the total count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended.\n\n**Morse Code Rules:**\n*   English letters are represented by strings of '0's and '1's (dots and dashes).\n*   Valid Morse codes have lengths from 1 to 4.\n*   There are 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30 such strings.\n*   Four specific strings are *invalid* (do not correspond to any English letter): \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n*   All other 26 strings of length 1 to 4 are valid and correspond to distinct English letters.\n\n**Decoding a Substring:**\nA substring `sub` can be decoded into a sequence of English letters if `sub` can be partitioned into `c_1 c_2 ... c_p`, where each `c_i` is a valid Morse code. For example, if \"1\" decodes to 'T', \"11\" to 'M', and \"111\" to 'O', then the substring \"111\" can be decoded into:\n*   \"O\" (using \"111\" as one code)\n*   \"TM\" (using \"1\" then \"11\")\n*   \"MT\" (using \"11\" then \"1\")\n*   \"TTT\" (using \"1\" then \"1\" then \"1\")\nThese are four distinct sequences and should all be counted.\n\n**Approach:**\nLet `S` be the current string after `k` appends. We need to find the sum of `f(sub)` for all non-empty substrings `sub` of `S`, where `f(sub)` is the number of ways `sub` can be decoded into a sequence of English letters.\n\nWhen a new character `char_k` is appended to `S`, increasing its length from `k-1` to `k`, we need to update the total count. The new contributions to the total count come from all substrings of `S` that end at the newly appended character (index `k-1`). These are `S[0...k-1]`, `S[1...k-1]`, ..., `S[k-1...k-1]`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to decode the suffix `S[i...k-1]` (the substring of `S` starting at index `i` and ending at index `k-1`).\nTo calculate `dp[i]`:\n*   `dp[k] = 1` (An empty string, `S[k...k-1]`, can be decoded in one way: an empty sequence of letters).\n*   For `i` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[i] = 0`\n    For each possible Morse code length `l` (from 1 to 4):\n        If the substring `S[i...i+l-1]` is a valid Morse code:\n            `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+l]) % MOD`\n    (Here, `dp[i+l]` represents the number of ways to decode the *remaining* part of the suffix `S[i...k-1]` after `S[i...i+l-1]` has been decoded as the first letter.)\n\nAfter computing all `dp[i]` values for `i` from `k-1` down to `0`, the total number of sequences for the current string `S` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`. This is because each `dp[i]` represents `f(S[i...k-1])`, and we need to sum `f(sub)` for all substrings `sub` of `S`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  Initialize `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n2.  Define `INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n3.  Create an empty list `S_list` to store the characters of `S` (using a list allows efficient appends).\n4.  Create an empty list `results` to store the answer after each modification.\n5.  Loop `m` times:\n    a.  Read the next character (`'0'` or `'1'`).\n    b.  Append the character to `S_list`.\n    c.  Let `current_len` be the new length of `S_list`.\n    d.  Initialize `dp = [0] * (current_len + 1)`.\n    e.  Set `dp[current_len] = 1` (base case for empty suffix).\n    f.  Initialize `current_total_sequences = 0`.\n    g.  Loop `i` from `current_len - 1` down to `0`:\n        i.  Loop `l` from `1` to `4`:\n            If `i + l <= current_len` (meaning `S_list[i...i+l-1]` is a valid substring):\n                Construct `sub = \"\".join(S_list[i : i+l])`.\n                If `sub` is not in `INVALID_CODES`:\n                    `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+l]) % MOD`.\n        ii. Add `dp[i]` to `current_total_sequences`:\n            `current_total_sequences = (current_total_sequences + dp[i]) % MOD`.\n    h.  Append `current_total_sequences` to `results`.\n6.  Print each value in `results`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   The outer loop runs `m` times (for each character appended).\n*   Inside the outer loop:\n    *   The `dp` array is initialized and filled. The `i` loop runs `current_len` times (up to `m`).\n    *   The `l` loop runs 4 times (constant).\n    *   String `sub` creation using `\"\".join(S_list[i : i+l])` takes `O(l)` time, which is `O(1)` since `l <= 4`.\n    *   Checking `is_valid_code` is `O(1)` (set lookup).\n*   Total time complexity: `O(m * m * 4 * 1) = O(m^2)`.\n*   Given `m <= 3000`, `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`, which is efficient enough for the typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second).\n*   Space complexity: `O(m)` for `S_list` and `dp` array.\n\n**Example Trace (S = \"111\"):**\n*   **k=1, S_list = [\"1\"]**:\n    *   `current_len = 1`. `dp = [0, 1]`. `current_total_sequences = 0`.\n    *   `i = 0`:\n        *   `l = 1`: `sub = \"1\"`.
