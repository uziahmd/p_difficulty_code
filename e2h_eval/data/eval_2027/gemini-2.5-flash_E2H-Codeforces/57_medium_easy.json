His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this competitive programming problem and my thought process.**  I need to write a Python script to figure out the best and worst possible rank Vasya can get in an Olympiad.  I'm given his minimum total score and the scores of all participants in two rounds, but not who got which score.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and the goal. I have *n* participants, Vasya's minimum score *x*, and two lists of scores, *a* and *b*, for each round. The output needs to be Vasya's best and worst ranks. The ranking is based on the sum of scores in descending order, with ties decided by the jury.  Crucially, I *don't* know which score in list *a* and which in *b* belong to Vasya, just that there *is* a combination that gives him at least *x*.\n\nThe core insight is that since we only have the *sums* of the scores, the actual assignments don't matter. The lists *a* and *b* are just bags of scores.  We are trying to find the best/worst rank for *Vasya*, who *is* a participant, and so can be matched with any score from list *a* and any score from list *b*, as long as each score is paired only once.\n\nSo, let's rephrase the problem. We have two sets of scores and have to make *n* pairs of scores such that each score from both lists are used exactly once. One of those pairs will be Vasya's score, and that sum needs to be at least *x*.  We want to find the possible ranks Vasya could have.\n\n**Best Rank:**\n\nI start by thinking about the best-case scenario for Vasya: how can he get the *best* rank? That means minimizing the rank number (ideally, getting 1). To do this, I need to maximize his score relative to everyone else. The highest score he *can* get is the sum of the highest score from *a* with the highest score from *b*. Since it's guaranteed that some pairing results in >= *x*, then if we pair the largest from *a* with the largest from *b*, and the result is >= x, then Vasya is in the best position.  If we sort both lists, and assign the largest scores to Vasya, it results in his best possible score.  No one else can have a higher total, so he'll always be ranked first, even if some have equal sums, due to the \"jury decides\" rule, so his best possible rank is always 1.\n\n**Worst Rank:**\n\nNow, to get the *worst* rank (the largest number), I have to minimize his score *while still* having the score be >= *x*, and simultaneously make everyone else have high scores to maximize the number of people with at least as much.  This means Vasya needs the lowest score that's still >= *x*. To make others score high, I need to make pairs such that as many as possible have sums greater than or equal to Vasya.  This sounds tricky, but the key is that sorting the input helps.\n\nI need to find a scoring for Vasya, say *S_V*, that's as small as possible while still >= *x*, and that then maximizes how many others can achieve that total. I have the sorted arrays, and need to construct all the possible pairs. To get the worst rank, I need to maximize how many pairs have a total greater than or equal to *S_V*. So I use the two-pointer greedy approach, sorting both *a* and *b*.\n\nThe key is in finding the *minimum* score *S_V* such that *S_V* >= *x*.\n\nOnce I have that minimum score, the \"worst rank\" is the maximum possible number of competitors (including Vasya) who can have a sum of scores greater than or equal to *S_V*. I call it `count_ge(S)`.\n\nNow I can use this minimum score to calculate the final number. To maximize how many have a score as high as possible, the sorted list of sums works, and this number is indeed the worst rank.\n\nI need to sort the two lists, find the minimum sum, then go through the two pointers to see how many players (including Vasya) have equal or more than that minimum score to calculate the worst rank. Since I'm using bisect and a two-pointer approach, the logic should have the right complexity for large inputs, and the solution should work correctly.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad. We are given the number of participants `n`, Vasya's minimum total score `x`, and two lists of `n` scores each for the first and second tours (`a` and `b`). The key challenge is that we don't know which participant got which score, only that Vasya is one of the participants and his total score is at least `x`.\n\n**Best Possible Rank:**\n\nTo achieve the best rank (smallest numerical value, i.e., 1st place), Vasya needs to maximize his total score and ensure no one else has a strictly higher score.\nThe maximum possible score any participant can get is `max(a) + max(b)`.\nThe problem guarantees that there exist `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Since `max(a) >= a_i` and `max(b) >= b_j`, it must be that `max(a) + max(b) >= a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThis means Vasya *can* achieve the score `max(a) + max(b)`. If he does, no other participant can achieve a strictly higher score. Due to the \"jury decides\" rule for ties, Vasya can be placed first among anyone with the same top score.\nTherefore, Vasya's best possible rank is always **1**.\n\n**Worst Possible Rank:**\n\nTo achieve the worst rank (largest numerical value), we need to:\n1.  Assume Vasya achieved the lowest possible total score `S_V` such that `S_V >= x`.\n2.  Maximize the number of other participants who score at least `S_V`.\nVasya's worst rank will be `1 + (number of people with strictly higher scores) + (number of people with same score as Vasya, excluding Vasya)`. This is equivalent to the total number of people (including Vasya) who score at least `S_V`, assuming we can arrange the pairings optimally to maximize this count.\n\nLet's break this down into steps:\n\n**Step 1: Determine Vasya's minimum possible score `S_min_vasya` such that `S_min_vasya >= x`.**\nTo find `S_min_vasya`, we need to consider all possible pairings `(a_i, b_j)`. For each `a_i`, we want to find the smallest `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. This means `b_j >= x - a_i`.\n1.  Sort array `a` in ascending order.\n2.  Sort array `b` in ascending order.\n3.  Initialize `S_min_vasya = infinity`.\n4.  For each `val_a` in `a`:\n    a.  Calculate the minimum required score from tour 2: `target_b = x - val_a`.\n    b.  Use binary search (`bisect_left`) on the sorted array `b` to find the smallest `b_j` that is greater than or equal to `target_b`. Let its index be `idx`.\n    c.  If such a `b_j` exists (i.e., `idx < n`), then `val_a + b[idx]` is a candidate for Vasya's score. Update `S_min_vasya = min(S_min_vasya, val_a + b[idx])`.\nAfter iterating through all `val_a`, `S_min_vasya` will hold the minimum total score Vasya could possibly get while satisfying `S_V >= x`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of participants who can score at least `S_min_vasya`.**\nThis count will be Vasya's worst rank. We want to form as many pairs `(a_i, b_j)` as possible such that their sum `a_i + b_j >= S_min_vasya`.\nThis can be solved using a two-pointer approach:\n1.  Ensure `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order (as they were from Step 1).\n2.  Initialize `worst_rank_count = 0`.\n3.  Initialize two pointers: `ptr_a = 0` (for array `a`, starting from the smallest element) and `ptr_b = n - 1` (for array `b`, starting from the largest element).\n4.  While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n    a.  If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_min_vasya`:\n        This pair `(a[ptr_a], b[ptr_b])` can achieve at least `S_min_vasya`. We count this as one participant. To maximize the number of such pairs, we use the smallest available `a` (`a[ptr_a]`) and the largest available `b` (`b[ptr_b]`).\n        Increment `worst_rank_count`.\n        Move `ptr_a` forward (`ptr_a += 1`) and `ptr_b` backward (`ptr_b -= 1`).\n    b.  Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < S_min_vasya`):\n        The current `a[ptr_a]` (the smallest available `a`) combined with `b[ptr_b]` (the largest available `b`) is not enough to reach `S_min_vasya`. This means `a[ptr_a]` cannot form a pair summing to `S_min_vasya` or more with any of the remaining `b` values (since `b` elements to the left of `ptr_b` are even smaller). So, `a[ptr_a]` must be paired with some `b_k` to form a sum less than `S_min_vasya`. We effectively discard `a[ptr_a]` for the purpose of forming high-scoring pairs.\n        Move `ptr_a` forward (`ptr_a += 1`).\n5.  The final `worst_rank_count` is Vasya's worst possible rank.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Sample):**\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\n**Best Rank:** 1 (as explained above).\n\n**Worst Rank:**\n1.  **Sort `a` and `b` (ascending):**\n    `a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n    `b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n2.  **Find `S_min_vasya`:**\n    -   For `a[0]=3`: `target_b = 7 - 3 = 4`. `bisect_left(b, 4)` is at index 2 (`b[2]=4`). Candidate sum: `3 + 4 = 7`. `S_min_vasya = 7`.\n    -   For `a[1]=4`: `target_b = 7 - 4 = 3`. `bisect_left(b, 3)` is at index 1 (`b[1]=3`). Candidate sum: `4 + 3 = 7`. `S_min_vasya = min(7, 7) = 7`.\n    -   ... (similarly for other `a_i` values, `S_min_vasya` remains 7).\n    So, `S_min_vasya = 7`.\n\n3.  **Calculate `worst_rank_count` for `S_min_vasya = 7`:**\n    `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 5`, `worst_rank_count = 0`\n    -   `a[0] + b[5] = 3 + 8 = 11`. `11 >= 7`. `worst_rank_count = 1`. `ptr_a = 1`, `ptr_b = 4`.\n    -   `a[1] + b[4] = 4 + 6 = 10`. `10 >= 7`. `worst_rank_count = 2`. `ptr_a = 2`, `ptr_b = 3`.\n    -   `a[2] + b[3] = 4 + 4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `worst_rank_count = 3`. `ptr_a = 3`, `ptr_b = 2`.\n    -   `a[3] + b[2] = 4 + 4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `worst_rank_count = 4`. `ptr_a = 4`, `ptr_b = 1`.\n    -   `a[4] + b[1] = 5 + 3 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `worst_rank_count = 5`. `ptr_a = 5`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n    -   `a[5] + b[0] = 6 + 0 = 6`. `6 < 7`. `ptr_a = 6`.\n    Loop terminates (`ptr_a` is no longer `< n`).\n    The worst rank is `5`.\n\nOutput: `1 5`.\n\nThis approach is efficient: sorting takes `O(N log N)`, finding `S_min_vasya` takes `O(N log N)` (N binary searches), and counting `worst_rank_count` takes `O(N)`. The total time complexity is `O(N log N)`, which is suitable for `N = 10^5`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank is always 1.\n    # Vasya can be assigned the largest score from tour 1 and largest score from tour 2.\n    # The problem guarantees that at least one pair (a_i, b_j) sums to >= x.\n    # Since max(a) >= a_i and max(b) >= b_j, it implies max(a) + max(b) >= x.\n    # As max(a) + max(b) is the highest possible total score, Vasya can achieve it.\n    # With ties decided by the jury, he can always be placed first.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst rank calculation\n    # To find the worst rank, we want to:\n    # 1.
