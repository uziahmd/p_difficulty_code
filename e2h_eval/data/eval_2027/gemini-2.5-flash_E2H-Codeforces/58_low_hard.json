You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Odd Cycle Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the minimum edges needed to make an odd cycle in a graph, along with the count of those ways. My initial thought is to zero in on the core property: a graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it's not bipartite. That's my starting point.\n\nIf the graph *already* has an odd cycle, the answer's straightforward: I don't need to add any edges (`t = 0`), and there's only one way to achieve this (doing nothing, so `w = 1`). I can quickly determine this by checking the graph's bipartiteness. I'll iterate through its connected components, trying a 2-coloring scheme via BFS or DFS. If I hit an edge connecting vertices of the same color within a component, that means I've got a non-bipartite component and I'm done.\n\nIf the graph *is* bipartite, then `t` must be greater than zero. To create that odd cycle, I have to introduce new edges. I need to consider two cases that can lead to an odd cycle. First, adding an edge within a bipartite component, connecting vertices that are in the same partition set. Second, connecting different components to form an odd cycle.\n\nNow, if the graph is bipartite, I can assume each connected component is also bipartite. To form an odd cycle, I need to add an edge connecting vertices that are in the same partition set within the same component. If I can add a single edge to any of the components to make it non-bipartite, I've got `t = 1`.\n\nThe crucial thing here is calculating `w`. For `t = 1`, it's all about counting the ways I can select two vertices within the *same* partition of a component and add an edge. So, I need to sum the number of ways to pick two vertices from each `L_i` and each `R_i` across all bipartite components.  This translates to `|L_i| * (|L_i| - 1) / 2` for each `L_i` and `|R_i| * (|R_i| - 1) / 2` for each `R_i`, summing those values for all components. I think this should give me the correct value for `w` when `t = 1`. I need to make sure that the added edge is not already present, but the structure of a bipartite graph guarantees this is not the case.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so. The graph is undirected, without parallel edges or loops.\n\nAn undirected graph contains an odd-length cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. This is the key property we will use. We can check if a graph (or its connected components) is bipartite using a 2-coloring algorithm (BFS or DFS).\n\nLet's maintain a `color` array (e.g., 0 for uncolored, 1 for color A, 2 for color B).\nWhen traversing a connected component:\n1. Start BFS/DFS from an uncolored vertex, assign it color A.\n2. For each neighbor `v` of the current vertex `u`:\n   a. If `v` is uncolored, assign it the opposite color of `u` and continue traversal.\n   b. If `v` is colored and has the same color as `u`, then we have found an edge connecting two vertices of the same color. This means the component is not bipartite and contains an odd cycle. We can stop checking this component.\n   c. If `v` is colored and has the opposite color of `u`, it's consistent with bipartiteness, continue.\n\nWe will iterate through all vertices. If a vertex hasn't been visited (colored), it means it belongs to a new connected component. We start a BFS/DFS from it.\n\nLet's define `t` and `w` based on the graph's properties:\n\n**Case 1: The graph already contains an odd cycle.**\nIf, during the 2-coloring process for any connected component, we find an edge connecting two vertices of the same color, then the graph already contains an odd cycle.\nIn this case, `t = 0` and `w = 1` (there's one way: add no edges).\n\n**Case 2: The graph is bipartite (all connected components are bipartite).**\nIf all connected components are bipartite, we need to add edges to form an odd cycle.\nFor each bipartite component, the 2-coloring process will assign vertices to two disjoint sets, say `L` and `R`. Any existing edge connects a vertex in `L` to a vertex in `R`.\n\n**Subcase 2.1: `t = 1`**\nWe can form an odd cycle by adding a single edge if we can connect two vertices within the same partition set (`L` or `R`) of *any* bipartite connected component.\nFor example, if we add an edge `(u, v)` where `u, v \\in L_i` (both in the left partition of component `i`), this creates an odd cycle. The length of this cycle will be `2k+1` for some `k \\ge 1`.\nThe number of ways to do this is the sum, over all bipartite components `C_i` with partitions `L_i` and `R_i`, of:\n`(|L_i| * (|L_i| - 1) / 2)` (ways to choose 2 distinct vertices from `L_i`)\n`+ (|R_i| * (|R_i| - 1) / 2)` (ways to choose 2 distinct vertices from `R_i`)\nIf this sum is greater than 0, then `t = 1` and `w` is this sum.\n\n**Subcase 2.2: `t = 2`**\nIf `t` is not 0 or 1, it must be at least 2.\nThis happens if all connected components are bipartite, AND for every bipartite component `C_i`, `|L_i| < 2` and `|R_i| < 2`. This means all bipartite components are either single vertices (`|L_i|=1, |R_i|=0` or vice versa) or single edges (`|L_i|=1, |R_i|=1`). In such a graph, adding a single edge within any component is impossible or creates an even cycle (if connecting two isolated vertices).\nTo form an odd cycle with `t=2`, we can connect two *different* bipartite components.\nSuppose we have two bipartite components `C_i` and `C_j`. We can add two edges `(u, v)` and `(v, w)` such that `u \\in L_i`, `v \\in R_i`, and `w \\in L_j`. This doesn't necessarily form an odd cycle.\nA simpler way to form an odd cycle with `t=2` is to take two vertices `u, v` from different components `C_i` and `C_j`. Add an edge `(u,v)`. Now `C_i` and `C_j` are merged into a larger bipartite component. We then need to add another edge within this new component to make it non-bipartite. This requires `t=1` for the first edge and `t=1` for the second edge. So, this path is not optimal for `t=2`.\n\nConsider forming an odd cycle by connecting multiple components.\nIf we add an edge `(u, v)` where `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j` (different components), this merges `C_i` and `C_j` into a larger component. If both `C_i` and `C_j` are bipartite, the merged component will also be bipartite.\nTo form an odd cycle, we need to add an edge between vertices of the same partition.\nIf we have `k` components, and we add `k-1` edges to connect them all into a single component, this new component will still be bipartite. Then we need one more edge (total `k` edges) to make it non-bipartite.\nThis means `t` can be `1` (within component), `2` (connect two components, then add an edge within one of them), or `3` (connect three components in a cycle).\n\nLet's re-evaluate `t=2`.\nIf we have at least two bipartite components, say `C_1` and `C_2`. Let `u_1 \\in L_1`, `v_1 \\in R_1`, `u_2 \\in L_2`.\nWe can add an edge `(u_1, u_2)`. Now `C_1` and `C_2` are merged. Let's say `u_1` keeps color A, `u_2` gets color B.\nThen we need to add another edge to form an odd cycle. This means connecting two vertices of same color in the merged component.\nFor example, if we add `(v_1, u_2)`. The path `u_1 - v_1 - u_2 - u_1` is a cycle.\nThe edge `(u_1, u_2)` connects `L_1` to `L_2`. The edge `(v_1, u_2)` connects `R_1` to `L_2`.\nThe vertices `u_1, v_1` are in `C_1`. The vertices `u_2` is in `C_2`.\nPath `u_1 - ... - v_1` has odd length in `C_1`.\nPath `u_2` is just a vertex.\nIf we add `(u_1, u_2)` and `(v_1, u_2)`. The cycle `u_1 - u_2 - v_1 - u_1` is formed.\nThe length of this cycle is `dist(u_1, v_1) + 2`. If `dist(u_1, v_1)` is odd, then `dist(u_1, v_1) + 2` is also odd.\n`dist(u_1, v_1)` is always odd if `u_1 \\in L_1, v_1 \\in R_1` and they are connected in `C_1`.\nSo, if we pick an edge `(u_1, v_1)` from `C_1` and an isolated vertex `u_2` from `C_2` (or any vertex from `C_2`), we can add edges `(u_1, u_2)` and `(v_1, u_2)`. This creates an odd cycle `u_1 - u_2 - v_1 - u_1` of length 3. This requires `t=2`.\nThe number of ways `w` for `t=2` would be:\nSum over all pairs of distinct bipartite components `C_i, C_j`:\n`|E_i| * |V_j|` where `E_i` is the set of edges in `C_i` and `V_j` is the set of vertices in `C_j`.\nThis counts choosing an edge `(u_1, v_1)` from `C_i` and a vertex `u_2` from `C_j` to form a cycle `u_1 - u_2 - v_1 - u_1`.\nThe vertices `u_1, v_1, u_2` must be distinct. This is guaranteed if `C_i` and `C_j` are distinct components.\nSo, `w = \\sum_{i \\ne j} |E_i| \\cdot |V_j|`. This sum is over ordered pairs `(i, j)`. If we want unordered pairs, we divide by 2 or sum `|E_i| \\cdot |V_j|` for `i < j` and `|E_j| \\cdot |V_i|` for `i < j`.\nTotal number of vertices `N`. Total number of edges `M`.\nLet `num_edges_in_comp[k]` be the number of edges in component `k`.\nLet `num_vertices_in_comp[k]` be the number of vertices in component `k`.\n`w = \\sum_{k=1}^{num\\_bipartite\\_components} \\sum_{l=k+1}^{num\\_bipartite\\_components} (num\\_edges\\_in\\_comp[k] \\cdot num\\_vertices\\_in\\_comp[l] + num\\_edges\\_in\\_comp[l] \\cdot num\\_vertices\\_in\\_comp[k])`\n\nThis formula for `w` can be simplified.\nLet `S_V = \\sum |V_i|` (total vertices in bipartite components) and `S_E = \\sum |E_i|` (total edges in bipartite components).\nThen `w = \\sum_{i < j} (|E_i| \\cdot |V_j| + |E_j| \\cdot |V_i|)`\n`w = \\sum_{i \\ne j} |E_i| \\cdot |V_j|` (sum over ordered pairs)\n`w = \\sum_i |E_i| \\sum_{j \\ne i} |V_j|`\n`w = \\sum_i |E_i| (S_V - |V_i|)`\n`w = S_E \\cdot S_V - \\sum_i |E_i| \\cdot |V_i|`\nThis is for `t=2`. This is only applicable if `t=0` and `t=1` cases are not met.\nThis strategy requires at least two bipartite components, and each component must have at least one edge. If all components are isolated vertices, `t=2` is not possible this way.\n\n**Subcase 2.3: `t = 3`**\nIf `t` is not 0, 1, or 2, it must be at least 3.\nThis happens if all components are bipartite, AND `t=1` ways are 0 (all components are isolated vertices or single edges), AND `t=2` ways are 0 (no two components both have edges).\nThis implies all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\nIf `t=1` and `t=2` ways are 0, it means:\n1. For all components `C_i`, `|L_i| < 2` and `|R_i| < 2`. (So `t=1` ways are 0).\n2. `S_E \\cdot S_V - \\sum |E_i| \\cdot |V_i| = 0`. This implies either `S_E=0` (all components are isolated vertices) or `S_V=0` (not possible as `N>=1`). So `S_E=0`.\nIf `S_E = 0`, it means all `m=0` edges initially. All `n` vertices are isolated.\nIn this scenario, we have `n` connected components, each consisting of a single vertex.\nTo form an odd cycle, we need at least 3 vertices. We can pick any 3 distinct vertices, say `v_1, v_2, v_3`, and add edges `(v_1, v_2)`, `(v_2, v_3)`, `(v_3, v_1)`. This forms a cycle of length 3.\nThis requires `t = 3`.\nThe number of ways `w` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6` (number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices).\nThis is only possible if `n >= 3`. If `n < 3`, it's impossible to form a cycle of length 3. The problem statement says \"consisting of more than one vertex\". Smallest odd cycle is 3. So `n` must be at least 3.\n\n**Summary of logic:**\n\n1.  Initialize `t = -1`, `w = -1`. `is_odd_cycle_present = False`.\n2.  Initialize `color` array for all vertices to 0 (uncolored).\n3.  Initialize `bipartite_components_info` list to store `(num_vertices, num_edges, L_size, R_size)` for each bipartite component.\n4.  Iterate `u` from `1` to `n`:\n    If `u` is uncolored:\n    a.  Start BFS from `u`. `current_component_vertices = 0`, `current_component_edges = 0`, `L_count = 0`, `R_count = 0`.\n    b.  Use a queue for BFS. Add `(u, 1)` (vertex `u`, color 1) to queue. `color[u] = 1`. `L_count = 1`. `current_component_vertices = 1`.\n    c.  `component_is_bipartite = True`.\n    d.  While queue is not empty:\n        Pop `(curr_u, curr_color)` from queue.\n        For each neighbor `v` of `curr_u`:\n            `current_component_edges` increments (each edge counted twice, once for `u-v` and once for `v-u`).\n            If `v` is uncolored:\n                `color[v] = 3 - curr_color` (assign opposite color).\n                If `color[v] == 1`: `L_count++`. Else: `R_count++`.\n                `current_component_vertices++`.\n                Add `(v, color[v])` to queue.\n            Else if `color[v] == curr_color`:\n                `component_is_bipartite = False`.\n                `is_odd_cycle_present = True`.\n                Break from inner loop (neighbors).\n        If not `component_is_bipartite`: Break from outer loop (queue).\n    e.  After BFS for this component:\n        `current_component_edges /= 2` (since each edge was counted twice).\n        If `is_odd_cycle_present`: Set `t = 0`, `w = 1`, and break from outer loop (iterating `u`).\n        Else (`component_is_bipartite` is true): Add `(current_component_vertices, current_component_edges, L_count, R_count)` to `bipartite_components_info`.\n\n5.

Print and exit.\n            Else (`n < 3`):\n                This case should not happen based on problem constraints (cycle must have >1 vertex, smallest odd cycle is 3, so `n` must be at least 3 for `t=3`). If `n < 3` and we reach here, it implies no odd cycle can be formed. The problem statement guarantees a solution exists implicitly by asking for `t` and `w`. For `n=1,2`, `t=3` is impossible.\n                However, for $N \\ge 1$, we always have $N \\choose 3$ ways to pick 3 vertices. If $N < 3$, this is 0. So $w=0$ if $N<3$.\n                The problem implies a solution always exists. The smallest graph requiring 3 edges is 3 isolated vertices.\n\nLet's refine the BFS to collect component info:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v = map(int, input().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    color = [0] * (n + 1) # 0: uncolored, 1: color A, 2: color B\n    is_odd_cycle_present = False\n    bipartite_components_info = [] # Stores (num_vertices, num_edges, L_size, R_size)\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if color[i] == 0: # New connected component\n            q = deque()\n            \n            # Component specific info\n            current_component_vertices = 0\n            current_component_edges = 0\n            L_count = 0\n            R_count = 0\n            \n            component_is_bipartite = True\n\n            q.append((i, 1)) # (vertex, color)\n            color[i] = 1\n            L_count += 1\n            current_component_vertices += 1\n\n            head = 0\n            q_list = [(i,1)] # Using list as a queue for easier iteration later\n            \n            while head < len(q_list):\n                u, u_color = q_list[head]\n                head += 1\n                \n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    current_component_edges += 1 # Each edge counted twice\n                    if color[v] == 0: # Uncolored\n                        color[v] = 3 - u_color # Assign opposite color\n                        if color[v] == 1:\n                            L_count += 1\n                        else:\n                            R_count += 1\n                        current_component_vertices += 1\n                        q_list.append((v, color[v]))\n                    elif color[v] == u_color: # Same color, odd cycle detected\n                        component_is_bipartite = False\n                        is_odd_cycle_present = True\n                        break # Break from inner loop (neighbors)\n                \n                if not component_is_bipartite:\n                    break # Break from outer loop (BFS for this component)\n            \n            if is_odd_cycle_present:\n                # No need to process further components\n                break\n            \n            if component_is_bipartite:\n                bipartite_components_info.append((current_component_vertices, current_component_edges // 2, L_count, R_count))\n\n    if is_odd_cycle_present:\n        print(0, 1)\n        return\n\n    # All components are bipartite\n    t_1_ways = 0\n    for num_v, num_e, L_c, R_c in bipartite_components_info:\n        t_1_ways += L_c * (L_c - 1) // 2\n        t_1_ways += R_c * (R_c - 1) // 2\n    \n    if t_1_ways > 0:\n        print(1, t_1_ways)\n        return\n\n    # t_1_ways is 0, meaning all components have L_c < 2 and R_c < 2 (isolated vertices or single edges)\n    # Check for t=2\n    total_vertices_bipartite = 0\n    total_edges_bipartite = 0\n    sum_Vi_Ei = 0 # Sum of (Vertices in C_i * Edges in C_i)\n\n    for num_v, num_e, L_c, R_c in bipartite_components_info:\n        total_vertices_bipartite += num_v\n        total_edges_bipartite += num_e\n        sum_Vi_Ei += num_v * num_e\n    \n    t_2_ways = total_edges_bipartite * total_vertices_bipartite - sum_Vi_Ei\n    \n    if t_2_ways > 0:\n        print(2, t_2_ways)\n        return\n\n    # t_2_ways is 0, meaning total_edges_bipartite = 0\n    # This implies all components are isolated vertices\n    # Check for t=3\n    # We need to pick 3 distinct vertices to form a C3.\n    # This is only possible if n >= 3.\n    if n >= 3:\n        t_3_ways = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6\n        print(3, t_3_ways)\n    else:\n        # This case implies n < 3 and no odd cycle can be formed.\n        # But problem guarantees a solution.
