Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Guard Duty Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and immediately my mind jumps to a few key areas.  First off, the problem statement is pretty clear: we've got spaceships and bases, and we need to assign each one to the other without the connecting lines intersecting.  The sizes of the input are the giveaway here - `R` and `B` are small, up to 10.  That tells me that brute force or at least something with a factorial time complexity *might* be viable.\n\nFirst check - if the number of spaceships doesn't match the number of bases, we can immediately say \"No\". No point in even going further.\n\nThe core of the problem is finding that non-intersecting matching. I'm thinking back to my computational geometry days. We're essentially trying to find a perfect matching between two sets of points in the plane such that no two line segments connecting the matched pairs intersect.  This rings a bell, I know there are some known geometric conditions or properties to use here.\n\nThe convex hull idea pops up, but I'm recalling that finding the convex hull and checking that all points are 'interleaved' is not the only way to solve the problem. I need to be more precise. We have to be careful here - a line separating the points of the two sets *doesn't* guarantee a matching exists.\n\nIt sounds like a sorting or ordering might be crucial here. I need to figure out a smart way to generate possible matchings and check them efficiently. It's a matching problem that's constrained by the geometric \"non-intersecting\" condition.\n\nLet's break this down further. Given this small constraint, let's explore all of the permutations for assigning the ships to bases. For each permutation, can I check in reasonable time if there are any intersecting line segments?\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, and no two assignment paths (straight line segments) intersect.\n\nFirst, for a perfect matching to exist, the number of Rebel spaceships `R` must be equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible, so we immediately output \"No\".\n\nIf `R == B`, let `N = R = B`. The constraint `N <= 10` is very small, which suggests that an algorithm with complexity exponential in `N` (like `N!`) might be acceptable. This leads us to consider trying all possible permutations for assignments.\n\nLet the Rebel spaceships be `R_0, R_1, ..., R_{N-1}` and the bases be `B_0, B_1, ..., B_{N-1}`. We want to find a permutation `p` of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` such that if we connect `R_i` to `B_{p[i]}` for all `i`, no two segments `R_i B_{p[i]}` and `R_j B_{p[j]}` intersect.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Check `R == B`**: Read `R` and `B`. If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n2.  **Read Coordinates**: Read the coordinates of `N` Rebel spaceships and `N` bases. Store them, for example, as lists of tuples.\n3.  **Iterate Permutations**: Generate all possible permutations of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)`. Each permutation `p` represents an assignment: `R_i` is connected to `B_{p[i]}`.\n4.  **Check Intersection for each Permutation**: For each permutation `p`:\n    a.  Construct the set of `N` segments: `S = {(R_i, B_{p[i]}) for i in range(N)}`.\n    b.  Check if any two distinct segments in `S` intersect. To do this, iterate through all unique pairs of segments `(seg1, seg2)` from `S`.\n        i.  `seg1 = (P1, P2)` and `seg2 = (P3, P4)`.\n        ii. Use a geometric function `segments_intersect(P1, P2, P3, P4)` to determine if they intersect. This function typically relies on cross products (or orientation tests) to check if the endpoints of one segment lie on opposite sides of the line defined by the other segment, and vice versa. It also needs to handle collinear cases carefully, especially for strict non-intersection (endpoints touching is usually allowed, but here \"do not intersect\" implies no shared interior points). Given the problem constraints (\"no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line\"), we can simplify the intersection check: two segments intersect if and only if their endpoints strictly alternate with respect to the other segment's line.\n5.  **Output**: If a permutation is found for which no segments intersect, print \"Yes\" and exit. If all permutations are checked and none satisfy the condition, print \"No\".\n\n**Geometric Intersection Check (`segments_intersect`)**:\n\nGiven two segments `P1 P2` and `P3 P4`:\nLet `P1=(x1, y1)`, `P2=(x2, y2)`, `P3=(x3, y3)`, `P4=(x4, y4)`.\n\nThe `orientation(P, Q, R)` function returns:\n*   `0` if `P, Q, R` are collinear.\n*   `1` if `P, Q, R` are in clockwise order.\n*   `2` if `P, Q, R` are in counter-clockwise order.\nIt's calculated using the cross product: `(Q.y - P.y) * (R.x - Q.x) - (Q.x - P.x) * (R.y - Q.y)`.\n*   `> 0` for counter-clockwise (2)\n*   `< 0` for clockwise (1)\n*   `= 0` for collinear (0)\n\nTwo segments `P1 P2` and `P3 P4` intersect if and only if:\n1.  `orientation(P1, P2, P3) != orientation(P1, P2, P4)` AND\n2.  `orientation(P3, P4, P1) != orientation(P3, P4, P2)`\n\nThis condition correctly identifies proper intersections where segments cross. It does *not* count cases where segments only touch at an endpoint or are collinear and overlap. The problem statement \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\" and \"no three points are on the same line\" implies we only need to check for proper intersections. If endpoints coincide, it's guaranteed not to happen. If segments are collinear, they must share at least 3 points, which is ruled out by \"no three points are on the same line\". So, this simplified check is sufficient.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\nR = 3, B = 3\nRebels: `R0=(0,0), R1=(2,0), R2=(3,1)`\nBases: `B0=(-2,1), B1=(0,3), B2=(2,2)`\n\nConsider the identity permutation `p = (0, 1, 2)`:\nSegments: `(R0, B0), (R1, B1), (R2, B2)`\n`S0 = ((0,0), (-2,1))`\n`S1 = ((2,0), (0,3))`\n`S2 = ((3,1), (2,2))`\n\nLet's check `S0` and `S1`:\n`P1=(0,0), P2=(-2,1)`\n`P3=(2,0), P4=(0,3)`\n\n`orient(P1,P2,P3)`: `orient((0,0),(-2,1),(2,0))` = `(1-0)*(2-(-2)) - (-2-0)*(0-1)` = `1*4 - (-2)*(-1)` = `4 - 2` = `2` (CCW)\n`orient(P1,P2,P4)`: `orient((0,0),(-2,1),(0,3))` = `(1-0)*(0-(-2)) - (-2-0)*(3-1)` = `1*2 - (-2)*2` = `2 + 4` = `6` (CCW)\nSince `orient(P1,P2,P3)` and `orient(P1,P2,P4)` are both `CCW` (both `2` and `6` are positive), they are on the same side of `P1P2`. So `S0` and `S1` do not intersect.\n\nSimilarly, we would check `S0` with `S2` and `S1` with `S2`. If no intersections are found, \"Yes\" is printed. In this example, the identity permutation works.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Helper function to calculate orientation\n# Returns 0 if P, Q, R are collinear\n# Returns 1 if P, Q, R are clockwise\n# Returns 2 if P, Q, R are counter-clockwise\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n          (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # Collinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2 # Clockwise or Counter-clockwise\n\n# Function to check if two line segments P1P2 and P3P4 intersect\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Find the four orientations needed for general and special cases\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if orientations are different\n    # and not collinear for both segments.\n    # Given \"no three points are on the same line\", collinearity (0) will not happen\n    # for p1,q1,p2 or p1,q1,q2 etc. unless p2 or q2 is an endpoint of p1q1.\n    # But \"no two points coincide\" means p1!=p2, p1!=q2, etc.\n    # So, we only need to check for strict crossing.\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Given the problem constraints (\"no two points coincide\" and \"no three points are on the same line\"),\n    # we don't need to handle special cases like collinear segments overlapping or touching endpoints.\n    # If o1, o2, o3, o4 are all non-zero, then they must be crossing.\n    # If any is zero, it implies three points are collinear, which is guaranteed not to happen.\n    # So the general case is sufficient.\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    N = R\n    \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        rebels.append(tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n    \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        bases.append(tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    # Iterate over all permutations of base indices\n    # Each permutation `p` means rebel[i] is connected to bases[p[i]]\n    for p_indices in permutations(range(N)):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(N):\n            segments.append((rebels[i], bases[p_indices[i]]))\n        \n        # Check for intersections among the current set of segments\n        has_intersection = False\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i + 1, N): # Check unique pairs of segments\n                seg1_p1, seg1_q1 = segments[i]\n                seg2_p2, seg2_q2 = segments[j]\n                \n                if segments_intersect(seg1_p1, seg1_q1, seg2_p2, seg2_q2):\n                    has_intersection = True\n                    break\n            if has_intersection:\n                break\n        \n        if not has_intersection:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
