Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Amusing Joke\" problem, and I need to whip up a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, I'm given two names and a pile of letters, and I need to figure out if the pile contains *exactly* the letters from the two names combined, just rearranged.  My first thought is, it boils down to character counts.\n\n**Breaking Down the Logic:**\n\nI can see a couple of ways to tackle this. The first thing that jumps out is using frequency maps. I'd concatenate the two names, create a dictionary (or array) to keep track of how many times each letter appears in the combined names, and then do the same for the pile. Finally, I'd just compare the two frequency maps. If every count matches, it's a \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO.\" That feels pretty straightforward.\n\n**A Simpler Approach: Sorting**\n\nThen, I remember that Python has this nifty `sorted()` function.  Instead of frequency maps, I could just concatenate the names, sort the combined string alphabetically, and do the same for the pile. Comparing the sorted strings directly would be much more elegant, and Python makes this so easy. It’s also simple enough to implement and fast enough to deal with the constraints. Both are efficient but sorting might be the most concise in Python.\n\n**Constraints Check**\n\nThe constraints say each string is at most 100 characters long, so combining them will result in a string of maximum 200 characters to sort.  The pile is at most 100 characters. Sorting a string of 200 is still pretty quick - O(N log N) – especially for Python, so that shouldn't be a bottleneck.  Frequency counting would be linear, even faster.  So, no worries about performance here.\n\n**Example Walkthrough**\n\nLet's do a quick mental check. If I have \"SANTACLAUS\" and \"DEDMOROZ\", and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", I could check this quickly manually. I think sorting the strings is simpler in this case. After sorting them, I'd compare the final strings, and make the verdict. Let's do it manually just to be sure... yep, sorting should do the trick. Now, to code!\n",
