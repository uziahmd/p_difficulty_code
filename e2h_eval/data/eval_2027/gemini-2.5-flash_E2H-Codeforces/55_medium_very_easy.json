Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nMy goal is to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible, given some specific rules about what character swaps are allowed. The core of this challenge lies in understanding how these allowed swaps affect the *relative order* of the characters '0', '1', and '2'.\n\nI quickly realized that '0' and '2' are the \"rigid\" characters, meaning they can't directly swap. Any '0' has to stay before any '2' in the final string, and the other way around. However, '1's are much more flexible and can move around and switch position with '0's and '2's.\n\nBecause '0' and '2' can't be directly swapped, their relative order is fixed. This made me decide the final structure of the output string will be made of 3 parts: '0's and '2's, which should be in their relative order in the original string; all '1's, which could potentially go anywhere in the result; and then '2's.\n\nMy approach will be this: first, I extract the subsequence of '0's and '2's, while keeping their original order. Next, I figure out how many '1's there are. Then, I construct the final string by placing the '1's in the best position to have the minimum possible lexicographical string. The '1's always go right after the '0's. I also need to calculate the position of the first '2', if there is any. That is the point when the insertion of the '1's must happen.\n\nI've tested it on several examples and made sure the relative order of '0' and '2's is preserved, and the '1's are optimally placed, to achieve the lexicographically smallest result.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by applying specific adjacent swaps: '0' with '1', and '1' with '2'. Swapping '0' with '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1.  **'0' and '1' can swap:** `01 <=> 10`. This means '0's can move past '1's, and '1's can move past '0's. Effectively, '0's and '1's can be reordered freely among themselves. To achieve the lexicographically smallest order, all '0's would come before all '1's if only '0's and '1's were present.\n2.  **'1' and '2' can swap:** `12 <=> 21`. This means '1's can move past '2's, and '2's can move past '1's. Similarly, '1's and '2's can be reordered freely among themselves. To achieve the lexicographically smallest order, all '1's would come before all '2's if only '1's and '2's were present.\n\nThe crucial constraint is that **'0' and '2' cannot swap**. This has a significant implication:\nIf we have a '0' at some position `i` and a '2' at some position `j` in the original string, their *relative order* cannot be changed.\n- If `s[i] == '0'` and `s[j] == '2'` with `i < j` (i.e., '0' appears before '2'), then this specific '0' must always remain to the left of this specific '2'. No sequence of allowed swaps can make them cross each other.\n- Similarly, if `s[i] == '2'` and `s[j] == '0'` with `i < j` (i.e., '2' appears before '0'), then this specific '2' must always remain to the left of this specific '0'.\n\nThis means that the subsequence formed by all '0's and '2's in the original string must be preserved in the final string. The '1's, however, are \"mobile\" and can move past any '0' or '2'.\nSince '1's can swap with '0's (`01 <=> 10`), a '1' can move to the left of a '0'.\nSince '1's can swap with '2's (`12 <=> 21`), a '1' can move to the right of a '2'.\nCombining these, a '1' is effectively free to move to any position in the string, as long as it doesn't violate the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\nGiven that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, we should place all the '1's in the \"middle\" of the '0's and '2's subsequence. Specifically, all '1's should come after any '0's and before any '2's.\n\nConsider the string `s` and extract all its '0's and '2's into a new sequence, preserving their original relative order. Let's call this `s_02_chars`. Count all the '1's separately (`count1`).\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n- `s_02_chars` will be `['0', '0', '2', '0']` (from indices 1, 2, 3, 5).\n- `count1` will be `2` (from indices 0, 4).\n\nNow, we need to insert `count1` '1's into `s_02_chars` to make the resulting string lexicographically smallest. To achieve this, all '1's should be placed after all '0's and before all '2's.\nWe can find the first occurrence of a '2' in `s_02_chars`. All characters in `s_02_chars` before this first '2' must be '0's. All characters from this first '2' onwards (including the '2' itself) are '2's or '0's that were originally after this '2'.\n\nThe optimal strategy is:\n1.  Collect all '0's and '2's from the input string `s` into a list, maintaining their original relative order. Let's call this `s_02_parts`.\n2.  Count the total number of '1's in `s`. Let's call this `count_ones`.\n3.  Find the index of the first '2' character in `s_02_parts`.\n    *   If no '2' is found (i.e., `s_02_parts` contains only '0's), then the result is all '0's (from `s_02_parts`) followed by all '1's (`count_ones` '1's).\n    *   If a '2' is found at `first_two_idx` in `s_02_parts`:\n        The result string will be constructed by:\n        a.  All characters in `s_02_parts` *before* `first_two_idx` (these must be '0's).\n        b.  All `count_ones` '1's.\n        c.  All characters in `s_02_parts` *from* `first_two_idx` to the end (these are the '2's and any '0's that appeared after the first '2' in the original string).\n\nLet's apply this to the example `s = \"100210\"`:\n1.  `s_02_parts = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n2.  `count_ones = 2`\n3.  The first '2' in `s_02_parts` is at index 2. So, `first_two_idx = 2`.\n4.  Construct the result:\n    a.  Characters before index 2 in `s_02_parts`: `['0', '0']`. Join to \"00\".\n    b.  All '1's: `count_ones = 2`, so \"11\".\n    c.  Characters from index 2 onwards in `s_02_parts`: `['2', '0']`. Join to \"20\".\n    d.  Concatenate: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\". This matches the example output.\n\nLet's apply this to `s = \"11222121\"`:\n1.  `s_02_parts = ['2', '2', '2', '2']`\n2.  `count_ones = 4`\n3.  The first '2' in `s_02_parts` is at index 0. So, `first_two_idx = 0`.\n4.  Construct the result:\n    a.  Characters before index 0: `[]`. Join to \"\".\n    b.  All '1's: `count_ones = 4`, so \"1111\".\n    c.  Characters from index 0 onwards: `['2', '2', '2', '2']`. Join to \"2222\".\n    d.  Concatenate: \"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\". This matches the example output.\n\nLet's apply this to `s = \"20\"`:\n1.  `s_02_parts = ['2', '0']`\n2.  `count_ones = 0`\n3.  The first '2' in `s_02_parts` is at index 0. So, `first_two_idx = 0`.\n4.  Construct the result:\n    a.  Characters before index 0: `[]`. Join to \"\".\n    b.  All '1's: `count_ones = 0`, so \"\".\n    c.  Characters from index 0 onwards: `['2', '0']`. Join to \"20\".\n    d.  Concatenate: \"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\". This matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy correctly handles all given examples and aligns with the movement rules.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    s_02_parts = []\n    count_ones = 0\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_02_parts.append(char)\n\n    # Find the index of the first '2' in the s_02_parts sequence\n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_02_parts)):\n        if s_02_parts[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n\n    result_parts = []\n\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # No '2's in the string.
