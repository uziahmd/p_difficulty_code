            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Tile Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with solving this competitive programming problem involving Mahjong tiles. Tokitsukaze needs to find the minimum number of tiles to draw to make a \"mentsu,\" which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu).  She starts with three tiles, and I can assume the number of each type of tile she can draw is infinite.\n\nMy immediate thought is to start with the simplest scenarios and work my way up. It's likely that a solution will involve drawing 0, 1, or 2 extra tiles, given that a \"mentsu\" requires three tiles. It would be inefficient to try more draws unless necessary, so I'll prioritize checking for zero draws first.\n\nSo, first check if the initial tiles can *already* form a mentsu.  I need to determine if they form a triplet, where all three tiles are identical, or if they form a sequence (shuntsu) – three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit, regardless of their order.  If either is true, the answer is zero, and I can stop there.\n\nIf the initial three tiles don't form a mentsu, I'll move on to the next scenario: one extra draw. Here, things get a little more complex. The question is: can I find *any* tile to draw that will complete a mentsu using one of the initial tiles?\nI have to test all possible tiles (the 9 numbers * 3 suits = 27 possible tiles), draw each one, then check if there is a way to form a koutsu or shuntsu with the resulting four tiles. It is simply a matter of iterating through all combinations of 3 tiles.\n\nIf this fails, only then would I consider drawing two tiles. But given the problem constraints, I am confident that a solution can be found in 0 or 1 extra draws.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. She starts with 3 tiles. A mentsu is either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit).\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `tile1`, `tile2`, `tile3`.\n\nWe can solve this by checking the minimum number of draws required: 0, 1, or 2.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nCheck if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n1.  **Koutsu check:** Are all three tiles identical? (e.g., `['1m', '1m', '1m']`)\n2.  **Shuntsu check:**\n    *   Are all three tiles of the same suit?\n    *   Do their numbers form a sequence? (e.g., `['1m', '2m', '3m']`, `['5s', '7s', '6s']` after sorting becomes `['5s', '6s', '7s']`).\n\nIf either condition is met, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu.\nThis means we need to find if there's *any* possible tile `t_draw` such that `[tile1, tile2, tile3, t_draw]` contains a mentsu.\nA mentsu needs 3 tiles. So, we are looking for a mentsu formed by:\n*   `tile1, tile2, t_draw`\n*   `tile1, tile3, t_draw`\n*   `tile2, tile3, t_draw`\n*   (And importantly, `tile1, tile2, tile3` is already covered by the 0-draw case, so we only need to consider cases involving `t_draw`).\n\nLet's consider pairs from the initial hand: `(tile1, tile2)`, `(tile1, tile3)`, `(tile2, tile3)`.\nFor each pair `(t_a, t_b)`:\n1.  **To form a Koutsu:** If `t_a` and `t_b` are identical (e.g., `['2p', '2p']`), drawing a third identical tile (`'2p'`) would form a koutsu. Since `t_draw` can be any tile, we can always draw the required tile. So, if any two initial tiles are identical, 1 draw is sufficient.\n2.  **To form a Shuntsu:** If `t_a` and `t_b` are of the same suit:\n    *   Let their numbers be `n_a` and `n_b`. Sort them: `n_min, n_max`.\n    *   If `n_max - n_min == 1` (e.g., `['2m', '3m']`), we can draw `(n_min - 1)m` (if `n_min > 1`) or `(n_max + 1)m` (if `n_max < 9`) to form a shuntsu.\n    *   If `n_max - n_min == 2` (e.g., `['2m', '4m']`), we can draw `(n_min + 1)m` (which is `(n_max - 1)m`) to form a shuntsu.\n    If any such pair exists, 1 draw is sufficient.\n\nIf any of these conditions for 1 draw are met, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws must be the answer.\nWhy? With 3 initial tiles, `t1, t2, t3`, we need to form a mentsu.\n*   If we draw two tiles, `t_draw1`, `t_draw2`, we will have 5 tiles.\n*   We can always form a mentsu with 2 draws. For example, we can always draw two tiles identical to `t1` to form a koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`. Or, if `t1` is `1m`, we can draw `2m` and `3m` to form `[1m, 2m, 3m]`. Since we can draw *any* tiles, and an infinite number of them, we can always complete a mentsu using one of the initial tiles and two drawn tiles, or even three entirely new drawn tiles. The problem states \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand\". It does not say the mentsu must involve the initial tiles. So, drawing `1m, 1m, 1m` (three new tiles) is a valid way to get a mentsu, requiring 3 draws. However, we only have 3 initial tiles.\n    *   If we need to complete a mentsu using one of the initial tiles, say `t1`, we can draw two more `t1`s to form `[t1, t1, t1]`. This is 2 draws.\n    *   If `t1` is `1m`, we can draw `2m` and `3m` to form `[1m, 2m, 3m]`. This is 2 draws.\n    So, 2 draws are always sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of draws is either 0, 1, or 2.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse input:** Convert tile strings into (number, suit) tuples. E.g., '1s' -> (1, 's').\n2.  **Sort tiles:** Sort the three initial tiles primarily by suit, then by number. This helps in checking shuntsu.\n3.  **Check for 0 draws:**\n    *   `is_koutsu(t1, t2, t3)`: `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`\n    *   `is_shuntsu(t1, t2, t3)`: `t1.suit == t2.suit == t3.suit` AND `t1.num + 1 == t2.num` AND `t2.num + 1 == t3.num` (after sorting by number if not already sorted).\n    *   If either is true, print 0 and exit.\n\n4.  **Check for 1 draw:**\n    *   Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the initial hand: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`.\n    *   For each pair `(ta, tb)`:\n        *   `can_form_koutsu_with_1_draw(ta, tb)`: `ta == tb`\n        *   `can_form_shuntsu_with_1_draw(ta, tb)`:\n            *   `ta.suit == tb.suit` AND (`abs(ta.num - tb.num) == 1` OR `abs(ta.num - tb.num) == 2`)\n    *   If any of these conditions are true for any pair, print 1 and exit.\n\n5.  **If neither 0 nor 1 draw works, print 2.**\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nInput: `3p 9m 2p`\n\n1.  Tiles: `(3, 'p')`, `(9, 'm')`, `(2, 'p')`.\n2.  Sorted (for convenience, not strictly necessary for all checks but good practice): `(2, 'p')`, `(3, 'p')`, `(9, 'm')`. Let's call them `t1=(2,'p')`, `t2=(3,'p')`, `t3=(9,'m')`.\n\n3.  **Check 0 draws:**\n    *   Koutsu: `t1, t2, t3` are not identical. `(2,'p') != (3,'p')`. False.\n    *   Shuntsu: Not all same suit (`'p'`, `'p'`, `'m'`). False.\n    Result for 0 draws: No.\n\n4.  **Check 1 draw:**\n    *   Pairs:\n        *   `(t1, t2)`: `(2,'p')`, `(3,'p')`\n            *   Koutsu: Not identical. False.\n            *   Shuntsu: Same suit ('p'). `abs(2-3) == 1`. Yes, can draw `1p` or `4p` to form `[1p, 2p, 3p]` or `[2p, 3p, 4p]`.\n            *   Since we found a way to form a mentsu with 1 draw, print 1.\n\nThe logic holds.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n\n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for t_str in tiles_str:\n        num = int(t_str[0])\n        suit = t_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles.
