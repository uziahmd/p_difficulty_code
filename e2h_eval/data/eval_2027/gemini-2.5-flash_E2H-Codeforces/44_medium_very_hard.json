He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem. The core is maximizing the total profit by strategically dividing the problems into segments, aiming for the highest daily maximum difficulties. My thought process is to achieve this by identifying the 'k' largest values in the input array 'a'.\n\nThe key insight is that the sum of these 'k' largest values will be the maximum total profit. I realized that by carefully arranging the segments, we can ensure that each of these 'k' largest values becomes the daily maximum for a different segment. This is crucial: to have the sum, we *must* have those k values as each segment maximum.\n\n**Finding and Organizing the Key Values**\n\nMy strategy revolves around the original *indices* of these 'k' largest values. I'll represent the array elements as (value, original_index) pairs. I sort these pairs by value in descending order and select the top 'k' pairs. The sum of the values gives the optimal total profit.\n\nThe trick is figuring out how to construct the segments using these sorted indices. I sort the indices themselves (`s_1, s_2, ..., s_k`), and I use the gaps between these sorted indices to partition the original array. This creates a contiguous sequence of segments that cover all the problems, and *forces* the chosen values to be the maximum of their respective segments.\n\nI realized the segments should *end* at these indices: This guarantees the maximum value for each segment. I make segment lengths equal to the differences between indices, with the first segment starting at 0 and the final one extending to n-1. After a careful analysis, I've got a robust system for calculating segment lengths and verifying it: it ensures the chosen maximum value is within its segment.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into `k` contiguous segments. Each segment corresponds to a day's practice. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved that day. We want to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of profits over all `k` days. We also need to output the number of problems solved each day.\n\nLet's analyze how to maximize the total profit. The total profit is the sum of `k` maximums, one for each day. To maximize this sum, we should choose the `k` largest possible values from the array `a` to serve as these daily maximums. It's important to note that these `k` values don't have to be distinct if the same maximum difficulty appears multiple times in the problem list. For example, if `a = [2000, 2000]` and `k=2`, we'd pick `2000` and `2000`, for a total profit of `4000`.\n\nSo, the first step is to identify the `k` largest values in the array `a`. We can do this by creating pairs of `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems, sorting these pairs by difficulty in descending order, and then taking the top `k` pairs. The sum of the difficulties of these `k` pairs will be the maximum possible total profit.\n\nLet these `k` largest difficulties be `v_1, v_2, ..., v_k`, and their corresponding original 0-indexed positions be `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_k`. The sum `v_1 + ... + v_k` is our maximum total profit.\n\nNow, we need to partition the problems into `k` contiguous segments such that each segment's maximum is one of these chosen `v_j` values. To achieve this, we can use the original indices `idx_1, ..., idx_k` as \"pivot\" points.\n\n1.  **Collect and sort indices:** Gather all `idx_j` values into a list and sort them in ascending order: `s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_k`. These are the indices of the `k` problems that will contribute to the total profit.\n\n2.  **Define segment boundaries:** We need to split the `n` problems into `k` days. This requires `k-1` cut points. A simple and effective strategy is to make the first `k-1` sorted indices (`s_1, s_2, ..., s_{k-1}`) the *end points* of the first `k-1` days' problem sets. The `k`-th day will then take all remaining problems up to the end of the list.\n\n    Specifically, the segments will be:\n    *   Day 1: Problems from index `0` to `s_1`.\n    *   Day 2: Problems from index `s_1+1` to `s_2`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `j` (for `1 < j < k`): Problems from index `s_{j-1}+1` to `s_j`.\n    *   Day `k`: Problems from index `s_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate segment lengths (`t_j`):**\n    *   `t_1 = (s_1 - 0) + 1 = s_1 + 1`\n    *   `t_2 = (s_2 - (s_1+1)) + 1 = s_2 - s_1`\n    *   ...\n    *   `t_j = (s_j - (s_{j-1}+1)) + 1 = s_j - s_{j-1}` for `j = 2, ..., k-1`.\n    *   `t_k = ((n-1) - (s_{k-1}+1)) + 1 = n - s_{k-1} - 1`. (This simplifies to `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)` problems from `s_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`).\n\n    Let's verify the sum of `t_j`:\n    `(s_1 + 1) + (s_2 - s_1) + (s_3 - s_2) + ... + (s_{k-1} - s_{k-2}) + (n - s_{k-1} - 1)`\n    This is a telescoping sum: `(s_1 + 1) + (s_{k-1} - s_1) + (n - s_{k-1} - 1)`\n    `= (s_{k-1} + 1) + (n - s_{k-1} - 1) = n`.\n    The sum is `n`, so all problems are covered.\n\n4.  **Proof of correctness for daily maximums:**\n    For any segment `S_j` (defined as `[s_{j-1}+1, s_j]` or `[0, s_1]` for `j=1`), the problem `a[s_j]` is included. By construction, `a[s_j]` is one of the `k` largest problems overall. Furthermore, `s_j` is the *only* index from `\\{s_1, ..., s_k\\}` that falls within segment `S_j`. Any other problem `a[x]` in `S_j` (where `x \\neq s_j`) must have `a[x] \\le a[s_j]`. If `a[x] > a[s_j]`, then `a[x]` would have to be one of the `k` largest problems, and its index `x` would be in `\\{s_1, ..., s_k\\}`, which contradicts `s_j` being the unique index from that set within `S_j`. Therefore, `max(S_j) = a[s_j]`. This guarantees that each day's profit is one of the `k` largest values we initially selected, and thus the total profit is maximized.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Pairs (value, index):** `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  **Sort by value (descending) and pick top k=3:**\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]` (Note: if there are multiple 5s, like `(5,0)` and `(5,4)`, we pick one. The problem allows any valid answer.)\n3.  **Maximum total profit:** `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n4.  **Indices of selected maximums:** `[6, 3, 0]`.\n5.  **Sorted indices `s`:** `[0, 3, 6]`. So `s_1=0, s_2=3, s_3=6`.\n6.  **Calculate `t_j`:**\n    *   `t_1 = s_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   `t_2 = s_2 - s_1 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n    *   `t_3 = n - s_2 - 1 = 8 - 3 - 1 = 4`.\n7.  **Output:**\n    Maximum total profit: `20`\n    Segment lengths: `1 3 4` (This means Day 1 solves 1 problem, Day 2 solves 3, Day 3 solves 4).\n    This is a valid solution. The example output `3 2 3` is also valid, demonstrating that multiple solutions for `t_j` can exist.
