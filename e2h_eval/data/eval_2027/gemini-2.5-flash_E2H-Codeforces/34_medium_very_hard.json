And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Average Sleep Time Over Weeks**\n\nAlright, here's how I'm tackling this. We've got Polycarp's sleep data, represented as an array `a` with `n` days of sleep records.  We need to figure out the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks,\" where a week consists of `k` consecutive days. The goal is a Python script to do this.\n\nFirst, I define what a \"week\" means, specifically a sequence of `k` consecutive days within the larger `n`-day data set.  Given that, there are `n - k + 1` possible weeks we need to analyze.\n\nMy thought is to calculate a sum for each of these weeks, `WeekSum_j`.  The key to get the average is to sum all the `WeekSum_j` values and then divide by the total number of weeks (`n - k + 1`). This `TotalSum` is the foundation.\n\nTo simplify calculations, I'm thinking of using a sliding window approach, by calculating `WeekSum_j` efficiently.  I’ll use prefix sums, let `P[x]` be the sum of all elements in `a` from index 0 up to `x-1`. This lets us get the sum for a window easily, using `P[j+k-1] - P[j-1]`.\n\nSo I'll calculate the prefix sums. I will use the 0-based indexing for both the array and the prefix sum, as it is standard indexing in Python. Then, I can loop through all weeks calculating the `WeekSum` and the total sum, then divide by the number of weeks.\n\nThe total time complexity, with this, would be O(n).\n",
