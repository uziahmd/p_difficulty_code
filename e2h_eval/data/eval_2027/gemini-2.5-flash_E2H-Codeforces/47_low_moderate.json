His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem.

    "thought": "**Solving the Neko Does Maths Problem: A Dive into LCM Minimization**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with finding the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. Let's break this down. My initial thought is to let `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`, and then I want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.  The key insight, as always, lies in the relationship between LCM and GCD: `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nNow, if I let `g = gcd(x, y) = gcd(a+k, b+k)`, I can see something powerful.  Since `g` divides both `a+k` and `b+k`, it *must* also divide their difference, which is `(b+k) - (a+k) = b-a`.  Let's call this difference `diff = abs(b-a)`.  Therefore, `g` has to be a divisor of `diff`. This is my crucial observation - it narrows down the possible values of the GCD considerably.\n\nLet's assume, without loss of generality, that `a <= b`. This makes the difference `b-a` (or `diff`). If `a` and `b` are equal, `diff` is zero. In that case, `gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. I want to minimize `a+k`, and the smallest `k` to achieve this is 0. So, if `a=b`, the answer is trivial: k=0.\n\nNow, let's consider the more interesting scenario where `a < b`. I know that `g` is a divisor of `diff = b-a`.  I need to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `gcd(a+k, b+k) = g`.  I can see that if I ensure `a+k` is a multiple of `g`, then `b+k`, being `a+k` plus `b-a` (which is itself a multiple of `g`), will also automatically be a multiple of `g`.\n\nSo my problem becomes: finding the smallest `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`.  That means I can represent `a+k` as `m * g`, for some integer `m`. Thus, `k = m * g - a`. Since `k` must be non-negative, I need to find the smallest `m` such that `m * g >= a`. This is equivalent to `m >= a/g`. So, I'll need `m = ceil(a/g)`.\n\nNow, if `a` is already a multiple of `g` (i.e., `a % g == 0`), then I can choose `m` to be `a/g`, giving me `k=0`.  However, if `a` isn't a multiple of `g` (i.e., `a % g != 0`), then `m` will be `ceil(a/g)`. The next multiple of `g` after `a` is `a - (a % g) + g`. So, I'll have `a+k = a - (a % g) + g`, and `k = g - (a % g)`. This should give me my solution. Let's start coding this up.\n",
