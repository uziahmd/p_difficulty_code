Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Mulling Over the \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon.\" I need a Python script to solve it.  Let's break it down. We're given an `n`-gon and a target angle `a`, and we need to find three vertices that form an angle closest to `a`.  The geometry part is where it gets interesting since we're dealing with a *regular* convex polygon, which opens up some nice properties.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the inputs and outputs. Input is `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle), and the output is the indices of three vertices. Now, the key is understanding how to calculate angles in a regular polygon.  I know all the vertices lie on a circumcircle. The central angle of each side is `360/n`.  We need to look at inscribed angles and their relationship to the central angles. That inscribed angle is the one we want.\n\nI remember inscribed angles are half the measure of the arc they subtend. If we fix a vertex as the angle's apex, the arc is determined by the other two vertices. It's the arc *not* containing the apex. Let's say `v2` is the apex of my angle. We need to count how many segments (sides) make up the arc between `v1` and `v3` *not* containing `v2`.  Each side is equivalent to a central angle of `360/n`, so the arc length determines the central angle, and that, in turn, determines the inscribed angle.\n\nI'm starting to get a bit tangled up with how to calculate this, though. Let's reframe. Let `v2 = P_i`, `v1 = P_j`, and `v3 = P_k`. The problem is determining the number of sides `k` between `P_j` and `P_k` that *don't* contain `P_i`. If you're m \"steps\" apart, then `k = m`. Got it. If the inscribed angle is `k` \"steps\" apart, then the angle itself is `k*(180/n)`.\n\nNow, the core of the problem becomes calculating these possible angles and finding the one closest to `a`. I need a way to efficiently iterate through combinations of vertices, find the angle formed, and minimize the difference `|actual_angle - a|`.  I can fix a vertex as `v2` and then vary the other two, `v1` and `v3`. It looks like that should be enough for finding a solution. I just need to be careful with the indexing to map it back to the polygon. Time to start coding this!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` is as close as possible to a given target angle `a`. The vertices are numbered 1 to `n` clockwise.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon:**\n\n1.  All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle.\n2.  An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is an inscribed angle.\n3.  The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n4.  The arc subtended by `v1-v2-v3` is the arc `v1-v3` that *does not* contain `v2`.\n5.  In a regular `n`-gon, the vertices divide the circumcircle into `n` equal arcs. Each such arc (corresponding to one side of the polygon) subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\n6.  If the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) spans `k` segments (i.e., there are `k-1` vertices between `v1` and `v3` along this arc), then the central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360/n)` degrees.\n7.  Therefore, the inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` will be `(1/2) * k * (360/n) = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Possible Values for `k`:**\n\n*   `k` represents the number of segments on the arc `v1-v3` not containing `v2`.\n*   Since `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct, `k` must be at least 1.\n*   The maximum number of segments on an arc is `n-2` (when `v1` and `v3` are separated by `n-2` segments, and `v2` is on the remaining single segment, e.g., `v1=1, v3=n-1, v2=n`).\n*   So, `k` can take any integer value from `1` to `n-2`.\n\n**The Problem's Goal:**\n\nWe need to find `v1, v2, v3` such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nThis is equivalent to finding an integer `k` (where `1 <= k <= n-2`) such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`:**\n\nLet `angle_unit = 180/n`. The possible angles are `k * angle_unit`.\nWe want to find `k` such that `k * angle_unit` is closest to `a`.\nThis means `k` should be close to `a / angle_unit`.\nLet `k_target = a / angle_unit = a / (180/n) = (a * n) / 180`.\n\nSince `k` must be an integer, we should check the integers closest to `k_target`. These are `floor(k_target)` and `ceil(k_target)`.\nLet `k1 = floor(k_target)` and `k2 = ceil(k_target)`.\n\nWe must also ensure `1 <= k <= n-2`.\nSo, the candidate values for `k` are:\n*   `k_cand1 = max(1, min(n-2, k1))`\n*   `k_cand2 = max(1, min(n-2, k2))`\n\nWe calculate `|k_cand1 * angle_unit - a|` and `|k_cand2 * angle_unit - a|` and choose the `k` that gives the minimum absolute difference. If both give the same minimum difference, any `k` is fine.\n\n**Constructing the Vertices:**\n\nOnce we have the optimal `k`:\n1.  Choose `v2` to be vertex 1.\n2.  Choose `v1` to be vertex 2.\n3.  `v3` must be `k` steps away from `v1` along the arc that doesn't contain `v2`.\n    If `v1=2` and `v2=1`, then `v3` should be `2 + k`.\n    So, `v3 = (2 + k)`. (Since vertices are 1-indexed and `n` is max, we don't need modulo arithmetic for `v3` here as `k <= n-2`, so `2+k <= 2+n-2 = n`.\n    The chosen vertices are `v1=2`, `v2=1`, `v3=2+k`.\n\nLet's verify the distinctness and order:\n`v2 = 1`\n`v1 = 2`\n`v3 = 2+k`\nSince `k >= 1`, `v3 >= 3`. So `v1, v2, v3` are distinct.\nThe vertices are `1, 2, ..., n` in clockwise order.\nThe angle is `v1-v2-v3`, which is `2-1-(2+k)`.\nThe arc subtended by this angle is from `2` to `2+k` (not passing through `1`).\nThe vertices on this arc are `2, 3, ..., 2+k`.\nThe number of segments is `(2+k) - 2 = k`. This matches our formula.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\n*   `n=3, a=15`\n    *   `angle_unit = 180/3 = 60`.\n    *   `k_target = (15 * 3) / 180 = 45 / 180 = 0.25`.\n    *   `k1 = floor(0.25) = 0`.\n    *   `k2 = ceil(0.25) = 1`.\n    *   Range for `k`: `1 <= k <= n-2 = 3-2 = 1`.\n    *   `k_cand1 = max(1, min(1, 0)) = 1`.\n    *   `k_cand2 = max(1, min(1, 1)) = 1`.\n    *   Both candidates give `k=1`.\n    *   Angle for `k=1` is `1 * 60 = 60`. `|60 - 15| = 45`.\n    *   Optimal `k=1`.\n    *   Vertices: `v2=1, v1=2, v3=2+1=3`. Output: `2 1 3`.\n    *   Wait, example output is `1 2 3`. Let's check `1 2 3`.\n        *   `v2=2, v1=1, v3=3`.\n        *   Arc from `1` to `3` (not containing `2`) has vertices `1, 3`. Number of segments `k=1`.\n        *   Angle `1 * (180/3) = 60`. This is also valid.\n        *   My construction `v1=2, v2=1, v3=3` gives `2 1 3`. This is also a valid answer. The problem states \"If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\"\n\n    My choice of `v2=1, v1=2, v3=2+k` is consistent and easy.\n    Let's re-check the example:\n    *   `n=3, a=15`. My code will output `2 1 3`. The example output `1 2 3` is also valid (angle 60).\n    *   `n=4, a=67`.\n        *   `angle_unit = 180/4 = 45`.\n        *   `k_target = (67 * 4) / 180 = 268 / 180 = 1.488...`.\n        *   `k1 = 1, k2 = 2`.\n        *   Range for `k`: `1 <= k <= n-2 = 4-2 = 2`.\n        *   `k_cand1 = max(1, min(2, 1)) = 1`. Angle `1*45=45`. Diff `|45-67|=22`.\n        *   `k_cand2 = max(1, min(2, 2)) = 2`. Angle `2*45=90`. Diff `|90-67|=23`.\n        *   Optimal `k=1`.\n        *   Vertices: `v2=1, v1=2, v3=2+1=3`. Output: `2 1 3`. This matches example output.\n    *   `n=4, a=68`.\n        *   `angle_unit = 45`.\n        *   `k_target = (68 * 4) / 180 = 272 / 180 = 1.511...`.\n        *   `k1 = 1, k2 = 2`.\n        *   Range for `k`: `1 <= k <= 2`.\n        *   `k_cand1 = 1`. Angle `45`. Diff `|45-68|=23`.\n        *   `k_cand2 = 2`. Angle `90`. Diff `|90-68|=22`.\n        *   Optimal `k=2`.\n        *   Vertices: `v2=1, v1=2, v3=2+2=4`. Output: `2 1 4`.\n        *   Example output is `4 1 2`. This is also valid. `v2=1, v1=4, v3=2`. Arc from `4` to `2` (not containing `1`) means vertices `4, n, n-1, ..., 2`. This is `k=2` segments.\n        *   My output `2 1 4` is also valid.\n\nThe logic seems sound.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The unit angle for an inscribed angle in a regular n-gon is 180/n degrees.\n    # Any possible angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 will be k * (180/n),\n    # where k is an integer representing the number of segments on the arc v1-v3\n    # that does not contain v2.\n    # The value of k can range from 1 to n-2.\n    \n    angle_unit = 180.0 / n\n\n    # We want to find k such that k * angle_unit is closest to 'a'.\n    # This means k should be close to a / angle_unit.\n    k_target = a / angle_unit\n\n    # Consider the two integers closest to k_target: floor(k_target) and ceil(k_target).\n    k_cand1 = math.floor(k_target)\n    k_cand2 = math.ceil(k_target)\n\n    # Ensure k is within the valid range [1, n-2].\n    # max(1, ...) handles k < 1.\n    # min(n-2, ...) handles k > n-2.\n    k_final_cand1 = max(1, min(n - 2, int(k_cand1)))\n    k_final_cand2 = max(1, min(n - 2, int(k_cand2)))\n\n    # Calculate the absolute differences for both candidates.\n    diff1 = abs(k_final_cand1 * angle_unit - a)\n    diff2 = abs(k_final_cand2 * angle_unit - a)\n\n    # Choose the k that gives the minimum difference.\n    optimal_k = k_final_cand1\n    if diff2 < diff1:\n        optimal_k = k_final_cand2\n    # If diff1 == diff2, either k is fine.
