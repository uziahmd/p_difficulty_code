Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Puzzle of String Replacements: My Expert Breakdown**\n\nAlright, let's get down to brass tacks. I've got a competitive programming problem here, and the core challenge is simulating a sequence of string substitutions and then calculating the final numerical value, modulo a large prime.  Here's my thought process as I dissect this:\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's coming: I have an initial string `s` of digits, then a series of queries. Each query is of the form `di -> ti`, meaning replace every instance of the digit `di` with the string `ti`. The real kicker is the exponential growth potential. If `s` is \"1\", and `1 -> 11111`, then `s` balloons to \"11111\". If you repeat that, it gets enormous.  I can't possibly *store* the entire string `s`.  Instead, I need a smarter approach.\n\nMy initial thought is that I need to track a value and a \"length\" for each digit. I realize that each digit expands, maybe exponentially, into a number. My key insight is that the queries must be processed in the given order.\n\nSo, for each digit `d`, I'm going to have `val[d]` which will hold its numerical value (modulo `M = 10^9 + 7`) after all the substitutions. I'll also have `len_pow10[d]`, which represents the length of the string, that expands from `d` as a power of 10. `10^L` is what I need here.  Initially, each digit `d` \"is itself\", so `val[d] = d`, and it's length is `1`, so `len_pow10[d] = 10`.\n\nNow, the trick is updating `val` and `len_pow10` with each query `di -> ti`.  When a query comes in, I have to update `val[di]` and `len_pow10[di]` correctly. I realize that the length and value of the string `ti` will affect all the digits *in* ti. So, when `di` is replaced by `ti`, I need to update my stored values of `val` and `len_pow10` for each digit within `ti`.\n\nHere's where the recursion of it gets to me. When `di` gets replaced by `ti`, I need to calculate it with existing lengths and values. When I do this, it means the query order matters here.\n\nAs I work through a simple example (\"123\", \"2->00\"), I realize the numerical value is built from the string in `ti`. Also, `s` gets updated by the given queries. It's not a direct string replacement, but a transformation. I also see that, when the new string `ti` replaces `di`, I need to calculate the value of `ti` using the \"current\" values of its elements.\n\nThinking about the computation, here's how I need to tackle updating the values. For `di -> ti`:\n-   `new_V_di` is going to be `sum_{j=0 to k} (val[t_j] * product_{p=0 to j-1} len_pow10[t_p]) % M`\n\nAfter testing with different examples, I know I must keep a \"current\" value and \"current\" length for each digit, and must iterate through queries in their given order. I see I must calculate `V[di]` by examining the digits in `ti`. I see that the value and exponent grow with length.\n\nI think Fermat's Little Theorem (because I'm working with a prime modulo) and the modular properties of exponentiation, the length and value of an *updated digit* come from the query.\n\nTo sum up:\n- I must maintain `V[d]` and `L[d]` to hold values.\n- I need `pow(10, exp, M)`.\n- I must iterate across queries. For a query, I need to iterate in reverse across string `ti`.\n\nWith the modular arithmetic, this looks doable. So, here's my plan: I'm going to iterate through the queries and build my digit representation. Then, I'll calculate the value.\nI feel this is an elegant and efficient solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo `10^9 + 7`. The string `s` can grow exponentially in length, so we cannot explicitly construct it. We need an approach that tracks the numerical value and effective length of each digit `0-9`.\n\nLet `M = 10^9 + 7`. This is a prime number.\nLet `MOD_EXP = M - 1`. By Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^b % M = a^(b % MOD_EXP) % M` for `a != 0`. This is crucial because the \"effective length\" of a digit can become extremely large, but we only care about its exponent modulo `MOD_EXP`.\n\nWe'll maintain two arrays, `val` and `length`:\n*   `val[d]` will store the numerical value (modulo `M`) that a single digit `d` effectively represents after all transformations.\n*   `length[d]` will store the effective length (modulo `MOD_EXP`) that a single digit `d` effectively represents after all transformations. This is used as an exponent for powers of 10.\n\n**Initialization:**\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` represents itself and has a length of 1.\nFor `d` from `0` to `9`:\n`val[d] = d`\n`length[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries (Crucial Insight):**\nThe queries are given in order. If we process them in the given order, a replacement `d_i -> t_i` means that `d_i` is replaced by `t_i`, and then any digits `d_j` within `t_i` are *further expanded* according to their current `val[d_j]` and `length[d_j]`. This means the state of `val` and `length` for `d_j` should reflect all prior transformations.\n\nHowever, if we process queries in reverse order, we can determine the *final* `val` and `length` for each digit. When processing a query `d_i -> t_i` (from the original sequence) in reverse, we are determining what `d_i` *eventually* becomes. The string `t_i` itself might contain digits `d_j`. These `d_j` will be affected by *subsequent* queries in the original sequence (which we have already processed in reverse). So, when calculating `val[d_i]` and `length[d_i]` based on `t_i`, we use the `val[d_j]` and `length[d_j]` that have *already been updated* by these \"future\" queries. This ensures that `val[d]` and `length[d]` will store the values that `d` ultimately expands to.\n\nLet's refine the reverse processing for query `d_i -> t_i`:\n1.  Parse `d_i` (a single digit character) and `t_i` (a string of digits).\n2.  Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n3.  Iterate through `t_i` from right to left (say, `t_i = c_k c_{k-1} ... c_0`).\n    For each digit `c_j` in `t_i`:\n    *   `new_val_di = (val[int(c_j)] * pow(10, new_len_di, M) + new_val_di) % M`\n    *   `new_len_di = (length[int(c_j)] + new_len_di) % MOD_EXP`\n4.  After processing all characters in `t_i`, update `val[int(d_i)] = new_val_di` and `length[int(d_i)] = new_len_di`.\n    *   Special case: If `t_i` is an empty string, `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` will remain `0`. This correctly models replacing a digit with nothing.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter all queries are processed in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` will hold the final effective value and length for each digit `d`. Now, we apply these transformations to the initial string `s`.\n1.  Initialize `final_answer = 0` and `current_power_of_10_exponent = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through the initial string `s` from right to left (say, `s = s_k s_{k-1} ... s_0`).\n    For each digit `s_j` in `s`:\n    *   `final_answer = (val[int(s_j)] * pow(10, current_power_of_10_exponent, M) + final_answer) % M`\n    *   `current_power_of_10_exponent = (length[int(s_j)] + current_power_of_10_exponent) % MOD_EXP`\n3.  The `final_answer` is the result.\n\n**Example 3: `s = \"222\"`, `2` queries: `2->0`, `0->7`**\n`M = 10^9 + 7`, `MOD_EXP = 10^9 + 6`\n\nInitial:\n`val = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n`length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\nQueries in reverse order:\n**Query 2 (original): `0 -> 7`**\n`d_i = '0'`, `t_i = \"7\"`\n`c_j = '7'`:\n  `new_val_0 = (val[7] * pow(10, 0, M) + 0) % M = (7 * 1 + 0) % M = 7`\n  `new_len_0 = (length[7] + 0) % MOD_EXP = (1 + 0) % MOD_EXP = 1`\nUpdate `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\nState: `val = [7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`, `length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n**Query 1 (original): `2 -> 0`**\n`d_i = '2'`, `t_i = \"0\"`\n`c_j = '0'`:\n  `new_val_2 = (val[0] * pow(10, 0, M) + 0) % M = (7 * 1 + 0) % M = 7` (Note: `val[0]` is now 7)\n  `new_len_2 = (length[0] + 0) % MOD_EXP = (1 + 0) % MOD_EXP = 1` (Note: `length[0]` is now 1)\nUpdate `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\nFinal state for `val` and `length`:\n`val = [7,1,7,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n`length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\nFinal calculation for `s = \"222\"`:\n`final_answer = 0`, `current_power_of_10_exponent = 0`\n1.  `s_j = '2'` (rightmost):\n    `final_answer = (val[2] * pow(10, 0, M) + 0) % M = (7 * 1 + 0) % M = 7`\n    `current_power_of_10_exponent = (length[2] + 0) % MOD_EXP = (1 + 0) % MOD_EXP = 1`\n2.  `s_j = '2'` (middle):\n    `final_answer = (val[2] * pow(10, 1, M) + 7) % M = (7 * 10 + 7) % M = 77`\n    `current_power_of_10_exponent = (length[2] + 1) % MOD_EXP = (1 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 2`\n3.  `s_j = '2'` (leftmost):\n    `final_answer = (val[2] * pow(10, 2, M) + 77) % M = (7 * 100 + 77) % M = 777`\n    `current_power_of_10_exponent = (length[2] + 2) % MOD_EXP = (1 + 2) % MOD_EXP = 3`\n\nResult: `777`.
