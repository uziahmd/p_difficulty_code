He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing Prefixes and Suffixes**\n\nOkay, I've got this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem swirling around in my head.  It seems straightforward at first glance, but I need to be precise.  The core of it is this: I'm given an unknown string `s` of length `n`, and a collection of its improper prefixes and suffixes. Specifically, `2n-2` strings in total.  My task?  Determine whether each of these given strings is a prefix or a suffix of `s`, and output 'P' or 'S' accordingly.  The input's guaranteed to be structured, so I know I can count on a unique solution.\n\nThe key observation here is that for each length `k` from 1 up to `n-1`, I'll have *exactly* two strings of length `k` in the input.  One of these has to be the prefix of length `k` (the first `k` characters of `s`), and the other must be the suffix of length `k` (the last `k` characters of `s`).\n\nThis leads me to a strategy. I should first identify the two potential candidates for `s`.  I'll start by finding the two strings of length `n-1`. Let's call them `str1` and `str2`.  One of these is definitely the prefix of length `n-1`, which is `s[0...n-2]`, and the other is the suffix of length `n-1`, which is `s[1...n-1]`.\n\nNow comes the crucial part: I need to reconstruct the full string `s`.  If I assume `str1` is the prefix, then `s` must be `str1` concatenated with the last character of `str2`. This requires the internal part of str1 (which is from 1 to n-2) to be equal to internal part of str2 (from 0 to n-3). If they don't match, I can switch the roles of `str1` and `str2`. That is the gist of it.\n\nIf I can correctly identify `s`, the prefix/suffix identification becomes simple. I'll iterate through the input strings and use my understanding of prefix and suffix structures to place the corresponding 'P' or 'S' in the output. This feels like it should be an elegant and efficient solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify `2n-2` given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to `n-1`, one being a prefix and the other a suffix. We need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's corresponding to the input order.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nThe crucial observation is that there are exactly two strings of length `n-1`. Let's call them `L1` and `L2`.\nOne of these strings must be the prefix of length `n-1`, which is `s[0...n-2]`.\nThe other must be the suffix of length `n-1`, which is `s[1...n-1]`.\n\nThis gives us two candidate full strings `s`:\n\n**Candidate 1:**\nAssume `L1` is `s[0...n-2]` and `L2` is `s[1...n-1]`.\nFor this to be true, `L1[1...n-2]` must be equal to `L2[0...n-3]`.\nIf this condition holds, the full string `s` would be `L1[0] + L2` (or equivalently, `L1 + L2[n-2]`). Let's call this `s_cand1`.\n\n**Candidate 2:**\nAssume `L2` is `s[0...n-2]` and `L1` is `s[1...n-1]`.\nFor this to be true, `L2[1...n-2]` must be equal to `L1[0...n-3]`.\nIf this condition holds, the full string `s` would be `L2[0] + L1` (or equivalently, `L2 + L1[n-2]`). Let's call this `s_cand2`.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that a consistent string `s` exists, at least one of these candidates (`s_cand1` or `s_cand2`) must be valid. We can pick the first one that is valid and use it to determine the 'P'/'S' assignments.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Store all `2n-2` input strings along with their original indices.\n3.  Filter out the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `str_n_minus_1_a` and `str_n_minus_1_b`.\n4.  **Try Candidate 1:**\n    *   Set `prefix_n_minus_1 = str_n_minus_1_a`\n    *   Set `suffix_n_minus_1 = str_n_minus_1_b`\n    *   Check if `prefix_n_minus_1[1:] == suffix_n_minus_1[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, then `s_candidate = prefix_n_minus_1[0] + suffix_n_minus_1`. This is our potential `s`.\n    *   Validate `s_candidate`:\n        *   Generate all prefixes of `s_candidate` (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n        *   Generate all suffixes of `s_candidate` (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n        *   Count occurrences of each generated prefix/suffix in the input list. If each appears exactly once, then `s_candidate` is a valid original string.\n        *   If `s_candidate` is valid, proceed to step 6.\n5.  **Try Candidate 2 (if Candidate 1 failed):**\n    *   Set `prefix_n_minus_1 = str_n_minus_1_b`\n    *   Set `suffix_n_minus_1 = str_n_minus_1_a`\n    *   Check if `prefix_n_minus_1[1:] == suffix_n_minus_1[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, then `s_candidate = prefix_n_minus_1[0] + suffix_n_minus_1`. This is our potential `s`.\n    *   Validate `s_candidate` (same as step 4).\n    *   Since a solution is guaranteed, this candidate must be valid if Candidate 1 was not.\n6.  **Assign 'P'/'S' based on the chosen `s_candidate`:**\n    *   Initialize an array `result` of size `2n-2` with empty strings.\n    *   Create a `set` of all prefixes of `s_candidate` (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n    *   Iterate through the original input strings (using their original indices):\n        *   If the current string is in the `prefixes_set` AND it hasn't been assigned as a prefix yet (we need to handle duplicates carefully, as there are two strings of each length), assign 'P'.\n        *   Otherwise, assign 'S'.\n    *   A more robust way to handle duplicates:\n        *   Create a `collections.defaultdict(int)` to count occurrences of each prefix of `s_candidate`.\n        *   Iterate through the input strings. If an input string `t` is a prefix of `s_candidate` AND its count in the `prefix_counts` dict is greater than 0, assign 'P', and decrement its count.\n        *   Otherwise (if it's not a prefix, or it's a prefix but its count is 0, meaning we've already assigned 'P' to its duplicate), assign 'S'.\n7.  Print the joined `result` array.\n\n**Refined Assignment Strategy (Step 6):**\nThe problem states \"It is guaranteed that there are exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1.\" This means for each length `k`, one string is `s[0...k-1]` and the other is `s[n-k...n-1]`.\nSo, we can identify the true `s` string first. Then, for each length `k`, we know what `s[0...k-1]` and `s[n-k...n-1]` are.\nWe iterate through the input strings. For each input string `t_i`:\n*   If `t_i` is a prefix of `s` (i.e., `s.startswith(t_i)`) AND we haven't already marked a string of the same length as a prefix: mark `t_i` as 'P'.\n*   Otherwise, mark `t_i` as 'S'.\n\nTo implement this, we can use two sets: `used_prefixes_len` and `used_suffixes_len`.\n`used_prefixes_len` will store lengths `k` for which `s[0...k-1]` has already been assigned 'P'.\n`used_suffixes_len` will store lengths `k` for which `s[n-k...n-1]` has already been assigned 'S'.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Read `2n-2` strings into a list, say `input_strings`.\n3.  Separate strings by length: `strings_by_len = defaultdict(list)`.\n    For each `(index, s_val)` in `enumerate(input_strings)`:\n    `strings_by_len[len(s_val)].append((s_val, index))`\n4.  Get the two strings of length `n-1`:\n    `str_a, idx_a = strings_by_len[n-1][0]`\n    `str_b, idx_b = strings_by_len[n-1][1]`\n5.  **Determine the actual string `s`:**\n    `s = \"\"`\n    `is_prefix_str_a = False` # True if str_a is the prefix of length n-1, False if it's the suffix\n    if `str_a[1:] == str_b[:-1]`:\n        `s = str_a[0] + str_b`\n        `is_prefix_str_a = True`\n    elif `str_b[1:] == str_a[:-1]`:\n        `s = str_b[0] + str_a`\n        `is_prefix_str_a = False`\n    # One of these MUST be true due to problem guarantees.\n6.  **Construct the result string:**\n    `result = [''] * (2 * n - 2)`\n    `used_prefix_lengths = set()`\n    `used_suffix_lengths = set()`\n\n    For `(current_str, original_index)` in `input_strings` (iterating through the original input order):\n        `length = len(current_str)`\n        `is_actual_prefix = (s[:length] == current_str)`\n        `is_actual_suffix = (s[n-length:] == current_str)`\n\n        if `is_actual_prefix` and `length` not in `used_prefix_lengths`:\n            `result[original_index] = 'P'`\n            `used_prefix_lengths.add(length)`\n        elif `is_actual_suffix` and `length` not in `used_suffix_lengths`:\n            `result[original_index] = 'S'`\n            `used_suffix_lengths.add(length)`\n        # The problem guarantees that for each length, one is prefix and one is suffix.\n        # This logic ensures that if a string matches the actual prefix and that length\n        # hasn't been \"claimed\" by a prefix yet, it gets 'P'. Otherwise, it must be 'S'\n        # (either it matches the actual suffix, or it's the duplicate of an already\n        # claimed prefix, in which case it must be the suffix).\n\n        # More precise logic:\n        # If current_str matches s[:length] AND we haven't assigned 'P' for this length yet:\n        #     Assign 'P', add length to used_prefix_lengths.\n        # Else (it must be the suffix of that length):\n        #     Assign 'S', add length to used_suffix_lengths.\n        # This works because there are exactly two strings of each length.\n\n    `final_result = [''] * (2 * n - 2)`\n    `prefix_lengths_assigned = set()`\n    `suffix_lengths_assigned = set()`\n\n    For `i` from `0` to `2 * n - 3`:\n        `current_str = input_strings[i]`\n        `length = len(current_str)`\n        if `s.startswith(current_str)` and `length` not in `prefix_lengths_assigned`:\n            `final_result[i] = 'P'`\n            `prefix_lengths_assigned.add(length)`\n        else:\n            `final_result[i] = 'S'`\n            `suffix_lengths_assigned.add(length)`\n\n    Print `\"\".join(final_result)`.\n\nThis logic is sound because for each length `k`, there are two strings `t1` and `t2`. One is `s[0...k-1]` and the other is `s[n-k...n-1]`. When we iterate through the input strings in their original order, the first string of length `k` that matches `s[0...k-1]` will be assigned 'P', and `k` will be added to `prefix_lengths_assigned`. The *other* string of length `k` (which must be `s[n-k...n-1]`) will then fall into the `else` block and be assigned 'S'.\n\nExample 1:\nn = 5\nInput strings: ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba\n\nStrings of length n-1 = 4: `abab`, `baba`\nLet `str_a = \"abab\"`, `str_b = \"baba\"`\n\nTry Candidate 1: `prefix_n_minus_1 = \"abab\"`, `suffix_n_minus_1 = \"baba\"`\n`prefix_n_minus_1[1:] = \"bab\"`\n`suffix_n_minus_1[:-1] = \"bab\"`\nThey match! So `s = \"a\" + \"baba\" = \"ababa\"`.\nThis is consistent with the example note.\n\nNow, assign P/S based on `s = \"ababa\"`:\nInput strings (original index, string):\n(0, \"ba\") -> `s` does not start with \"ba\". `s` ends with \"ba\". Length 2. 'S'. `suffix_lengths_assigned = {2}`\n(1, \"a\") -> `s` starts with \"a\". Length 1. 'P'. `prefix_lengths_assigned = {1}`\n(2, \"abab\") -> `s` starts with \"abab\". Length 4. 'P'. `prefix_lengths_assigned = {1, 4}`\n(3, \"a\") -> `s` starts with \"a\", but length 1 is in `prefix_lengths_assigned`. So 'S'. `suffix_lengths_assigned = {2, 1}`\n(4, \"aba\") -> `s` starts with \"aba\". Length 3. 'P'. `prefix_lengths_assigned = {1, 4, 3}`\n(5, \"baba\") -> `s` does not start with \"baba\". `s` ends with \"baba\". Length 4. 'S'. `suffix_lengths_assigned = {2, 1, 4}`\n(6, \"ab\") -> `s` starts with \"ab\". Length 2. 'P'. `prefix_lengths_assigned = {1, 4, 3, 2}`\n(7, \"aba\") -> `s` starts with \"aba\", but length 3 is in `prefix_lengths_assigned`.
