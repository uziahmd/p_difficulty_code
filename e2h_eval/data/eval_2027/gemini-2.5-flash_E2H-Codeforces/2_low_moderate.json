Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**X-Shaped Grid Verification**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to determine if a given character grid forms an \"X\" shape based on specific criteria. Let's break this down. First, the grid will be square, `n x n`, where `n` is always odd and between 3 and 300. The core logic hinges on these rules: all characters on the diagonals must be identical, all *other* characters must be identical, and these two sets of characters must be different from each other.\n\nMy plan is to represent the grid as a 2D structure, like a list of lists of characters. I'll need to define how I identify the diagonal cells; that's straightforward: a cell `(row, col)` is on the main diagonal if `row == col`, and on the anti-diagonal if `row + col == n - 1`.  So, a cell is part of a diagonal if it satisfies either of those conditions.\n\nThe algorithm itself will proceed as follows: I'll read the value of `n` and then populate the grid.  I'll initialize two variables, `diagonal_char` and `other_char`, to store the characters found on the diagonals and off-diagonals, respectively. Initially, these will be set to `None` or an empty string.\n\nNext, I'll iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell `(r, c)`, I'll determine if it's on a diagonal using that condition I defined. If it *is* on a diagonal, I'll compare its character to `diagonal_char`. If `diagonal_char` is still `None`, this is my first diagonal character, so I'll set it. If it's *not* `None`, I'll immediately check if the current character is different.  If it is, the \"X\" is broken, and I can immediately output \"NO\" and stop processing.\n\nIf the cell is *not* on a diagonal, I'll repeat the same comparison against `other_char`, updating it or returning \"NO\" if there's a mismatch.\n\nOnce I've iterated through the entire grid without finding any violations, I know the diagonals are uniform, and the non-diagonals are uniform. The final check is simply to ensure `diagonal_char` is different from `other_char`. If they are, it's an \"X\", and I print \"YES\"; otherwise, I print \"NO\". This approach feels solid and should handle the rules correctly.\n",
