The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Rock-Paper-Scissors Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem, and I need to whip up a Python script to solve it.  Two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, are playing *n* rounds, and they both have cyclic strategies defined by sequences *A* and *B*, respectively.  My goal is to figure out the total number of losses for each player.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the game's rules.  Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. Draws are irrelevant here; only losses matter.\n\nThe input's pretty straightforward: *n* (number of rounds), sequence *A*, and sequence *B*. The output should be the number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, separated by a space.\n\nNow, I've noticed a crucial detail: the strategies are *cyclic*.  Nikephoros's choice in round *i* is simply *A[i % m]*, and similarly for Polycarpus.  This means the combined sequence of choices will also be cyclic. The length of this combined cycle is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the sequences, *m* and *k*.  So, I'll need to calculate `lcm(m, k)`.  Since *m* and *k* are at most 1000, the LCM shouldn't be too large, likely around a million or less, which is manageable.\n\nHere's my general strategy:\n\n1.  **Calculate GCD and LCM:** I'll use the `gcd` function (Python's `math` module has it) and the relationship `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)` to get the cycle length, `cycle_len`.\n2.  **Simulate a Full Cycle:** I'll iterate through `cycle_len` rounds, simulating the game.  For each round, I'll determine the moves of each player using the cyclic sequences *A* and *B*. Then I'll compare the moves, and increment the loss counter for the player who loses. I'll maintain two variables, `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle` and `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle` for that.\n3.  **Calculate Losses for *n* Rounds:** I can calculate how many full cycles fit into the total rounds *n*. I'll multiply the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds (the remainder after division) need to be simulated manually, just like step 2.\n4.  **Simulate Remaining Rounds:** I'll iterate again, simulating the remaining rounds and updating the loss counters.\n5.  **Print the Results:**  I'll print `total_nikephoros_losses` and `total_polycarpus_losses`.\n\nTo simplify the winner determination, I'll create a helper function, possibly `who_loses(move_n, move_p)`. This function will return which player lost (Nikephoros, Polycarpus, or draw) based on the moves played.  A dictionary lookup for the \"beats\" relation seems like a neat and concise way to do this.\n\nI'll check the constraints to make sure my approach is efficient. The number of rounds can go up to 2\\*10<sup>9</sup>, which means a simulation for each round is too slow. Fortunately, because I only need to simulate cycles (which have the length that is a function of *m* and *k*), and *m* and *k* are at most 1000.  The `O(m*k)` time complexity of simulating one cycle is acceptable.  Also, Python's `math.gcd` is optimized, so the `gcd` computation will be very fast.  The space complexity is just `O(m+k)` to store the sequences, which is fine.\n\nI'll define some test cases and perform thorough testing to ensure the correctness of my code and confirm it handles all edge cases. I'll make sure it runs correctly and produces the correct output according to the problem description, and I'll implement it!\n",
