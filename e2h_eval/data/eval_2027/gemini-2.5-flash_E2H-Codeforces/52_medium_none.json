Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for Solving the \"New Year Candles\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem's pretty straightforward, it's about maximizing how long Vasily can keep his room lit with candles, given that he starts with some new ones and can craft new ones from burned-out candles. The key is to act *optimally*.\n\nFirst, I figured out the core variables: `total_hours` to track the answer, `new_candles` for candles currently available, and `burned_out_remainder` to hold onto the burned-out candles that *don't* quite make a new one (leftovers from crafting).\n\nThen, I focused on the iterative process: I need a loop that runs as long as Vasily has any candles. Inside the loop, here's what happens in each \"round\":\n1.  Light all the `new_candles`. Add that number to `total_hours`.\n2.  These candles are now burned out, so, I combine them with any leftovers from the last crafting (`burned_out_remainder`).\n3. Calculate how many new candles Vasily can *craft* from these burned out candles (`total_burned_out_now // b`).\n4. Any leftovers from the crafting process, get stored in the variable `burned_out_remainder` (`total_burned_out_now % b`).\n5. Update `new_candles` for the next round to be the newly crafted candles.\n\nI ran through the example cases to confirm the logic. The main thing is to ensure that the process correctly handles the \"leftover\" burned out candles. \n\nThe most common competitive programming setup is to read multiple lines, but this problem statement has a hint that it might just be a single input line. Given that the problem says \"The single line contains two integers, a and b\", it means I need to read one line, split it into two integers, and then call the function with those parameters, and print the resulting total_hours value.\n\nSo, in the end, it's a simple, neat loop. The only trick is keeping track of those leftovers so they can contribute to crafting the next batch of candles. I tested with the provided examples and some edge cases, and it works. I'm ready to submit.\n",
