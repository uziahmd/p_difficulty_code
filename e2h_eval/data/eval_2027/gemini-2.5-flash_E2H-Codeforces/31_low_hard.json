Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Vanya and Cards: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The core of this is about achieving a target sum of zero using cards with values ranging from -x to x. The input gives me `n` existing cards, their values, and the `x` value constraint. My goal is to determine the *minimum* number of additional cards needed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the *current* sum, `S`, of the existing cards is. Then, I define `target_sum` as `-S`, essentially what I need to *add* to make the total zero.\n\nIf `target_sum` is zero, I'm done. No more cards are needed. But if it's not zero, the optimization part begins. To minimize the number of additional cards, I need each card to contribute as much as possible towards reaching that `target_sum`. This means using the maximum possible absolute value, either `x` or `-x`, depending on the sign of the `target_sum`.\n\nTo calculate the minimum, I'll take the absolute value of `target_sum` and divide by `x`. The result, after applying the ceiling function, will give me the optimal number of cards to minimize the required count.\n\nFor example, if `S` is 5 and `x` is 2, my `target_sum` would be -5. To reach -5, I’d take the ceiling of (abs(-5) / 2) = ceil(2.5) = 3 cards. If I get `S` as -7 and `x` as 3, the ceiling of (abs(7)/3) = ceil(2.33) = 3 is the correct approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to make the sum of all cards equal to zero. Vanya has already found `n` cards, and the maximum absolute value a card can have is `x`. He can find infinitely many cards with any integer value from `-x` to `x`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of the `n` cards Vanya has already found. Let this sum be `current_sum`.\n\nVanya wants the final sum of all cards (existing + new) to be zero. If he finds `k` additional cards with values `c_1, c_2, ..., c_k`, then the total sum will be `current_sum + c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_k`. He wants this to be 0.\nSo, `c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_k = -current_sum`.\n\nLet `target_sum_for_new_cards = -current_sum`.\n\nWe need to find the minimum `k` such that the sum of `k` cards, each with an absolute value not exceeding `x`, equals `target_sum_for_new_cards`.\n\nTo minimize the number of cards `k`, we should make each new card contribute as much as possible towards `target_sum_for_new_cards`. The maximum absolute value a single card can have is `x`.\n\n*   If `target_sum_for_new_cards` is positive, we should use cards with value `x`.\n*   If `target_sum_for_new_cards` is negative, we should use cards with value `-x`.\n*   If `target_sum_for_new_cards` is zero, we don't need any additional cards.\n\nIn general, each additional card can contribute at most `x` to the absolute value of the sum.\nSo, the minimum number of cards `k` required will be `ceil(abs(target_sum_for_new_cards) / x)`.\nThe `ceil` function (ceiling) rounds a number up to the nearest integer. This can be calculated using integer division: `(abs(target_sum_for_new_cards) + x - 1) // x` for positive `x`.\n\nLet's walk through the examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n`n = 3, x = 2`\nCards: `-1, 1, 2`\n\n1.  Calculate `current_sum`: `-1 + 1 + 2 = 2`.\n2.  Calculate `target_sum_for_new_cards`: `-current_sum = -2`.\n3.  Calculate minimum cards `k`: `ceil(abs(-2) / 2) = ceil(2 / 2) = ceil(1) = 1`.\nVanya needs to find 1 card. A card with value `-2` would make the total sum `2 + (-2) = 0`.\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n`n = 2, x = 3`\nCards: `-2, -2`\n\n1.  Calculate `current_sum`: `-2 + (-2) = -4`.\n2.  Calculate `target_sum_for_new_cards`: `-current_sum = -(-4) = 4`.\n3.  Calculate minimum cards `k`: `ceil(abs(4) / 3) = ceil(4 / 3) = ceil(1.33...) = 2`.\nVanya needs to find 2 cards. For example, two cards with value `2` would sum to `4`. The total sum would be `-4 + 2 + 2 = 0`. He cannot find a single card with value `4` because `4 > x = 3`.\n\nThe solution involves:\n1. Reading `n` and `x`.\n2. Reading the `n` card values and calculating their sum.\n3. Taking the absolute value of this sum.\n4. Dividing this absolute sum by `x` and rounding up to the nearest integer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and x\n    n, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Read the n card values\n    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the found cards\n    current_sum = sum(cards)\n\n    # The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the current sum\n    # We are interested in the absolute value of this target sum\n    abs_target_sum_for_new_cards = abs(current_sum)\n\n    # If the current sum is already zero, no new cards are needed\n    if abs_target_sum_for_new_cards == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        # To find the minimum number of cards, we divide the absolute\n        # target sum by the maximum possible value on a single card (x)\n        # and round up to the nearest integer.\n        # This can be done using math.ceil or integer division trick.\n        # k = math.ceil(abs_target_sum_for_new_cards / x)\n        k = (abs_target_sum_for_new_cards + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
