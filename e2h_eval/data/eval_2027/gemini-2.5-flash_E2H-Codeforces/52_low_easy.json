Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**New Year Candles Problem: A Simulation Approach**\n\nAlright, I'm looking at this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and it's pretty straightforward, but I need to be careful with the details. Vasily starts with `a` candles, each burning for an hour.  He can then make a new candle from `b` spent ones. The goal is to maximize the total burn time.  It screams \"simulation\" to me.\n\nMy strategy is clear: I'll maintain three variables: `total_hours`, `current_new_candles`, and `burned_out_candles`. I'll initialize them with `total_hours = 0`, `current_new_candles = a`, and `burned_out_candles = 0`.  Then, I'll simulate the burning process step by step, which will be within a `while` loop, as long as `current_new_candles` remains greater than zero.\n\nIn each iteration, I'll first *burn* all my current candles:  add `current_new_candles` to `total_hours`, increment `burned_out_candles` by the same amount, and then reset `current_new_candles` to zero because they are now spent.  Then, I'll *make* new candles.  I'll use integer division (`//`) to figure out how many new candles I can create from `burned_out_candles`. This result will be added to `current_new_candles`.  The remainder from the division (using the modulo operator `%`) is what's left over - `burned_out_candles` will then be set to this remainder.\n\nLet's walk through an example to be certain. Let's say `a = 4` and `b = 2`.  Initially, I have 4 new candles.\n\n*   **Iteration 1:** I burn 4, and `total_hours` becomes 4.  I then have 4 burnt candles. I can create 2 new candles from the burnt ones. `current_new_candles` becomes 2, and `burned_out_candles` becomes 0.\n*   **Iteration 2:** I burn those 2 new candles. `total_hours` becomes 6. Now I have 2 burnt ones, which allows me to create 1 more.  `current_new_candles` becomes 1, and `burned_out_candles` is 0.\n*   **Iteration 3:** I burn the last candle, giving us 7 total hours of burn time. The burnt candle can't make a new one, so the loop terminates.\n\nEssentially, this is a clean and efficient simulation.  I'll continue this until I can't generate any more new candles. This loop terminates once I have no new candles and cannot convert burned ones to new ones. The final `total_hours` is my answer. I'm ready to code this up in Python!\n",
