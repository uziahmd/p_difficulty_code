Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown & Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Find Maximum\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, I'm given an array `a` of integers, and a function `f(x)` that calculates a sum based on the bits of `x` and corresponding elements of `a`. The core of the problem is finding the *maximum* value of `f(x)` within a specified range from 0 up to `m`, where `m` is presented as a binary string `s`.\n\nI immediately recognize this as a bit manipulation problem with a constraint, making me think of digit DP or a greedy approach. The trick is understanding how `m` is represented. The binary string `s` is actually a reversed representation of the bits of `m`. The most significant bit of `m` is at the beginning of `s`, and the least significant bit at the end. That means `s[0]` is the bit corresponding to `2^(n-1)`, `s[1]` corresponds to `2^(n-2)`, and so on. Also, the problem defines the `f(x)` using bit(i), usually the bit(i) means 2^i, that's why, when iterating through `s`, `s_{n-1}` corresponds to `a_0`, `s_{n-2}` corresponds to `a_1`, and so on.\n\nThe main objective is to maximize the sum of `a_i * bit(i)`, with the constraint that `x` must be less than or equal to `m`. It feels like a standard bit manipulation problem, where I iterate through the bits of `x` from most to least significant, making choices.\n\nI think a greedy strategy is suitable here. I'll maintain a `tight` flag to indicate whether my current `x` is still constrained by the digits of `m`. If `tight` is true, then if I set the current bit of `x` to `1` I must ensure it is within the bounds of `m`. If `tight` is false, it means I've already made `x` smaller than `m`, so I can just greedily select the bit that gives the maximum value. I'll need to keep track of the current sum, which is `max_f_x`.\n\nSo, the plan is to iterate from the MSB of `x` to the LSB, making choices at each bit position based on `tight` and aiming to maximize the running sum. This feels like the right path to a clean and efficient solution.\n",
