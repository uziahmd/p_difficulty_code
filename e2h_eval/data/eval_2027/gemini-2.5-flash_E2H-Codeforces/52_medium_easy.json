Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Candle Conundrum: A Pythonic Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break down this \"New Year Candles\" problem. My objective is crystal clear: craft a Python script to determine the maximum burn time. It's a classic simulation problem, and the constraints are pleasantly small, making it perfectly amenable to a straightforward, iterative approach.\n\nHere's my thought process. The core of the problem lies in the cyclical nature of candle burning and crafting. We begin with `a` new candles and a crafting ratio of `b`.  Each cycle involves lighting the current candles (`hours_lit += current_new_candles`), accumulating the used candles (`burned_out_candles += current_new_candles`), and then calculating how many new candles can be \"recycled\" from the burnt-out ones (`new_from_crafting = burned_out_candles // b`). This `new_from_crafting` count then becomes the starting point for the next cycle. We need to continuously light, burn, and craft until we no longer have enough burned-out candles to create new ones.\n\nThe crucial loop condition is `current_new_candles > 0`. We stop when there are no more new candles to burn.\n\nWe'll use a few key variables:\n*   `hours_lit`: The cumulative sum of burn time.\n*   `current_new_candles`: The number of candles Vasily has to light in the current iteration.\n*   `burned_out_candles`: The candles that cannot be burned and have been used.\n\nInitially, `hours_lit = 0`, `current_new_candles = a`, and `burned_out_candles = 0`. In the main loop, we update these variables appropriately with each iteration.\n\nThe calculations for new and burned out candle counts are: `new_from_crafting = burned_out_candles // b` and `burned_out_candles = burned_out_candles % b`.\n\nThis iterative approach captures the essence of the process and will compute the required solution efficiently.\n\nLet's quickly check edge cases. If `b=1` we are burning candles and crafting new ones, meaning at each cycle we have one more candle. If `b > a`, then no more new candles will be crafted.\n\nBased on the problem statement \"The single line contains two integers\", it seems a single input line is expected, not multiple test cases. We need to take the input as a string, split the line, convert the strings to integers and apply the logic, printing a single integer representing the total burn time.\n\nHere's the Python code I've settled on:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(line[0])\n    b = int(line[1])\n\n    hours_lit = 0\n    current_new_candles = a\n    burned_out_candles = 0\n\n    while current_new_candles > 0:\n        hours_lit += current_new_candles\n        burned_out_candles += current_new_candles\n        \n        new_from_crafting = burned_out_candles // b\n        burned_out_candles = burned_out_candles % b\n        \n        current_new_candles = new_from_crafting\n        \n    print(hours_lit)\n\nsolve()\n```\nIt appears complete and correct. We will proceed with this implementation.\n",
