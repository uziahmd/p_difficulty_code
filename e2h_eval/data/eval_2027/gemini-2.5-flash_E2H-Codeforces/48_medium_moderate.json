            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Conversion Between Number Bases**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to write a Python script that takes a number in a given base (`a`) and converts it to another base (`b`). The input comes in as two lines: the bases `a` and `b` (with `b` potentially being 'R' for Roman numerals), and then the number itself as a string `c` in base `a`. We're given some constraints: both `a` and `b` are between 2 and 25 (inclusive), the string `c` is up to 1000 characters long, and if `b` is 'R', the base 10 equivalent of `c` is limited to 3000.  The main strategy is to break this down into steps: read the inputs, convert the number `c` to its decimal (base 10) value, and then convert that decimal value to the target base `b`.\n\nFirst, I'll need to handle reading the input from standard input, parsing `a`, `b`, and `c`. I'll also need some helper functions. Since the bases can be greater than 10, I have to handle digits 'A' through 'O' representing 10 to 24. So I'll need a way to convert between these character digits and their integer equivalents. Then, to convert from any base to decimal, I'll iterate through the input string `c` from left to right, multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the digit.  This naturally handles any leading zeros. The second step is to convert this number from decimal to either the target base, or to Roman numerals.\n\nIf the target base is an integer, I can do this with the repeated division method. I repeatedly divide the decimal value by the target base, record the remainders (which are the digits in the new base), and build the result string by reversing these remainders. The `from_decimal` function will handle this. The function will also omit leading zeros except for the case when decimal_val equals to zero.\n\nThe tricky part is the Roman numeral conversion.  The Roman numeral system has some specific rules (e.g., subtractive notation).  I'll implement a function `to_roman` that uses a greedy approach. I'll define a list of Roman numeral values (1000, 900, 500, etc.) paired with their symbols, and iterate through this list, subtracting the largest possible value from the input number and appending the corresponding symbol.  This approach will handle all valid Roman numeral representations up to 3000, as required by the problem statement. The edge case \"0\" is not handled since we are guaranteed the number won't be zero when converted to Roman numerals.\n\nTo implement the whole program, I'll read `a`, `b`, and `c` from standard input, use `to_decimal` to convert `c` to decimal, and then use either `from_decimal` (for integer bases) or `to_roman` (for 'R') to convert the decimal value to the desired output. Finally, I'll print the result to standard output. I've considered some example inputs and edge cases, and I believe my strategy covers them all. Now I need to implement the Python functions.\n",
