The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Calculating Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses Efficiently**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The core is figuring out the losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus across a huge number of rounds, up to 2 billion.  The real trick here is that their strategies are cyclic. Nikephoros has a repeating sequence, *A*, and Polycarpus has *B*.\n\nMy immediate thought is that simulating every single round is a total non-starter.  *n* is just too massive. But *A* and *B* have relatively small lengths, *m* and *k* (at most 1000).  That's where the cyclic nature comes in.\n\nThe combined play pattern must also be cyclic. The cycle length will be the least common multiple of *m* and *k*, the cycle length of each player's sequence.  Calculating that LCM is key. I'll need a Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) function to get there, but luckily Python's `math.gcd` is readily available.  The LCM, then, will be at most 1,000,000, which is perfectly manageable to simulate.\n\nSo, the game plan is this:\n\n1.  Read in *n*, *A*, and *B*.\n2.  Define a helper function, `get_winner()`, to quickly determine who wins in a single round, or if it's a draw.\n3.  Calculate the cycle length, `lcm(m, k)`.\n4.  Simulate *one* full cycle of the game, keeping track of the losses for both Nikephoros and Polycarpus.  For each round within the cycle, determine the winner. If Nikephoros wins, increment Polycarpus's losses. If Polycarpus wins, increment Nikephoros's losses.\n5.  With the losses from one cycle in hand, I can scale it up to the total number of rounds (*n*). I'll divide *n* by the cycle length to get the number of full cycles and multiply the losses from one cycle by this number. Then I'll handle any remaining rounds (the remainder after the division) individually to get the correct loss counts.\n\nThis cyclic approach should be efficient and accurate, avoiding that brute-force simulation. The constraints suggest this is the intended approach, so this is what I'm going to implement. I'm thinking of creating a function to handle the winner lookup as it will be used repeatedly.\n",
