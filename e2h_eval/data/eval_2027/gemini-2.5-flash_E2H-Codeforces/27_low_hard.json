On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving \"A Twisty Movement\" with Python**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"A Twisty Movement\" problem. Let's break this down.  The core idea is that we're given a sequence of 1s and 2s, and we can flip a subsegment and then maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the modified sequence.\n\n**Understanding the Problem & Constraints:**\n\nThe input sequence, `a`, has length `n` (up to 2000), and each element is either 1 or 2. We're choosing an interval `[l, r]` (0-indexed here for simplicity), reversing that segment, and finding the LNDS.  The ultimate goal is to find the *maximum* LNDS length achievable across *all* possible reversals. This sounds like an optimization problem.\n\n**Key Insight: Simplifying the LNDS for a 1/2 Sequence:**\n\nSince we're only dealing with 1s and 2s, the LNDS is pretty straightforward. It'll always be a bunch of 1s followed by a bunch of 2s. We can think of it as taking all the 1s up to some index and all the 2s from some index onward. In essence, it's a \"prefix of 1s and suffix of 2s\" structure. This means the LNDS length is equal to the number of 1s picked plus the number of 2s picked.\n\n**Calculating LNDS Without Reversal:**\n\nLet's say `count1[i]` stores the number of 1s up to index `i` (exclusive of `i`) and `count2[i]` stores the number of 2s from index `i` to the end.  If we consider a point `k` in the sequence, the potential LNDS length is simply `count1[k]` (1s from the beginning) plus `count2[k]` (2s from the end) – making sure to consider `k=0` and `k=n` as well. The LNDS length of the un-reversed sequence would be the maximum of all `count1[k] + count2[k]` for all possible splits.\n\n**Applying the Reversal Strategy:**\n\nNow, we need to consider the reversal part.  If we reverse a segment `[l, r]`, we modify the sequence.  To efficiently compute the LNDS after the reversal, I think I'll need to simulate the reversal, compute `count1` and `count2` *for the reversed segment*, then combine those with the unaltered portions of the sequence. Then,  for each possible reversal, I'll calculate `count1[k] + count2[k]` for all `k` and take the maximum.\n\nI'm thinking I'll need to loop through all possible `l` and `r` values.  For each `[l, r]` combination, I need to create the reversed sequence, then calculate the LNDS.  This approach *should* work, though I'll have to be mindful of efficiency as the length `n` can go up to 2000, so I want to avoid anything quadratic in the reversal and LNDS calculations to stay under the time limit.  I think I can optimize this further...Let's translate this into Python!\n",
