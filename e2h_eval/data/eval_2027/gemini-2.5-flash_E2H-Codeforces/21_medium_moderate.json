The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey: Neko Finds Grapes**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm staring down the \"Neko Finds Grapes\" problem, and my mind's already dissecting it. We've got `n` chests with numbers and `m` keys, each with their own number. A key opens a chest if their sum is odd – the classic parity game. The goal? Maximize the opened chests, keeping in mind each key/chest can be used only once.\n\nFirst things first: odd plus even equals odd. That's the core. So, I'm thinking, let's count the even and odd chests, and the even and odd keys. Call them `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`. Now, here's the crucial observation: even chests *must* pair with odd keys, and odd chests *must* pair with even keys. These pairings are totally independent.\n\nTo maximize, I'm going to find how many even chests I can open with odd keys. It's limited by the *smaller* number: either the count of even chests or the count of odd keys. That's `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`. Similarly, the number of opened odd chests by even keys is limited by `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. And these pairings are totally separate, so the overall answer is the sum: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nI ran through an example case, and it checked out perfectly, matching the provided output. The constraints say `n, m <= 10^5`, so I'm not worried about the time complexity of a simple loop to count the even/odd chests and keys. This solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), which is more than sufficient. The storage complexity looks like O(N+M) for input, but it's really just O(1) in addition to input when using standard python.\n\nNow, time to build the Python script. I'll read `n` and `m`, then the lists `a` and `b`. Inside the main part, I'll count the evens and odds, and then apply that formula I derived. To keep things clean, I'll create a solve function. I used edge cases, even where n and m equal 1 and various combinations of odd and even values to ensure that the logic is correct and handled all cases, including when input a and input b are empty. A quick check of the given examples confirmed that my solution is working. I also did some extra checks to ensure that the solution has no memory or time constraint violations. After all that, I was happy to finalize the solution.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that the sum of the chest number and the key number must be odd. This condition is satisfied in two distinct cases:\n1. `a_i` is an even number and `b_j` is an odd number (Even + Odd = Odd).\n2. `a_i` is an odd number and `b_j` is an even number (Odd + Even = Odd).\n\nThese two types of pairings are mutually exclusive and independent. An even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key. Similarly, an odd key can only open an even chest, and an even key can only open an odd chest. This means we can count the maximum pairings for each case separately and sum them up.\n\nLet's categorize the chests and keys based on their parity:\n- Count of even-numbered chests: `chests_even`\n- Count of odd-numbered chests: `chests_odd`\n- Count of even-numbered keys: `keys_even`\n- Count of odd-numbered keys: `keys_odd`\n\nTo maximize the number of chests opened:\n\n**Case 1: Even chests opened by odd keys**\nWe have `chests_even` available even chests and `keys_odd` available odd keys. Each odd key can open one even chest. The maximum number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys is limited by whichever count is smaller.\n`opened_by_odd_keys = min(chests_even, keys_odd)`\n\n**Case 2: Odd chests opened by even keys**\nSimilarly, we have `chests_odd` available odd chests and `keys_even` available even keys. Each even key can open one odd chest. The maximum number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys is limited by whichever count is smaller.\n`opened_by_even_keys = min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\nSince these two types of pairings use different sets of chests (even vs. odd) and different sets of keys (odd vs. even), they do not conflict. Therefore, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the chests opened in these two independent scenarios.\n\n`Total maximum chests = opened_by_odd_keys + opened_by_even_keys`\n`Total maximum chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Read the list of chest numbers `a`.\n3. Read the list of key numbers `b`.\n4. Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n5. Iterate through `a`: if an element `x` is even (`x % 2 == 0`), increment `chests_even`; otherwise, increment `chests_odd`.\n6. Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n7. Iterate through `b`: if an element `x` is even (`x % 2 == 0`), increment `keys_even`; otherwise, increment `keys_odd`.\n8. Calculate `result = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n9. Print `result`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n- Time Complexity: Reading input takes O(N + M) time. Counting parities for chests takes O(N) time. Counting parities for keys takes O(M) time. The final calculation is O(1). Thus, the total time complexity is O(N + M), which is efficient enough for N, M up to `10^5`.\n- Space Complexity: Storing the input lists `a` and `b` takes O(N + M) space. The additional variables for counts take O(1) space.\n\nThis approach is optimal and handles all edge cases, including scenarios where there are no even/odd chests or keys.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the numbers on chests\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Read the numbers on keys\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Count even and odd chests\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    # Count even and odd keys\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n    # An even chest (a_i % 2 == 0) can only be opened by an odd key (b_j % 2 == 1).\n    # The number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of available even chests and odd keys.\n    opened_even_chests_by_odd_keys = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n    # An odd chest (a_i % 2 == 1) can only be opened by an even key (b_j % 2 == 0).\n    # The number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of available odd chests and even keys.\n    opened_odd_chests_by_even_keys = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n    # The total maximum is the sum of these two independent types of pairings.\n    total_opened_chests = opened_even_chests_by_odd_keys + opened_odd_chests_by_even_keys\n\n    # Print the result\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_opened_chests) + '\\n')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
