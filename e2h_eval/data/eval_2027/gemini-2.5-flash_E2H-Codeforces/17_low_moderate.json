He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Python Script: Unpacking the Prefix and Suffix Problem**\n\nAlright, let's get down to brass tacks. I've got this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem staring me in the face, and I need a Python script to crack it. The problem setup is straightforward, a bit of a classic, really. We're given the length of an unknown string `s`, denoted as `n`, and a collection of `2n - 2` strings. These strings are all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, each with a length between `1` and `n - 1`. The catch? We don't know which is which. The script's job is to output a string of 'P's and 'S's, clearly marking each input string as a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S').\n\nThe constraints are pretty helpful, though. We're guaranteed a consistent solution, meaning a valid string `s` exists. If there are multiple solutions, any will do. With that in mind, let's look at the key insights:\n1. For each possible length from 1 up to `n-1`, we should see precisely two strings: one prefix and one suffix.\n2. The prefix of length `n-1` is `s[0...n-2]` and the suffix of the same length is `s[1...n-1]`.\n3. If we identify the prefix and suffix of length `n-1`, call them `P_n_minus_1` and `S_n_minus_1` respectively, we can reconstruct the string `s`.\n4. The reconstruction is simple: by taking the prefix `P_n_minus_1` and appending the last character of `S_n_minus_1`, we obtain `s`. Or, alternatively, `s` is formed by taking the `S_n_minus_1` and prepending the first character of `P_n_minus_1`.\n\nThus, if we can identify these two strings of length `n-1`, the rest is straightforward. I should be able to create a script that efficiently identifies these strings, then iterates through the input, identifying prefixes and suffixes using the recovered string `s`. The final output will be that answer string comprised of 'P's and 'S's.\n",
