    "thought": "**The Gluttony Dilemma - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Gluttony problem staring me in the face, and it's a classic permutation puzzle.  The input's straightforward: an array `a` of distinct integers and its size `n`. The challenge?  Find a permutation `b` of `a` such that the sum of elements from *any* non-empty, non-full subset of indices in `a` is *different* from the sum of elements at those same indices in `b`.  If I can't find such a permutation, I've gotta return -1. And the small n constraint (<= 22) gives me a strong hint to look for subset or meet in the middle type solutions.\n\nThe core constraint, `sum(a[i] for i in S) != sum(b[i] for i in S)`, really got me thinking. I first tried to understand this condition in the most intuitive way possible, that the sums of elements selected from both arrays have to be different for any subset of indices. Since n <= 22, checking n! permutations isn't going to fly - the search space is just too vast.\n\nI initially thought that maybe a cyclic shift of the array *a* might work. But after testing, I realized that doesn't always work based on the examples. I have to find a systematic approach to tackle the problem and it seems that I have to explore the relationship between `a` and `b`.\n\nLet me think a bit more on how to solve this.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements `a_i` for `i` in `S` is different from the sum of elements `b_i` for `i` in `S`. The size of the array `n` is at most 22.\n\nLet `c_i = a_i - b_i`. The condition can be rewritten as `sum_{i in S} c_i != 0` for all non-empty proper subsets `S`.\nSince `b` is a permutation of `a`, the multiset `{b_0, ..., b_{n-1}}` is the same as `{a_0, ..., a_{n-1}}`. This implies that `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i`.\nTherefore, `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a_i - b_i) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i - sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i = 0`.\nThis means that the sum over the entire set of indices `S = {0, ..., n-1}` is always 0 for `c_i`. The problem explicitly excludes the full set from the condition.\n\nThe problem effectively asks us to find a permutation `b` such that the array `c = [a_0-b_0, ..., a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}]` has no non-empty proper subsegment sums equal to zero.\n\nA known property related to subset sums is that if we sort the array `a` and then construct `b` by cyclically shifting `a` by one position, it often satisfies conditions related to subset sums. Let's try this approach:\n1. Sort the input array `a` to get `a'`. Let `a'_0 <= a'_1 <= ... <= a'_{n-1}`.\n2. Construct `b'` as a cyclic shift of `a'`: `b'_i = a'_{(i+1)%n}`.\n3. The array `c'_i = a'_i - b'_i = a'_i - a'_{(i+1)%n}`.\n\nConsider `sum_{i in S} c'_i = sum_{i in S} (a'_i - a'_{(i+1)%n})`.\nIf `a'_i` are all distinct, then `a'_i - a'_{(i+1)%n}` will be non-zero for all `i` (except possibly if `n=1`, but `n=1` is trivial and always works, output `a_0`).\nIf `a'_i` are distinct, then `a'_i - a'_{(i+1)%n}` is positive for `i < n-1` and `a'_{n-1} - a'_0` can be positive or negative.\n\nA key insight is that if we sort the elements `a_i` and then apply a cyclic shift to form `b`, this configuration tends to maximize the \"spread\" of the differences `c_i`, making zero sums less likely.\nSpecifically, let `a` be sorted: `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\nLet `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}`.\nThen `c_i = a_i - a_{(i+1)%n}`.\nFor `i < n-1`, `c_i = a_i - a_{i+1} < 0`.\nFor `i = n-1`, `c_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0`.\n\nLet `S` be any non-empty proper subset of indices.\nIf `n=1`, `a=[a_0]`. There are no non-empty proper subsets. `b=[a_0]` works.\nIf `n > 1`:\nThe array `c` will have `n-1` negative values and one positive value.\nLet `C_neg = {c_0, ..., c_{n-2}}` and `C_pos = {c_{n-1}}`.\n`sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i = 0`.\n\nConsider `sum_{i in S} c_i`.\nIf `S` does not contain `n-1`: `sum_{i in S} c_i` is a sum of strictly negative numbers, so it must be strictly negative. Thus, it cannot be 0.\nIf `S` contains `n-1`: `sum_{i in S} c_i = c_{n-1} + sum_{i in S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}} c_i`.\nLet `S' = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`. `S'` can be empty or contain indices from `0` to `n-2`.\nSince `S` is a proper subset, it cannot contain all indices `0, ..., n-1`.\nIf `S' = \\emptyset`, then `S = \\{n-1\\}`, and `sum_{i in S} c_i = c_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0`. Since `a` has distinct elements, `a_{n-1} > a_0`, so `c_{n-1} > 0`. Thus, it cannot be 0.\nIf `S'` is not empty, `sum_{i in S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}} c_i` is a sum of one or more strictly negative numbers, so it is strictly negative.\nLet `X = sum_{i in S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}} c_i`. We have `X < 0`.\nWe need to check if `c_{n-1} + X = 0`. This is equivalent to `c_{n-1} = -X`.\nSince `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i = 0`, we have `c_{n-1} + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i = 0`.\nSo, `c_{n-1} = -sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i`.\nThe condition `c_{n-1} + X = 0` means `-sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i + X = 0`.\nThis implies `X = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i`.\nThis can only happen if `S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}` is exactly the set `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nIn that case, `S = \\{0, ..., n-2, n-1\\}`, which is the full set of indices.\nHowever, the problem statement explicitly excludes the full set of indices from consideration.\nTherefore, for any non-empty proper subset `S`, `sum_{i in S} c_i` will not be 0.\n\nThis strategy guarantees a solution.\nThe steps are:\n1. Read `n` and array `a`.\n2. Store the original indices along with values to reconstruct the permutation `b` in the original order. A common way is to store pairs `(a_i, i)`.\n3. Sort these pairs based on `a_i`. Let the sorted array be `sorted_a_with_indices`.\n4. Create the `b` array. For each `k` from `0` to `n-1`, `b[original_index_of_a_k]` should be `a_{(k+1)%n}` from the sorted array.\n   Let `(val_k, original_idx_k)` be the `k`-th element in `sorted_a_with_indices`.\n   Let `(val_next_k, original_idx_next_k)` be the `(k+1)%n`-th element in `sorted_a_with_indices`.\n   Then `b[original_idx_k]` should be `val_next_k`.\n5. Print the constructed `b` array.\n\nExample 1: `n=2`, `a=[1, 2]`\n1. `a_with_indices = [(1, 0), (2, 1)]`\n2. `sorted_a_with_indices = [(1, 0), (2, 1)]` (already sorted)\n3. Initialize `b = [0, 0]`\n   - `k=0`: `(val_0, original_idx_0) = (1, 0)`. `(val_1, original_idx_1) = (2, 1)`.\n     `b[original_idx_0] = val_1` => `b[0] = 2`.\n   - `k=1`: `(val_1, original_idx_1) = (2, 1)`. `(val_0, original_idx_0) = (1, 0)`. (index `(1+1)%2 = 0`)\n     `b[original_idx_1] = val_0` => `b[1] = 1`.\n4. `b = [2, 1]`. Output: `2 1`. Matches example.\n\nExample 2: `n=4`, `a=[1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n1. `a_with_indices = [(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n2. `sorted_a_with_indices = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   Let's label them:\n   `s_0 = (1, 3)`\n   `s_1 = (10, 2)`\n   `s_2 = (100, 1)`\n   `s_3 = (1000, 0)`\n3. Initialize `b = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - `k=0`: `s_0 = (1, 3)`. `s_1 = (10, 2)`.\n     `b[s_0.original_idx] = s_1.val` => `b[3] = 10`.\n   - `k=1`: `s_1 = (10, 2)`. `s_2 = (100, 1)`.\n     `b[s_1.original_idx] = s_2.val` => `b[2] = 100`.\n   - `k=2`: `s_2 = (100, 1)`. `s_3 = (1000, 0)`.\n     `b[s_2.original_idx] = s_3.val` => `b[1] = 1000`.\n   - `k=3`: `s_3 = (1000, 0)`. `s_0 = (1, 3)`. (index `(3+1)%4 = 0`)\n     `b[s_3.original_idx] = s_0.val` => `b[0] = 1`.\n4. `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`. Output: `1 1000 100 10`.\nThis output is different from the example output `100 1 1000 10`, but it should also be a valid solution according to the logic. The problem states \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\"\n\nThe proof works for any `n >= 1`.\nThe time complexity will be dominated by sorting, which is `O(N log N)`. `N=22` makes this very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Store pairs of (value, original_index)\n    # This is necessary to reconstruct 'b' in the original order of 'a'\n    a_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        a_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort based on values\n    # sorted_a_with_indices will be [(val_0, orig_idx_0), (val_1, orig_idx_1), ...]\n    # where val_0 < val_1 < ...\n    sorted_a_with_indices = sorted(a_with_indices)\n\n    # Initialize b with zeros.
