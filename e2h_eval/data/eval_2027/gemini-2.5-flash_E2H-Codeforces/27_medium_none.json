On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "**A Twisty Path to the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"A Twisty Movement\" problem. The gist is: given a sequence of 1s and 2s, we can reverse a segment of it and then need to figure out the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the modified sequence. The goal is to maximize this LNDS length over all possible reversals.\n\nThe LNDS will be a sequence that looks like a bunch of 1s followed by a bunch of 2s. The key is to find the best split point where the 1s end and the 2s begin.  Since there are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is simply the count of 1s plus the count of 2s in that chosen split.\n\nInitially, I thought brute force – trying all possible reversals and calculating the LNDS each time – might work.  But, with the constraints (sequence length up to 2000), that approach gets too slow with `O(N^3)` complexity.\n\nI started thinking about how to optimize. Precomputing prefix sums of 1s and 2s looked promising. I can use them to calculate the LNDS after any reversal. I can represent the LNDS as `max_i (count of 1s before i + count of 2s after i)`. This helps me define the LNDS of the new array for a particular reversal.\n\nA crucial observation: the LNDS for an interval is independent of other elements. We can partition the sequence for a particular reversal into three parts: the prefix (elements before reversal), the reversed segment, and the suffix (elements after reversal). The LNDS calculation then becomes about counting 1s and 2s appropriately within the reversed segment.\n\nThe key insight is that for a fixed reversal (l, r), let `j` be an index representing the split point, this will map to original array indices, in particular in the reversed part, such as `r - (j - l)`, this calculation can replace the iteration on `i` with `j` from `l` to `r` in the reversed segment to the index in the original array after reversal. Thus, the LNDS calculation should now be: `max_l, r {max_l <= j <= r} (function(l,j, r))`.\n\nI can precompute the number of 1s and 2s up to any point (prefix sums) and starting from any point (suffix sums). With `l` and `r` representing the start and end of the reversal segment, for any split point `j`, it will consist of `(j - l)` element from the reversal. This, combined with the number of 1 and 2 elements, turns into the formula `val[l] + val[r+1] + rev_val[j+1] + c2[n]`. We want to maximize this.\n\nMy refined approach involves an outer loop for the start (`l`) of the reversal, an inner loop for the end (`r`) of the reversal segment. In that inner loop, I am maintaining the maximum value of the segment, such that I can compute the final LNDS in O(1).\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after performing at most one reversal of a subsegment `a[l...r]`. The elements of the sequence are restricted to 1s and 2s.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1.  **LNDS with 1s and 2s:** A non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s will always have the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. This means we pick some number of 1s, followed by some number of 2s. To maximize the length, we should pick all 1s that appear before or at some \"split point\" and all 2s that appear after or at that split point.\n    Formally, for a sequence `b` of length `n`, the length of its LNDS is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count of 1s in b[0...k-1] + count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`. Here, `k` represents the first index where a 2 could appear in the subsequence, or `k=0` if all elements are 2s, or `k=n` if all elements are 1s.\n\n2.  **Effect of Reversal:** When we reverse a segment `a[l...r]` (0-indexed), the new sequence `b` is formed by:\n    `a[0...l-1]` (prefix, unchanged)\n    `reversed(a[l...r])` (middle segment, reversed)\n    `a[r+1...n-1]` (suffix, unchanged)\n\n**Algorithm Breakdown:**\n\nLet's define prefix sums for convenience:\n*   `c1[i]`: count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`. `c1[0] = 0`.\n*   `c2[i]`: count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`. `c2[0] = 0`.\n\nThe total number of 1s in the array is `c1[n]`, and total 2s is `c2[n]`. These counts do not change after reversal.\n\nFor a given `l`, `r` (0-indexed, `0 <= l <= r < n`), we form `b`. We then need to find `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count_1s_in_b_prefix_k + count_2s_in_b_suffix_k)`.\n\nLet's analyze the `k` (split point) cases:\n\n*   **Case 1: `k <= l` (split point before or at the start of the reversed segment)**\n    `count_1s_in_b_prefix_k = c1[k]` (from `a[0...k-1]`)\n    `count_2s_in_b_suffix_k = (c2[l] - c2[k]) + (c2[r+1] - c2[l]) + (c2[n] - c2[r+1]) = c2[n] - c2[k]`.\n    The sum is `c1[k] + c2[n] - c2[k]`. This is the same as if no reversal happened.\n\n*   **Case 2: `k > r` (split point after the end of the reversed segment)**\n    `count_1s_in_b_prefix_k = c1[l] + (c1[r+1] - c1[l]) + (c1[k] - c1[r+1]) = c1[k]`.\n    `count_2s_in_b_suffix_k = c2[n] - c2[k]`.\n    The sum is `c1[k] + c2[n] - c2[k]`. This is also the same as if no reversal happened.\n\n*   **Case 3: `l < k <= r+1` (split point inside the reversed segment `a[l...r]`)**\n    This is the crucial part. The split point `k` in the `b` array corresponds to splitting the original segment `a[l...r]` at some internal point `j`.\n    Specifically, the elements `a[0...l-1]` are taken as 1s.\n    Then, from `a[l...r]` (which is `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]` after reversal), we take 1s from `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[j+1]` and 2s from `a[j], a[j-1], ..., a[l]`.\n    Finally, `a[r+1...n-1]` are taken as 2s.\n\n    The total count of 1s will be `c1[l] + (count of 1s in a[j+1...r])`.\n    The total count of 2s will be `(count of 2s in a[l...j]) + (c2[n] - c2[r+1])`.\n\n    Using prefix sums:\n    `count_1s_total = c1[l] + (c1[r+1] - c1[j+1])`.\n    `count_2s_total = (c2[j+1] - c2[l]) + (c2[n] - c2[r+1])`.\n\n    The sum for a given `l, r, j` is:\n    `S(l, r, j) = c1[l] + c1[r+1] - c1[j+1] + c2[j+1] - c2[l] + c2[n] - c2[r+1]`.\n    This simplifies to:\n    `S(l, r, j) = (c1[l] - c2[l]) + (c1[r+1] - c2[r+1]) + (c2[j+1] - c1[j+1]) + c2[n]`.\n\n    We need to maximize this `S(l, r, j)` over all `0 <= l <= r < n` and `l <= j <= r`.\n    Notice that `c2[n]` is a constant (total number of 2s in the original array). We can add it at the end.\n    Let `val[x] = c1[x] - c2[x]` and `rev_val[x] = c2[x] - c1[x]`.\n    The expression to maximize becomes `val[l] + val[r+1] + rev_val[j+1]`.\n\n**Efficient Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Precomputation:**\n    *   Compute `c1` and `c2` arrays of size `n+1`.\n    *   Compute `val` and `rev_val` arrays of size `n+1`.\n\n2.  **Initial Max LNDS:**\n    Calculate the LNDS of the original array (no reversal). This is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (c1[k] + c2[n] - c2[k])`. Initialize `max_overall_lnds` with this value. This handles Cases 1 and 2 implicitly for all `l, r` combinations, as well as the case of no reversal.\n\n3.  **Iterate `l` and `r`:**\n    We need to maximize `val[l] + val[r+1] + rev_val[j+1]` for `0 <= l <= j <= r < n`.\n    We can iterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`.\n    For each `l`, we iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\n    For fixed `l` and `r`, we need to find `max_{l <= j <= r} (rev_val[j+1])`. This is equivalent to `max_{l+1 <= k_prime <= r+1} (rev_val[k_prime])`.\n    This inner maximum can be maintained efficiently:\n    Initialize `current_max_rev_val_in_middle = -infinity`.\n    As `r` increases, `r+1` also increases. We just need to update `current_max_rev_val_in_middle = max(current_max_rev_val_in_middle, rev_val[r+1])`.\n    Then, for the current `l` and `r`, the LNDS contribution from Case 3 is `val[l] + val[r+1] + current_max_rev_val_in_middle + c2[n]`. Update `max_overall_lnds`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Precomputation: `O(N)`\n*   Initial LNDS: `O(N)`\n*   Nested loops for `l` and `r`: `O(N^2)` iterations. Inside the loop, `current_max_rev_val_in_middle` is updated in `O(1)`.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(N^2)`.\n*   Space complexity: `O(N)` for prefix sum arrays.\n\nGiven `N=2000`, `N^2 = 4 * 10^6`, which is efficient enough.\n\n**Example 1: `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, n = 4**\n`c1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`c2 = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n`val = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`\n`rev_val = [0, -1, 1, -1, 2]`\n`c2[n] = c2[4] = 2`\n\n**Initial LNDS (no reversal):**\n`k=0: c1[0] + c2[4]-c2[0] = 0 + 2-0 = 2`\n`k=1: c1[1] + c2[4]-c2[1] = 1 + 2-0 = 3`\n`k=2: c1[2] + c2[4]-c2[2] = 1 + 2-1 = 2`\n`k=3: c1[3] + c2[4]-c2[3] = 2 + 2-1 = 3`\n`k=4: c1[4] + c2[4]-c2[4] = 2 + 2-2 = 2`\n`max_overall_lnds = 3`\n\n**Iterate l, r:**\n`l=0`:\n  `r=0`: `j=0`. `val[0]+val[1]+rev_val[1] = 0+1+(-1) = 0`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 0+2) = 3`.\n  `r=1`: `j=0,1`. `current_max_rev_val_in_middle = max(rev_val[1], rev_val[2]) = max(-1, 1) = 1`.\n         `val[0]+val[2]+current_max_rev_val_in_middle = 0+0+1 = 1`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 1+2) = 3`.\n  `r=2`: `j=0,1,2`. `current_max_rev_val_in_middle = max(1, rev_val[3]) = max(1, -1) = 1`.\n         `val[0]+val[3]+current_max_rev_val_in_middle = 0+1+1 = 2`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 2+2) = 4`.\n         (This corresponds to reversing `a[0...2] = [1,2,1]` to `[1,1,2]`.

The LNDS of `[1,1,2,2]` is indeed 4.\n           The formula `val[l] + val[r+1] + rev_val[j+1] + c2[n]` calculates the LNDS when the split point `k` is *within* the reversed segment.\n           If the optimal split point `k` for `b` is *outside* the reversed segment `[l, r]`, then the LNDS is `c1[k] + c2[n] - c2[k]`.\n           My `max_overall_lnds` variable is initialized with the LNDS of the original array, which covers all `k` outside `[l,r]` for any `l,r`.\n           So `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, val[l] + val[r+1] + current_max_rev_val_in_middle + c2[n])` is correct.\n           The example output is 4. My calculation for `l=1, r=2` gives 5.\n           What if `a[l...j]` or `a[j+1...r]` is empty?\n           `j_orig` ranges from `l` to `r`.\n           If `j_orig = l-1`, it means all elements in `a[l...r]` are 1s.\n           If `j_orig = r`, it means all elements in `a[l...r]` are 2s.\n           The indices `j_orig+1` for `rev_val` should be correct.\n\n           Let's re-check the definition of LNDS: `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count of 1s in b[0...k-1] + count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`.\n           For `b = [1,1,2,2]`:\n           `k=0`: `0 + (2s in [1,1,2,2]) = 0+2=2`.\n           `k=1`: `(1s in [1]) + (2s in [1,2,2]) = 1+2=3`.\n           `k=2`: `(1s in [1,1]) + (2s in [2,2]) = 2+2=4`.\n           `k=3`: `(1s in [1,1,2]) + (2s in [2]) = 2+1=3`.\n           `k=4`: `(1s in [1,1,2,2]) + (2s in []) = 2+0=2`.\n           The maximum is 4.\n\n           My formula `val[l] + val[r+1] + rev_val[j+1] + c2[n]` for `l=1, r=2` and `j=1` gives 5.\n           `val[1]=1`, `val[3]=1`, `rev_val[2]=1`, `c2[4]=2`.\n           The formula is `(c1[l]-c2[l]) + (c1[r+1]-c2[r+1]) + (c2[j+1]-c1[j+1]) + c2[n]`.\n           This is `c1[l] - c2[l] + c1[r+1] - c2[r+1] + c2[j+1] - c1[j+1] + c2[n]`.\n           This equals `(c1[l] + c1[r+1] - c1[j+1]) + (c2[j+1] - c2[l] - c2[r+1] + c2[n])`.\n           This is `(1s from a[0...l-1] + 1s from a[j+1...r]) + (2s from a[l...j] + 2s from a[r+1...n-1])`. This is the LNDS sum using `j` as the split point in the original array `a` within the reversed segment.\n\n           Let's trace `l=1, r=2, j=1` for `a=[1,2,1,2]`.\n           `a[0...l-1]` is `a[0] = [1]`.

(1 two)\n           Total 1s: `1+1=2`. Total 2s: `1+1=2`. Sum = 4.\n           The formula result `val[1] + val[3] + rev_val[2] + c2[4]` is `1+1+1+2=5`.\n           The formula is wrong. The `c2[n]` term is `total_twos_in_original_array`.\n           The total LNDS is `(count of 1s) + (count of 2s)`.\n           The count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` is `c1[l] + (c1[r+1] - c1[j_orig+1])`.\n           The count of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` is `(c2[j_orig+1] - c2[l]) + (c2[n] - c2[r+1])`.\n           The sum should be `c1[l] + c1[r+1] - c1[j_orig+1] + c2[j_orig+1] - c2[l] + c2[n] - c2[r+1]`.\n           This is `(c1[l] - c2[l]) + (c1[r+1] - c2[r+1]) + (c2[j_orig+1] - c1[j_orig+1]) + c2[n]`.\n           This is `val[l] + val[r+1] + rev_val[j_orig+1] + c2[n]`.\n           This formula is correct.
