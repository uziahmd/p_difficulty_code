    "thought": "**Understanding the Frog Jumping Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Frog Jumping problem, and my first step is to really understand the core of it. Essentially, I need to create a Python script to solve it. Let me break it down: a frog starts at position 0 and can jump either `a` units forward or `b` units backward.  The catch?  The frog can *never* jump outside of the range `[0, x]`.  \n\nThe heart of the problem lies in the function `f(x)`, which represents the *number* of distinct integers the frog can reach *while* adhering to that `[0, x]` constraint. I start at 0 and I'm interested in finding how many numbers I can possibly land on. The main goal is to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for every `i` from 0 to `m`.\n\nNow, digging deeper into `f(x)`, I'm thinking about the frog's moves and the limitations. It can go from `k` to `k+a` or `k-b`. But hold on, if `k+a` is greater than `x`, that jump is off-limits. Similarly, if `k-b` is less than 0, that's not allowed either. So, the frog is basically navigating a confined space with a particular jumping pattern.\n\nI'm thinking, let's represent the set of reachable positions within `[0, x]` as `S_x`. The size of this set, `|S_x|`, is precisely what `f(x)` equals. The \"never jumps outside\" constraint is the key. When considering a potential jump from `k` to `k+a`, the rule is `k+a <= x`, and for `k` to `k-b`, the condition is `k-b >= 0`.\n\nThis starts to sound like a graph reachability problem, where the integers are the nodes, and the edges are the possible jumps (`+a` and `-b`), under the conditions defined.\n\nConsidering all possible jumps, it looks like all reachable states must be of the form `c_1 * a - c_2 * b`, where `c_1` and `c_2` are non-negative integers.  It's clear that since the starting position is 0, any reachable state `k` must also be a non-negative number. Moreover, every valid state `k` is reached by a series of valid jumps `j_1, j_2, ..., j_p`.\n\nA critical idea jumps out: the greatest common divisor, `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any reachable position `k` *must* be a multiple of `g`. Here's why: `k = c_1 * a - c_2 * b = g * (c_1 * a/g - c_2 * b/g)`.\n\nNow, if I ignore the `x` constraint for a moment, the reachable states would be something like {k * g | k is an integer}. However, `[0, x]` is critical.\nIf I can reach `P`, I should also be able to reach `P+a`, `P-b` (as long as they don't break the rules). This smells like I need a shortest path algorithm or a reachability analysis, tracking the minimum jumps. Maybe I can use `dist[k]` as the minimum jumps to reach `k`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it starts at `0` and never jumps outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet's analyze `f(x)`:\n1.  **Starting point:** The frog starts at `0`. So `0` is always reachable.\n2.  **Jump constraints:** From a position `k`, it can jump to `k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) or `k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\n3.  **Reachability:** An integer `p` is reachable if there's a sequence of jumps `0 = p_0, p_1, ..., p_k = p` such that `0 <= p_j <= x` for all `j`.\n\nThis is a reachability problem. We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra-like approach to find all reachable points.\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable points must be multiples of `g`. This means `f(x)` can be at most `floor(x/g) + 1`.\n\nConsider `dist[k % g]`, the minimum position `k` such that `k % g = target_rem` and `k` is reachable. This is a common technique for problems involving `+A` and `-B` jumps.\nHowever, the `[0, x]` constraint makes it tricky. If we find all reachable points without an upper bound, they are all non-negative multiples of `g`. For example, `0, a, 2a, ..., ka` (if `ka` is reachable), and `a-b, 2a-b, ...`.\n\nLet's define `min_reach[r]` as the minimum value `k` such that `k % g = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` using only jumps `+a` and `-b`, *without any upper bound `x` yet*. We are only interested in `r = 0` since `0` is a multiple of `g`.\nThe set of all non-negative integers reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps is `{k * g | k >= 0}`. This is because any reachable point `P` must be of the form `c_1 * a - c_2 * b = (c_1 * a/g - c_2 * b/g) * g`. Since `gcd(a/g, b/g) = 1`, by Bezout's identity, any multiple of `g` can be expressed as `X * a + Y * b`. We need non-negative coefficients for `+a` and `-b` jumps, but we can always make `X` positive by adding `k*b/g` to `X` and subtracting `k*a/g` from `Y`. For example, `P = (X + k*b/g)a + (Y - k*a/g)b`. We can choose `k` large enough to make `X+k*b/g >= 0` and `Y-k*a/g <= 0`. This means any non-negative multiple of `g` is reachable if there's no upper bound.\n\nNow, let's reintroduce the `[0, x]` constraint.\nThe key insight is that if `k` is reachable within `[0, x]`, then `k+a` is reachable within `[0, x]` if `k+a <= x`, and `k-b` is reachable within `[0, x]` if `k-b >= 0`.\nThis is a standard BFS problem on states `0, 1, ..., x`.\nLet `reachable[p]` be a boolean indicating if `p` is reachable.\n`reachable[0] = true`.\nUse a queue for BFS. Initially, `q = [0]`.\nWhile `q` is not empty, pop `curr`.\nIf `curr + a <= x` and `reachable[curr+a]` is false, set `reachable[curr+a] = true` and push `curr+a` to `q`.\nIf `curr - b >= 0` and `reachable[curr-b]` is false, set `reachable[curr-b] = true` and push `curr-b` to `q`.\n`f(x)` is the count of `true`s in `reachable[0...x]`.\n\nThe maximum value of `x` is `m = 10^9`, so a direct BFS for each `f(i)` up to `m` is too slow.\nThe maximum value of `a, b` is `10^5`.\nNotice that `f(x)` is non-decreasing with `x`.\nFor small `x`, `f(x)` grows. At some point, the set of reachable points might stabilize or grow linearly.\n\nConsider the states modulo `g = gcd(a, b)`.\nLet `d[r]` be the minimum reachable position `k` such that `k % g = r`.\nWe can use a Dijkstra-like approach to find these `d[r]` values.\nInitialize `d[0] = 0` and `d[r] = infinity` for `r = 1, ..., g-1`.\nUse a min-priority queue `pq`. Push `(0, 0)` (cost, remainder).\nWhen extracting `(cost, r)` from `pq`:\n1.  If `cost > d[r]`, continue (already found a better path).\n2.  Consider jumping `+a`: `next_r = (r + a) % g`. `next_cost = cost + a`. If `next_cost < d[next_r]`, update `d[next_r] = next_cost` and push `(next_cost, next_r)` to `pq`.\n3.  Consider jumping `-b`: `next_r = (r - b % g + g) % g`. `next_cost = cost - b`. If `next_cost < d[next_r]` and `next_cost >= 0`, update `d[next_r] = next_cost` and push `(next_cost, next_r)` to `pq`.\nThe `cost - b` part is tricky. If we reach `k` with `d[k%g]=k`, then we can reach `k-b` if `k-b >= 0`. This means `d[(k-b)%g]` should be `k-b`. So we are looking for minimum non-negative `k` for each `k%g`.\nThe jumps `+a` and `-b` preserve the remainder modulo `g`. So all reachable points must have remainder `0` modulo `g`.\nThis simplifies the problem: we only care about `d[0]`. `d[0]` is `0`.\nThe set of reachable points is `0, a, 2a, ..., ka` and `a-b, 2a-b, ...`.\nThe actual problem is about reachability within `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum number of `+a` jumps needed to reach `i * g` from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, such that all intermediate positions are non-negative. This is not quite right.\nLet `min_val[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, where all intermediate positions are non-negative.\nThis is a standard shortest path problem on a graph with `a` nodes (remainders `0` to `a-1`).\nNodes are `0, 1, ..., a-1`. Edges:\n- From `u` to `(u+b)%a` with weight `b`. (represents jumping `-b`)\n- From `u` to `(u-a)%a` with weight `a`. (represents jumping `+a`)\nNo, it's `u` to `(u+b)%a` with weight `b` (for `-b` jump) and `u` to `(u-a)%a` with weight `a` (for `+a` jump).\nThis is Dijkstra on remainders.\n`dist[r]` = minimum non-negative integer `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` (with all intermediate positions non-negative).\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[r] = infinity` for `r = 1, ..., a-1`.\nUse a min-priority queue `pq`. Push `(0, 0)` (cost, remainder).\nWhen extracting `(cost, u)` from `pq`:\n1.  If `cost > dist[u]`, continue.\n2.  Consider jumping `+a`: `v = (u + a) % a = u`. `new_cost = cost + a`. If `new_cost < dist[v]`, update `dist[v] = new_cost` and push `(new_cost, v)` to `pq`. Wait, this is `cost + a` but `u` remains same. This means `cost` is the minimum `k` for `k%a = u`. If `k` is reachable, then `k+a` is reachable.\n3.  Consider jumping `-b`: `v = (u - b % a + a) % a`. `new_cost = cost - b`. If `new_cost >= 0` and `new_cost < dist[v]`, update `dist[v] = new_cost` and push `(new_cost, v)` to `pq`.\n\nAfter Dijkstra, `dist[r]` will contain the minimum non-negative value `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, with all intermediate positions being non-negative.\nThe total number of such values `dist[r]` that are finite is `a` (if `gcd(a,b)=1`) or `a/g` (if `gcd(a,b)=g`).\nSpecifically, only `dist[r]` where `r` is a multiple of `g` will be finite.\n\nLet `max_val_to_check = max(a, b) + a`. This is a heuristic. A tighter bound is often `a*b/g`.\nSince `a, b <= 10^5`, `a*b` can be `10^{10}`, which is too large for `dist` array.\nThe size of the `dist` array should be `a`. So `dist` has `a` elements. Dijkstra will run in `O(a log a)` or `O(a + E)` where `E` is number of edges. Here `E = 2a`. So `O(a log a)`.\nAfter Dijkstra, `dist[r]` stores the smallest reachable number `k >= 0` such that `k % a = r`.\nAll reachable numbers `p` from `0` (with all intermediate positions `p_j >= 0`) are of the form `dist[p % a] + N * a` for some integer `N >= 0`.\nSo, for a given `x`, `f(x)` is the count of all `p` such that `p = dist[p % a] + N * a <= x`.\nThis means for each `r` from `0` to `a-1` (where `dist[r]` is finite):\nWe count `N` such that `dist[r] + N * a <= x`.\n`N * a <= x - dist[r]`.\n`N <= (x - dist[r]) / a`.\nSo, `N` can range from `0` to `floor((x - dist[r]) / a)`.\nThe number of such `N` values is `floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1`.\nThis is valid only if `x - dist[r] >= 0`. If `x - dist[r] < 0`, then there are no such `N` values.\nSo for each `r`, we add `max(0, floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1)` to `f(x)`.\n\nThis `f(x)` calculation is `O(a)`.\nWe need to sum `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n`sum(f(i) for i in range(m+1)) = sum(sum(max(0, floor((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1) for r in range(a) if dist[r] <= i) for i in range(m+1))`\nThis is `O(m * a)`, too slow.\n\nLet's swap the summations:\n`sum_f = sum(sum(max(0, floor((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1) for i in range(m+1) if i >= dist[r]) for r in range(a))`\n`sum_f = sum(sum(floor((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1 for i in range(dist[r], m+1)) for r in range(a) if dist[r] < infinity)`\nLet `D_r = dist[r]`.\nFor a fixed `r`, we need to calculate `sum_{i=D_r}^{m} (floor((i - D_r) / a) + 1)`.\nLet `j = i - D_r`. Then `i = j + D_r`.\nThe sum becomes `sum_{j=0}^{m - D_r} (floor(j / a) + 1)`.\nLet `K = m - D_r`. We need to calculate `sum_{j=0}^{K} (floor(j / a) + 1)`.\nThis sum can be calculated efficiently.\nThe terms `floor(j / a) + 1` take values:\n`1` for `j = 0, ..., a-1` (`a` terms)\n`2` for `j = a, ..., 2a-1` (`a` terms)\n`3` for `j = 2a, ..., 3a-1` (`a` terms)\n...\n`Q+1` for `j = Qa, ..., (Q+1)a-1` (`a` terms)\n\nLet `num_blocks = K // a`.\nThe sum is `a * (1 + 2 + ... + num_blocks)`.\nPlus the remaining terms: `floor(j/a)+1` for `j = num_blocks * a, ..., K`.\nThe value `floor(j/a)+1` for these remaining terms is `num_blocks + 1`.\nThe number of remaining terms is `K % a + 1`.\nSo the sum is `a * (num_blocks * (num_blocks + 1) // 2) + (num_blocks + 1) * (K % a + 1)`.\nThis is a standard arithmetic series sum.\nLet `S(K) = sum_{j=0}^{K} (floor(j / a) + 1)`.\n`S(K) = a * sum_{q=0}^{num_blocks-1} (q+1) + (num_blocks+1) * (K % a + 1)`\n`S(K) = a * (num_blocks * (num_blocks + 1) // 2) + (num_blocks + 1) * (K - num_blocks * a + 1)`\n\nSo the overall algorithm is:\n1.  Compute `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2.  Initialize `dist` array of size `a` with `infinity`, `dist[0] = 0`.\n3.  Use Dijkstra's algorithm to fill `dist`. Priority queue stores `(cost, remainder)`.\n    - Initial push: `(0, 0)`.\n    - When popping `(d_u, u)`:\n        - If `d_u > dist[u]`, continue.\n        - `v_plus_a = (u + a) % a = u`. `cost_plus_a = d_u + a`. If `cost_plus_a < dist[v_plus_a]`, update `dist[v_plus_a] = cost_plus_a` and push `(cost_plus_a, v_plus_a)`.\n        - `v_minus_b = (u - b % a + a) % a`. `cost_minus_b = d_u - b`. If `cost_minus_b >= 0` and `cost_minus_b < dist[v_minus_b]`, update `dist[v_minus_b] = cost_minus_b` and push `(cost_minus_b, v_minus_b)`.\n    The `+a` jump is just adding `a` to current position, it doesn't change `k % a`. So it's `dist[u] + a`.\n    The `-b` jump changes `k % a` to `(k-b)%a`. So it's `dist[u] - b`.\n    This is correct.\n\n4.  Calculate the total sum `total_sum = 0`.\n    For each `r` from `0` to `a-1`:\n    - If `dist[r]` is `infinity` (or `dist[r] > m`), skip.\n    - Let `D_r = dist[r]`.\n    - Let `K = m - D_r`.\n    - Calculate `S(K) = a * (num_blocks * (num_blocks + 1) // 2) + (num_blocks + 1) * (K % a + 1)` where `num_blocks = K // a`.\n    - Add `S(K)` to `total_sum`.\n\n5.  Print `total_sum`.\n\nExample 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`\n`g = gcd(5,3) = 1`.\nDijkstra with `a=5`. `dist` array of size 5.\n`dist = [inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`dist[0] = 0`. `pq = [(0, 0)]`\n\n1. Pop `(0, 0)`.\n   - `+a`: `(0+5, 0) = (5, 0)`. `dist[0]` is `0 < 5`, so no update. (This means `0` is better than `5` for `r=0`).\n   - `-b`: `(0-3, (0-3)%5) = (-3, 2)`. `cost < 0`, so skip.\n   - Wait, `dist[u]+a` is for `k+a`. The value `dist[u]` is the smallest `k` for `k%a=u`. So if `k` is reachable, then `k+a` is reachable. The smallest `k'` for `k'%a=u` is `k+a` or `dist[u]`.\n   The Dijkstra should be:\n   From `u` with cost `d[u]`:\n   - `next_u = (u+b)%a`, `next_cost = d[u]+b`. (Jump `-b` from `d[u]+b` to `d[u]`. This is not `d[u]-b`.)\n   This is a common \"shortest path in graph of remainders\" problem.\n   The nodes are `0, ..., a-1`. An edge `u -> v` with weight `w` means if we can reach `k` with `k%a=u`, we can reach `k+w` with `(k+w)%a=v`.\n   So from `u`:\n   - Edge to `u` with weight `a` (jump `+a`). `cost = d[u] + a`.\n   - Edge to `(u-b%a+a)%a` with weight `b` (jump `-b`). `cost = d[u] + b`.\n   This finds minimum `k` for `k%a = r` where `k` is of form `X*a + Y*b`.\n   This is for reachability of `k` *from* `0`, *not* `0` *to* `k`.\n   If we are at `k`, we can reach `k+a` or `k-b`.\n   The `dist[r]` should be the smallest non-negative `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, where all intermediate positions are `p_j >= 0`.\n   This is the correct Dijkstra setup for `dist[r]` as minimum `k`.\n   `dist[u]` is the minimum number `k` such that `k \\equiv u \\pmod a`.\n   From `u` with cost `dist[u]`:\n   - Jump `+a`: `k+a`. `(k+a)%a = u`. New cost `dist[u]+a`. If `dist[u]+a < dist[u]` (which is impossible) or `dist[u]+a` is a new path to `u`, update `dist[u] = min(dist[u], dist[u]+a)`. This means we can always add `a`. So `dist[u]` is the smallest `k` for `k%a=u`.\n   - Jump `-b`: `k-b`. `(k-b)%a = (u-b%a+a)%a`. New cost `dist[u]-b`. If `dist[u]-b >= 0` and `dist[u]-b < dist[(u-b%a+a)%a]`, update.\n   This is the correct Dijkstra.\n\nLet's re-run Dijkstra for `m=7, a=5, b=3`:\n`dist = [inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`dist[0] = 0`. `pq = [(0, 0)]` (cost, remainder)\n\n1. Pop `(0, 0)`. `dist[0]=0`.\n   - Try `+a`: target `0`. New cost `0+5=5`. `dist[0]` is `0 < 5`. No update.\n   - Try `-b`: target `(0-3%5+5)%5 = 2`. New cost `0-3=-3`. Negative, skip.\n   - No, this is not a Dijkstra on `k` values. This is Dijkstra on `k%a` values where edge weights are `a` or `b`.\n   The edges are: `u -> u` with weight `a` (from `k` to `k+a`) and `u -> (u-b%a+a)%a` with weight `b` (from `k` to `k-b`).\n   This is a graph where `dist[u]` is the minimum `k` such that `k % a = u` and `k` is reachable.\n   `dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n   `pq = [(0, 0)]`\n\n1. Pop `(0, 0)`. `d_u = 0, u = 0`.\n   - `+a` jump: `next_u = 0`. `next_cost = 0 + 5 = 5`. `dist[0]` is `0 < 5`. No update.\n   - `-b` jump: `next_u = (0 - 3%5 + 5)%5 = 2`. `next_cost = 0 - 3 = -3`. `next_cost < 0`, skip.\n\n   This is not finding other remainders. The `+a` jump should be `dist[u] + a`.\n   The problem is that for `k` to be reachable, *all intermediate positions* must be `[0, x]`.\n   The `dist[r]` values computed by this Dijkstra are the minimum `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` *without* an upper bound `x`, but *with* the lower bound `0`.\n   Let's check `m=7, a=5, b=3` output. `f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8`.

From `0`, can jump to `0+5=5`. `5 <= 5`, so `5` is reachable. From `5`, can jump to `5-3=2`. `2 >= 0`, so `2` is reachable. From `2`, can jump to `2+5=7`. `7 > 5`, so cannot jump to `7`. From `2`, can jump to `2-3=-1`. `-1 < 0`, so cannot jump to `-1`.\n   Reachable for `f(5)`: `0, 2, 5`. So `f(5)=3`.\n   `f(6)`: Reachable for `f(5)` are `0, 2, 5`. All are `<= 6`.\n   From `0`, can jump to `5`. From `5`, can jump to `2`.\n   From `2`, can jump to `2+5=7`. `7 > 6`, cannot jump to `7`.\n   From `5`, can jump to `5-3=2`.\n   Reachable for `f(6)`: `0, 2, 5`. So `f(6)=3`.\n   `f(7)`: Reachable for `f(6)` are `0, 2, 5`. All are `<= 7`.\n   From `0`, can jump to `5`. From `5`, can jump to `2`.\n   From `2`, can jump to `2+5=7`. `7 <= 7`, so `7` is reachable.\n   From `7`, can jump to `7-3=4`. `4 >= 0`, so `4` is reachable.\n   From `4`, can jump to `4+5=9`. `9 > 7`, cannot jump to `9`.\n   From `4`, can jump to `4-3=1`. `1 >= 0`, so `1` is reachable.\n   From `1`, can jump to `1+5=6`. `6 <= 7`, so `6` is reachable.\n   From `1`, can jump to `1-3=-2`. `-2 < 0`, cannot jump to `-2`.\n   Reachable for `f(7)`: `0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7`. Wait, `3` is missing.\n   From `6`, can jump to `6-3=3`. `3 >= 0`, so `3` is reachable.\n   Reachable for `f(7)`: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`. All `8` integers. So `f(7)=8`.\n\nThe `dist[r]` values must be computed using BFS on states `0...A_MAX` where `A_MAX` is `a+b` or similar.\nThe maximum value `k` that `dist[r]` can take before `k` becomes too large for `k+a` or `k-b` to matter for `k%a` is related to `a*b/g`.\nSince `a,b <= 10^5`, `a*b/g` can be `10^{10}`. `dist` array cannot store such values directly.\nHowever, `dist[r]` is the smallest `k`. The maximum `k` we care about is `m`.\nThe `dist[r]` values are actually the minimum *non-negative* `k` with `k % a = r` that is reachable.\nThe maximum possible value for `dist[r]` is `a * (b/g - 1)`.\nThis is because if `k` is reachable, then `k+a` is reachable. So we are looking for the smallest `k` for each `r`.\nIf `k >= a * (b/g - 1)`, then `k` can be written as `k = x*a + y*b` where `x,y` are integers.\nThe maximum value of `dist[r]` is `a * (b-1) - b` if `gcd(a,b)=1`.\nFor `a=5, b=3`, `dist` values:\n`dist[0] = 0`\n`dist[1] = 4` (from `0+5-3-3+5 = 4` or `0+5-3=2`, `2+5=7`, `7-3=4`)\n`dist[2] = 2` (from `0+5-3=2`)\n`dist[3] = 6` (from `0+5-3+5-3=4`, `4+5-3=6`)\n`dist[4] = 4` (from `0+5-3-3+5=4`)\nSo `dist = [0, 4, 2, 6, 4]`.\n\nLet's verify these `dist` values for `a=5, b=3`.\n`dist[0]=0`.\n`dist[1]`: `0+5=5`, `5-3=2`, `2+5=7`, `7-3=4`, `4+5=9`, `9-3=6`, `6-3=3`, `3+5=8`, `8-3=5`, `5-3=2`, `2+5=7`, `7-3=4`, `4-3=1`. Smallest `k%5=1` is `1`.\n`0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1`. So `dist[1]=1`.\n`dist[2]`: `0 -> 5 -> 2`. So `dist[2]=2`.\n`dist[3]`: `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6 -> 3`. So `dist[3]=3`.\n`dist[4]`: `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4`. So `dist[4]=4`.\nThe actual `dist` values are `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. This is because `gcd(a,b)=1`, so all integers are reachable if `x` is large enough.\nThe maximum `dist[r]` value is `a-1` when `gcd(a,b)=1`.\nIf `gcd(a,b)=g > 1`, then only multiples of `g` are reachable.\nThe `dist[r]` values will be `r` if `r` is a multiple of `g`, otherwise `infinity`.\nSo `dist[r]` should be `r` for `r = 0, g, 2g, ..., a-g`.\nThis makes the `dist` array at most `a-1`.\nThe Dijkstra should be:\n`dist[r]` = minimum non-negative integer `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` (all intermediate positions `p_j >= 0`).\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[r] = infinity` for `r > 0`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`.\nWhile `pq`:\n  `d_u, u = heappop(pq)`\n  If `d_u > dist[u]`: continue\n  `next_k_plus_a = d_u + a`. `next_rem_plus_a = u`.\n  If `next_k_plus_a < dist[next_rem_plus_a]`:\n    `dist[next_rem_plus_a] = next_k_plus_a`\n    `heappush(pq, (next_k_plus_a, next_rem_plus_a))`\n  `next_k_minus_b = d_u - b`. `next_rem_minus_b = (u - b % a + a) % a`.\n  If `next_k_minus_b >= 0` and `next_k_minus_b < dist[next_rem_minus_b]`:\n    `dist[next_rem_minus_b] = next_k_minus_b`\n    `heappush(pq, (next_k_minus_b, next_rem_minus_b))`\n\nThis Dijkstra is correct. `dist[r]` will be at most `a * (b/g - 1)`.\nFor `a=5, b=3, g=1`.\n`dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`\n\n1. Pop `(0, 0)`. `d_u = 0, u = 0`.\n   - `+a`: `next_k = 5, next_r = 0`. `dist[0]=0 < 5`. No update.\n   - `-b`: `next_k = -3`. Skip (negative).\n   No new states pushed. This is wrong.\n\nThe states are positions on the number line. The Dijkstra approach is for finding shortest paths in a graph where nodes are remainders.\nThe graph nodes are `0, 1, ..., a-1`. An edge `u -> v` exists if we can jump from a number `k` with `k % a = u` to a number `k'` with `k' % a = v`.\nThe actual cost for `dist[r]` is the minimum non-negative number `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable.\nFrom `k`, we can go to `k+a` or `k-b`.\nIf `k` is reachable, then `k+a` is reachable. So `dist[r]` is the minimum of `dist[r]` and `dist[r]+a`. This is useless.\nThe edges are `u -> (u-b%a+a)%a` with weight `b`.\nAnd `0` is the starting point.\nThe values `dist[r]` are the minimum `k` such that `k % a = r`.\nThis is a standard problem: find minimum `k` values.\nThe nodes are `0, ..., a-1`.

No update.\n`pq = []`.\nFinal `dist`: `[0, 6, 12, 3, 9]`.\nThese values represent the minimum `k` that is reachable using only `+b` jumps *from multiples of a*.\nNo, this is `dist[r]` = minimum `k` such that `k % a = r` using `+b` jumps.\nExample: `dist[1]=6`. `6%5=1`. `6 = 2*3`. This means `0 -> 3 -> 6`. `6` is reachable.\nBut `1` is also reachable: `0+5-3-3+5-3-3+5-3-3 = 1`.\nThe problem states \"From `k`, it can either jump to `k+a` or `k-b`\".\nSo `dist[r]` needs to consider both jumps.\n\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum reachable position `k` such that `k % a = r`.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, others `inf`. `pq = [(0,0)]`.\nWhen popping `(d_u, u)`:\n1. `d_u` is current smallest `k` for `k%a=u`.\n2. Consider `k+a`: `d_u + a`. This is also `u % a`. If `d_u + a < dist[u]` (impossible) or if we want to add it as a new path:\n   If `d_u + a` is a smaller `k` for `u`, it would have been found already.\n   This means `dist[u]` is the minimum `k` for `u`.\n   The actual reachable numbers are `dist[u], dist[u]+a, dist[u]+2a, ...`\n3. Consider `k-b`: `d_u - b`. This is `(u-b%a+a)%a`.\n   If `d_u - b >= 0` and `d_u - b < dist[(u-b%a+a)%a]`, then update.\n   This is the correct Dijkstra setup.\n\nLet's re-run for `a=5, b=3`.\n`dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`pq = [(0,0)]`\n\n1.

Skip (negative).\n   `pq` is empty. `dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`.\nThis `dist` array is wrong for `f(x)` calculation.\n`f(7)=8` means `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` are reachable.\nThe example output means `f(x)` counts *all* reachable numbers *up to* `x`.\nThe `dist` values should be `[0,1,2,3,4]` for `a=5, b=3`.\nHow to get `[0,1,2,3,4]`?\nThe values `dist[r]` must be computed using a BFS/Dijkstra on the actual positions `0, ..., max_pos`.\n`max_pos` can be `a+b` or similar.\nThe maximum `dist[r]` can be `a*(b-1)`. If `a=10^5, b=10^5`, this is `10^{10}`.\nThe `dist` array cannot store all `10^{10}` values.\nThe maximum `dist[r]` value is actually `a+b` for `g=1`.\nIf `gcd(a,b)=1`, then all `0, 1, ..., a-1` are reachable by `dist[r]` values.\nThe maximum `dist[r]` can be `a+b-g`.\nNo, the maximum `dist[r]` value is `max_val` such that all values `k > max_val` with `k % g = 0` are reachable.\nThis is Frobenius coin problem. The largest number not representable as `x*a + y*b` for `x,y>=0` is `ab-a-b`.\nHere, we can have `x*a - y*b`.\nThe maximum `dist[r]` is `a+b-g`. For `a=5, b=3, g=1`, it is `5+3-1=7`.\nSo the maximum `dist[r]` value is `7`.\n\nThe Dijkstra must be on a graph with `g` nodes (remainders modulo `g`).\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum `k` such that `k % g = r` and `k` is reachable.\nNo, this is not correct. The graph should be on `a` nodes, and `dist[r]` is min `k` s.t. `k%a = r`.\nThe `dist` array is of size `a`.\nThe values `dist[r]` are at most `a+b-g`.\nLet's trace `a=5, b=3`. `g=1`.\n`dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`pq = [(0,0)]`\n\n1.

The `+a` jump is not updating `dist[u]` because `dist[u]` is already the minimum.\n   The `dist[r]` values are the *first* time we reach `r` modulo `a`.\n   The problem is that the `+a` jump *does* create new reachable states. `0` is reachable. `0+a` is reachable. `0+2a` is reachable.\n   The `dist[r]` should be the smallest `k` for `k%a=r` that is reachable.\n   The Dijkstra needs to find `dist[r]` for `r` in `0..a-1`.\n   `dist[r]` = minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0` with all intermediate steps `p_j >= 0`.\n   The edges are:\n   - From `u` to `u` with weight `a`.

The Dijkstra finds the minimum `k` for `k%a=r` that is reachable using `+a` and `+b` jumps *from 0*.\nThe `k-b` part is the issue. If `k-b < 0`, it's not allowed.\nMy Dijkstra above for `dist[r]` as minimum `k` for `k%a=r` is correct, but it calculates the minimum `k` from `0` using `+a` and `+b` jumps.\nWe need `k-b`. So the edges should be `u -> (u-b%a+a)%a` with weight `b`.\nThe `dist` values are `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` for `a=5, b=3`.\nThis is because `gcd(a,b)=1`. All remainders modulo `a` are reachable.\nThe minimum values for `r` are `r` itself.\nThis is true if `a` and `b` are coprime.\nIf `gcd(a,b)=1`, then `dist[r]` = `r` for `r=0, ..., a-1`.

The example output is `19`. My `dist` values are wrong or the interpretation of `f(x)` is wrong.\n\n\"The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from `0`.\"\nThis implies `f(x)` is exactly the count of `k` in `[0, x]` such that `k` is reachable.\nThe `[0, x]` constraint is on *all intermediate jumps*.\nThis means that for `f(x)`, we can only use `+a` jumps that result in `k+a <= x` and `-b` jumps that result in `k-b >= 0`.\nThis is a standard BFS.\n`reachable_set = {0}`\n`q = deque([0])`\nwhile `q`:\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  `next_plus_a = curr + a`\n  if `next_plus_a <= x` and `next_plus_a` not in `reachable_set`:\n    `reachable_set.add(next_plus_a)`\n    `q.append(next_plus_a)`\n  `next_minus_b = curr - b`\n  if `next_minus_b >= 0` and `next_minus_b` not in `reachable_set`:\n    `reachable_set.add(next_minus_b)`\n    `q.append(next_minus_b)`\n`f(x) = len(reachable_set)`\n\nThis BFS is what I thought initially. It's too slow for `m=10^9`.\nThe key is that for a sufficiently large `x`, `f(x)` will behave predictably.\nThe maximum value `k` that can be reached and has `k-b < 0` is `b-1`.\nThe maximum value `k` that can be reached and has `k+a > x` is `x`.\nThe maximum value of `a,b` is `10^5`.\nLet `MAX_AB = max(a,b)`.\nFor `x >= MAX_AB`, the behavior might stabilize.\nConsider `m = 10^9, a = 1, b = 2019`. `g = gcd(1, 2019) = 1`.\n`f(x)`: `0` is reachable. From `0`, `0+1=1` is reachable. From `1`, `1+1=2` is reachable, etc.\nSince `a=1`, we can reach any `k` from `0` to `x` by repeatedly jumping `+1`.\nThe only way we can't reach `k` is if `k-b < 0` causes issues. But `a=1` means we can always reach anything `0..x`.\nSo `f(x) = x+1` for `a=1`.\n`sum_{i=0}^{m} (i+1) = sum_{j=1}^{m+1} j = (m+1)(m+2)/2`.\nFor `m=10^9, a=1, b=2019`: `(10^9+1)(10^9+2)/2`.\n`1000000001 * 1000000002 / 2 = 1000000001 * 500000001 = 500000001500000001`.\nThis matches example 2. So for `a=1`, the formula `f(x)=x+1` is correct.\n\nThis confirms that my BFS interpretation of `f(x)` is correct.\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)` needs to be calculated in parts.\nFor `i` up to some threshold `T`, we can compute `f(i)` using BFS explicitly.\nFor `i > T`, `f(i)` might follow a pattern.\nWhat is `T`? The maximum reachable value `k` such that `k-b < 0` or `k+a > x` is relevant.\nThe maximum value that can be reached within `[0, x]` such that `k-b` is still `[0, x]` is `x`.\nThe maximum value `k` such that `k-b` is negative is `b-1`.\nThe maximum `k` that can be reached and `k+a` is still within `[0, x]` is `x-a`.\nThe \"critical\" range is `[0, max(a,b)]` or `[0, a+b]`.\nLet `N = a+b`. We can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `N` using BFS.\nFor `i > N`, the set of reachable points `S_i` might grow linearly.\nIf `k` is reachable within `[0, i]`, and `k+a` is reachable within `[0, i+1]`, and `k-b` is reachable within `[0, i+1]`.\nIf `x` is large enough, `f(x)` will be `x/g + C`.\nThe values `dist[r]` from the Dijkstra I described earlier *are* the crucial values.\n`dist[r]` = minimum `k` such that `k % g = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, with all intermediate steps `p_j >= 0`.\nThis Dijkstra is indeed correct for finding the \"base\" reachable points.\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n`dist[r]` stores the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod g` and `k` is reachable from `0` by jumps `+a` and `-b` (all intermediate states `p_j >= 0`).\nThe graph for Dijkstra has `g` nodes. Edges:\n- `u -> (u+a)%g` with weight `a`\n- `u -> (u-b%g+g)%g` with weight `b`\nNo, this is wrong. `u -> (u+a)%g` is `u -> u` if `a%g=0`. `u -> (u-b%g+g)%g` is `u -> u` if `b%g=0`.\nThis means all reachable numbers are multiples of `g`.\nSo `dist[0]` is `0`, and all other `dist[r]` for `r!=0` are `inf`. This is trivial.\n\nThe correct Dijkstra is on `a` nodes (remainders modulo `a`).\n`dist[r]` = minimum `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, where all intermediate positions `p_j >= 0`.\nThis is what I tried to trace above.\n`dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]` for `a=5, b=3`.\n`pq = [(0,0)]`\n1.

The `f(x)` definition means we have to check *all* intermediate steps.\nThis means for `f(x)`, the set of reachable points can be different for different `x`.\nThe `dist[r]` values computed in the Dijkstra are the minimum `k` for `k%a=r` that are reachable *assuming no upper bound*.\nLet `k_0` be such a minimum `k`. Then `k_0, k_0+a, k_0+2a, ...` are all reachable.\nThe threshold for `x` is `a+b`.\nFor `x >= a+b`, `f(x)` will be `f(x-1) + (g if x is a multiple of g and x is reachable, else 0)`.\nLet `max_val = a + b - g`. This is the maximum value of `dist[r]` for the \"right\" Dijkstra.\nThe `dist[r]` values are computed for `r` from `0` to `a-1`.\nThe maximum value of `a` or `b` is `10^5`. So `a+b` is `2 * 10^5`.\nWe can compute `f(i)` explicitly for `i` from `0` to `2 * 10^5`.\nLet `N_0 = a+b`.\n`total_sum = 0`.\n`reachable = set([0])`. `q = deque([0])`.\n`f_values = [0] * (N_0 + 1)`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `N_0`:\n  While `q`:\n    `curr = q.popleft()`\n    `next_plus_a = curr + a`\n    if `next_plus_a <= i` and `next_plus_a` not in `reachable`:\n      `reachable.add(next_plus_a)`\n      `q.append(next_plus_a)`\n    `next_minus_b = curr - b`\n    if `next_minus_b >= 0` and `next_minus_b` not in `reachable`:\n      `reachable.add(next_minus_b)`\n      `q.append(next_minus_b)`\n  `f_values[i] = len(reachable)`.\n  `total_sum += f_values[i]`.\nThe `f_values[i]` calculation is wrong. For each `i`, the `reachable` set must be computed from scratch, or `q` must be re-initialized.\nThis is too slow. `N_0` BFSs. Each BFS can visit up to `N_0` states. `O(N_0^2)`. `(2*10^5)^2 = 4*10^{10}`.\n\nThe `f(x)` function is computed using a BFS where the maximum state is `x`.\n`f(x)` depends on `f(x-1)`.\n`f(x)` is the number of reachable points in `[0, x]`.\n`f(x-1)` is the number of reachable points in `[0, x-1]`.\n`f(x) = f(x-1)` if `x` is not reachable.\n`f(x) = f(x-1) + 1` if `x` is reachable.\nSo we need to know if `x` is reachable.\n`x` is reachable if `x-a` is reachable (and `x-a >= 0`) or `x+b` is reachable (and `x+b <= x` and `x+b >= 0`).\nThis is a standard DP problem. `dp[k] = true` if `k` is reachable.\n`dp[0] = true`. `dp[k] = dp[k-a] or dp[k+b]` (if terms are valid).\nThe `dp[k+b]` term is problematic because it needs future values.\nThis is a BFS, where reachable states for `f(x)` are found.\nLet `dp[k]` be a boolean array for `k` from `0` to `a+b`.\nLet `g = gcd(a,b)`.\nThe maximum value of `a+b` is `2 * 10^5`.\nLet `MAX_K = a+b`.\nWe can compute `f(i)` for `i` up to `MAX_K`.\n`f_arr = [0] * (MAX_K + 1)`\n`reachable_in_range = [False] * (MAX_K + 1)`\n`reachable_in_range[0] = True`\n`current_reachable_count = 1`\n`q = deque([0])`\n`sum_f = 0`\n\nFor `i` from `0` to `min(m, MAX_K)`:\n  `f_arr[i] = current_reachable_count`\n  `sum_f += f_arr[i]`\n  // Now, extend reachability to `i+1`\n  // Any new points reachable in `[0, i+1]` must be `i+1`.\n  // `i+1` is reachable if `i+1-a` was reachable and `i+1-a >= 0`\n  // or `i+1+b` was reachable and `i+1+b <= i+1`. The second case is impossible for positive `b`.\n  // The interpretation of \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\" is critical.\n  // It means all intermediate points must be within `[0, x]`.\n  // So `f(x)` is the size of the set `S_x = {k | k is reachable from 0 using only jumps to p where 0 <= p <= x}`.\n  // This means `S_x` is not necessarily `S_{x-1} U {x}`.\n  // For `f(7)`, `f(6)` has `0,2,5`. `f(7)` has `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`.\n  // `1` is reachable in `f(7)` because `4-3=1` and `4` is reachable from `7` (`7-3=4`).\n  // This means the set of reachable points depends on `x` in a complex way.\n\nThis means the BFS must be run for each `x`. This is too slow.\nThe problem is tricky because of the \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means the graph itself changes with `x`.\nThe problem states \"an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from `0`\".\nThis means we can reach `k` if there exists a path `0=p_0, p_1, ..., p_t=k` such that `0 <= p_j <= x` for all `j`.\nThis is precisely the BFS I described.\n\nThe critical observation for this type of problem is that for `x` large enough, the set of reachable points `S_x` will become `S_{x-1} U {x}` if `x` is a multiple of `g`, or `S_x = S_{x-1}` if `x` is not a multiple of `g`.\nThis happens when `x` is large enough that any `k` in `[0, x]` that is a multiple of `g` is reachable.\nWhen does this happen? When `x >= a+b-g`.\nLet `threshold = a+b-g`.\nFor `i <= threshold`, we compute `f(i)` explicitly using BFS.\nFor `i > threshold`, `f(i)` will be `f(i-1) + 1` if `i` is a multiple of `g`, and `f(i-1)` otherwise.\nSo, `f(i) = f(threshold) + (number of multiples of g in (threshold, i])`.\n`f(i) = f(threshold) + floor(i/g) - floor(threshold/g)`.\nThis is the linear part.\n\nLet's compute `threshold = a+b-g`.\nIf `m < threshold`, then we just compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m` using BFS.\nIf `m >= threshold`:\n1. Compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `threshold` using BFS. Sum these up.\n2. For `i` from `threshold+1` to `m`: `f(i) = f(threshold) + (i - threshold) / g` (approximately, handling multiples of `g`).\n   More precisely: `f(i) = f(threshold) + (count of multiples of g in (threshold, i])`.\n   `count = floor(i/g) - floor(threshold/g)`.\n   So `f(i) = f(threshold) + floor(i/g) - floor(threshold/g)`.\n   `sum_{i=threshold+1}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=threshold+1}^{m} (f(threshold) + floor(i/g) - floor(threshold/g))`.\n   This sum can be computed efficiently.\n   `f(threshold)` is a constant. `floor(threshold/g)` is a constant.\n   Let `C = f(threshold) - floor(threshold/g)`.\n   We need `sum_{i=threshold+1}^{m} (C + floor(i/g))`.\n   `= (m - threshold) * C + sum_{i=threshold+1}^{m} floor(i/g)`.\n   `sum_{i=threshold+1}^{m} floor(i/g)` can be calculated using a sum of arithmetic series approach.\n   Let `start_val = threshold + 1`. `end_val = m`.\n   `sum_{k=start_val}^{end_val} floor(k/g)`.\n   This sum can be split into blocks where `floor(k/g)` is constant.\n   `floor(k/g)` takes `val_q` for `k` from `val_q * g` to `(val_q+1)*g - 1`.\n   This is a sum `sum_{q=Q_1}^{Q_2} q * (number of times q appears)`.\n   `Q_1 = floor(start_val / g)`. `Q_2 = floor(end_val / g)`.\n   This sum is `sum_{k=start_val}^{end_val} floor(k/g)`.\n   Can be computed as `sum_{k=1}^{end_val} floor(k/g) - sum_{k=1}^{start_val-1} floor(k/g)`.\n   `sum_{k=1}^{N} floor(k/g)` is `g * (Q * (Q+1) / 2) + (Q+1) * (N % g + 1)` where `Q = N // g`. This is the same sum `S(K)` logic from before.\n\nSo the plan:\n1.  Calculate `g = math.gcd(a, b)`.\n2.  `threshold = a + b - g`. (This is the Frobenius number for `a, b` plus `g`. If `a,b` coprime, `ab-a-b`. If not, `ab/g - a - b + g`).\n    The actual threshold for all multiples of `g` to be reachable is `max(a, b) + a + b`.\n    A safer threshold is `a * b / g`. Max `10^{10}`. No.\n    The maximum value `k` that `dist[r]` can take is `a+b-g`.\n    The sum `f(x)` calculation is correct.\n    The `f(x)` values are `f(x-1) + 1` if `x` is reachable, else `f(x-1)`.\n    `x` is reachable if `x-a` is reachable (and `x-a >= 0`) or `x+b` is reachable (and `x+b <= x`).\n    The second part `x+b` is not useful.\n    So `x` is reachable if `x-a` is reachable and `x-a >= 0`.\n    This means `dp[k] = dp[k-a]`.\n    The BFS for `f(x)` is:\n    `reachable = [False] * (x+1)`\n    `reachable[0] = True`\n    `q = deque([0])`\n    while `q`:\n        `curr = q.popleft()`\n        if `curr + a <= x` and not `reachable[curr+a]`:\n            `reachable[curr+a] = True`\n            `q.append(curr+a)`\n        if `curr - b >= 0` and not `reachable[curr-b]`:\n            `reachable[curr-b] = True`\n            `q.append(curr-b)`\n    `f(x)` is `sum(reachable)`.\n\n    The `threshold` must be `max(a, b)`. No, `a+b`.\n    The maximum value of `dist[r]` from the Dijkstra (for `dist[r]` = min `k` s.t. `k%a=r` and `k` is reachable) is `a+b-g`.\n    So `threshold = a+b`. Let's use `a+b`.\n    Let `MAX_COMPUTE = min(m, a+b) + max(a,b)`. To be safe. `2*10^5 + 10^5 = 3*10^5`.\n    Let `MAX_COMPUTE = min(m, 2*10^5 + 5)`.\n    We compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `MAX_COMPUTE` using the BFS.\n    This takes `O(MAX_COMPUTE * (a+b))` time. `(2*10^5)^2` is too much.\n    A single BFS will compute all reachable points up to `MAX_COMPUTE`.\n    `reachable_arr = [False] * (MAX_COMPUTE + 1)`\n    `reachable_arr[0] = True`\n    `q = deque([0])`\n    while `q`:\n        `curr = q.popleft()`\n        `next_plus_a = curr + a`\n        if `next_plus_a <= MAX_COMPUTE` and not `reachable_arr[next_plus_a]`:\n            `reachable_arr[next_plus_a] = True`\n            `q.append(next_plus_a)`\n        `next_minus_b = curr - b`\n        if `next_minus_b >= 0` and not `reachable_arr[next_minus_b]`:\n            `reachable_arr[next_minus_b] = True`\n            `q.append(next_minus_b)`\n    This single BFS computes all `k` reachable within `[0, MAX_COMPUTE]` *if there was no `x` constraint*.\n    But `f(x)` has the `x` constraint.\n    The `f(x)` definition is tricky.\n\nLet's use the actual `dist[r]` values from the Dijkstra on remainders.\n`dist[r]` is the minimum `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k` is reachable from `0` (all intermediate positions `p_j >= 0`).\nThis is the standard Dijkstra:\n`dist = [inf] * a`. `dist[0] = 0`. `pq = [(0,0)]`.\nwhile `pq`:\n  `d_u, u = heappop(pq)`\n  if `d_u > dist[u]`: continue\n  // Option 1: jump `+a`.\n  // From `d_u` to `d_u + a`.

Others `inf`. `pq = [(0,0)]`.\nEdges: `u -> (u+a)%g` with weight `a`. `u -> (u-b%g+g)%g` with weight `b`.\nThis is exactly the graph where `dist[r]` is the smallest `k` for `k%g=r`.\nBut if `a,b` are multiples of `g`, then `a%g=0, b%g=0`. So `(u+a)%g = u` and `(u-b%g+g)%g = u`.\nThis means all edges are `u -> u`. So `dist[0]=0`, others `inf`. This is trivial.\n\nThe correct interpretation for `f(x)` is that we run a BFS on `[0, x]` to find all reachable points.\nLet `MAX_X = a+b+max(a,b)`. Or `2*max(a,b)`.

Let `N_crit = ceil((dp[k_0]-k_0)/a)`.\n  If `N < N_crit`, then `k_0+N*a < dp[k_0]`. So `max(dp[k_0], k_0+N*a) = dp[k_0]`.\n  The sum for `N` from `0` to `min(N_max, N_crit-1)` is `(m - dp[k_0] + 1) * (min(N_max, N_crit-1) + 1)`.\n  If `N >= N_crit`, then `k_0+N*a >= dp[k_0]`. So `max(dp[k_0], k_0+N*a) = k_0+N*a`.\n  The sum for `N` from `max(0, N_crit)` to `N_max` is `sum_{N=max(0, N_crit)}^{N_max} (m - (k_0+N*a) + 1)`.\n  This is an arithmetic progression.\n  Let `N_start = max(0, N_crit)`.\n  `sum_{N=N_start}^{N_max} (m - k_0 + 1 - N*a)`.\n  This is `(N_max - N_start + 1) * (m - k_0 + 1) - a * sum_{N=N_start}^{N_max} N`.\n  `sum_{N=N_start}^{N_max} N = (N_max * (N_max+1) // 2) - ((N_start-1) * N_start // 2)`.\nThis is efficient enough. `O(MAX_STATE)` for the sum.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1.
