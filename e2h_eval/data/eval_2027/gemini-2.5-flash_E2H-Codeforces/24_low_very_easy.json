She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Browser Tab Closing Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem. It's about minimizing the time to close tabs outside a range `[l, r]`. We start with `n` tabs and the cursor at `pos`. There are four operations: moving the cursor left or right (costing 1 second each), and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor (also costing 1 second). The indices `a` and `b` track the unclosed tabs, initially `1` and `n`.  Essentially, I need to close tabs from `1` to `l-1` and from `r+1` to `n`.\n\nLet's break this down.  I need the cursor to be at either `l` or to the right of `l` and tabs `[1, l-1]` will be open. For closing these, I must use operation 3 (close tabs left).  Similarly, for tabs `[r+1, n]`, I need the cursor at `r` or to its left and tabs `[r+1, n]` will be open. So, these should be closed using operation 4 (close tabs right).\n\nIf `l = 1` and `r = n`, we're done; no tabs to close, time is 0.\n\nNow, if only tabs to the left of `l` need closing, I'll need to move the cursor to `l` (or somewhere to its right in order to allow the `a` pointer to properly close that section), and then the single tab-closing operation will take place. This'll cost `abs(pos - l) + 1` seconds.\n\nIf I'm closing tabs only on the right, I'll move to `r`, and then close those. Again, a single tab close operation will cost 1 second.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and tabs `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`).\n\nLet's analyze the operations and costs:\n- Moving cursor: `abs(current_pos - target_pos)` seconds.\n- Closing tabs to the left of cursor: 1 second. (e.g., if cursor at `i`, close `[a, i-1]`)\n- Closing tabs to the right of cursor: 1 second. (e.g., if cursor at `i`, close `[i+1, b]`)\n\nThe key insight is that to close tabs `[1, l-1]`, the cursor must be at tab `l` (or to its right, but `l` is the most efficient point to perform this operation as it's the boundary). Similarly, to close tabs `[r+1, n]`, the cursor must be at tab `r` (or to its left).\n\nWe need to perform at most two \"closing\" operations: one for the left side and one for the right side. Each closing operation costs 1 second. The remaining time is spent moving the cursor.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed:** This happens if `l = 1` and `r = n`. In this case, the segment `[l, r]` covers all tabs, so there's nothing to do.\n    Cost: 0 seconds.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed:** This happens if `l > 1` and `r = n`.\n    We need to move the cursor from `pos` to `l`, then perform the \"close left\" operation.\n    -   Move from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    -   Close `[1, l-1]`: 1 second.\n    Total cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed:** This happens if `r < n` and `l = 1`.\n    We need to move the cursor from `pos` to `r`, then perform the \"close right\" operation.\n    -   Move from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    -   Close `[r+1, n]`: 1 second.\n    Total cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Both tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r` need to be closed:** This happens if `l > 1` and `r < n`.\n    We need to perform two closing operations, each costing 1 second. We also need to move the cursor. The cursor must visit both `l` (to close left tabs) and `r` (to close right tabs).\n    The total movement cost will be the distance from `pos` to `l`, plus the distance from `l` to `r` (or vice-versa), or the distance from `pos` to `r`, plus the distance from `r` to `l`. In essence, the cursor must traverse the path that covers `pos`, `l`, and `r`.\n\n    There are two main strategies:\n    a.  Go to `l`, close left, then go to `r`, close right.\n        -   Move `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)`\n        -   Close left: `1`\n        -   Move `l` to `r`: `abs(l - r)`\n        -   Close right: `1`\n        Total cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1`.\n\n    b.  Go to `r`, close right, then go to `l`, close left.\n        -   Move `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)`\n        -   Close right: `1`\n        -   Move `r` to `l`: `abs(r - l)`\n        -   Close left: `1`\n        Total cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1`.\n\n    We need to choose the minimum of these two strategies.\n    Notice that `abs(l - r)` is the same as `abs(r - l)`, which is simply `r - l`.\n    So, the total cost for this case is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n    This can be explained as: move from `pos` to the closer of `l` or `r`, then move across the segment `[l, r]` to the other end, and add 2 for the two closing operations.\n\nLet's combine these observations into the code logic:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the left of 'l' need to be closed\n    elif l == 1:\n        # Move from pos to r, then close right\n        # Cost: movement (pos -> r) + 1 (close operation)\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the right of 'r' need to be closed\n    elif r == n:\n        # Move from pos to l, then close left\n        # Cost: movement (pos -> l) + 1 (close operation)\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    # Case 4: Both left and right tabs need to be closed\n    else:\n        # We need to visit both l and r.\n        # The path will be pos -> l -> r (close left at l, close right at r)\n        # OR pos -> r -> l (close right at r, close left at l)\n        \n        # Option 1: Go to l, close left, then go to r, close right\n        # Cost: (pos -> l) + 1 + (l -> r) + 1\n        cost1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1\n\n        # Option 2: Go to r, close right, then go to l, close left\n        # Cost: (pos -> r) + 1 + (r -> l) + 1\n        cost2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1\n        \n        # The minimum of these two options\n        print(min(cost1, cost2))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
