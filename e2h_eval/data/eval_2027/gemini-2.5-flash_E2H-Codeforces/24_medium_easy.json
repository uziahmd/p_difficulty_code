She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving this browser tab problem:**\n\nMy primary goal is to minimize the time it takes to close unwanted tabs, leaving only those within the `[l, r]` range.  I've broken this down into a few distinct cases to handle:\n\n*   **No Work Needed:** If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, all tabs are already in the desired range, and the answer is immediately 0.\n\n*   **Just Left to Close:** If `r` equals `n`, and `l` is greater than 1, only the tabs to the *left* of `l` need closing. I'll need to calculate the absolute distance between my current position (`pos`) and `l` to move the cursor there.  Then, one second to \"close left.\"\n\n*   **Just Right to Close:** If `l` equals 1, and `r` is less than `n`, I need to close tabs to the *right* of `r`. Again, the distance from `pos` to `r` determines the travel time, plus one second for the \"close right\" operation.\n\n*   **Both Sides to Close:** This is the most complex case, where I have to close tabs both to the left of `l` and to the right of `r`.  Here, I have two strategies:\n\n    *   **Strategy A:** Go to `l`, close left, then go to `r`, close right.\n    *   **Strategy B:** Go to `r`, close right, then go to `l`, close left.\n\n    I need to calculate the cost (time) for *both* strategies and choose the faster one. For Strategy A, the cost is the movement from `pos` to `l`, plus one second to close left, then the movement from `l` to `r`, plus one second to close right. Strategy B follows the reverse order of movements and closing operations.  I take the minimum of these two costs to find the most efficient solution for this scenario.\n\nI'm confident in this approach because it directly addresses the problem's constraints and operations. The relatively small `n` value (`n <= 100`) allows for a straightforward, efficient solution without needing more complex algorithms. The key is in accurately calculating the movement costs and \"close\" operation times for each case, which I've carefully done, accounting for all possible positions and boundary conditions of `l` and `r`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). Each move (left or right) takes 1 second, and each closing operation (close all left of cursor, or close all right of cursor) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l = 1` and `r = n`. In this case, the segment `[l, r]` already covers all tabs, so no operations are needed.\n    Cost: `0` seconds.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l > 1` and `r = n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be moved to tab `l`, and then the \"close left\" operation is performed.\n    -   Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    -   Close tabs `[1, l-1]` (by being at `l` and closing left, where `a` is initially `1`): `1` second.\n    Total cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1` seconds.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l = 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be moved to tab `r`, and then the \"close right\" operation is performed.\n    -   Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    -   Close tabs `[r+1, n]` (by being at `r` and closing right, where `b` is initially `n`): `1` second.\n    Total cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1` seconds.\n\n4.  **Tabs on both sides (left of `l` and right of `r`) need to be closed:**\n    This occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to perform two closing operations: one at `l` to close `[1, l-1]`, and one at `r` to close `[r+1, n]`. The cursor must visit both `l` and `r`. There are two optimal sequences for this:\n\n    *   **Strategy A: Close left first, then close right.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n        2.  Perform \"close left\" at `l`: `1` second. (Tabs `[1, l-1]` are closed.)\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`: `abs(l - r)` seconds. Since `l < r`, this is `r - l` seconds.\n        4.  Perform \"close right\" at `r`: `1` second. (Tabs `[r+1, n]` are closed.)\n        Total cost for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1` seconds.\n\n    *   **Strategy B: Close right first, then close left.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n        2.  Perform \"close right\" at `r`: `1` second. (Tabs `[r+1, n]` are closed.)\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`: `abs(r - l)` seconds. Since `l < r`, this is `r - l` seconds.\n        4.  Perform \"close left\" at `l`: `1` second. (Tabs `[1, l-1]` are closed.)\n        Total cost for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1` seconds.\n\n    The minimum of these two strategies will be the answer.\n    Total cost: `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2, abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2)` seconds.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this logic using a series of `if/return` statements to handle these mutually exclusive cases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed.
