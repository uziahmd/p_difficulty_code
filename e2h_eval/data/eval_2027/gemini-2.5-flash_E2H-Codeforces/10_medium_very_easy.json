Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My thought process starts with a competitive programming problem: \"Feed the Golorp.\"** I need to write a Python script to solve it.  I begin by meticulously breaking down the problem's description. The input is a string that represents the Golorp's \"diet\" – a program, and the output is a lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies the diet.  A crucial part of the problem involves the \"jaws\" of the Golorp, which seem to relate to how many variables the diet requires.\n\nI focus on the examples given, trying to deduce a pattern. It looks like the input string has two main parts: an expression and a set of constraints.  I'm interpreting underscores `_` as placeholders for the digits that are the variables I'm trying to find. The order in which these underscores appear seems important, potentially defining the order of the variables.\n\nI initially consider each unique underscore to be a distinct variable, but this quickly leads to inconsistencies with the example outputs. The output's length is much shorter than the number of unique underscores. This is where the core challenge lies: understanding exactly *how* the variables map to the underscores.\n\nI then try a different approach, treating sequences of underscores (like `___` or `__`) as multi-digit numbers. But again, the example outputs don't align with this interpretation. The output length doesn't seem to correlate with the maximum length of an underscore sequence. This is a common pattern in coding puzzles and I try to remember if I have encountered something similar.\n\nI keep re-reading the problem description and try to think outside the box.  I ponder the \"jaws\" analogy: what's the significance? How is the number of variables, *K*, determined? Is it based on the number of `?` characters (there's only one!), the number of individual `_` characters in the entire string or maybe something else? I try different interpretations of the examples provided and all of them lead to inconsistencies with the provided output.\n\nI assume that the total number of variables `K` is not fixed, but determined by the input itself and I try to map the underscore occurrences to individual variables, sequentially, wrapping if necessary, but this does not give a correct mapping. The output always refers to a number of variables which I am struggling to derive from the input. I also look at alternative interpretations: is it the number of numbers or the length of the string, or the length of the underscore block? All of these are incorrect.\n\nI'm starting to get really stuck.  The problem description is intentionally obscure. I've considered virtually every standard approach to mapping variables and it's not quite working. The problem is supposed to be \"very easy,\" but this step is proving unexpectedly complex. There is some crucial piece of the puzzle that I am not understanding. I'm searching for clues in the wording and the examples, but at this stage I don't feel sure if the assumption I'm making is correct.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits from 0-9) that satisfies a given Golorp \"name\" (a program). The name consists of an expression and a set of constraints. The expression must evaluate to 0, and all constraints must be true. If no such sequence exists, we output \"false\".\n\nThe core challenge is to correctly interpret how variables are defined and mapped from the underscore sequences in the Golorp's name. After analyzing the examples and common competitive programming patterns, the most plausible interpretation is:\n\n1.  **Variables:** The variables are `v0, v1, v2, ... v_{K-1}` where `K` is the number of variables.\n2.  **Mapping:** Each sequence of `L` underscores (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`) represents a distinct variable `v_{L-1}`. For example, `_` maps to `v0`, `__` maps to `v1`, `___` maps to `v2`, and so on.\n3.  **Number of Variables (K):** The total number of variables `K` is determined by the maximum length of any underscore sequence found in the entire Golorp name. If the longest sequence of underscores is `L_max`, then `K = L_max`, and we will be solving for `v0, v1, ..., v_{L_max-1}`.\n4.  **Numbers in expressions/constraints:** A sequence of `L` underscores, say `_..._` (L times), when used in an arithmetic context, represents the numerical value of `v_{L-1}`. For example, if `v0=5`, `_` evaluates to 5. If `v1=2`, `__` evaluates to 2.\n5.  **Lexicographical Order:** We need to find the smallest sequence `v0v1...v_{K-1}`. This implies a brute-force search (backtracking) where we try values for `v0` from 0 to 9, then `v1` from 0 to 9, and so on. The first valid sequence found will be the lexicographically smallest.\n\nLet's re-verify this interpretation with the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   Underscore sequences: `_` (len 1), `_` (len 1), `___` (len 3), `__` (len 2), `___` (len 3), `__` (len 2).\n    *   Maximum length `L_max = 3`. So `K=3`. Variables are `v0, v1, v2`.\n    *   `_` maps to `v0`, `__` maps to `v1`, `___` maps to `v2`.\n    *   Expression: `(v0 - v0 / v2 * v1)`\n    *   Constraint: `v2 > v1`\n    *   Output: `001`. Let's check: `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1`.\n        *   Expression: `(0 - 0 / 1 * 0) = 0`. (Division by zero is not an issue here since 0/1 is 0). Correct.\n        *   Constraint: `1 > 0`. Correct.\n    *   The sample output is `0010`. This contradicts my `K=3` deduction. This interpretation is still incorrect.\n\nLet's re-read the problem again: \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This strongly suggests that the variables are indeed `v0, v1, v2, ...` assigned to the *individual underscores* in the order they appear, and *K* is the total number of underscores. However, the output length usually doesn't match the total number of underscores.\n\nThe only interpretation that makes sense given the \"very easy\" hint and the sample outputs is that the problem is a variation of a typical \"cryptarithmetic\" style puzzle, where:\n\n1.  **Variables:** There are `K` variables, `v0, v1, ..., v_{K-1}`.\n2.  **Number of Variables (K):** `K` is the number of distinct lengths of underscore sequences present in the entire input string. For example, if `_`, `__`, `___` are the only lengths present, then `K=3`.\n3.  **Mapping:** `v0` corresponds to `_`, `v1` corresponds to `__`, `v2` corresponds to `___`, etc. (i.e., `v_i` corresponds to `i+1` underscores).\n4.  **Output Order:** The output `v0v1...v_{K-1}` lists these variables in increasing order of the number of underscores they represent.\n\nLet's re-verify *this* interpretation:\n\n*   **Example 1:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   Underscore sequences: `_`, `__`, `___`. Distinct lengths: 1, 2, 3.\n    *   So `K=3`. Variables `v0` (for `_`), `v1` (for `__`), `v2` (for `___`).\n    *   Expression: `(v0 - v0 / v2 * v1)`\n    *   Constraint: `v2 > v1`\n    *   Output `001` (from my reasoning). Sample output `0010`. Still a mismatch.\n\nThe only way for `0010` to be the answer for Example 1 is if `K=4`. How would `K=4` be derived?\nIf `K` is the count of *all unique underscore sequences* (not just by length, but by position). This would be too many variables.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the problem is *not* mapping `_` to `v0`, `__` to `v1`, etc. but rather `_` maps to `v0`, `__` maps to `v0v1`, `___` maps to `v0v1v2` (multi-digit numbers). This is a very common interpretation in similar \"cryptarithmetic\" style problems.\n\n**Final Interpretation (most likely for \"very easy\"):**\n\n1.  **Identify all unique underscore lengths:** Scan the entire input string to find all sequences of underscores. Collect their lengths.\n2.  **Determine `K` (number of variables):** `K` is the number of *distinct* underscore lengths found. Let these distinct lengths be `L_0, L_1, ..., L_{K-1}` in increasing order.\n3.  **Map variables:** `v_i` will represent the value for an underscore sequence of length `L_i`.\n    *   Example: If distinct lengths are `1, 2, 3`, then `v0` is the value for `_`, `v1` for `__`, `v2` for `___`.\n4.  **Parse and Substitute:**\n    *   Replace each `(L_i)`-length underscore sequence in the expression and constraints with `v_i`.\n    *   For example, if `_` maps to `v0`, `__` maps to `v1`, `___` maps to `v2`:\n        *   `_-_/___*__` becomes `v0 - v0 / v2 * v1`\n        *   `___>__` becomes `v2 > v1`\n5.  **Brute-force search:** Iterate `v0, v1, ..., v_{K-1}` from 0 to 9. The first combination that makes the expression evaluate to 0 and all constraints true is the answer.\n6.  **Output:** Concatenate `v0, v1, ..., v_{K-1}` as a string. If no solution, print \"false\".\n\nLet's re-check Example 1 with this interpretation: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n1.  Underscore sequences: `_`, `__`, `___`. Distinct lengths: `1, 2, 3`.\n2.  `K=3`. Variables: `v0` (for `_`), `v1` (for `__`), `v2` (for `___`).\n3.  Expression: `v0 - v0 / v2 * v1`\n4.  Constraint: `v2 > v1`\n5.  Try `v0, v1, v2` from 0-9.\n    *   `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1`:\n        *   Expr: `0 - 0 / 1 * 0 = 0`. Valid.\n        *   Constr: `1 > 0`. Valid.\n        *   Solution: `001`. Still not `0010`.\n\nThis means the number of variables `K` is *not* the number of distinct underscore lengths.\nThe sample output `0010` for the first example is the most confusing part. It has 4 digits.\nThe problem statement: \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\nThis means `K` is derived from the input.\n\nWhat if `K` is the number of *distinct underscore sequences* (by content, not just length) in the expression part?\nEx 1: `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`. Distinct sequences: `_`, `__`, `___`. Still 3.\n\nThe only way for `K` to be 4 for the first example, and `0010` to be the output, is if the variables are `v0, v1, v2, v3` and the mapping is:\n`_` -> `v0`\n`__` -> `v1`\n`___` -> `v2`\n`____` -> `v3`\nAnd if `____` doesn't appear in the string, `v3` can be any value (0-9).\nThis is a *very unusual* interpretation. If a variable `v_i` (for `i+1` underscores) is not used, its value can be anything from 0-9, and we want the lexicographically smallest. So it would be 0.\n\nLet's try this:\n1.  Find `L_max = max(length of all underscore sequences)`.\n2.  `K = L_max`. Variables `v0, ..., v_{L_max-1}`.\n3.  `v_i` corresponds to `i+1` underscores.\n4.  If a `v_i` is not used in any expression/constraint (because `i+1` underscores never appear), its value is `0` for lexicographical smallest.\n\nExample 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n1.  `L_max = 3`.\n2.  `K=3`. Variables `v0, v1, v2`.\n3.  `v0` for `_`, `v1` for `__`, `v2` for `___`.\n4.  Expression: `v0 - v0 / v2 * v1`\n5.  Constraint: `v2 > v1`\n6.  Solution `001`. Still not `0010`.\n\nThis is the only remaining option: The problem is actually asking for `K` variables, where `K` is the maximum length of an underscore sequence, *but the output length is not always `K`*.\nWhat if the output length is *always* 4? No, example 3 has length 7.\n\nThis problem is a puzzle about interpretation. The \"very easy\" hint suggests a straightforward mapping.\nThe most common \"variable mapping\" in such problems where `_` means a digit is that `_` maps to `v0`, `__` maps to `v1`, `___` maps to `v2`, etc., and the total number of variables `K` is the number of *distinct underscore lengths* in the input. And the output is `v0v1...v_{K-1}`.\n\nLet's try Example 3: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n1.  Distinct underscore lengths: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 22.\n2.  If `K` is the number of distinct lengths, `K=8`.\n3.  Variables `v0` (`_`), `v1` (`__`), `v2` (`___`), `v3` (`____`), `v4` (`_____`), `v5` (`______`), `v6` (`_______`), `v7` (`______________________`).\n4.  Output `0250341`. This is 7 digits. This means `K=7`.\n    *   This implies that `v7` (for `______________________`) is not part of the output, or is implicitly 0 and not printed.\n    *   But `v7` *is used* in the expression: `v7 / v3 + v6 * v1 - v4 * v5 - v2`.\n    *   This is a contradiction.\n\nThe only remaining possibility for \"very easy\" is that the problem text is misleading, and the variables are simply `x0, x1, x2, ...` assigned to *each unique group of underscores in the order they appear*.\n\nLet's try this:\n1.  Scan the string. When an underscore sequence is found, assign it to a new variable `v_i` if it's the first time we see *that specific block* of underscores.\n    *   Example: `_-_/___*__`\n        *   `_` (first) -> `v0`\n        *   `-`\n        *   `_` (second) -> `v1`\n        *   `/`\n        *   `___` (first) -> `v2`\n        *   `*`\n        *   `__` (first) -> `v3`\n    *   Then, `___>__`\n        *   `___` (second) -> `v2` (reuse `v2` because `___` was already assigned)\n        *   `>`\n        *   `__` (second) -> `v3` (reuse `v3`)\n    *   So, `K=4` variables: `v0, v1, v2, v3`.\n    *   Expression: `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`\n    *   Constraint: `v2 > v3`\n    *   Output `0010`. Let's test: `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`.\n        *   Expression: `0 - 0 / 1 * 0 = 0`. Valid.\n        *   Constraint: `1 > 0`. Valid.\n    *   **THIS MATCHES EXAMPLE 1!** This must be the correct interpretation.\n\nLet's confirm with Example 3: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n1.  `______________________` (first) -> `v0`\n2.  `/`\n3.  `____` (first) -> `v1`\n4.  `+`\n5.  `_______` (first) -> `v2`\n6.  `*`\n7.  `__` (first) -> `v3`\n8.  `-`\n9.  `_____` (first) -> `v4`\n10. `*`\n11. `______` (first) -> `v5`\n12. `-`\n13. `___` (first) -> `v6`\n14. `):-`\n15. `__` (second) -> `v3` (reuse)\n16. `<`\n17. `___` (second) -> `v6` (reuse)\n18. `,`\n19. `___` (third) -> `v6` (reuse)\n20. `<`\n21. `____` (second) -> `v1` (reuse)\n22. `,`\n23. `____` (third) -> `v1` (reuse)\n24. `<`\n25. `_____` (second) -> `v4` (reuse)\n26. `,`\n27. `_____` (third) -> `v4` (reuse)\n28. `<`\n29. `______` (second) -> `v5` (reuse)\n30. `,`\n31. `______` (third) -> `v5` (reuse)\n32. `<`\n33. `_______` (second) -> `v2` (reuse)\n34. `.`\n\nTotal distinct underscore blocks: `______________________`, `____`, `_______`, `__`, `_____`, `______`, `___`.\nThere are 7 distinct underscore blocks. So `K=7`. Variables `v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6`.\nOutput `0250341`. This matches the length and structure. This interpretation is correct!\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse the input string:**\n    *   Extract the `expression_str` (between `?(` and `):-`).\n    *   Extract the `constraints_str` (between `:-` and `.`).\n2.  **Identify variables and map underscore blocks:**\n    *   Create a dictionary `var_map` to map unique underscore block strings (e.g., `\"___\"`) to variable indices (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`).\n    *   Iterate through the entire input string (expression + constraints).\n    *   When an underscore sequence is found, if its string representation (e.g., `\"___\"`) is not in `var_map`, add it with a new index `K` and increment `K`.\n    *   Store the total number of variables `K`.\n3.  **Tokenize and convert to RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) or direct evaluation:**\n    *   Define a helper function `evaluate(tokens, values)` that takes a list of tokens (numbers or operators) and variable values, and evaluates the expression.\n    *   Numbers will be represented as `(type='var', index=i)` for `v_i`.\n    *   The `evaluate` function will need to handle standard operator precedence. Use a stack-based approach for RPN or direct parsing.\n    *   Handle division by zero: If `b == 0` in `a / b`, treat it as an invalid expression (return a non-zero value, or raise an error to be caught).\n4.  **Brute-force search (backtracking):**\n    *   Implement a recursive function `solve(k, current_values)`:\n        *   `k`: current variable index to assign a value (from `0` to `K-1`).\n        *   `current_values`: a list of assigned values for `v0, ..., v_{k-1}`.\n        *   Base case: If `k == K` (all variables assigned):\n            *   Evaluate the `expression_str` using `current_values`. If it's not `0`, return `false`.\n            *   Evaluate all `constraints_str` using `current_values`. If any is `false`, return `false`.\n            *   If all pass, return `true` (and store `current_values` as the solution).\n        *   Recursive step: For `digit` from 0 to 9:\n            *   `current_values[k] = digit`\n            *   If `solve(k+1, current_values)` returns `true`, propagate `true` up.\n        *   If no digit works, return `false`.\n    *   Initialize `current_values` as a list of `K` zeros. Call `solve(0, current_values)`.\n    *   The first solution found will be the lexicographically smallest.\n\n**Detailed Parsing and Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Tokenization:** Iterate through the string.\n    *   If `_` is found, consume all consecutive `_`s to form an underscore block (e.g., `\"___\"`). Map this block to its variable index using `var_map`. The token will be `('VAR', index)`.\n    *   If an operator `+ - * / ( ) < >` is found, the token is `('OP', operator_char)`.\n    *   Constraints are separated by `,`. Parse each constraint separately.\n*   **Evaluation:** A simple way to evaluate arithmetic expressions with operator precedence is using two stacks (operand stack and operator stack) or by converting to RPN. Given the \"very easy\" tag, a simpler direct evaluation might be possible by replacing variables with their values and then using Python's `eval()`. However, `eval()` is generally unsafe and might not handle custom variable names or comparison operators directly. A custom parser is safer.\n\nLet's refine the `evaluate` function for a single expression/constraint.\nWe need to handle `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` for expressions, and `>` `<` for constraints.\nA simple shunting-yard algorithm to convert to RPN, then evaluate RPN is robust.\n\n**Example: `v0 - v0 / v2 * v1`**\nTokens: `('VAR', 0)`, `('OP', '-')`, `('VAR', 0)`, `('OP', '/')`, `('VAR', 2)`, `('OP', '*')`, `('VAR', 1)`\n\n`evaluate(tokens, values)` function:\n1.  Replace `('VAR', i)` with `values[i]`.\n2.  Use `eval()` on the resulting string (e.g., `str(v0) + '-' + str(v0) + '/' + str(v2) + '*' + str(v1)`).\n    *   Need to be careful with `/` (integer division vs float division). Python 3 `/` is float. Problem implies integer arithmetic. `//` for integer division.\n    *   Handle division by zero explicitly before `eval`.\n\n**Structure of the solution:**\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Global variables to store parsed expression/constraints and variable mapping\nEXPRESSION_TOKENS = []\nCONSTRAINT_TOKENS_LIST = []\nVAR_MAP = {} # Maps underscore string (e.g., \"___\") to variable index\nK = 0 # Total number of variables\n\n# Operator precedence for shunting-yard\nPRECEDENCE = {'+': 1, '-': 1, '*': 2, '/': 2, '>': 0, '<': 0}\n\ndef tokenize(s):\n    tokens = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        if s[i] == '_':\n            j = i\n            while j < len(s) and s[j] == '_':\n                j += 1\n            underscore_block = s[i:j]\n            if underscore_block not in VAR_MAP:\n                global K\n                VAR_MAP[underscore_block] = K\n                K += 1\n            tokens.append(('VAR', VAR_MAP[underscore_block]))\n            i = j\n        elif s[i] in '+-*/()<>':\n            tokens.append(('OP', s[i]))\n            i += 1\n        else: # Skip other characters like spaces, commas (handled by splitting constraints)\n            i += 1\n    return tokens\n\ndef to_rpn(tokens):\n    output = []\n    operator_stack = []\n    for token_type, token_value in tokens:\n        if token_type == 'VAR':\n            output.append((token_type, token_value))\n        elif token_type == 'OP':\n            if token_value == '(':\n                operator_stack.append((token_type, token_value))\n            elif token_value == ')':\n                while operator_stack and operator_stack[-1][1] != '(':\n                    output.append(operator_stack.pop())\n                operator_stack.pop() # Pop '('\n            else: # Operator\n                while (operator_stack and operator_stack[-1][1] != '(' and\n                       PRECEDENCE.get(operator_stack[-1][1], 0) >= PRECEDENCE.get(token_value, 0)):\n                    output.append(operator_stack.pop())\n                operator_stack.append((token_type, token_value))\n    while operator_stack:\n        output.append(operator_stack.pop())\n    return output\n\ndef evaluate_rpn(rpn_tokens, values):\n    operand_stack = []\n    for token_type, token_value in rpn_tokens:\n        if token_type == 'VAR':\n            operand_stack.append(values[token_value])\n        elif token_type == 'OP':\n            b = operand_stack.pop()\n            a = operand_stack.pop()\n            if token_value == '+':\n                operand_stack.append(a + b)\n            elif token_value == '-':\n                operand_stack.append(a -
