They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down.**  \n\nMy initial impression is that this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem is a graph-based puzzle with a twist. We've got `n` lawns (vertices), `m` roads (edges), and each road connects two lawns with constraints on the mushroom counts. The core challenge is figuring out a valid mushroom count assignment for each lawn that respects those constraints.\n\n**Problem Structure & Constraints:**\nEach road tells us the GCD (`g`) and LCM (`l`) of the mushroom counts (`a` and `b`) on the connected lawns. We know `a * b = g * l`. Crucially, we have to make sure that for any `(a,b)` pair, `l` has to be divisible by `g`, which is checked beforehand for each edge. We know that `a=g*x` and `b=g*y`, and if `GCD(x,y)=1`, then `x*y=l/g`.\n\n**Solution Approach: Breaking Down the LCM/GCD Relationship**\n\nThe key insight is to work with the relationship between `a`, `b`, `g`, and `l`. Given `g` and `l`, we want to find values for `a` and `b` on the connected lawns. If `l` is not divisible by `g` for some edge, then it's impossible to satisfy the constraints, and we can immediately output \"NO\". \n\nWe can let `P=l/g`, which will be the product of `x` and `y` where `a=g*x` and `b=g*y`. We have to consider how to find coprime numbers `x` and `y` where `x * y = P`. This is the core piece of the puzzle. I need to figure out a smart way to generate them.\n\n**Graph Representation**\n\nI think I'll use an adjacency list to represent the graph. For each lawn, `adj[u]` would store a list of connected lawns and the GCD/LCM information for each edge, something like `adj[u] = [(v, g, l), ...]` for a road that connects lawn `u` and `v`.\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Input:** Read in `n`, `m`, and the edge data.\n2.  **Validity Check:**  Go through the edges and if any `l % g != 0`, then print \"NO\" and exit.\n3.  **Find `x` and `y`:** For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`, calculate `P = l / g`. I'll need a function to find coprime factors `x` and `y` of `P`. I can do this by considering the prime factorization of `P` and strategically assigning the prime factors to either `x` or `y`.\n4.  **Mushroom Assignment:**  Once I have `x` and `y`, then `a = g * x` and `b = g * y`. Assign these values to `M[u]` and `M[v]`, or at least mark that these are constraints. I'll need to develop an algorithm to propagate the mushroom count values through the graph to ensure consistency. This might involve some kind of Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search to find a consistent assignment.\n5.  **Output:** If a valid assignment is found for all lawns, print \"YES\" followed by the mushroom counts `M[1], ..., M[n]`. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to assign a number of mushrooms `M[i]` to each lawn `i` such that for every given road connecting lawns `u` and `v`, the `GCD(M[u], M[v])` and `LCM(M[u], M[v])` match the given values `g` and `l`.\n\n**Key Properties:**\n1.  For any two positive integers `a` and `b`, `a * b = GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b)`.\n2.  If `a = g*x` and `b = g*y`, where `g = GCD(a, b)`, then `GCD(x, y) = 1`.\n3.  From `a * b = g * l`, substituting `a = g*x` and `b = g*y`, we get `(g*x) * (g*y) = g * l`, which simplifies to `g * x * y = l`.\n4.  This implies that `l` must be divisible by `g`. If `l % g != 0`, no solution exists.\n5.  Let `P = l / g`. Then we need to find `x` and `y` such that `x * y = P` and `GCD(x, y) = 1`.\n    This means that for every prime factor `p` of `P`, `p` (and its full power `p^k`) must divide either `x` or `y`, but not both.\n\n**Problem Structure and Approach:**\n\nThe problem can be modeled as a graph problem where lawns are vertices and roads are edges. Each vertex `i` needs to be assigned a value `M[i]`.\n\n1.  **Initial Checks:**\n    *   For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`, if `l % g != 0`, then no solution exists. Output \"NO\".\n    *   Initialize `M[i]` for all `i` to 0 (or some indicator that it's unassigned).\n    *   Store the edges: `adj[u]` will store `(v, g, l)`.\n\n2.  **Assigning Values using Prime Factors:**\n    *   The crucial insight is that for any edge `(u, v)` with `GCD=g` and `LCM=l`, `M[u]` and `M[v]` must both be multiples of `g`.\n    *   Let `M[u] = g * x` and `M[v] = g * y`. We need `x * y = l/g` and `GCD(x, y) = 1`.\n    *   This means that for any prime `p`, `v_p(M[u])` (the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `M[u]`) and `v_p(M[v])` must satisfy:\n        *   `min(v_p(M[u]), v_p(M[v])) = v_p(g)`\n        *   `max(v_p(M[u]), v_p(M[v])) = v_p(l)`\n    *   Let `v_p(M[i]) = e_p(i)`. Then `min(e_p(u), e_p(v)) = v_p(g)` and `max(e_p(u), e_p(v)) = v_p(l)`.\n    *   This implies that for any prime `p`, `e_p(u)` and `e_p(v)` must be either `v_p(g)` or `v_p(l)`. And one must be `v_p(g)` and the other `v_p(l)`.\n    *   This is true *unless* `v_p(g) = v_p(l)`, in which case `e_p(u) = e_p(v) = v_p(g) = v_p(l)`.\n\n3.  **Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS) and Constraint Propagation:**\n    *   We can use a BFS-like approach. Start with an arbitrary unassigned lawn `u`.\n    *   Assign `M[u]` to be `1` (or any valid value that satisfies constraints, `1` is a good starting point as it is the smallest possible).\n    *   Add `u` to a queue.\n    *   While the queue is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue `u`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` with edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n            *   If `M[v]` is unassigned:\n                *   Calculate `M[v]` based on `M[u]`, `g`, and `l`.\n                *   The only valid `M[v]` is `(g * l) // M[u]`.\n                *   Assign `M[v] = (g * l) // M[u]`.\n                *   Add `v` to the queue.\n            *   If `M[v]` is already assigned:\n                *   Verify the consistency: Check if `GCD(M[u], M[v]) == g` and `LCM(M[u], M[v]) == l`.\n                *   If not consistent, then no solution exists. Output \"NO\".\n\n4.  **Handling Disconnected Components:**\n    *   Repeat the BFS/DFS process for every unassigned lawn until all lawns are assigned. Each time we start a new BFS/DFS, it means we are processing a new connected component.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm for `M[v]` Calculation and Consistency Check:**\n\nWhen `M[u]` is known and `M[v]` needs to be determined for edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n1.  **Calculate candidate `M_v_cand`:** `M_v_cand = (g * l) // M[u]`.\n2.  **Verify `M_v_cand`:**\n    *   `GCD(M[u], M_v_cand)` must be `g`.\n    *   `LCM(M[u], M_v_cand)` must be `l`.\n    *   If `M[u]` is not a multiple of `g`, or `M_v_cand` is not a multiple of `g`, or the GCD/LCM checks fail, then something is wrong.\n\nLet's refine the `M_v_cand` calculation. The property `a * b = g * l` means `M[u] * M[v] = g * l`. So, if `M[u]` is known, `M[v]` *must* be `(g * l) // M[u]`.\nHowever, `M[u]` also must be a factor of `g * l`. If `(g * l) % M[u] != 0`, then `M[u]` itself is inconsistent with the edge constraints. This check is implicitly handled by `GCD(M[u], M_v_cand) == g` and `LCM(M[u], M_v_cand) == l`.\n\n**GCD and LCM Helper Functions:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        return 0\n    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n```\n\n**Main Loop:**\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v, g, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        if l % g != 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n        adj[u].append((v, g, l))\n        adj[v].append((u, g, l))\n\n    # Array to store assigned mushroom counts\n    M = [0] * (n + 1) # M[0] is unused\n\n    # Iterate through all lawns to handle disconnected components\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if M[i] == 0: # If lawn i has not been assigned a value yet\n            q = deque()\n            \n            # Start BFS from i.

Then GCD(1, 500) = 1 != 5. This will be caught.\n            # So, a better initial value for M[i] if it's unassigned is to pick the 'g' from an edge.\n            # No, that's also not always correct.\n            # The simplest way to start is to assign M[i] = 1.\n            # The actual values will be derived.\n            \n            # A more robust initial value:\n            # If M[i] is unassigned, it must be a multiple of all 'g' values from its incident edges.\n            # The initial M[i] should be the LCM of all 'g' values for edges connected to i.\n            # If no edges, it can be 1.\n            \n            # Let's reconsider: The problem asks for *any* valid assignment.\n            # If we pick M[i] = 1, and it leads to a contradiction, it's NO.\n            # If we pick M[i] = M_prime_i, and it leads to a contradiction, it's NO.\n            # What if M[i]=1 leads to NO, but M[i]=X leads to YES?\n            # This can't happen. The values are fixed by the constraints.\n            # If M[u] is fixed, M[v] is fixed by M[v] = (g*l) // M[u].\n            # The only choice is the initial value for the first node in a component.\n            # Let's say we pick M[i] = X.
