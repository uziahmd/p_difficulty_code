    "thought": "**Thinking Through Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to find the smallest ternary string possible, given these specific swap rules. Let's break this down. My main thought is that the *allowed* swaps are the key here. We can swap '0' and '1', and we can swap '1' and '2', but we **cannot** swap '0' and '2' directly. \n\nThis means '0's and '1's are essentially interchangeable within a group, and '1's and '2's are similarly interchangeable within their group.  However, and this is crucial, the *order* of '0's and '2's is immutable. If a '0' comes before a '2' in the original string, it *must* stay before that '2' in the final string, and vice-versa.  This is a significant constraint.\n\nLooking closer, if a '0' and a '2' are arranged this way: \"0...2\" the '0' will always come before the '2' - meaning the string must be reordered such that all the '0's come before all the '2's.\n\nTherefore, the string is effectively divided into three zones: a zone of '0's, a zone of '1's, and a zone of '2's.  The order of these zones is fixed based on the initial ordering of 0s and 2s, but within each zone, the '1's can freely move around, but the order of the '0's and '2's must be preserved.\n\nNow that the logic has been figured out, the implementation is the next hurdle to tackle.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by repeatedly applying two types of swaps: '01' <-> '10' and '12' <-> '21'. The swap '02' <-> '20' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap positions. This means a '0' can move past a '1', and a '1' can move past a '0'.\n2. '1' and '2' can swap positions. This means a '1' can move past a '2', and a '2' can move past a '1'.\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' and '2' cannot swap. This implies that the relative order of any '0' and any '2' in the string is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must always appear before that '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it must always appear before that '0'.\n\nConsider the '1's. A '1' can swap with a '0' and a '2'. This means a '1' can essentially move freely past any '0's and any '2's. It can move to any position in the string.\n\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each character: `count0`, `count1`, `count2`.\n\nThe '0's and '2's maintain their relative order. The '1's can move anywhere.\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we should try to move all '0's to the left, then all '1's, then all '2's.\n\nHowever, the '0's and '2's cannot cross each other. This means if we have a substring \"0...2\", the '0' cannot move to the right of the '2'.\nThe only way '0's and '2's can change their positions relative to each other is if there are '1's between them. But even then, the '1's just move around them, they don't facilitate '0' and '2' crossing.\n\nConsider the string without '1's. For example, \"002022\". Since '0' and '2' cannot swap, this string cannot be changed. The '1's are the only characters that can move relative to '0's and '2's.\n\nThe key observation is that all '1's are \"fungible\". They can all be grouped together. Since '1's can move past '0's (to the right) and past '2's (to the left), all '1's can be collected and placed at any position relative to the '0's and '2's.\n\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nAll '0's that appear before any '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning of the string, past any '1's.\nAll '2's that appear after any '0' in the original string can be moved to the very end of the string, past any '1's.\n\nWhat about the '1's? Since they can move past both '0's and '2's, all '1's can be grouped together. Where should this group of '1's be placed to make the string lexicographically smallest?\nThey should be placed after all '0's and before all '2's.\n\nSo the strategy is:\n1. Count all '0's.\n2. Count all '1's.\n3. Count all '2's.\n4. Construct the result string:\n   - Append all '0's first.\n   - Then append all '1's.\n   - Then append all '2's.\n\nThis strategy works because:\n- All '0's can move to the left past any '1's.\n- All '2's can move to the right past any '1's.\n- The relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n- The relative order of '0's among themselves is preserved.\n- The relative order of '2's among themselves is preserved.\n\nLet's take an example: \"100210\"\nCounts: '0': 3, '1': 2, '2': 1\nAccording to the strategy: \"000\" + \"11\" + \"2\" = \"000112\"\n\nLet's trace this manually:\n\"100210\"\nMove '0's left past '1's:\n\"100210\" -> \"010210\" (first '0' moves left)\n\"010210\" -> \"001210\" (second '0' moves left)\n\"001210\" -> \"001201\" (last '0' moves left past '1')\nNow we have \"001201\". We want to move all '0's to the left as much as possible, and all '2's to the right as much as possible.\nThe string can be seen as `(all 0s) (all 1s) (all 2s)`.\nThe '0's and '2's cannot cross. So, any '0' that appears after a '2' in the original string (e.g., \"2...0\") cannot move before that '2'.\nHowever, the problem statement implies a simpler structure. The '0's and '2's *do* maintain their relative order.\nLet's consider the characters '0' and '2'. We can extract them and form a subsequence. For example, in \"100210\", the subsequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\".\nThe '1's can move freely. This means all '1's can be grouped together.\nWhere can this group of '1's be placed?\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nThe crucial point is that '0's can pass '1's to their left. '2's can pass '1's to their right. This means all '1's can be collected and placed *between* all the '0's and '2's.\nSpecifically, any '0' can move to the left of any '1'. Any '2' can move to the right of any '1'.\nSo, all '0's can be moved to the beginning of the string, and all '2's can be moved to the end of the string. The '1's will then naturally be in the middle.\n\nLet's re-examine the example \"100210\".\nNumber of '0's: 3\nNumber of '1's: 2\nNumber of '2's: 1\nResult should be \"000112\".\n\nLet's test this with the examples:\n1. Input: \"100210\"\n   Count '0': 3, Count '1': 2, Count '2': 1\n   Output: \"000\" + \"11\" + \"2\" = \"000112\"\n   Example output: \"001120\"\n   My strategy is wrong. The example output is \"001120\". This means the '0's and '2's *do* maintain their relative order.\n   The '1's are the only characters that can move. They can move past '0's and '2's.\n   This means that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n   For \"100210\", the sequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\".\n   The '1's can be inserted anywhere into this sequence.\n   To get the lexicographically smallest string, we want to put '0's first.\n   So, we should place all '1's after the '0's and before the '2's.\n\n   Let's identify the '0's and '2's.\n   `s = \"100210\"`\n   `s_no_1s = \"\"`\n   `ones = \"\"`\n   Iterate through `s`:\n   - `s[0] = '1'`: `ones += '1'`\n   - `s[1] = '0'`: `s_no_1s += '0'`\n   - `s[2] = '0'`: `s_no_1s += '0'`\n   - `s[3] = '2'`: `s_no_1s += '2'`\n   - `s[4] = '1'`: `ones += '1'`\n   - `s[5] = '0'`: `s_no_1s += '0'`\n\n   After this, `s_no_1s = \"0020\"` and `ones = \"11\"`.\n   The string `s_no_1s` represents the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\n   The `ones` string contains all the '1's that can be inserted anywhere into `s_no_1s`.\n   To make the resulting string lexicographically smallest, we want to insert `ones` at the first possible position where it doesn't make the prefix larger.\n   This means we should append all '0's from `s_no_1s`, then all '1's, then the remaining '2's and '0's from `s_no_1s`.\n\n   More precisely:\n   1. Extract all '1's from the original string and count them. Let this be `num_ones`.\n   2. Construct a new string `s_prime` by removing all '1's from the original string. `s_prime` will only contain '0's and '2's.\n   3. The goal is to insert `num_ones` '1's into `s_prime` to make the result lexicographically smallest.\n   4. To make it smallest, we want '0's first. So, we should try to put '1's after all initial '0's in `s_prime`.\n   5. Find the first occurrence of '2' in `s_prime`. Let its index be `idx_first_2`.\n      - If no '2' is present in `s_prime`, then `s_prime` consists only of '0's. We can append all '1's after all '0's. Result: `s_prime + \"1\" * num_ones`.\n      - If '2's are present, `s_prime` looks like `00...02...`. We should insert all '1's right before the first '2'.\n        Result: `s_prime[:idx_first_2] + \"1\" * num_ones + s_prime[idx_first_2:]`.\n\nLet's apply this refined strategy to the examples:\n\n1. Input: `s = \"100210\"`\n   - `num_ones = 2` (from `s[0]` and `s[4]`)\n   - `s_prime = \"0020\"` (removing '1's)\n   - Find first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 2 (`s_prime[2] == '2'`). So `idx_first_2 = 2`.\n   - Result: `s_prime[:2]` (`\"00\"`) + `num_ones` '1's (`\"11\"`) + `s_prime[2:]` (`\"20\"`)\n   - `res = \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\"`\n   This matches the example output!\n\n2. Input: `s = \"11222121\"`\n   - `num_ones = 4` (from `s[0], s[1], s[5], s[7]`)\n   - `s_prime = \"2222\"` (removing '1's)\n   - Find first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 0. `idx_first_2 = 0`.\n   - Result: `s_prime[:0]` (`\"\"`) + `num_ones` '1's (`\"1111\"`) + `s_prime[0:]` (`\"2222\"`)\n   - `res = \"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\"`\n   This matches the example output!\n\n3. Input: `s = \"20\"`\n   - `num_ones = 0`\n   - `s_prime = \"20\"`\n   - Find first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 0. `idx_first_2 = 0`.\n   - Result: `s_prime[:0]` (`\"\"`) + `num_ones` '1's (`\"\"`) + `s_prime[0:]` (`\"20\"`)\n   - `res = \"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\"`\n   This matches the example output!\n\nThis refined strategy seems correct. The logic is that '0's and '2's maintain their relative order. '1's can move anywhere. To make the string lexicographically minimal, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's. The '1's should be inserted right after all '0's that appear before any '2' in the `s_prime` string. If there are no '2's, all '0's come first, then '1's. If there are '2's, all '0's that precede the first '2' in `s_prime` come first, then all '1's, then the rest of `s_prime` (which starts with a '2').\n\nImplementation details:\n- Iterate through the input string `s`.\n- Build `s_prime` by appending characters that are not '1'.\n- Count `num_ones` by incrementing a counter when '1' is encountered.\n- Find the index of the first '2' in `s_prime`. A simple loop or `s_prime.find('2')` can do this.\n- Construct the result string using string concatenation or `join`.\n\nEdge cases:\n- String contains only '0's: e.g., \"000\". `num_ones = 0`, `s_prime = \"000\"`. `idx_first_2 = -1`. Result: `\"000\" + \"\" + \"\" = \"000\"`. Correct.\n- String contains only '1's: e.g., \"111\". `num_ones = 3`, `s_prime = \"\"`. `idx_first_2 = -1`. Result: `\"\" + \"111\" + \"\" = \"111\"`. Correct.\n- String contains only '2's: e.g., \"222\". `num_ones = 0`, `s_prime = \"222\"`. `idx_first_2 = 0`. Result: `\"\" + \"\" + \"222\" = \"222\"`. Correct.\n- String with no '2's: e.g., \"01010\". `num_ones = 2`, `s_prime = \"000\"`. `idx_first_2 = -1`. Result: `\"000\" + \"11\" + \"\" = \"00011\"`. Correct.\n- String with no '0's: e.g., \"12121\". `num_ones = 3`, `s_prime = \"22\"`. `idx_first_2 = 0`. Result: `\"\" + \"111\" + \"22\" = \"11122\"`. Correct.\n\nThe logic holds for various cases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    s_prime_chars = []\n    num_ones = 0\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_prime_chars.append(char)\n    \n    s_prime = \"\".join(s_prime_chars)\n\n    # Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # '1's should be placed after all '0's that appear before any '2'\n    # and before the first '2'.\n    # This means finding the index of the first '2' in s_prime.\n    idx_first_2 = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_prime)):\n        if s_prime[i] == '2':\n            idx_first_2 = i\n            break\n    \n    result_parts = []\n    if idx_first_2 == -1:\n        # No '2's in s_prime (s_prime contains only '0's or is empty)\n        # All '1's go after all '0's.\n        result_parts.append(s_prime)\n        result_parts.append('1' * num_ones)\n    else:\n        # '2's are present.
