The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Basically, I need a Python script to figure out the shortest path for Xenia to complete a bunch of tasks on a circular road.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the rules. We've got `n` houses numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks.  Each task `a_i` tells us which house to go to. Xenia starts at house 1 and has to complete the tasks in order. Movement is clockwise, and it takes one time unit to move between adjacent houses.\n\nI've worked through the provided example; that helped a lot with understanding the circular nature and the crucial \"if target < current\" case. I realized the tricky part is when the target house comes *before* the current house in the circle – we have to go all the way around.\n\nI've worked out a formula to determine the shortest time between houses. If the `target_house` is the same as or *after* the `current_house`, it's just `target_house - current_house`. But if the `target_house` is *before* the `current_house`, then we need to do `(n - current_house) + target_house`. I am simplifying the formula in my brain to make sure it is accurate.\n\nThe core algorithm is pretty straightforward:\n1.  Initialize total time to 0 and Xenia's location to house 1.\n2.  For each task:\n    *   Calculate the time to move to the `target_house` using the logic above.\n    *   Add that time to the `total_time`.\n    *   Update Xenia's `current_house` to be the `target_house`.\n3.  Print the `total_time`.\n\nI need to be careful with the constraints. `n` and `m` can be up to 10^5, so I need to be sure Python's integer handling is sufficient. Luckily, Python has arbitrary-precision integers, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nI'm thinking about the Python implementation details. `sys.stdin.readline()` is generally faster for competitive programming than plain `input()`, so I will be using that. I will use `map(int, ...)` to convert the input to integers.\n\nI've run through another example to make sure the logic is right. I just did a quick sanity check to make sure the time is calculated right, the time should be correct.\n\nI need to consider some edge cases: if Xenia is already at the target house, the time is 0. If Xenia must go from `n` to `1`, the time is 1.\n\nI think I have a solid algorithm and implementation. Now I am coding this up. I feel confident about this one.\n",
