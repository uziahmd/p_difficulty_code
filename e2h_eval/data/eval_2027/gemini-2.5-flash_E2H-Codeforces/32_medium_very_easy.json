Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Algorithm Design and Optimization for Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this array stabilization problem. My goal is to craft a Python script that efficiently solves it. First, I have to *understand* what's being asked. It's about an array of integers, and the instability is defined as the range (max - min). The task is to remove *exactly* one element to minimize this instability. The crucial constraint is that the array size can go up to 10^5, which is significant.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I can see the core idea. Removing the elements contributing to the highest instability should be the path to the solution. The examples also indicate removing elements that are the current min or max.\n\nThe key insight hits me: to minimize the range, I should try to make the gap between the largest and smallest numbers as small as possible. Since I can only remove one element, this points directly to the logic of removing the minimum or the maximum. If I sort the array, the problem turns into checking the two options: removing the smallest (second smallest - largest) versus removing the largest (smallest - second largest). Any other element removed won't decrease the range further than these two optimal removals.\n\nThe algorithm now emerges clearly: I read the array, sort it, and calculate the two instabilities. Then, I simply output the smaller of the two. This feels very efficient, mainly because the sorting step dominates the runtime. Since the array is bounded by 10^5, this should be fine.  I'm confident that the sorting using Python's built-in `sort` is fast enough.  Calculating the instability after sorting is a constant time operation.\n\nA quick edge-case check with `n=2` confirms that the algorithm handles the edge-case properly; zero instability is the correct answer in those scenarios. Also, I don't see any other edge cases to handle. The complexity analysis is straightforward. Sorting is O(n log n), the reading of inputs O(n) and the instability calculations and output is O(1). Thus, the overall time complexity will be dominated by sorting. Space complexity is O(n) to store the array, or O(1) if in-place sorting and read input directly into the list (though a separate sorted list might be easier to manage).\n\nAlright, I have the algorithm and the complexity analysis, so it's time to translate my thought process to code. The code implementation will be concise and focused. I'll read `n`, read the array `a`, sort it and calculate the two instabilities. Then I'll `print` the `min` of the results. I should probably use `sys.stdin.readline()` for input, it's good practice for competitive programming and might save a few clock cycles. Nothing too fancy, but to make my code clean and maintainable, I will use meaningful variable names.  Finally, I review the whole solution one last time to make sure that I didn't miss anything.\n",
