            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Plan for Efficiently Counting Decodable Substrings**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to count the number of ways we can decode substrings of a growing string, `S`, represented in Morse code. It's a dynamic programming problem, and my initial thought was to use a straightforward DP approach, but that quickly became too slow.  We need to optimize.\n\nThe core idea is this: When a new character is added to `S`, we only need to focus on substrings that *end* with that new character. This significantly reduces the complexity.\n\nHere's how I'm approaching it:\n\n1.  **Define the DP State:**  Let `dp[j]` represent the number of ways the substring `S[j:k]` (where `k` is the current length of `S`) can be decoded. Think of `j` as starting positions of substrings that end at `k`.\n\n2.  **Base Case:** `dp[k] = 1`. An empty substring can be decoded in one way (as an empty sequence).\n\n3.  **Transition:** To calculate `dp[j]`, we look at substrings ending at `k` starting at `j`. For each valid Morse code of length `L` (1 to 4) starting at j, we add up the count of ways it can be decoded, which is `dp[j+L]`.  So, `dp[j] = sum(dp[j+L])` where `S[j:j+L]` is a valid code.\n\n4.  **Efficiency:** Instead of recomputing everything for each new character, we can update the DP array incrementally. When the string gets longer, the only new substrings start from index j=0, and extend to the most recent character.\n\n5.  **Running Total:** For each step, we sum all the `dp[j]` values from j = 0 to k-1, and add this to the total number of substrings decoded.\n\nSo, for each new character, we just need to calculate the DP array for the substrings ending with that character and add that to a running total. This should be much faster than recomputing everything from scratch.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding substrings of a growing string `S`. `S` is initially empty, and characters ('0' or '1') are appended one by one. After each append operation, we must report the total count modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nMorse code representations are strings of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4. There are 26 such valid codes, each corresponding to a distinct English letter. Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") are explicitly stated as not corresponding to any letter. All other strings of length 1-4 are valid.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `k`. We are interested in `sum_{0 <= i < j <= k} f(S[i:j])`, where `f(text)` is the number of ways `text` can be decoded into a sequence of English letters.\n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, making its new length `k` (from `k-1`), the total count of sequences can be updated. Let `Total[k]` be the answer for the string `S` of length `k`.\n`Total[k] = Total[k-1] + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S[i:k])`.\nThe `sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S[i:k])` represents the number of sequences formed by all substrings ending at the newly added character `S[k-1]`.\n\nTo compute `f(text)` for a given `text`:\nLet `g[x]` be the number of ways to decode the prefix `text[0:x]`.\n`g[0] = 1` (empty prefix can be decoded in one way, as an empty sequence).\nFor `x` from `1` to `len(text)`:\n  `g[x] = 0`\n  For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `x >= L` and `text[x-L:x]` is a valid Morse code:\n      `g[x] = (g[x] + g[x-L]) % MOD`\nThen `f(text) = g[len(text)]`.\n\nHowever, computing `f(S[i:k])` for each `i` using this prefix DP would be inefficient. A better way to compute `sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S[i:k])` is by using a suffix DP.\nLet `dp[j]` be the number of ways to decode the suffix `S[j:k]`.\n`dp[k] = 1` (empty suffix can be decoded in one way, as an empty sequence).\nFor `j` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[j] = 0`\n  For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `j+L <= k` (meaning `S[j:j+L]` is a valid substring of `S`):\n      If `S[j:j+L]` is a valid Morse code:\n        `dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j+L]) % MOD`\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S[i:k])` is simply `sum_{i=0}^{k-1} dp[i]`.\n\nThis approach calculates `dp` array of size `k+1` for each `k`.\nFor each `k` from `1` to `m`:\n1. Append the new character to `S`. `S` now has length `k`.\n2. Initialize `dp[k] = 1`.\n3. Iterate `j` from `k-1` down to `0`. For each `j`, iterate `L` from `1` to `4`.\n   This takes `O(k * 4)` time.\n4. Sum `dp[j]` for `j` from `0` to `k-1`. This takes `O(k)` time.\n5. Add this sum to `current_total_ans` and print.\n\nThe total time complexity will be `sum_{k=1 to m} O(k) = O(m^2)`. Given `m <= 3000`, `m^2` is `9 * 10^6`, which is acceptable within typical time limits.\n\n**Valid Morse Codes:**\nFirst, we need to define the set of valid Morse codes.\nStrings of length 1: \"0\", \"1\"\nStrings of length 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\nStrings of length 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\"\nStrings of length 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0100\", \"0101\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"\n\nTotal possible strings: 2+4+8+16 = 30.\nInvalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nSo, the set of valid codes is all strings of length 1-4 except these four.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    #
