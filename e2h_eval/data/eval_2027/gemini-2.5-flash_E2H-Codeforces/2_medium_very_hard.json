Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**X-Shape Grid Checker - My Approach**\n\nAlright, I've got a handle on this \"X\" grid problem. The goal is to build a Python script that determines if a given `n x n` character grid adheres to specific rules: an odd-sized square with diagonals containing the same letter, non-diagonal positions holding a *different* single letter.\n\nHere's the plan, and it's pretty straightforward. First, get the grid's size, `n`. Then, read the grid line by line into a data structure (a list of strings is fine here). Now, the core. I'll initialize a flag, `is_x`, set to `True`, and two variables, `diag_char` and `nondiag_char` to an empty string. I'll iterate through each cell of the grid using nested loops.\n\nFor each cell, I need to figure out if it's on a diagonal. That's simple: `row == col` or `row + col == n - 1`. If it's on a diagonal and `diag_char` is still empty (the first diagonal char I've found), then assign that char to `diag_char`. Otherwise, if it's not the same as the current `diag_char`, the grid isn't an X, so I set `is_x` to `False` and break out of the loops. Same logic applies to the non-diagonal elements, comparing to `nondiag_char` and setting `is_x` to `False` on any mismatch.\n\nAfter the loops finish (or break early), if `is_x` is still `True`, it *might* be an X. The final check is to ensure `diag_char` and `nondiag_char` are *different*. If they are the same, print \"NO\". Otherwise, print \"YES\".\n\nGiven that `n` is odd and between 3 and 300, it's pretty safe to say there will always be diagonal and non-diagonal elements, so the `diag_char` and `nondiag_char` variables will get set. And, given that `n` will be small, this nested loop approach is definitely efficient enough. I've considered all of the problem's constraints.\n\nThe example trace and the examples with test cases have given me confidence in the correctness of this approach. Let's make sure to use `sys.stdin` for this competitive programming scenario.\n",
