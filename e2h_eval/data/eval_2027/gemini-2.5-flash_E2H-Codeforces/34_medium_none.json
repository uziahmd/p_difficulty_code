And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Implementation Plan for Calculating Average Sleep Time**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: Polycarp wants a Python script to find the average sleep time across all \"weeks\" – where a week is a set of `k` consecutive days from his sleep records (the array `a`). There are `n` days of records.  It looks like I need to calculate `n-k+1` week sums, and then average them.\n\nMy initial thought was to simply iterate through all `n-k+1` windows, summing up `k` values each time.  That would be `O((n-k+1)*k)`. But, I quickly realized that could be `O(n^2)` in the worst-case, which is too slow considering that `n` could be as large as 200,000.  So, I need something more efficient.\n\nAfter some analysis, I noticed a pattern. The average is the sum of all elements divided by the number of weeks. Let's trace how many times each `a_j` appears. I derived the formula `min(j, n-k+1) - max(1, j-k+1) + 1` for the number of times `a_j` is counted. So, I can just calculate this count for each element and get the `TotalSum`. This leads to an `O(n)` solution.\n\nI then revisited the problem and thought about sliding windows.  I realized I could get the next window sum from the previous one in constant time, meaning I could iterate through the sleep data only once. This is also `O(n)`. The sliding window method seems simpler to implement, so I'll probably go with that. Let's get to coding this in Python.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\". A week is defined as `k` consecutive days. We are given `n` days of sleep records, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.\n\nThere are `n - k + 1` possible weeks:\n1. Days `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k`\n2. Days `a_2, a_3, ..., a_{k+1}`\n...\n`n - k + 1`. Days `a_{n-k+1}, a_{n-k+2}, ..., a_n`\n\nLet `S_i` be the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week (using 1-based indexing for weeks, so `S_1` covers `a_1` to `a_k`, `S_2` covers `a_2` to `a_{k+1}`, etc.).\nThe total number of weeks is `N_weeks = n - k + 1`.\nWe need to calculate the sum of all these week sums: `TotalSum = S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{N_weeks}`.\nThe final average will be `TotalSum / N_weeks`.\n\nA naive approach would be to calculate each `S_i` by summing `k` elements, and then add it to `TotalSum`. This would take `O((n - k + 1) * k)` time. Given `n` up to `2 * 10^5`, this could be `O(n^2)` in the worst case (e.g., `k = n/2`), which is too slow (`4 * 10^{10}` operations).\n\nA more efficient approach uses a sliding window technique. We can calculate the sum of the first window `S_1 = a_1 + ... + a_k` in `O(k)` time. Then, each subsequent window sum `S_i` can be calculated from `S_{i-1}` in `O(1)` time:\n`S_i = S_{i-1} - a_{i-1} + a_{i+k-1}`.\n\nHere's how the sliding window approach works:\n1. Initialize `current_window_sum` to the sum of the first `k` elements: `a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{k-1}` (using 0-based indexing for array `a`).\n2. Initialize `TotalSum` to `current_window_sum`. This accounts for the sum of the first week.\n3. Iterate from the second week up to the last week (`n - k + 1` weeks in total). For each subsequent week `i` (from `1` to `n - k` in 0-based week index):\n   a. Update `current_window_sum`: subtract the element leaving the window (`a_{i-1}`) and add the new element entering the window (`a_{i+k-1}`).\n   b. Add the updated `current_window_sum` to `TotalSum`.\n4. After the loop, `TotalSum` will contain the sum of all `n - k + 1` week sums.\n5. The final average is `TotalSum / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nThis approach takes `O(k)` to calculate the first window sum and `O(1)` for each of the `n - k` subsequent window sums. The total time complexity is `O(k + (n - k)) = O(n)`, which is efficient enough for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `TotalSum` can be `n * k * max(a_i)`. In the worst case, `n = 2 * 10^5`, `k = n`, `max(a_i) = 10^5`. This would be `(2 * 10^5) * (2 * 10^5) * 10^5 = 4 * 10^{15}`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this without overflow. The final division should be a floating-point division to get the required precision.\n\nExample: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`\n1. `k=2`. First window `a[0], a[1]`.\n   `current_window_sum = a[0] + a[1] = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n   `TotalSum = 7`.\n2. There are `n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2` weeks. We've accounted for the first. Need to process `2 - 1 = 1` more week.\n   Loop `i` from `1` to `n-k` (i.e., `1` to `3-2=1`).\n   For `i=1`:\n     `current_window_sum = current_window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n     `current_window_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1] = 7 - a[0] + a[2]`\n     `current_window_sum = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`.\n     `TotalSum = TotalSum + current_window_sum = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n3. Loop ends.\n4. Average = `TotalSum / (n - k + 1) = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0.0)\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first 'k' elements\n    current_window_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    \n    # Initialize total_sum with the sum of the first week\n    total_sum_of_all_weeks = current_window_sum\n\n    # Slide the window for the remaining weeks\n    # There are (n - k + 1) weeks in total.\n    # We've already calculated the first week's sum.\n    # So we need to iterate (n - k) times for the remaining weeks.\n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        # Update current_window_sum by subtracting the element leaving the window\n        # and adding the element entering the window.\n        # a[i-1] is the element leaving\n        # a[i+k-1] is the element entering\n        current_window_sum = current_window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sum_of_all_weeks += current_window_sum\n    \n    # The number of weeks considered is n - k + 1\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    # Calculate the average\n    average = total_sum_of_all_weeks / num_weeks\n    \n    # Output the result formatted to at least 6 decimal places\n    print(f\"{average:.10f}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
