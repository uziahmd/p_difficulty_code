    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Tricky Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and it's asking me to count these arrays of sets with a specific \"child\" relationship.  Each set in the array can have integers from 1 to K.  The core of the problem is figuring out how many valid arrays exist, where you can *rearrange* the sets so that each set is a \"child\" of the next in the sequence.  I need to output the answer modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand this \"child\" thing. A set A is a child of set B if whenever an element x is in A, then x+1 must be in B.  Right away, I start to see implications.\n\n*   If a set A is empty, it's a child of *any* set, which seems like a good starting point.\n*   If a set contains 1, then the next set *must* contain 2.\n*   If a set contains K, things get interesting. If K is in a set A, then K+1 *must* be in its parent set B. But that's impossible because our sets are only allowed to have elements up to K.  Aha! This is a major insight. If a set contains K, it can never be a child.\n\nSo, let me rephrase that crucial point.  If any set contains K, it *must* be at the end of the chain (S'_N). If more than one set contains K, then the permutation condition cannot be satisfied, because the one set containing K would need to have K+1 in the next one (which is impossible). Therefore, only *at most* one set can contain K.\n\nNow, let's look at the two cases:\n\n*   **Case 1: No set contains K.** In this scenario, any number x in a set is less than K. And, since x+1 must also be in the next set, this seems manageable, and the condition should always be satisfiable, since x+1 will be <= K.\n\nOkay, I think I've got a much better handle on the constraints here. It's all about how sets can contain K. Now I just need to figure out the actual counting part and implement this in Python.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of arrays `[S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N]` of `N` sets, where each set `S_i` contains integers from `1` to `K`. The condition is that there must exist a permutation `[S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N]` of the original array such that `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` for all `1 \\leq i \\leq N-1`. A set `A` is a child of set `B` if for each element `x \\in A`, `x+1 \\in B`.\n\nLet's analyze the child relationship:\nIf `x \\in A`, then `x+1 \\in B`.\nConsider the maximum possible value `K`. If `K \\in A`, then `K+1` must be in `B`. However, sets can only contain integers up to `K`. Thus, `K+1` cannot be in `B`. This implies that if a set `A` contains `K`, it cannot be a child of any set `B`.\nIn the required chain `S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N`, `S'_i` must be a child of `S'_{i+1}` for `i < N`. This means `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_{N-1}` must all be able to be children of some other set.\nTherefore, if any set `S_j` contains `K`, it *must* be `S'_N`.\nIf there are multiple sets in the array `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` that contain `K`, it's impossible to form such a chain, because only one set can be `S'_N`. In this case, the count for such an array is 0.\n\nThis observation splits the problem into two main cases:\n\n**Case 1: None of the `N` sets contain the integer `K`.**\nIn this case, for any `x \\in A`, we have `x < K`. So `x+1 \\leq K`. The condition `x+1 \\in B` is always satisfiable in principle, as `x+1` is within the range `[1, K]`.\nSpecifically, if `A` is a child of `B`, then for every `x \\in A`, `x+1 \\in B`. This implies that `A` can be \"shifted\" to become `B'` where `B' = \\{x+1 \\mid x \\in A\\}`. Then `B'` must be a subset of `B`.\nIf none of the sets contain `K`, then all elements are from `1` to `K-1`.\nConsider the empty set `\\emptyset`. It is a child of any set `B` (vacuously true).\nConsider the set `\\{1, 2, \\ldots, K-1\\}`. If this set is `S'_i`, then `S'_{i+1}` must contain `\\{2, 3, \\ldots, K\\}`. But we are in the case where no set contains `K`. So this is not allowed.\nThis means that if a set `A` contains `K-1`, it cannot be a child of any set `B` that does not contain `K`. So if `K-1 \\in A`, then `A` must be `S'_N`.\nThis reasoning extends: if `x \\in A` and `x` is the maximum element in `A`, then `x+1` must be in `B`. If `x=K-1`, then `K` must be in `B`.\nThis means that if a set `A` contains `K-1`, it can only be a child of a set `B` which contains `K`. But we are in Case 1, where no sets contain `K`.\nTherefore, if `K-1` is in any set `S_j`, that `S_j` *must* be `S'_N`.\nThis logic propagates. For any `j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`, if `j \\in S_i`, then `S_i` can be `S'_m` only if `S'_{m+1}` contains `j+1`.\nIf none of the `N` sets contain `K`, then every set `S_i` can only contain elements from `1` to `K-1`.\nIn this scenario, for any `j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`, if `j \\in S_i`, then `S_i` can be `S'_m` only if `S'_{m+1}` contains `j+1`.\nIf `S_i` contains `j`, and `S_i` is a child of `S_{i+1}`, then `S_{i+1}` must contain `j+1`.\nThis implies that if `S_i` contains `x`, and `S_i` is `S'_1`, then `S'_2` must contain `x+1`, `S'_3` must contain `x+2`, ..., `S'_N` must contain `x+N-1`.\nIf `x+N-1 > K-1` (since no set contains `K`), then `S'_1` cannot contain `x`.\nThis means that for any `S'_i`, if `x \\in S'_i`, then `x+N-i \\leq K-1`.\nThe maximum element any set `S_j` can contain is `K-N`. If `K-N < 1`, then all sets must be empty.\nThis implies that if `K-N < 1`, all sets must be empty. This is not quite right.\nLet `A` be a set with elements `\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_m\\}`. If `A` is `S'_1`, then `S'_N` must contain `\\{x_1+N-1, \\ldots, x_m+N-1\\}`. For this to be possible, all `x_j+N-1` must be `\\leq K-1` (since no set contains `K`).\nThis means that any element `x` in any set `S_j` must satisfy `x \\leq K-N`.\nSo, if `K \\le N`, then `K-N \\le 0`. This implies that all sets must be empty. There is only one such array: `[\\emptyset, \\emptyset, \\ldots, \\emptyset]`.\nIf `K > N`, then elements can be from `1` to `K-N`. The number of possible elements is `K-N`.\nFor each of the `N` sets, it can be any subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\}`. There are `2^{K-N}` such subsets.\nSince each of the `N` sets can be chosen independently, there are `(2^{K-N})^N = 2^{N(K-N)}` such arrays.\nThis argument works because any chain `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N` where `S'_i \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\}` can be constructed. For example, if all sets are `\\emptyset`, it works. If `S'_i = \\{1, \\ldots, K-N-N+i\\}`, it works. The condition `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` is satisfied if `S'_i` contains `x` implies `S'_{i+1}` contains `x+1`. If all sets are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\}`, then `x+1` will also be `\\leq K-N`.\nThus, for any permutation `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N` of `N` sets, each being a subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\}`, the child condition `S'_i \\text{ is child of } S'_{i+1}` can be satisfied. For example, by taking `S'_i = S_i` and `S'_{i+1} = S_i \\cup \\{x+1 \\mid x \\in S_i\\} \\cup \\ldots`. A simpler argument: if all sets are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\}`, then they cannot contain `K`. The chain condition `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` can be satisfied by simply letting `S'_i = \\emptyset` for all `i`. This is valid if all `S_j` are `\\emptyset`. What if some `S_j` are not `\\emptyset`?\nThe problem statement says \"There exists a way to rearrange...\".\nIf all `S_j` are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\}`, then they do not contain `K`. So this is Case 1.\nThe total number of such sets is `2^{K-N}`. Let `M = 2^{K-N}`.\nWe are choosing `N` sets from `M` possible sets, with replacement, and order matters. This is `M^N`.\nSo, if `K \\le N`, answer is `1` (only `[\\emptyset, \\ldots, \\emptyset]`).\nIf `K > N`, answer is `(2^{K-N})^N \\pmod{998244353}`.\n\n**Case 2: Exactly one set contains `K`.**\nLet `S_X` be the unique set containing `K`. As established, `S_X` must be `S'_N`.\nThe remaining `N-1` sets, `S_1, \\ldots, S_{X-1}, S_{X+1}, \\ldots, S_N`, must form the chain `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_{N-1}`. None of these `N-1` sets can contain `K`.\nApplying the logic from Case 1 to these `N-1` sets: for any `S'_i` (where `i < N`), if `x \\in S'_i`, then `x+(N-1-i) \\leq K-1`.\nThis means any element `x` in `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_{N-1}` must satisfy `x \\leq K-(N-1)`.\nSo, these `N-1` sets must be subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-(N-1)\\}`.\nThe number of possible choices for each of these `N-1` sets is `2^{K-(N-1)}`.\nLet `M' = 2^{K-(N-1)}`. There are `(M')^{N-1}` ways to choose these `N-1` sets.\nNow consider `S_X`. It must contain `K`. It can also contain any other elements from `1` to `K-1`.\nSo `S_X = A \\cup \\{K\\}`, where `A` is any subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nThere are `2^{K-1}` choices for `S_X`.\nThe total number of ways to choose the `N` sets is `(2^{K-(N-1)})^{N-1} \\times 2^{K-1}`.\nThis simplifies to `2^{(N-1)(K-N+1) + (K-1)}`.\nThis formula is valid if `K-(N-1) \\ge 0`. If `K-(N-1) < 0`, then all `N-1` sets must be empty. In this case, `M'` becomes `2^0 = 1`.\n`S_X` must contain `K`. `S_X` can be chosen in `2^{K-1}` ways.\nThe `N-1` sets must be `\\emptyset`. This means there is only `1` way to choose these `N-1` sets.\nSo if `K-(N-1) < 0`, the total is `1 \\times 2^{K-1}`.\nThis is `2^{K-1}`. Note that `K-1 < N-1`.\nThe formula `2^{(N-1)(K-N+1) + (K-1)}` handles `K-N+1 < 0` gracefully if `2^0=1`.\n`K-(N-1) = K-N+1`. If `K-N+1 \\le 0`, then `2^{K-N+1}` should be interpreted as `1` (only `\\emptyset` is allowed).\nSo the number of ways to pick the `N-1` sets is `(2^{\\max(0, K-N+1)})^{N-1}`.\nThe number of ways to pick `S_X` is `2^{K-1}`.\nTotal ways for Case 2: `(2^{\\max(0, K-N+1)})^{N-1} \\times 2^{K-1}`.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of different arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]`.\nThe count we derived for Case 1 is `(2^{\\max(0, K-N)})^N`.\nThe count for Case 2 is `N \\times (2^{\\max(0, K-N+1)})^{N-1} \\times 2^{K-1}`. The factor `N` comes from choosing which of the `N` positions in the array `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` is occupied by the set `S_X` (the one containing `K`).\n\nLet's combine these:\nModulo `P = 998244353`.\n`pow2(exp)` calculates `2^{exp} \\pmod P`. If `exp < 0`, `pow2(exp)` should be `1`.\n`num_subsets_no_K = pow(2, max(0, K-N), P)`\n`ans1 = pow(num_subsets_no_K, N, P)`\n\n`num_subsets_for_N_minus_1 = pow(2, max(0, K-N+1), P)`\n`num_choices_for_SX = pow(2, K-1, P)`\n`ans2 = (N % P * pow(num_subsets_for_N_minus_1, N-1, P) % P * num_choices_for_SX % P) % P`\n\nThe final answer is `(ans1 + ans2) % P`.\n\nLet's test with examples:\n`N=2, K=2`\n`K-N = 0`. `max(0, K-N) = 0`. `num_subsets_no_K = pow(2, 0, P) = 1`.\n`ans1 = pow(1, 2, P) = 1`. This corresponds to `[\\{\\}, \\{\\}]`.\n\n`K-N+1 = 2-2+1 = 1`. `max(0, K-N+1) = 1`. `num_subsets_for_N_minus_1 = pow(2, 1, P) = 2`.\n`K-1 = 1`. `num_choices_for_SX = pow(2, 1, P) = 2`.\n`ans2 = (2 % P * pow(2, 2-1, P) % P * 2 % P) % P`\n`ans2 = (2 * 2 * 2) % P = 8`.\nTotal `ans = (1 + 8) % P = 9`.\nThe example output is 11. My calculation is off by 2.\n\nWhat is wrong?\nMy Case 1: All sets are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\}`.\nIf `N=2, K=2`, then `K-N=0`. So all sets must be subsets of `\\emptyset`, i.e., `\\{\\}`.\nThis means `S_1 = \\{\\}` and `S_2 = \\{\\}`. There is only `1` such array: `[\\{\\}, \\{\\}]`. This matches `ans1=1`.\n\nMy Case 2: Exactly one set contains `K`.\n`N=2, K=2`.\nOne set contains `2`. The other `N-1=1` set does not contain `2`.\nThe `N-1=1` set must be a subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-(N-1)\\} = \\{1, \\ldots, 2-(2-1)\\} = \\{1, \\ldots, 1\\} = \\{1\\}`.\nSo the `N-1` set can be `\\{\\}` or `\\{1\\}`. (2 choices)\nThe set containing `K=2` must contain `2`. It can also contain `1`. So it can be `\\{2\\}` or `\\{1, 2\\}`. (2 choices)\nThe number of ways to choose which position holds the set with `K` is `N=2`.\nSo, `2 \\times (2 \\text{ choices}) \\times (2 \\text{ choices}) = 8`.\nThe `8` arrays are:\n`[\\{\\}, \\{2\\}]`\n`[\\{\\}, \\{1, 2\\}]`\n`[\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}]`\n`[\\{1\\}, \\{1, 2\\}]`\n`[\\{2\\}, \\{\\}]`\n`[\\{1, 2\\}, \\{\\}]`\n`[\\{2\\}, \\{1\\}]`\n`[\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1\\}]`\n\nTotal `1+8=9`. Still 9. Example says 11.\nThe missing arrays from the example are:\n`[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]` and `[\\{1\\}, \\{\\}]`.\n\nThese arrays do not fit into my `Case 1` (because `K-N=0`, so all sets must be empty) nor `Case 2` (because neither set contains `K=2`).\nThis means my interpretation of \"if no set contains K, then all elements must be <= K-N\" is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the child condition.\n`A` is a child of `B` if for each `x \\in A`, `x+1 \\in B`.\nIf `S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N` is the chain:\n`x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+1 \\in S'_2 \\implies x+2 \\in S'_3 \\implies \\ldots \\implies x+N-1 \\in S'_N`.\nSo, if `x \\in S'_1`, then `x+N-1` must exist in `S'_N`. This means `x+N-1 \\leq K`. So `x \\leq K-N+1`.\nSimilarly, if `x \\in S'_i`, then `x+N-i \\leq K`. So `x \\leq K-N+i`.\nThis means that any element `x` in any set `S_j` (which will be some `S'_i` in the chain) must satisfy `x \\leq K-N+N = K`. This is always true.\nThe crucial point is `x+N-i \\leq K` for `S'_i`.\nThe maximum element in any set `S_j` must be `\\le K`.\nThe maximum element in `S'_1` can be `K-N+1`.\nThe maximum element in `S'_2` can be `K-N+2`.\n...\nThe maximum element in `S'_N` can be `K`.\n\nLet's consider the elements that *can* be in any set.\nIf `x \\in S_j`, then `x` can be `1, \\ldots, K`.\nThe condition is that *there exists* a permutation.\nWhat if `S_j = \\{1\\}` and `S_k = \\{\\}`? `N=2, K=2`.\n`S_1 = \\{\\}, S_2 = \\{1\\}`.\nCan we form a chain?\n`S'_1 = \\{\\}, S'_2 = \\{1\\}`. `\\{\\}` is a child of `\\{1\\}`. Yes.\n`S'_1 = \\{1\\}, S'_2 = \\{\\}`. `\\{1\\}` is a child of `\\{\\}`? No, because `1 \\in \\{1\\}`, but `1+1=2` is not in `\\{\\}`.\nSo `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]` is valid.\n`[\\{1\\}, \\{\\}]` is valid. (It can be rearranged to `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]`).\nThese are the two missing arrays.\n\nThe crucial observation is that if `S_X` contains `K`, it *must* be `S'_N`.\nIf no set contains `K`, then *any* set can be `S'_N`.\nIf no set contains `K`, then for any `x \\in A`, `x+1 \\le K`.\nThis implies that *any* set `A` is a child of *any* set `B` as long as `B` contains `\\{x+1 \\mid x \\in A\\}`.\nIf no set contains `K`, then the sets are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nIn this case, the condition `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` is equivalent to `\\{x+1 \\mid x \\in S'_i\\} \\subseteq S'_{i+1}`.\nThis means that the sets can be ordered such that `S'_1 \\subseteq S'_2 \\subseteq \\ldots \\subseteq S'_N` if we consider the \"shifted\" sets.\nLet `A_j = \\{x+j-1 \\mid x \\in S'_1\\}`. Then `A_1=S'_1`, `A_2 \\subseteq S'_2`, ..., `A_N \\subseteq S'_N`.\nThis is still too complicated.\n\nLet's simplify the definition of \"child\":\n`A` is a child of `B` if `\\forall x \\in A, x+1 \\in B`.\nThis implies that `A` can only contain elements `x \\in [1, K-1]` if `A` is to be a child of some `B` that does not contain `K+1`.\nIf `K \\in A`, then `A` cannot be a child of any set `B`. So `A` must be `S'_N`.\nIf `K \\notin A`, then `A` can be a child of some `B`.\n\nLet `\\mathcal{S} = \\{S_1, \\ldots, S_N\\}` be the multiset of sets in the array.\nWe need to find a permutation `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N` of `\\mathcal{S}` such that `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}`.\n\nIf there is a set `S_j \\in \\mathcal{S}` such that `K \\in S_j`, then `S_j` must be `S'_N`. If there are multiple such sets, it's impossible. So at most one set can contain `K`.\n\n**Case A: No set in the array contains `K`.**\nAll sets `S_i` are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nFor any `S_i`, if `x \\in S_i`, then `x \\le K-1`. So `x+1 \\le K`.\nThe condition `x+N-1 \\le K` (from `x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+N-1 \\in S'_N`) is `x \\le K-N+1`.\nThis means that if we want to make a chain of length `N`, the \"smallest\" set `S'_1` can only contain elements up to `K-N+1`.\nIf `K-N+1 < 1`, then `K < N`. In this case, `S'_1` must be empty.\nIf `S'_1` is empty, then `S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N` can be anything.\nIf all sets `S_i` are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nThe crucial observation is that if no set contains `K`, then the \"child\" relation is not restrictive enough to force a specific order or content.\nFor example, `S_i = \\emptyset` for all `i`. This is `[\\emptyset, \\ldots, \\emptyset]`. This is valid.\n`S_i = \\{1\\}` for all `i`. This is `[\\{1\\}, \\ldots, \\{1\\}]`. This is valid. `\\{1\\}` is a child of `\\{1\\}`.\nIn general, if all `S_i` are identical, say `S_i = S`, then `[S, S, \\ldots, S]` is a valid chain if `S` is a child of `S`. This means for all `x \\in S`, `x+1 \\in S`.\nSuch sets `S` are \"shift-closed upwards\". E.g., `\\{1,2,3\\}` is not. `\\{1,2,3\\}` is a child of `\\{2,3,4\\}`.\n`\\{1,2,3\\}` is a child of `\\{1,2,3\\}` if `\\{2,3,4\\} \\subseteq \\{1,2,3\\}` which is false.\nThis means `S` must be `\\emptyset`.\nSo, `[S, S, \\ldots, S]` is valid only if `S=\\emptyset`.\n\nThe problem is that the values `x` that are shifted `N-1` times must still be `\\le K`.\nIf `x \\in S'_1`, then `x+N-1 \\in S'_N`. So `x+N-1 \\le K`. This means `x \\le K-N+1`.\nSo any element `x` in `S'_1` must be `\\le K-N+1`.\nIf `x \\in S'_i`, then `x+N-i \\in S'_N`. So `x \\le K-N+i`.\nThis means that if `S_j` is to be `S'_i`, any element `x \\in S_j` must be `\\le K-N+i`.\nThe most restrictive condition is for `S'_1`. Any `x \\in S'_1` must satisfy `x \\le K-N+1`.\nThe least restrictive condition is for `S'_N`. Any `x \\in S'_N` must satisfy `x \\le K`.\n\nThe key insight is that *any* set `S` can be `S'_N` if it does not contain `K+1`.\nAnd *any* set `S` can be `S'_1` if all its elements `x` satisfy `x \\le K-N+1`.\nThe condition is that *there exists* a way to rearrange.\nThis implies that if we can pick one set `S_j` to be `S'_1` such that all its elements `x \\le K-N+1`, and one set `S_k` to be `S'_N` such that it contains `\\{x+N-1 \\mid x \\in S_j\\}`, and for the remaining `N-2` sets we can fill in the gaps.\n\nThis is a known type of problem. The condition `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` for `1 \\le i \\le N-1` means that the sets `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N` must be \"compatible\" with a shift.\nIf `K \\in S_j` for some `j`, then `S_j` *must* be `S'_N`. If there are multiple such `S_j`, then it's impossible.\nSo, if the array contains `k_K > 1` sets that contain `K`, the answer is 0.\nIf the array contains `k_K = 1` set that contains `K`, say `S_X`, then `S_X` must be `S'_N`. The remaining `N-1` sets must form `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_{N-1}`. None of these `N-1` sets can contain `K`. Also, for any `x \\in S'_i` (where `i < N`), `x+N-1-i \\in S'_{N-1}`. This means `x+N-1-i \\le K-1`. The most restrictive is `x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+N-2 \\le K-1 \\implies x \\le K-N+1`.\nIf the array contains `k_K = 0` sets that contain `K`, then any set `S_j` can be `S'_N`. In this case, for any `x \\in S'_i`, `x+N-i \\in S'_N`. This means `x+N-i \\le K-1` (since `S'_N` does not contain `K`). The most restrictive is `x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+N-1 \\le K-1 \\implies x \\le K-N`.\n\nLet `M = 998244353`.\n\nLet `f(k_max)` be the number of subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, k_max\\}`. This is `2^{k_max}` if `k_max \\ge 0`, and `1` (for `\\emptyset`) if `k_max < 0`.\nSo `pow2(k_max) = pow(2, max(0, k_max), M)`.\n\n**Scenario 1: No set contains `K`.**\nAll sets `S_i` must be subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nFurthermore, for any `S_i` to be `S'_1`, all its elements `x` must satisfy `x \\le K-N`.\nFor any `S_i` to be `S'_N`, all its elements `x` must satisfy `x \\le K-1`.\nThe condition \"there exists a way to rearrange\" means that we must be able to pick an `S'_1` such that `max(S'_1) \\le K-N`, and `S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N` can be filled in.\nIt turns out that if no set contains `K`, then *any* set can be `S'_N`.\nAnd *any* set can be `S'_1` if all its elements `x \\le K-N`.\nThe condition for the whole array `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` to be valid is that all `S_i` must be subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nAnd there must exist a permutation.\nIf all sets `S_i` are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`, then `S_i` is a child of `S_j` if `\\{x+1 \\mid x \\in S_i\\} \\subseteq S_j`.\nIf `N=1`, any set `S_1 \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}` is valid. `2^K` ways.\nMy formula:\nCase 1: `(2^{K-1})^1 = 2^{K-1}`.\nCase 2: `1 * (2^0)^0 * 2^{K-1} = 2^{K-1}`.\nTotal `2^{K-1} + 2^{K-1} = 2^K`. This works for `N=1`.\n\nLet's reconsider the condition `x \\le K-N+i` for `x \\in S'_i`.\nThis means `S'_i \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K-N+i\\}`.\nSo `S'_1 \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K-N+1\\}`.\n`S'_2 \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K-N+2\\}`.\n...\n`S'_N \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}`.\n\nThis implies that for a given array `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]`, if it is to be valid, there must exist a permutation `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N` such that `S'_i \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K-N+i\\}` for all `i`.\nThis is a matching problem. We have `N` sets `S_j` and `N` \"slots\" `R_i = \\{1, \\ldots, K-N+i\\}`. We need to assign each `S_j` to a unique `R_i` such that `S_j \\subseteq R_i`.\nThis is Hall's Marriage Theorem, but for sets.\n\nA simpler observation by others in similar problems:\nThe condition `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` for `1 \\le i \\le N-1` means that the maximum element in `S'_i` must be less than `K`.\nIf `K \\in S_j`, then `S_j` cannot be a child of any set. So `S_j` must be `S'_N`.\nIf there is no set that contains `K`, then all sets are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nIn this case, any `S_i` can be `S'_N`.\nThe condition `x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+N-1 \\in S'_N` means that `max(S'_1) \\le K-N`.\nThis is the standard interpretation. Let's stick with this.\n\nThe total number of sets `S` that can be formed using elements from `1` to `K` is `2^K`.\nLet `C_j` be the condition that `S_j` contains `K`.\nLet `A` be the set of arrays where at most one `S_j` contains `K`.\nLet `A_0` be the set of arrays where no `S_j` contains `K`.\nLet `A_1` be the set of arrays where exactly one `S_j` contains `K`.\n\nFor `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` to be valid:\n1. At most one `S_j` contains `K`.\n2. If `K \\in S_j`, then `S_j` must be `S'_N`. The other `N-1` sets (none containing `K`) must form `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_{N-1}`. For these `N-1` sets, `x \\in S'_i \\implies x+N-1-i \\le K-1`. The most restrictive is `x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+N-2 \\le K-1 \\implies x \\le K-N+1`.\n3. If no `S_j` contains `K`, then for any `x \\in S'_i`, `x+N-i \\le K-1`. The most restrictive is `x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+N-1 \\le K-1 \\implies x \\le K-N`.\n\nThis is the interpretation I used initially.\nLet's re-check the example `N=2, K=2`.\n`MOD = 998244353`.\n`ans = 0`.\n\nCase 1: No set contains `K=2`.\nAll sets `S_i` must be subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\} = \\{1, \\ldots, 2-2\\} = \\{1, \\ldots, 0\\} = \\emptyset`.\nSo `S_1 = \\emptyset, S_2 = \\emptyset`. This gives `[\\{\\}, \\{\\}]`.\nNumber of such arrays: `pow(pow(2, max(0, K-N), MOD), N, MOD) = pow(pow(2, 0, MOD), 2, MOD) = pow(1, 2, MOD) = 1`.\n`ans = 1`.\n\nCase 2: Exactly one set contains `K=2`.\nThe `N-1=1` set (not containing `K`) must be a subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N+1\\} = \\{1, \\ldots, 2-2+1\\} = \\{1, \\ldots, 1\\} = \\{1\\}`.\nSo this set can be `\\{\\}` or `\\{1\\}`. (2 choices).\nThe set containing `K=2` must contain `2`. It can also contain any subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\} = \\{1\\}`.\nSo this set can be `\\{2\\}` or `\\{1, 2\\}`. (2 choices).\nNumber of ways to choose the `N-1` sets: `pow(pow(2, max(0, K-N+1), MOD), N-1, MOD) = pow(pow(2, 1, MOD), 1, MOD) = 2`.\nNumber of ways to choose the one set containing `K`: `pow(2, K-1, MOD) = pow(2, 1, MOD) = 2`.\nNumber of positions for the set containing `K`: `N = 2`.\nNumber of such arrays: `(N * 2 * 2) % MOD = (2 * 2 * 2) % MOD = 8`.\n`ans = (1 + 8) % MOD = 9`.\n\nThis is still 9. The example output 11 means that the arrays `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]` and `[\\{1\\}, \\{\\}]` are valid.\nMy interpretation of the element bounds is too strict.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"There exists a way to rearrange the order of the array of sets into `[S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N]` such that `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` for each `1 \\le i \\le N-1`.\"\n\nConsider `N=2, K=2`. Array `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]`.\nPermutations:\n1. `S'_1 = \\{\\}, S'_2 = \\{1\\}`.\n   Is `\\{\\}` a child of `\\{1\\}`? Yes, vacuously true. This permutation works. So `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]` is a valid array.\n2. `S'_1 = \\{1\\}, S'_2 = \\{\\}`.\n   Is `\\{1\\}` a child of `\\{\\}`? No, because `1 \\in \\{1\\}` but `1+1=2` is not in `\\{\\}`.\n\nThe example arrays `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]` and `[\\{1\\}, \\{\\}]` are valid.\nMy logic for Case 1 (no set contains `K`) says `K-N` is the max element.\nFor `N=2, K=2`, `K-N=0`. So max element is `0`. All sets must be `\\{\\}`.\nThis is incorrect. The set `\\{1\\}` does not contain `K=2`. It should be allowed.\n\nIf no set contains `K`, then all sets are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nIf `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}`, then for `x \\in S'_i`, `x+1 \\in S'_{i+1}`.\nThis implies `max(S'_i) + 1 \\le K` if `S'_{i+1}` is to contain `max(S'_i)+1`.\nThis means `max(S'_i) \\le K-1`. This is consistent with \"no set contains `K`\".\nThe condition `x+N-1 \\in S'_N` means `x+N-1 \\le K-1` (since `S'_N` doesn't contain `K`).\nSo `x \\le K-N`. This applies to `S'_1`.\nThis means that for an array `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` to be valid:\n1. At most one set `S_j` contains `K`. If more than one, answer is 0.\n2. If exactly one set `S_X` contains `K`: `S_X` must be `S'_N`. The other `N-1` sets `S_j` must not contain `K`. For these `N-1` sets to form `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_{N-1}`, all elements `x` in these `N-1` sets must satisfy `x \\le K-1`.\n   Also, for `S'_1`, `x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+N-2 \\in S'_{N-1}`. Since `S'_{N-1}` does not contain `K`, `x+N-2 \\le K-1 \\implies x \\le K-N+1`.\n   So for this case, `N-1` sets must be subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`. And one set `S_X` must be a subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}` containing `K`.\n   The total number of sets that are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}` is `2^{K-1}`.\n   The total number of sets that are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}` and contain `K` is `2^{K-1}`.\n   The number of ways to choose `N-1` sets (not containing `K`) is `(2^{K-1})^{N-1}`.\n   The number of ways to choose `S_X` (containing `K`) is `2^{K-1}`.\n   The number of positions for `S_X` is `N`.\n   Total for Case 2: `N \\times (2^{K-1})^{N-1} \\times 2^{K-1} = N \\times (2^{K-1})^N`.\n   This is valid if `K \\ge 1`. If `K=0`, no elements. `2^0=1`.\n   This is for `N=2, K=2`: `2 \\times (2^{2-1})^2 = 2 \\times (2^1)^2 = 2 \\times 4 = 8`. This matches my earlier calculation for Case 2.\n\n3. If no set contains `K`: All sets `S_j` must be subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\n   For these `N` sets, `x \\in S'_i \\implies x+N-i \\in S'_N`. Since `S'_N` does not contain `K`, `x+N-i \\le K-1`.\n   The most restrictive is `x \\in S'_1 \\implies x+N-1 \\le K-1 \\implies x \\le K-N`.\n   This means that `S'_1` must be a subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-N\\}`.\n   The other sets `S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N` are subsets of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\n   For the example `N=2, K=2`: `K-N = 0`. So `S'_1` must be `\\emptyset`.\n   `S'_2` must be a subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\} = \\{1\\}`. So `S'_2` can be `\\{\\}` or `\\{1\\}`.\n   The arrays `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]` and `[\\{1\\}, \\{\\}]` are valid.\n   In `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]`: `S_1 = \\{\\}, S_2 = \\{1\\}`.

Incorrect.\n\nThe formula `(K+1)^N - K^N` is for a different problem: given `N` sets, count arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` such that `S_i \\subseteq \\{0, \\ldots, K\\}` and we can reorder them `S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N` such that `S'_i \\subseteq S'_{i+1}` for all `i`.\nThis is not the problem.\n\nLet's use the current logic, which seems to work for the example.\n`N_all = pow(2, max(0, K-1), MOD)`\n`N_small = pow(2, max(0, K-N), MOD)`\n`ans1 = (pow(N_all, N, MOD) - pow(N_all - N_small + MOD, N, MOD) + MOD) % MOD`\n\n`N_small_for_N_minus_1 = pow(2, max(0, K-(N-1)), MOD)`\n`N_K_set = pow(2, max(0, K-1), MOD)` (This is `N_all`)\n`term_for_N_minus_1_sets = (pow(N_all, N-1, MOD) - pow(N_all - N_small_for_N_minus_1 + MOD, N-1, MOD) + MOD) % MOD`\n`ans2 = (N % MOD * term_for_N_minus_1_sets % MOD * N_K_set % MOD) % MOD`\n\nSpecial case `N=1`:\n`ans1 = (pow(N_all, 1, MOD) - pow(N_all - N_small + MOD, 1, MOD) + MOD) % MOD`\n`N_small = pow(2, max(0, K-1), MOD) = N_all`.\n`ans1 = (N_all - (N_all - N_all + MOD) + MOD) % MOD = (N_all - 0 + MOD) % MOD = N_all = 2^{K-1}`.\n`ans2 = (1 % MOD * (pow(N_all, 0, MOD) - pow(N_all - N_small_for_N_minus_1 + MOD, 0, MOD) + MOD) % MOD * N_K_set % MOD) % MOD`\n`N-1=0`. `pow(X, 0, MOD) = 1`.\n`N_small_for_N_minus_1 = pow(2, max(0, K-0), MOD) = pow(2, K, MOD)`.\n`ans2 = (1 * (1 - 1 + MOD) % MOD * N_K_set % MOD) % MOD = 0`.\nTotal for `N=1`: `ans1 + ans2 = 2^{K-1} + 0 = 2^{K-1}`.\nThis is incorrect for `N=1`. For `N=1`, any set `S_1 \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}` is valid. There are `2^K` such sets.\nMy logic gives `2^{K-1}`.\n\nThe `N=1` case is special.\nIf `N=1`, there is no `S'_i` is child of `S'_{i+1}` condition. Any array `[S_1]` is valid.\n`S_1` can be any subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}`. So `2^K` ways.\nMy formula for `N=1`:\n`ans1 = pow(2, max(0, K-1), MOD)`\n`ans2 = 0`\nTotal `pow(2, max(0, K-1), MOD)`. This is `2^{K-1}`.\nThis is wrong.\n\nThe issue for `N=1` is `N-1=0`.\nIn `Part 1`, `K-N = K-1`. So `N_small = pow(2, max(0, K-1), MOD) = N_all`.\n`ans1 = (pow(N_all, 1, MOD) - pow(N_all - N_all + MOD, 1, MOD) + MOD) % MOD = N_all`.\nThis is `2^{K-1}`.\nThis part counts arrays `[S_1]` where `S_1` does not contain `K`, and `S_1 \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, K-1\\}`.\nThis is `2^{K-1}`. This is correct.\n\nIn `Part 2`, `N-1=0`. The term `(N_all_minus_K^{N-1} - (N_all_minus_K - N_small_for_N_minus_1)^{N-1} + MOD) % MOD` becomes `(1 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 0`.\nSo `ans2 = 0`.\nThis means `ans1+ans2` for `N=1` is `2^{K-1}`.\nBut the answer should be `2^K`.\nThe `N=1` case is `S_1` is any subset of `\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}`.\nMy `ans1` counts `S_1` that don't contain `K`.\nMy `ans2` counts `S_1` that do contain `K`.\nFor `N=1`, `ans2` should be `N \\times N_K_set = 1 \\times 2^{K-1} = 2^{K-1}`.\nSo total `2^{K-1} + 2^{K-1} = 2^K`.\nThe `term_for_N_minus_1_sets` should be `1` if `N-1=0`.\nIf `N-1=0`, `N=1`. The `N-1` sets are an empty list of sets. This condition `at least one of N-1 sets...` is vacuously true.\nSo `pow(N_all, 0, MOD) = 1`. `pow(N_all - N_small_for_N_minus_1 + MOD, 0, MOD) = 1`.\nSo `term_for_N_minus_1_sets = (1 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 0`. This is the problem.\nIf `N-1=0`, the number of ways to pick `N-1` sets is `1` (the empty list of sets).\nSo `term_for_N_minus_1_sets` should be `1` when `N-1=0`.\n\nCorrected `term_for_N_minus_1_sets`:\nIf `N-1 == 0`: `term_for_N_minus_1_sets = 1`.\nElse: `term_for_N_minus_1_sets = (pow(N_all, N-1, MOD) - pow(N_all - N_small_for_N_minus_1 + MOD, N-1, MOD) + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nLet's recheck `N=1, K=2`.\n`N_all = pow(2, 1, MOD) = 2`.\n`N_small = pow(2, 1, MOD) = 2`.\n`ans1 = (pow(2, 1, MOD) - pow(2 - 2 + MOD, 1, MOD) + MOD) % MOD = (2 - 0 + MOD) % MOD = 2`.\nThis is correct for `S_1 \\subseteq \\{1\\}`. These are `\\{\\}, \\{1\\}`.\n\n`N=1`. `term_for_N_minus_1_sets = 1`.\n`N_K_set = pow(2, 1, MOD) = 2`.\n`ans2 = (1 % MOD * 1 % MOD * 2 % MOD) % MOD = 2`.\nThis is correct for `S_1` containing `2`. These are `\\{2\\}, \\{1,2\\}`.\n\nTotal `ans = (2 + 2) % MOD = 4`.\nFor `N=1, K=2`, the sets are `\\{\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{1,2\\}`. Total 4. Correct.\n\nFinal check with `N=2, K=2`.\n`N_all = pow(2, 1, MOD) = 2`.\n`N_small = pow(2, 0, MOD) = 1`.\n`ans1 = (pow(2, 2, MOD) - pow(2 - 1 + MOD, 2, MOD) + MOD) % MOD = (4 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 3`. Correct.\n\n`N-1 = 1`. `term_for_N_minus_1_sets` (not `N-1=0` case).\n`N_small_for_N_minus_1 = pow(2, max(0, 2-(2-1)), MOD) = pow(2, 1, MOD) = 2`.\n`term_for_N_minus_1_sets = (pow(N_all, 1, MOD) - pow(N_all - N_small_for_N_minus_1 + MOD, 1, MOD) + MOD) % MOD`\n`term_for_N_minus_1_sets = (pow(2, 1, MOD) - pow(2 - 2 + MOD, 1, MOD) + MOD) % MOD = (2 - 0 + MOD) % MOD = 2`.\n`N_K_set = pow(2, 1, MOD) = 2`.\n`ans2 = (2 % MOD * 2 % MOD * 2 % MOD) % MOD = 8`. Correct.\n\nTotal `ans = (3 + 8) % MOD = 11`. Correct.\n\nThis refined logic seems solid.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    # Helper function for modular exponentiation\n    def power(base, exp):\n        res = 1\n        base %= MOD\n        while exp > 0:\n            if exp % 2 == 1:\n                res = (res * base) % MOD\n            base = (base * base) % MOD\n            exp //= 2\n        return res\n\n    # Helper function for 2^exp, handling exp < 0 by returning 1 (for empty set)\n    def pow2_safe(exp):\n        if exp < 0:\n            return 1 # Corresponds to 2^0 = 1, meaning only empty set is possible\n        return power(2, exp)\n\n    # Part 1: No set contains K\n    # All N sets must be subsets of {1, ..., K-1}.\n    # And at least one set must be a subset of {1, ..., K-N}.\n    # N_all represents the number of subsets of {1, ..., K-1}\n    N_all = pow2_safe(K - 1)\n    # N_small represents the number of subsets of {1, ..., K-N}\n    N_small = pow2_safe(K - N)\n\n    # Total ways to choose N sets, all subsets of {1, ..., K-1}\n    total_ways_all_subsets_K_minus_1 = power(N_all, N)\n    \n    # Ways to choose N sets, all subsets of {1, ..., K-1} BUT NONE are subsets of {1, ..., K-N}\n    # This means each of the N sets must contain at least one element from {K-N+1, ..., K-1}\n    # Number of such sets is N_all - N_small\n    ways_none_small = power((N_all - N_small + MOD) % MOD, N)\n    \n    ans1 = (total_ways_all_subsets_K_minus_1 - ways_none_small + MOD) % MOD\n\n    # Part 2: Exactly one set contains K\n    # This set must be S'_N.
