    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Lexicographical Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this string manipulation problem. The core is finding the smallest string achievable by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, or '1's and '2's, but *not* directly swapping '0' and '2'. This immediately screams \"constraints.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the implications of these allowed swaps.  Swapping '0' and '1' means they can be reordered relative to each other. Same goes for '1' and '2'.  But what about '0' and '2'? Can they *effectively* swap? That's the crucial question.\n\nI started playing around with examples. \"012\" can become \"102\" or \"021\". I realized that no matter what, if a '0' is to the left of a '2' initially, it *must* remain to the left of the '2'. The same logic would hold if '2' is to the left of '0'.\n\nLet's look more closely at this '0' and '2' interaction. Can a '0' somehow \"move\" past a '2'? The answer is a resounding *no*.  I tried to imagine situations where they're separated by '1's.  Even with intervening '1's, because a '0' can only swap with a '1' and a '2' can only swap with a '1', the relative order of '0's and '2's is *fixed*. If I have \"0...2\" in the input, I *must* have \"0...2\" in the output, no matter how many '1's are in between.\n\nThis is a powerful constraint. It dictates the overall structure of the solution.  The only thing that I can manipulate is the internal ordering of '0's and '1's, and '1's and '2's.  Essentially, the '0's have to come first, the '2's have to be at the end. The '1's can be rearranged wherever they are in relation to each other, based on what the smallest lexicographical representation dictates. This is starting to feel like a sorting problem with a clever twist on the comparison function, given the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' directly is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap: \"01\" <-> \"10\". This means '0's can move past '1's and vice versa.\n2. '1' and '2' can swap: \"12\" <-> \"21\". This means '1's can move past '2's and vice versa.\n\nCrucially, '0' and '2' cannot swap directly. Let's consider if they can swap indirectly.\nSuppose we have a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j` with `i < j`. To move the '0' to the right of the '2' (i.e., `0` effectively crosses `2`), the '0' must somehow pass the '2'.\nA '0' can only swap with a '1'. A '2' can only swap with a '1'.\nThis means a '0' can never directly interact with a '2'. If there is a '1' between them, say \"012\", '0' can swap with '1' to get \"102\", or '1' can swap with '2' to get \"021\". In neither case does the '0' move past the '2'. The '0' remains to the left of the '2'.\nTherefore, the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that '2' in the final string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it must remain so.\n\nThis implies that '0's and '2's act as barriers to each other.\nAll '0's can be moved to the left as much as possible, as long as they don't cross any '2's.\nAll '2's can be moved to the right as much as possible, as long as they don't cross any '0's.\nThe '1's are \"freely movable\" with respect to '0's and '2's. That is, a '1' can move past any '0' and any '2'.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each character:\n- `count0`: number of '0's\n- `count1`: number of '1's\n- `count2`: number of '2's\n\nConsider the structure of the final string.\nAll '0's must come before all '2's *if they were originally in that order*.\nHowever, '1's can move freely. This means all '1's can be grouped together.\n\nLet's find the first '2' in the string. All '0's that appear before this first '2' can be moved to the very beginning of the string.\nAll '1's can be moved past any '0's and any '2's. This means all '1's can be grouped together.\nWhere should these '1's go for a lexicographically minimal string?\nThey should come after all '0's that can be moved to the front, and before any '2's that cannot be moved past.\n\nLet's re-examine the invariant: The relative order of '0's and '2's cannot change.\nThis means that if we extract all '0's and '2's from the original string and form a subsequence, say `subsequence_02`, this subsequence must remain the same in the final string.\nFor example, if `s = \"100210\"`, `subsequence_02 = \"0020\"`. This means the first '0' must be before the second '0', which must be before the '2', which must be before the third '0'.\n\nSince '1's can move past '0's and '2's, they can essentially be \"removed\" from the string, and then \"inserted\" back anywhere.\nTo make the string lexicographically minimal:\n1. We want to put all '0's as far left as possible.\n2. Then all '1's.\n3. Then all '2's.\n\nHowever, the '0's and '2's have fixed relative order.\nThis implies that '0's can move left until they hit a '2'.\n'2's can move right until they hit a '0'.\n'1's are completely \"free\" to move past both '0's and '2's.\n\nThis means we can conceptually separate the '1's from the '0's and '2's.\nLet's count all '1's. Let this be `num_ones`.\nNow, consider the string `s'` formed by removing all '1's from `s`.\nFor example, if `s = \"100210\"`, then `s' = \"0020\"`. `num_ones = 2`.\nThe relative order of characters in `s'` cannot change.\nSo, the final string will look like `s'_prefix + (all_ones) + s'_suffix`.\nWhere should the `num_ones` characters go in `s'` to make the overall string lexicographically minimal?\nThey should go at the first position where inserting them does not make the string larger.\nSince '1' is greater than '0' but smaller than '2', the ideal place for all '1's is after all '0's from `s'` and before all '2's from `s'`.\nIf `s'` contains '0's and '2's, we want to put '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nSo, we should put all `num_ones` characters right after the last '0' in `s'`, or at the very beginning if `s'` starts with '2'.\n\nLet's refine this:\n1. Count the total number of '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `num_ones`.\n2. Construct a new string `s_prime` by taking all characters from `s` that are NOT '1'.\n3. The final string will be formed by placing all `num_ones` '1's into `s_prime`. To make it lexicographically minimal, we want to place these '1's after all '0's in `s_prime` and before any '2's in `s_prime`.\n   This means we find the first occurrence of '2' in `s_prime`. If `s_prime` contains '0's and '2's, all '0's will be before this '2'. We should insert all '1's right before this first '2'.\n   If `s_prime` contains no '2's (only '0's), then all '1's should be appended at the end of `s_prime`.\n   If `s_prime` contains no '0's (only '2's), then all '1's should be prepended at the beginning of `s_prime`.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `num_ones = 2` (from `s[0]` and `s[4]`).\n2. `s_prime = \"0020\"` (characters at indices 1, 2, 3, 5).\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 2 (`s_prime[2]`).\n   So, `s_prime` can be split into `s_prime[0:2]` (\"00\") and `s_prime[2:]` (\"20\").\n   We insert `num_ones` '1's between these parts: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\".\n   Result: \"001120\".\n\nExample: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `num_ones = 4` (from `s[0], s[1], s[5], s[7]`).\n2. `s_prime = \"2222\"` (characters at indices 2, 3, 4, 6).\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 0.\n   So, `s_prime` can be split into `s_prime[0:0]` (\"\") and `s_prime[0:]` (\"2222\").\n   We insert `num_ones` '1's between these parts: \"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\".\n   Result: \"11112222\".\n\nExample: `s = \"20\"`\n1. `num_ones = 0`.\n2. `s_prime = \"20\"`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 0.\n   Split `s_prime` into \"\" and \"20\".\n   Insert 0 '1's: \"\" + \"\" + \"20\".\n   Result: \"20\".\n\nThis logic seems correct and covers all cases.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Iterate through the input string once to count '1's and build `s_prime`.\n- Find the insertion point for '1's in `s_prime`.\n- Construct the final string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    s_prime_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the string to count '1's and build s_prime\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_prime_chars.append(char_s)\n            \n    # Find the insertion point for '1's in s_prime\n    # We want to insert '1's after all '0's and before all '2's in s_prime\n    insertion_idx = 0\n    for i in range(len(s_prime_chars)):\n        if s_prime_chars[i] == '2':\n            insertion_idx = i\n            break\n    else: # If no '2' is found, insert '1's at the very end\n        insertion_idx = len(s_prime_chars)\n            \n    # Construct the result string\n    result_chars = []\n    result_chars.extend(s_prime_chars[:insertion_idx])\n    result_chars.extend(['1'] * num_ones)\n    result_chars.extend(s_prime_chars[insertion_idx:])\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_chars) + \"\\n\")\n\n# The problem statement implies multiple test cases based on the example input format\n# However, competitive programming platforms typically provide one string per line for such problems.\n# The example input format ['100210', '11222121', '20'] suggests reading one line at a time.\n# Let's stick to the standard competitive programming input reading for a single string.\n# If multiple lines of input were expected, a loop would be around the solve() function.\n# For this problem, it's safer to assume a single string input as per typical constraints.\n# The `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` handles reading a single line.\nsolve()\n\n```",
