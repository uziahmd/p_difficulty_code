He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Challenge of Prefixes and Suffixes**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're given a bunch of strings, and our task is to figure out whether they're prefixes or suffixes of some mystery string `s`. The key is that `s` has length `n`, and we're given all the possible prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to `n-1`. I'm thinking, since we're guaranteed a solution, there's a neat pattern here.\n\nThe first thing that jumps out is that for each length `k` (from 1 to `n-1`), we have exactly two strings. One is the prefix, and the other is the suffix.  This tells me that if we can reconstruct string `s`, we can then easily identify which strings are prefixes ('P') and which are suffixes ('S').\n\nNow, let's think about how to construct `s`. If we look at the longest prefix and suffix we have (length `n-1`), their relationship holds the answer. Let's call them `prefix_n_minus_1` and `suffix_n_minus_1`. To make a full string `s` of length `n`, it's going to be `prefix_n_minus_1` followed by a character OR a character prepended to `suffix_n_minus_1`. To have a valid consistent string, `prefix_n_minus_1[1:]` must be equal to `suffix_n_minus_1[:-1]`.\n\nSo, the strategy is this:\n\n1.  Read the input, storing each string with its original index.\n2.  Find the two strings that have length `n-1`. Let's call them `str1` and `str2`.\n3.  We'll make two assumptions about these strings and attempt to build the string:\n    *   **Case 1:** Assume `str1` is the prefix and `str2` is the suffix.\n    *   **Case 2:** Assume `str2` is the prefix and `str1` is the suffix.\n4.  For each case, check for consistency: does `P[1:] == S[:-1]`?\n    *   If yes, we can reconstruct the string `s` as `P[0] + S`.\n5.  If we build `s` with a valid combination, we verify that all other given strings match the prefix or suffix of string `s` according to their length. We have to keep track of this, ensuring that for any given length `k` we have exactly 1 prefix and 1 suffix, so that we produce a coherent assignment.\n6.  The code outputs a string of 'P's and 'S's to identify whether each original input string is a prefix or suffix, respectively. We continue this process until we find the solution, which the problem says is guaranteed.\n\nIf, after reconstructing the string and marking each input string with a character, we go through the input string, checking all strings as per the reconstructed `s`.  If we do this for both cases and find a coherent prefix and suffix assignments, we have the answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to identify which of the given `2n-2` strings are prefixes ('P') and which are suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that these strings are all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`), and that for each length `k` from 1 to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings: one is the prefix `s[0...k-1]` and the other is the suffix `s[n-k...n-1]`. We are also guaranteed that a consistent string `s` exists.\n\nThe core idea is to reconstruct the original string `s`. The key insight comes from the strings of length `n-1`. There are exactly two such strings given in the input. One must be the prefix `s[0...n-2]` and the other must be the suffix `s[1...n-1]`.\n\nLet's denote the two strings of length `n-1` as `str_A` and `str_B`. There are two possibilities for their roles:\n1.  `str_A` is the prefix of length `n-1` (`P_n_minus_1`) and `str_B` is the suffix of length `n-1` (`S_n_minus_1`).\n2.  `str_B` is the prefix of length `n-1` (`P_n_minus_1`) and `str_A` is the suffix of length `n-1` (`S_n_minus_1`).\n\nFor each possibility, we can attempt to reconstruct `s`:\n*   If `P_n_minus_1` is `s[0...n-2]` and `S_n_minus_1` is `s[1...n-1]`, then for these to be consistent, the substring `s[1...n-2]` must be common to both. This means `P_n_minus_1[1:]` must be equal to `S_n_minus_1[:-1]`.\n*   If this consistency check passes, we can reconstruct the full string `s`. For example, `s` would be `P_n_minus_1[0] + S_n_minus_1`.\n\nOnce we have a candidate string `s`, we need to verify if all `2n-2` input strings can be correctly assigned as prefixes or suffixes of this `s`.\nThe verification process works as follows:\n1.  Initialize an array `current_assignments` of size `2n-2` to store 'P' or 'S' for each input string.\n2.  Keep track of how many prefixes and suffixes we've found for each length `k` (from 1 to `n-1`). We expect exactly one prefix and one suffix for each length. We can use `prefix_found_count[k]` and `suffix_found_count[k]` for this, initialized to 0.\n3.  First, assign `P_n_minus_1` and `S_n_minus_1` to their respective roles and update their counts.\n4.  Then, iterate through all other `2n-2` input strings (excluding the two length `n-1` strings which are already assigned). For each input string `text` at its `original_idx`:\n    *   Determine its `length`.\n    *   Check if `text` is equal to `s[0:length]` (the prefix of `s` of that length). Let this be `is_expected_prefix`.\n    *   Check if `text` is equal to `s[n-length:n]` (the suffix of `s` of that length). Let this be `is_expected_suffix`.\n    *   If `is_expected_prefix` is true AND `prefix_found_count[length]` is 0, assign `current_assignments[original_idx] = 'P'` and increment `prefix_found_count[length]`.\n    *   Else if `is_expected_suffix` is true AND `suffix_found_count[length]` is 0, assign `current_assignments[original_idx] = 'S'` and increment `suffix_found_count[length]`.\n    *   If neither of these conditions is met, it means `text` cannot be assigned correctly (either it's not a prefix/suffix of `s`, or we've already assigned both the prefix and suffix for its length). In this case, the current candidate `s` is invalid, and we return `None`.\n5.  After iterating through all strings, check if all `prefix_found_count[k]` and `suffix_found_count[k]` are exactly 1 for all `k` from 1 to `n-1`. If not, `s` is invalid, return `None`.\n6.  If all checks pass, `s` is valid, and we return the `\"\".join(current_assignments)` string.\n\nWe try this verification for both possibilities of `str_A`/`str_B` roles. Since the problem guarantees a valid answer exists, one of these attempts will succeed. We print the first valid assignment string found.\n\nThis approach correctly handles cases where the prefix and suffix of a certain length `k` are identical strings (e.g., `s=\"aaa\"`, length 1 prefix \"a\", length 1 suffix \"a\"). The `if`/`else if` structure ensures that one of the identical input strings gets 'P' and the other gets 'S', which is the desired behavior given the problem's guarantees.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Store strings along with their original indices\n    input_strings_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s_input = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        input_strings_with_indices.append((s_input, i))\n    \n    # Filter strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1_strings = []\n    for s_input, idx in input_strings_with_indices:\n        if len(s_input) == n - 1:\n            len_n_minus_1_strings.append((s_input, idx))\n    \n    # These are the two strings of length n-1\n    str1, idx1 = len_n_minus_1_strings[0]\n    str2, idx2 = len_n_minus_1_strings[1]\n\n    def check_and_assign(p_n_minus_1, s_n_minus_1, p_n_minus_1_idx, s_n_minus_1_idx):\n        # Consistency check: prefix[1:] must match suffix[:-1]\n        # Example: if P = \"ababa\" (n=5), S = \"baba\", then P[1:] = \"baba\", S[:-1] = \"bab\"\n        # This is not correct.
