Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the String Transformation Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem involving string manipulation and modular arithmetic, and my immediate thought is that a straightforward approach of building the final string is a dead end. The string could grow exponentially large, which is a big no-no given the constraints.  We're given an initial string `s` of digits, and then a series of replacement queries, each in the form `di -> ti`.  After applying all the replacements, we need the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007.\n\nThe \"aha!\" moment here is the modular arithmetic. It's hinting that we need to be clever about how we calculate the string's value. We *can't* construct the massive string and then take the modulus. We need an approach that factors in the modulus at every step.\n\nSince direct string construction is out, I'm thinking dynamic programming or a recursive approach. Probably building from the \"ground up,\" understanding the effect of each digit.  We're given digits '0' through '9', and each digit effectively \"transforms\" into something else based on these queries.\n\nMy strategy is to define `val[d]` as the final numerical value of the string that digit `d` transforms into, and `len[d]` as the final length.  Initially, `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`. Then, for each query `di -> ti`, I need to update `val[di]` and `len[di]`.  `ti` can be viewed as the concatenation of digits that represent the final strings they transform into. If `ti` is something like \"123\", this means `di` becomes the concatenated values of (final string 1) + (final string 2) + (final string 3). This seems to keep the string length growth manageable. The key is to propagate updates through dependencies: whenever a `ti` contains a `dj`, which could itself transform to another `tk`, we need to trace those dependencies to compute `val[di]` and `len[di]`.\n\nI need to carefully track the values and lengths, applying the modulo operation at each stage to keep things from exploding. I think a recursive function or a DP table, processing queries in reverse or in dependency order, will be the way to go here. Let's start sketching out the recursive relationships...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the numerical value of a string `s` after a series of digit replacements, modulo 10^9 + 7. The string `s` can become extremely long, so we cannot explicitly construct it. Instead, we must track the length and value contributions of each digit.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nWe can think of each digit '0' through '9' as eventually transforming into some (potentially very long) string. Let `val[d]` be the numerical value of the string that `d` eventually transforms into, and `length[d]` be the length of that string, both modulo `MOD - 1` for length (since it's an exponent) and `MOD` for value.\n\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` transforms into itself:\n- `val[d] = d` (as an integer, e.g., `val['5'] = 5`)\n- `length[d] = 1`\n\nWhen a query `di -> ti` arrives, it means that from now on, any `di` should be replaced by `ti`. This effectively changes what `di` transforms into. The crucial observation is that queries are performed in order, and later queries affect the transformations of digits `0-9` that might appear in `ti` of earlier queries. For example, if `2->00` is followed by `0->7`, then `2` eventually becomes `77`. This suggests processing queries in reverse order.\n\nIf we process queries in reverse:\nWhen we are at query `k` (say, `di -> ti`), we assume that `val[c]` and `length[c]` for all digits `c` already reflect the transformations from queries `k+1` to `n-1`. Now we need to update `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on `ti`.\n\nFor a given `ti = t_m t_{m-1} \\dots t_1 t_0`:\nThe numerical value of `ti` (after all subsequent transformations) will be:\n`val[t_m] * 10^{L_{m-1} + \\dots + L_0} + val[t_{m-1}] * 10^{L_{m-2} + \\dots + L_0} + \\dots + val[t_1] * 10^{L_0} + val[t_0]`\nwhere `L_j` is `length[t_j]`.\nAll additions and multiplications are modulo `MOD`. Exponents are modulo `MOD - 1` because of Fermat's Little Theorem (for `10^(L)` mod `MOD`, if `MOD` is prime, `10^(L)` is `10^(L mod (MOD-1))`).\n\nLet's maintain `current_val` and `current_length` for `ti`:\n- Initialize `new_val_di = 0`\n- Initialize `new_length_di = 0`\n- Initialize `power_of_10 = 1` (this represents `10` raised to the sum of lengths of digits processed so far from the right)\n\nIterate through `ti` from right to left (from `t_0` to `t_m`):\nFor each digit `c` in `ti` (which is `t_j`):\n1. `new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[c] * power_of_10) % MOD`\n2. `new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[c]) % (MOD - 1)`\n3. `power_of_10 = (power_of_10 * pow(10, length[c], MOD)) % MOD`\n\nAfter iterating through all digits in `ti`, `new_val_di` and `new_length_di` will be the new `val[di]` and `length[di]`. Update them:\n`val[di] = new_val_di`\n`length[di] = new_length_di`\n\nSpecial case: If `ti` is empty, then `val[di]` becomes 0 and `length[di]` becomes 0. This is naturally handled by the initialization `new_val_di = 0`, `new_length_di = 0` if the loop for `ti` doesn't run.\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` will store the final value and length for each original digit `d`.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of the initial string `s = s_k s_{k-1} \\dots s_1 s_0`.\nThis is done similarly:\n- Initialize `final_ans = 0`\n- Initialize `power_of_10_overall = 1`\nIterate through `s` from right to left (from `s_0` to `s_k`):\nFor each digit `c` in `s`:\n1. `final_ans = (final_ans + val[c] * power_of_10_overall) % MOD`\n2. `power_of_10_overall = (power_of_10_overall * pow(10, length[c], MOD)) % MOD`\n\nThe `pow(10, length[c], MOD)` function calculates `10` to the power of `length[c]` modulo `MOD`. Since `length[c]` can be `0`, `pow(10, 0, MOD)` correctly returns `1`.\n\nExample: `s = \"123\"`, queries: `2->00`, `0->7`\nInitial:\n`val = {'0':0, '1':1, ..., '9':9}`\n`length = {'0':1, '1':1, ..., '9':1}`\n\nQueries in reverse:\n1. `0->7`:\n   `ti = \"7\"`. `c = '7'`.\n   `new_val_0 = (0 + val['7'] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n   `new_length_0 = (0 + length['7']) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n   `power_of_10 = (1 * pow(10, length['7'], MOD)) % MOD = (1 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 10`\n   Update: `val['0'] = 7`, `length['0'] = 1`\n\n2. `2->00`:\n   `ti = \"00\"`.\n   Process `t_0 = '0'`:\n     `new_val_2 = (0 + val['0'] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n     `new_length_2 = (0 + length['0']) % (MOD - 1) = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\n     `power_of_10 = (1 * pow(10, length['0'], MOD)) % MOD = (1 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 10`\n   Process `t_1 = '0'`:\n     `new_val_2 = (7 + val['0'] * 10) % MOD = (7 + 7 * 10) % MOD = 77`\n     `new_length_2 = (1 + length['0']) % (MOD - 1) = (1 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 2`\n     `power_of_10 = (10 * pow(10, length['0'], MOD)) % MOD = (10 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 100`\n   Update: `val['2'] = 77`, `length['2'] = 2`\n\nFinal values (only relevant ones shown):\n`val = {'0':7, '1':1, '2':77, ..., '9':9}`\n`length = {'0':1, '1':1, '2':2, ..., '9':1}`\n\nCalculate for `s = \"123\"`:\n`final_ans = 0`, `power_of_10_overall = 1`\n\nProcess `s_0 = '3'`:\n  `final_ans = (0 + val['3'] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 3 * 1) % MOD = 3`\n  `power_of_10_overall = (1 * pow(10, length['3'], MOD)) % MOD = (1 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 10`\nProcess `s_1 = '2'`:\n  `final_ans = (3 + val['2'] * 10) % MOD = (3 + 77 * 10) % MOD = (3 + 770) % MOD = 773`\n  `power_of_10_overall = (10 * pow(10, length['2'], MOD)) % MOD = (10 * pow(10, 2, MOD)) % MOD = 10 * 100 % MOD = 1000`\nProcess `s_2 = '1'`:\n  `final_ans = (773 + val['1'] * 1000) % MOD = (773 + 1 * 1000) % MOD = (773 + 1000) % MOD = 1773`\n  `power_of_10_overall = (1000 * pow(10, length['1'], MOD)) % MOD = (1000 * pow(10, 1, MOD)) % MOD = 10000`\n\nResult: `1773`. This matches the example `222 -> 777` (if initial `s=\"222\"`, it would be `val['2']*100 + val['2']*10 + val['2'] = 77*100 + 77*10 + 77 = 7700 + 770 + 77 = 8547`. Wait, the example output is `777`. What went wrong?\nAh, the example `222 -> 777` is for `2->0, 0->7`.\nLet's retrace with `s=\"222\"`, `2->0`, `0->7`.\nInitial: `val[d]=d`, `length[d]=1` for all `d`.\nQueries: `Q = [\"2->0\", \"0->7\"]`. Process in reverse:\n1. `0->7`: `ti=\"7\"`.\n   `val['0'] = val['7'] = 7`\n   `length['0'] = length['7'] = 1`\n2. `2->0`: `ti=\"0\"`.\n   `val['2'] = val['0'] = 7`\n   `length['2'] = length['0'] = 1`\nFinal: `val['0']=7, length['0']=1`, `val['2']=7, length['2']=1`.\nCalculate for `s=\"222\"`:\n`final_ans = 0`, `p = 1`\n`c='2'`: `final_ans = (0 + val['2']*1) = 7`. `p = (1 * pow(10, length['2'], MOD)) = 10`.\n`c='2'`: `final_ans = (7 + val['2']*10) = (7 + 7*10) = 77`. `p = (10 * pow(10, length['2'], MOD)) = 100`.\n`c='2'`: `final_ans = (77 + val['2']*100) = (77 + 7*100) = 777`. `p = (100 * pow(10, length['2'], MOD)) = 1000`.\nResult: `777`. This matches the example. My previous manual trace was incorrect for the values. The logic is sound.\n\nThe maximum length of `s` is 10^5. The number of queries `n` is up to 10^5. The sum of lengths of `ti` is up to 10^5.\nEach query takes `O(|ti|)` time.
