Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the deal:** I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where we're given a string `S` built from '0's and '1's. The goal is to count the total number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding substrings of `S`. The tricky part is that these substrings are Morse code representations, and there are a bunch of rules and constraints.\n\nInitially, I had this whole idea of storing sets of sequences for each substring, but that quickly became too memory-intensive. It felt wrong. I needed to focus on the problem’s core. The `10^9 + 7` modulo hinted at counting \"ways\" rather than tracking distinct objects.\n\nThen it hit me: the problem is subtly asking for the *sum of the number of ways* to decode each possible substring of the evolving string `S`.  It's not about keeping track of unique *decoded* sequences, but rather the total number of ways the substrings can be *partitioned* into valid Morse codes. That’s a game changer!\n\nThe problem basically boils down to a dynamic programming approach. After each character append, I have to figure out the number of ways each newly formed substring can be decoded. I need to calculate it for all possible substrings. Let’s say the string at the moment is `S` and its length is `k`. Then I have to calculate the number of ways to decode substrings `S[j...k-1]` where `j` goes from `0` to `k-1`.\n\nLet's call `count_ways(sub)` the number of ways to decode a substring `sub`. To do this, I need to look at each prefix within the string. I will use a DP array where `dp[i]` is the number of ways to decode the substring from index `i` to the end. The final answer is simply the sum of all `count_ways` for each substring I get after appending a character to `S`, keeping modulo operation in mind. The time complexity seems to be manageable too!\n\nSo, the plan is: append the character, then calculate the \"ways\" for each new substring by iterating backwards to calculate the substrings and keep adding them to `total_ans`.  It's all about finding the number of partitions that can form that substring. This approach finally seems efficient, given that `m` can be up to 3000! I am on the right track!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding *any* substring of a growing string `S`. The string `S` is built by appending '0's and '1's one at a time. After each append, we need to report the total count modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nA key simplification comes from the problem statement and example:\n1. There are 26 distinct Morse code strings (length 1-4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") that map to 26 distinct English letters.\n2. If a Morse code string `sub` can be partitioned in multiple ways (e.g., \"11\" can be \"11\" or \"1\", \"1\"), each distinct partition results in a distinct sequence of English letters (e.g., \"M\" vs \"TT\").\n3. If two different substrings `sub1` and `sub2` are decoded, they will always produce disjoint sets of sequences of English letters. This is because if `sub1` and `sub2` are different strings, their structure (and thus their possible partitions) will be different, leading to different letter sequences. Even if they are the same length, e.g., \"10\" vs \"01\", the resulting sequences will be distinct.\n\nGiven these points, the problem simplifies to:\nAfter each character is appended to `S`, let `S` have length `k`. We need to calculate `count_ways(sub)` for every non-empty substring `sub` of `S`, and sum these counts. `count_ways(sub)` is the number of ways `sub` can be partitioned into valid Morse codes.\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nLet `invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\nA string `s` is a valid Morse code if `1 <= len(s) <= 4` and `s not in invalid_codes`.\n\nWhen a new character is appended to `S`, increasing its length from `k-1` to `k`, new substrings are formed. These are all substrings ending at the new last character `S[k-1]`. Specifically, these are `S[j...k-1]` for `j` from `0` to `k-1`.\n\nWe can calculate `count_ways(S[j...k-1])` for all `j` from `k-1` down to `0` efficiently.\nLet `dp[j]` be the number of ways to decode the substring `S[j...k-1]`.\nWe can compute `dp[j]` using a backward DP approach:\nBase case: `dp[k] = 1`. This represents the \"empty string\" following `S[k-1]`, which is useful for the recurrence.\nFor `j` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[j] = 0`\n  For `length` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `j + length <= k`: (i.e., `S[j...j+length-1]` is a valid substring of `S`)\n      Let `sub = S[j : j + length]`.\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code (i.e., `sub not in invalid_codes`):\n        `dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j + length]) % MOD`\n  The value `dp[j]` now holds `count_ways(S[j...k-1])`.\n  We add this `dp[j]` to our running total `total_sequences`.\n\nAfter computing all `dp[j]` for `j=k-1` down to `0`, `total_sequences` will hold the sum of `count_ways` for all substrings ending at `S[k-1]`. This sum is then added to the overall `total_sequences` from previous steps.\n\nThe length of `S` can be up to `m = 3000`.\nFor each of the `m` appends:\n  We iterate `j` from `k-1` down to `0` (which is `k` iterations).\n  Inside the `j` loop, we iterate `length` from `1` to `4` (constant 4 iterations).\n  String slicing and `in` operator for `invalid_codes` take constant time since `length` is at most 4.\nSo, each append operation takes `O(k)` time.\nThe total time complexity will be `sum(k for k=1 to m) = O(m^2)`.\nFor `m = 3000`, `m^2 = 9 \\times 10^6`, which is efficient enough.\n\nExample walk-through for `S=\"111\"`:\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n`current_S = \"\"`\n`total_sequences = 0`\n\n1. Append '1'. `current_S = \"1\"`, `k = 1`.\n   `dp` array of size `k+1 = 2`. `dp[1] = 1`.\n   `j = 0`:\n     `sub = \"1\"` (length 1). Valid.\n     `dp[0] = (0 + dp[0+1]) % MOD = (0 + dp[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n   `total_sequences = (0 + dp[0]) % MOD = 1`.\n   Output: `1`.\n\n2. Append '1'. `current_S = \"11\"`, `k = 2`.\n   `dp` array of size `k+1 = 3`. `dp[2] = 1`.\n   `j = 1`: (for substring `S[1...1] = \"1\"`)\n     `sub = \"1\"` (length 1). Valid.\n     `dp[1] = (0 + dp[1+1]) % MOD = (0 + dp[2]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n   `total_sequences = (1 + dp[1]) % MOD = 2`.\n   `j = 0`: (for substring `S[0...1] = \"11\"`)\n     `sub = \"1\"` (length 1). Valid. `dp[0] = (0 + dp[0+1]) % MOD = (0 + dp[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n     `sub = \"11\"` (length 2). Valid. `dp[0] = (1 + dp[0+2]) % MOD = (1 + dp[2]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n   `total_sequences = (2 + dp[0]) % MOD = (2 + 2) % MOD = 4`.\n   Output: `4`. (This matches the example's implicit logic for S=\"11\" which resulted in 3. My interpretation gets 4. Let's re-check the example again. The example output for S=\"11\" is 3. My calculation for S=\"11\" is `count_ways(\"1\")` from `S[0]` (1) + `count_ways(\"1\")` from `S[1]` (1) + `count_ways(\"11\")` from `S[0...1]` (2) = 4. The problem statement's example for `S=\"111\"` lists 7 sequences. If we sum up `count_ways` for all substrings: `S[0]` (\"1\"): 1 way. `S[1]` (\"1\"): 1 way. `S[2]` (\"1\"): 1 way. `S[0...1]` (\"11\"): 2 ways. `S[1...2]` (\"11\"): 2 ways. `S[0...2]` (\"111\"): 4 ways. Total = 1+1+1+2+2+4 = 11. But the example says 7. This means my interpretation of \"sum of ways to decode *each substring*\" is wrong.\n\nThe example's list for S=\"111\" is:\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"111\")\nTotal 7 distinct sequences.\n\nThis implies that if a sequence `X` can be formed by `S[i...j]` and also by `S[p...q]`, it is counted only once.\nHowever, if `S[i...j]` can be decoded in two ways to `X` and `Y`, both `X` and `Y` are counted.\nAnd if `S[i...j]` and `S[p...q]` are distinct substrings, their generated sequences are distinct.\nThis is exactly what the problem states: \"each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter\". This means if \"1\" -> 'T' and \"11\" -> 'M', then 'T' != 'M'.\nSo, a partition `c1 c2 ... ck` of a substring `sub` will always result in a unique letter sequence `L1 L2 ... Lk`.\nIf `sub1` and `sub2` are distinct substrings, then any sequence `L` generated by `sub1` cannot be equal to any sequence `L'` generated by `sub2`. This is because the underlying Morse code string (`sub1` vs `sub2`) is different.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the example `S=\"111\"` to result in 7 is if it's counting:\n`count_ways(\"1\")` for `S[0]` (1 way: \"T\")\n`count_ways(\"11\")` for `S[0...1]` (2 ways: \"M\", \"TT\")\n`count_ways(\"111\")` for `S[0...2]` (4 ways: \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\")\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nThis means we only consider substrings starting at index 0. This is a common pattern in competitive programming, often called \"prefix DP\".\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to decode the prefix `S[0...i-1]`.\n`dp[0] = 1` (empty string)\n`dp[i] = sum(dp[i-len])` where `S[i-len...i-1]` is a valid Morse code.\n\nSo, after `k` appends, `S` has length `k`.\nWe want to calculate `count_ways(S[0...i-1])` for `i=1...k`.\nLet `current_dp[i]` be the number of ways to decode `S[0...i-1]`.\n`current_dp[0] = 1`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `k`:\n  `current_dp[i] = 0`\n  For `length` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `i - length >= 0`:\n      `sub = S[i-length : i]`\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code:\n        `current_dp[i] = (current_dp[i] + current_dp[i - length]) % MOD`\n\nThe total answer after `k` appends is `sum(current_dp[i] for i=1...k)`.\nThis `current_dp` array is computed for each new `S`.\nWhen `S` grows from `k-1` to `k`, we only need to compute `current_dp[k]`.\nThe values `current_dp[1]` through `current_dp[k-1]` remain the same as in the previous step.\nSo, we maintain a `dp` array. When `S` gets a new character `S[k-1]`:\n`dp[k] = 0`\nFor `length` from `1` to `4`:\n  If `k - length >= 0`:\n    `sub = S[k-length : k]`\n    If `sub` is a valid Morse code:\n      `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k - length]) % MOD`\nAfter computing `dp[k]`, we add `dp[k]` to `total_sequences`.\n\nLet's re-trace with this corrected interpretation:\n`S = \"\"`\n`dp = [1]` (represents `dp[0]=1` for empty prefix)\n`total_sequences = 0`\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n\n1. Append '1'. `S = \"1\"`, `k = 1`.\n   `dp` now needs size `k+1 = 2`. `dp = [1, 0]`.\n   Compute `dp[1]`:\n     `length = 1`: `sub = S[0:1] = \"1\"`. Valid.\n       `dp[1] = (0 + dp[1-1]) % MOD = (0 + dp[0]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n   `total_sequences = (0 + dp[1]) % MOD = 1`.\n   Output: `1`. (Matches example)\n\n2. Append '1'. `S = \"11\"`, `k = 2`.\n   `dp` now needs size `k+1 = 3`. `dp = [1, 1, 0]`.\n   Compute `dp[2]`:\n     `length = 1`: `sub = S[1:2] = \"1\"`. Valid.\n       `dp[2] = (0 + dp[2-1]) % MOD = (0 + dp[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n     `length = 2`: `sub = S[0:2] = \"11\"`. Valid.\n       `dp[2] = (1 + dp[2-2]) % MOD = (1 + dp[0]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n   `total_sequences = (1 + dp[2]) % MOD = (1 + 2) % MOD = 3`.\n   Output: `3`. (Matches example!)\n\n3. Append '1'. `S = \"111\"`, `k = 3`.\n   `dp` now needs size `k+1 = 4`. `dp = [1, 1, 2, 0]`.\n   Compute `dp[3]`:\n     `length = 1`: `sub = S[2:3] = \"1\"`. Valid.\n       `dp[3] = (0 + dp[3-1]) % MOD = (0 + dp[2]) % MOD = (0 + 2) % MOD = 2`.\n     `length = 2`: `sub = S[1:3] = \"11\"`. Valid.\n       `dp[3] = (2 + dp[3-2]) % MOD = (2 + dp[1]) % MOD = (2 + 1) % MOD = 3`.\n     `length = 3`: `sub = S[0:3] = \"111\"`. Valid.\n       `dp[3] = (3 + dp[3-3]) % MOD = (3 + dp[0]) % MOD = (3 + 1) % MOD = 4`.\n   `total_sequences = (3 + dp[3]) % MOD = (3 + 4) % MOD = 7`.\n   Output: `7`. (Matches example!)\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the example.\nThe overall complexity is still `O(m^2)` because `S` string grows and string slicing takes `O(length)` time. However, since `length` is at most 4, slicing `S[k-length : k]` is `O(1)`. The `dp` array itself grows, but we only access `dp[k-1]`, `dp[k-2]`, etc. The `dp` array can be implemented as a list in Python, which resizes dynamically, or a fixed-size array if we know `m` beforehand. Appending to `S` is also `O(1)` for Python strings (amortized) or `O(k)` for list of characters. If `S` is built as a list of characters, then `S[k-length : k]` would be `O(length)` for slicing.\nTo be truly `O(1)` for string operations, we can maintain `S` as a `collections.deque` or a list and access characters by index. Slicing `S[k-length : k]` then becomes `S[k-length]` to `S[k-1]`.\nSince `length` is at most 4, we only need to check `S[k-1]`, `S[k-2:k]`, `S[k-3:k]`, `S[k-4:k]`.\nWe can construct these 4 substrings using direct character access, which is `O(1)` for each substring.\nSo, the calculation for `dp[k]` is `O(1)`.\nThe total time complexity is `O(m)`. This is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    # Set of invalid Morse codes\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    # S will store the current Morse code string as a list of characters\n    S = []\n\n    # dp[i] will store the number of ways to decode the prefix S[0...i-1]\n    # dp[0] is 1 (for an empty string, one way to decode)\n    dp = [1] \n\n    total_sequences = 0\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char_to_append = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(char_to_append)\n        current_len = len(S)\n\n        # Calculate dp[current_len]\n        # This is the number of ways to decode the entire string S[0...current_len-1]\n        \n        current_ways_for_S = 0\n        \n        # Check substrings of S ending at current_len-1, of length 1 to 4\n        # These are S[current_len-1 : current_len] (length 1)\n        # S[current_len-2 : current_len] (length 2)\n        # S[current_len-3 : current_len] (length 3)\n        # S[current_len-4 : current_len] (length 4)\n        \n        # Iterate through possible lengths of the last Morse code segment\n        for length in range(1, 5):\n            if current_len - length >= 0:\n                # Extract the substring S[current_len-length : current_len]\n                # Join characters to form the Morse code string\n                sub = \"\".join(S[current_len - length : current_len])\n                \n                if sub not in invalid_codes:\n                    # If this substring is a valid Morse code, \n                    # add the number of ways to decode the prefix before it (dp[current_len - length])\n                    current_ways_for_S = (current_ways_for_S + dp[current_len - length]) % MOD\n        \n        dp.append(current_ways_for_S)\n        \n        # Add the number of ways to decode the current full string S\n        # to the total count of distinct sequences.\n        total_sequences = (total_sequences + current_ways_for_S) % MOD\n        \n        sys.stdout.write(str(total_sequences) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
