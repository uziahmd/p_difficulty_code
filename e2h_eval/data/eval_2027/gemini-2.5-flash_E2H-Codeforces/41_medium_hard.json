There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Zoning Restrictions Revisited: A Python-Powered Profit Maximization**\n\nMy goal is to craft a Python solution for this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem.  The core challenge revolves around maximizing profit by strategically adjusting house heights under imposed restrictions.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my thinking:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Constraints:**  There are `n` houses with heights between 0 and `h`.  Each house's profit is its height squared.  Restrictions are defined as tuples `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, which mean that every house within the range `l_j` to `r_j` (inclusive) must have a height no greater than `x_j`.  The key insight is that this restriction applies *individually* to each house in the range, not to the maximum within the range as I might have initially thought.\n\n2.  **Developing a Strategy:** To maximize profit, I need to find the optimal height for each house. Given that profit is height squared, I want each height to be as large as possible.  For each house `i`, its height is limited by two things: the global maximum `h`, and any restrictions that apply to it. Therefore, the optimal height `h_i` is the minimum of `h` and the lowest `x_j` associated with any restriction that covers house `i`.\n\n3.  **Data Structures and Algorithm:** I will use a list `max_allowed_heights` to store the maximum permissible height for each house, initialized to `h`.  Then, I'll iterate through the restrictions, updating the corresponding entries in `max_allowed_heights` by taking the minimum of the current value and the restriction's `x_j` value. After processing all the restrictions, `max_allowed_heights` will contain the optimal heights. Finally, I will calculate the total profit by summing the squares of the values in `max_allowed_heights`.\n\n4.  **Time Complexity and Efficiency:** The time complexity of this approach is `O(n + m * n)`.  Initializing the `max_allowed_heights` list is `O(n)`. Processing each of the `m` restrictions, in the worst case, requires iterating through all `n` houses.  Calculating the total profit is another `O(n)` operation.  Given that `n` and `m` are small (at most 50), this is extremely efficient.\n\n5.  **Implementation Details:** The Python code will:\n    *   Read the input values `n`, `h`, and `m`.\n    *   Initialize the `max_allowed_heights` list.\n    *   Iterate through the restrictions, adjusting the `max_allowed_heights` accordingly.\n    *   Compute the total profit.\n    *   Output the total profit.\n\n6.  **Example Validation:** The logic is confirmed by stepping through an example.\n    A test case with `n=3, h=3, m=3` gives the following:\n    Initial heights:  `[3, 3, 3]`.\n    Restrictions: `(1, 1, 1)`, `(2, 2, 3)`, `(3, 3, 2)`\n    Final heights:  `[1, 3, 2]`. Total profit: `1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n7.  **Edge Cases Check:** I also verify the solution's correctness with the below edge cases.\n    - No restrictions (`m=0`): the profit is `n * h^2`.\n    - Restrictions on single houses: handled by the algorithm.\n    - Multiple restrictions on a house: The min operation correctly applies the tightest constraint.\n    -  `x_i = 0`: House at the position must have height `0`.\n8.  **Final Code Review:** After verifying time complexity and edge cases, I believe the Python script will correctly solve the problem according to the specifications.\n",
