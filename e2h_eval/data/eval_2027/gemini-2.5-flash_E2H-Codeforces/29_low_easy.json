            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Substitutes in Number\n\nAndrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string s, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Let's Get This Coding!**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem staring me down. The task is straightforward: manipulate a digit string based on a series of substitutions and then find the final numerical value, modulo a large prime.  My initial thought is that a straightforward string replacement approach is a dead end. I immediately see the potential for exponential string growth, which screams \"time limit exceeded\" and \"memory error\" – classic pitfalls in competitive programming! The constraints confirm this, with a maximum string length and number of queries both at 10^5.\n\nI need to get clever.  I'm thinking about the way digits contribute to the overall value - it’s all about the powers of ten and this recursive relationship. `d_k * 10^k + ... d_0 * 10^0`. So the answer is a cascading power-of-10 kind of thing.\n\nSince the order of application matters, I figured out that if I process the queries in reverse, I can keep track of what each digit *eventually* becomes. Think of it as mapping each initial digit to its final, post-substitution, representation. If a digit gets transformed into a multi-digit string, I can handle that as well.\n\nI'll iterate through the string, and substitute the individual digits based on my mapping, and calculate the number at each step using the familiar power of 10 technique. By the end, I should have a modular result without constructing the massive, intermediate string. That's the key.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then find the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The key challenge is that the string length can grow exponentially, making direct string manipulation infeasible.\n\nWe need to find the numerical value `V` of the final string `s_final` modulo `M = 1000000007`.\nThe value of a string `d_k d_{k-1} ... d_1 d_0` is `d_k * 10^k + d_{k-1} * 10^{k-1} + ... + d_1 * 10^1 + d_0 * 10^0`.\nThis can be computed as `sum(digit * 10^position)` or iteratively as `((...((d_k * 10 + d_{k-1}) * 10 + d_{k-2}) * 10 + ...) * 10 + d_0)`.\n\nSince replacements can affect digits that were themselves results of previous replacements (e.g., `2 -> 0` then `0 -> 7`), processing queries in reverse order is a common and effective strategy for this type of problem.\n\nLet's maintain two pieces of information for each digit `d` from `0` to `9`:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value that a single digit `d` eventually contributes to the total sum, modulo `M`.\n2.  `len[d]`: The length of the string that a single digit `d` eventually expands into, modulo `M-1` (for powers of 10).\n\nInitially, before any queries are processed:\n*   For each digit `d` (0-9):\n    *   `val[d] = d`\n    *   `len[d] = 1` (a single digit has length 1)\n\nNow, process the queries in reverse order (from `n-1` down to `0`).\nFor each query `di -> ti`:\nWe want to update `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on what `ti` expands into.\n`ti` is a string of digits `t_k t_{k-1} ... t_1 t_0`.\nThe value of `ti` (after all subsequent replacements) would be:\n`val[t_k] * 10^(L_k) + val[t_{k-1}] * 10^(L_{k-1}) + ... + val[t_0] * 10^(L_0)`\nwhere `L_j` is the sum of lengths of `t_0` through `t_{j-1}`.\nThis can be computed iteratively:\n`new_val_di = 0`\n`new_len_di = 0`\nIterate `c` from `ti` (characters of `ti`) from right to left (or `ti` from left to right, accumulating powers of 10):\nFor `c` in `ti` (processing from left to right):\n`new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, len[int(c)], M) + val[int(c)]) % M`\n`new_len_di = (new_len_di + len[int(c)]) % (M - 1)` (Lengths are added, and the exponent for powers of 10 is modulo `M-1` due to Fermat's Little Theorem, as `M` is prime).\n\nAfter processing `ti` this way, update `val[di] = new_val_di` and `len[di] = new_len_di`.\nIf `ti` is an empty string, then `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n\nAfter all queries are processed in reverse, `val[d]` and `len[d]` will store the final value and length for each original digit `d` in the initial string `s`.\n\nFinally, calculate the value of the initial string `s`:\n`final_ans = 0`\n`current_power_of_10 = 0` (this represents the exponent for the current digit, starting from the rightmost digit of `s`)\nIterate `c` from `s` (characters of `s`) from right to left:\n`digit = int(c)`\n`final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit] * pow(10, current_power_of_10, M)) % M`\n`current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 + len[digit]) % (M - 1)`\n\nThe result `final_ans` is the answer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Sample 3): `s = 222`, `n = 2`, `2->0`, `0->7`**\n\n`M = 1000000007`\n`MOD_EXP = M - 1 = 1000000006`\n\nInitial state (for digits 0-9):\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nQueries in reverse:\n1.  `0 -> 7` (This is the second query, `q[1]`)\n    `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n    `new_val_0 = 0`\n    `new_len_0 = 0`\n    Process `c = '7'` from `ti`:\n    `digit_c = int('7') = 7`\n    `new_val_0 = (new_val_0 * pow(10, len[7], M) + val[7]) % M`\n    `new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, 1, M) + 7) % M = 7`\n    `new_len_0 = (new_len_0 + len[7]) % MOD_EXP`\n    `new_len_0 = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\n    Update: `val[0] = 7`, `len[0] = 1`\n    State:\n    `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2.  `2 -> 0` (This is the first query, `q[0]`)\n    `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n    `new_val_2 = 0`\n    `new_len_2 = 0`\n    Process `c = '0'` from `ti`:\n    `digit_c = int('0') = 0`\n    `new_val_2 = (new_val_2 * pow(10, len[0], M) + val[0]) % M`\n    `new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, 1, M) + 7) % M = 7` (Note: `val[0]` is now 7)\n    `new_len_2 = (new_len_2 + len[0]) % MOD_EXP`\n    `new_len_2 = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1` (Note: `len[0]` is now 1)\n    Update: `val[2] = 7`, `len[2] = 1`\n    State:\n    `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nAll queries processed.
