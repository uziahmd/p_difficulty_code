    "thought": "**Tackling the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and need to figure out a couple of things. First, I have to determine the smallest number of nodes, which I'll call `n`, needed to create a directed graph with a specific property. This property relates to \"p\"-reachable pairs. Second, among all the graphs with that minimal node count, I need to identify the one with the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet me break down these terms, making sure I fully grasp what the problem is asking.  A pair of nodes `(u, v)` is considered \"reachable from each other\" if there's a path from `u` to `v` and a path from `v` back to `u`.  Essentially, this means they're part of the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).  Importantly, the problem specifies that `u < v`, so I'm only counting pairs where the first node has a lower label than the second. I have to count how many of these \"reachable from each other\" pairs there are, and this number is designated as `p`.\n\nNow, an \"unidirectional pair\" `(u, v)` means there's a path from `u` to `v`, but crucially, there's *no* path from `v` back to `u`. I need to find the graph with the maximum number of these unidirectional pairs, given that our graph has the minimum possible number of nodes `n` and satisfies the \"p\"-reachable constraint.\n\nThinking about the node labels, they're typically integers. The `u < v` condition strongly hints that we're dealing with node labels like `1, 2, ..., n`.  Let's keep that in mind.\n\n**Part 1: Minimizing Nodes (n)**\n\nMy initial thought is that the size of Strongly Connected Components plays a major role. If I have a group of `k` nodes in an SCC, like `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k`, every unique pair `(s_i, s_j)` with `s_i < s_j` within that SCC contributes to the \"reachable from each other\" count, `p`.  There are exactly `k * (k - 1) / 2` such pairs within an SCC of size `k`.\n\nTo get the largest possible `p` with a given number of nodes, I should try to make as big an SCC as I can. If all `n` nodes form one gigantic SCC, I'll get the maximum possible number of \"reachable from each other\" pairs, which will be `n * (n - 1) / 2`.  So, if I denote this function as `f(n) = n * (n - 1) / 2`, I am looking for the smallest `n` for which `f(n) >= p`.\n\nWhat about the case where `p = 0`? The initial node count could be either 0 or 1. However, since the problem states `u < v`, and there are no valid pairs if only 1 node exists, so that means `n = 0` for `p=0`, as there are no pairs `u<v`. The example output for `p=0` is `0 0`. If `p=0`, then `n=0` to create no pairs.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum `n`, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n- A pair `(u, v)` with `u != v` is \"reachable from each other\" if there's a path `u -> v` and a path `v -> u`. This means `u` and `v` are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n- A graph is `p`-reachable if it has exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- A pair `(u, v)` is \"unidirectional\" if `u != v`, there's a path `u -> v`, and no path `v -> u`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n` for a given `p`.**\n\nThe number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` that are reachable from each other depends on the sizes of the SCCs. If an SCC has `k` nodes, it contributes `k * (k - 1) / 2` such pairs. To minimize `n` for a given `p`, we should make the SCCs as large as possible. The most efficient way to achieve `p` pairs is to have one large SCC.\n\nLet `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` be the maximum number of `u < v` reachable pairs achievable with `k` nodes (by making all `k` nodes form a single SCC).\nWe need to find the smallest `n` such that `f(n) >= p`.\nWe can iterate `n = 0, 1, 2, ...` and calculate `f(n)` until `f(n) >= p`.\n\nFor `p = 0`:\n- `f(0) = 0 * (-1) / 2 = 0`. So, `n = 0` nodes gives `p = 0` reachable pairs.\n- The example output for `p=0` is `0 0`, confirming `n=0` is the minimum.\n\nFor `p > 0`:\n- `n = 1`: `f(1) = 0`.\n- `n = 2`: `f(2) = 1`.\n- `n = 3`: `f(3) = 3`.\n- `n = 4`: `f(4) = 6`.\n- ...\nSince `f(n)` is strictly increasing for `n >= 1`, we can find the minimum `n` by iterating.\nThe maximum `p` is `2 * 10^5`.\n`n * (n - 1) / 2 = 2 * 10^5` implies `n^2 - n - 4 * 10^5 = 0`.\n`n` is approximately `sqrt(4 * 10^5) = sqrt(40 * 10^4) = 200 * sqrt(10) approx 200 * 3.16 = 632`.\nSo `n` will be at most around 633. A simple loop is efficient enough.\n\nLet `n_min` be this minimum `n` such that `f(n_min) >= p`.\nIf `f(n_min) == p`, then all `n_min` nodes form a single SCC.\nIf `f(n_min) > p`, then we need `p` pairs. We can form an SCC of size `k` such that `f(k) <= p`, and then use `n_min - k` other nodes as isolated nodes or in other small SCCs to reach exactly `p` pairs. To minimize `n`, we should make one SCC of size `k_0` where `f(k_0)` is the largest value `f(k_0) <= p`. Then we need `p - f(k_0)` more pairs. We can take `k_0` nodes in one SCC, and `n_min - k_0` isolated nodes. The total nodes is `n_min`. The `p` pairs are achieved by having `k_0` nodes in an SCC and `p - f(k_0)` additional pairs formed by adding `m` nodes to form an SCC of size 2. This is actually exactly what the `n_min` calculation does: `n_min` is the smallest `N` such that `N*(N-1)/2 >= p`. To get exactly `p` pairs, we make an SCC of size `N-1` (contributing `(N-1)*(N-2)/2` pairs) and then `p - (N-1)*(N-2)/2` pairs are formed by taking some of the remaining `1` node and `N-1` nodes. This can be done by making `k` nodes form an SCC and `N-k` nodes isolated. The number of pairs is `k*(k-1)/2`. We need `k*(k-1)/2 = p`. If `p` is not a triangular number, say `p = 3`, `n_min = 3` because `f(3) = 3`. If `p = 4`, `n_min = 4` because `f(3) = 3 < 4` and `f(4) = 6 >= 4`. In this case, we can take 3 nodes in an SCC (3 pairs), and 1 isolated node. Total 4 nodes, 3 pairs. We need 4 pairs. This implies we need `p` to be exactly `k*(k-1)/2` for some `k`. If `p` is not a triangular number, we need to take `k` nodes to form an SCC, where `k*(k-1)/2` is the largest triangular number less than or equal to `p`. The remaining `p - k*(k-1)/2` pairs must be formed by `m` additional nodes, each forming an SCC of size 2. This means we use `m` additional nodes to form `m` pairs. So `n = k + m`. The total pairs would be `k*(k-1)/2 + m`.\nThe minimum `n` is found by:\n1. Find `k` such that `k*(k-1)/2` is the largest triangular number less than or equal to `p`.\n2. Let `rem_p = p - k*(k-1)/2`. This is the number of additional pairs needed.\n3. Each additional pair needs 2 nodes that form an SCC. So we need `rem_p` additional nodes.\n4. Total nodes `n = k + rem_p`.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n1. `f(1)=0, f(2)=1, f(3)=3`. Largest `f(k) <= 4` is `f(3)=3`. So `k=3`.\n2. `rem_p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3. We need `1` additional node.\n4. `n = 3 + 1 = 4`.\nThis is the minimum number of nodes.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs.**\n\nA unidirectional pair `(u, v)` exists if `u -> v` but not `v -> u`. This happens if `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there is a path from `u`'s SCC to `v`'s SCC.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we want to maximize paths between different SCCs. This is achieved by forming a \"chain\" of SCCs.\nLet the SCCs be `S_1, S_2, ..., S_m`. If we add edges such that there's a path from `S_i` to `S_j` if `i < j`, and no path from `S_j` to `S_i` if `i < j`, then all pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is in `S_i`, `v` is in `S_j`, and `i < j` will be unidirectional.\n\nLet `n_min` be the minimum number of nodes calculated in Part 1.\nThe configuration for `n_min` nodes is:\n- One SCC of size `k` (contributing `k*(k-1)/2` pairs).\n- `rem_p = p - k*(k-1)/2` additional nodes, each forming an SCC of size 1, but paired with one of the `k` nodes to form `rem_p` SCCs of size 2. This means we have `k - rem_p` nodes in the main SCC, and `rem_p` SCCs of size 2, each consisting of one node from the original `k` nodes and one of the `rem_p` additional nodes.\nThis is incorrect. The `rem_p` pairs must be formed by *distinct* pairs of nodes. This implies `rem_p` SCCs of size 2, each using 2 nodes.\nSo, we have `k` nodes forming an SCC (contributing `k*(k-1)/2` pairs). The remaining `rem_p` pairs must come from `rem_p` distinct SCCs of size 2. Each such SCC uses 2 nodes. So, `2 * rem_p` nodes are used for these.\nTotal nodes = `k + 2 * rem_p`. This would be the `n_min` we calculated.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `n_min` for `p=4`:\n1. `k=3` (for `f(3)=3` pairs).\n2. `rem_p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3. We need 1 additional pair. This requires 2 nodes forming an SCC of size 2.\n4. Total nodes `n = k + 2*rem_p = 3 + 2*1 = 5`.\nThis matches the example `p=4 -> 5 6`.\n\nSo, the structure of the graph with `n_min` nodes to achieve `p` reachable pairs is:\n- One SCC of size `k`.\n- `rem_p` SCCs of size 2.\n- `n_min - k - 2*rem_p` isolated nodes (each forming an SCC of size 1).\n\nLet `N_k = k` be the size of the large SCC.\nLet `N_2 = rem_p` be the number of SCCs of size 2.\nLet `N_1 = n_min - k - 2*rem_p` be the number of SCCs of size 1 (isolated nodes).\n\nTotal number of nodes `n_min = N_k + 2*N_2 + N_1`.\nTotal number of SCCs `m = 1 + N_2 + N_1`.\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, arrange these `m` SCCs in a chain.\nLet the SCCs be `C_1, C_2, ..., C_m`. We add edges such that there's a path from `C_i` to `C_j` iff `i < j`. For example, add an edge from one node in `C_i` to one node in `C_{i+1}` for all `i=1, ..., m-1`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs is `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} |C_i| * |C_j|`.\nThis is equivalent to `(sum_{i=1}^m |C_i|)^2 - sum_{i=1}^m |C_i|^2` divided by 2, which simplifies to `(n_min^2 - sum_{i=1}^m |C_i|^2) / 2`.\nTo maximize this, we need to minimize `sum_{i=1}^m |C_i|^2`.\nThis means making the SCC sizes as \"even\" as possible.\nHowever, our SCC sizes are fixed: one SCC of size `k`, `rem_p` SCCs of size 2, and `N_1` SCCs of size 1.\nSo, `sum |C_i|^2 = k^2 + N_2 * 2^2 + N_1 * 1^2 = k^2 + 4 * N_2 + N_1`.\nThe maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(n_min^2 - (k^2 + 4*N_2 + N_1)) / 2`.\n\nLet's trace the calculation for `p=0, 3, 4`.\n\n**Case 1: `p = 0`**\n- `n_min = 0`.\n- `k=0` (since `f(0)=0`).\n- `rem_p = 0 - 0 = 0`.\n- `N_k = 0, N_2 = 0, N_1 = 0`.\n- `unidirectional_pairs = (0^2 - (0^2 + 4*0 + 0)) / 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `0 0`. Matches example.\n\n**Case 2: `p = 3`**\n- Find `k`: `f(1)=0, f(2)=1, f(3)=3`. Largest `f(k) <= 3` is `f(3)=3`. So `k=3`.\n- `rem_p = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n- `n_min = k + 2*rem_p = 3 + 2*0 = 3`.\n- `N_k = 3`.\n- `N_2 = 0`.\n- `N_1 = n_min - N_k - 2*N_2 = 3 - 3 - 0 = 0`.\n- `sum |C_i|^2 = 3^2 + 0*4 + 0*1 = 9`.\n- `unidirectional_pairs = (3^2 - 9) / 2 = (9 - 9) / 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\n**Case 3: `p = 4`**\n- Find `k`: `f(1)=0, f(2)=1, f(3)=3`. Largest `f(k) <= 4` is `f(3)=3`. So `k=3`.\n- `rem_p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n- `n_min = k + 2*rem_p = 3 + 2*1 = 5`.\n- `N_k = 3`.\n- `N_2 = 1`.\n- `N_1 = n_min - N_k - 2*N_2 = 5 - 3 - 2*1 = 0`.\n- `sum |C_i|^2 = 3^2 + 1*2^2 + 0*1^2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n- `unidirectional_pairs = (5^2 - 13) / 2 = (25 - 13) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`. Matches example.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Read `p`.\n2. If `p = 0`: print `0 0` and exit.\n3. Initialize `k = 0`.\n4. Loop while `k * (k - 1) / 2 < p`: increment `k`.\n   (This `k` will be the largest integer such that `k*(k-1)/2 <= p` if we use `k-1` for the loop condition. If we use `k*(k-1)/2 < p` then the loop will stop when `k*(k-1)/2 >= p` for the first time. Let's adjust this: find `k_val` such that `k_val * (k_val - 1) / 2` is the largest triangular number less than or equal to `p`.\n   Let `k_val = 0`. While `(k_val + 1) * k_val / 2 <= p`: `k_val += 1`.\n   This `k_val` is the size of the largest SCC we can form that contributes `k_val * (k_val - 1) / 2` pairs, which is `<= p`.\n5. `current_p = k_val * (k_val - 1) / 2`.\n6. `rem_p = p - current_p`.\n7. `n_min = k_val + 2 * rem_p`.\n8. `N_k = k_val`.\n9. `N_2 = rem_p`.\n10. `N_1 = n_min - N_k - 2 * N_2`. (This will always be 0 with this construction).\n11. `sum_sq_scc_sizes = N_k * N_k + N_2 * 2 * 2 + N_1 * 1 * 1`.\n12. `unidirectional_pairs = (n_min * n_min - sum_sq_scc_sizes) // 2`.\n13. Print `n_min` and `unidirectional_pairs`.\n\nLet's double check `N_1` calculation.\n`n_min = k_val + 2 * rem_p`.\nThe number of nodes in the large SCC is `k_val`.\nThe number of nodes in the `rem_p` SCCs of size 2 is `2 * rem_p`.\nSo, all `n_min` nodes are accounted for. `N_1` will indeed be 0.\nThis simplifies `sum_sq_scc_sizes = N_k * N_k + N_2 * 4`.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Read `p`.\n2. If `p == 0`: print `0 0`.\n3. Else:\n   a. Initialize `k_val = 0`.\n   b. While `(k_val + 1) * k_val // 2 <= p`:\n      `k_val += 1`.\n   c. `current_p = k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2`.\n   d. `rem_p = p - current_p`.\n   e. `n_min = k_val + 2 * rem_p`.\n   f. `sum_sq_scc_sizes = k_val * k_val + rem_p * 4`.\n   g. `unidirectional_pairs = (n_min * n_min - sum_sq_scc_sizes) // 2`.\n   h.
