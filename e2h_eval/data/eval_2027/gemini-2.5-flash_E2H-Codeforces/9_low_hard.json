Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Selling Souvenirs\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which looks like a variation of the knapsack problem, but with a crucial twist.  Let's break it down:  I've got `n` souvenirs, each with a weight (`wi`) and a cost (`ci`).  The goal is to pick a subset of souvenirs that maximizes the total cost, but importantly, the total weight can't exceed `m`.  Standard knapsack is probably a dead end here.\n\nThe first thing that hits me is that `n` can be up to 100,000, and `m` can be as high as 300,000.  If I went the straightforward dynamic programming route (O(N*M)), that's going to be a massive number of operations, and I need to avoid that.  However, the constraint on `wi` is key - it can only be 1, 2, or 3.  That's my ticket.\n\nThe weights being limited to 1, 2, or 3 makes all the difference.  I can categorize the souvenirs by weight and treat each category somewhat independently.  My plan is to keep three sorted lists:  `items_w1`, `items_w2`, and `items_w3`.  I'll sort them in descending order of cost.  Why descending? Because if I'm taking items of a certain weight, I want the most expensive ones first – that's a greedy approach within each weight category.\n\nNow, to make things fast during the main iteration, I'll use prefix sums. Pre-compute the sum of the first *k* items of each weight (that would be `sum_w1`, `sum_w2`, and `sum_w3`).  This allows me to quickly calculate the cost of taking a specific number of items for a given weight without having to sum them every time.  For instance, `sum_w1[k]` gives me the total cost if I take the first *k* items of weight 1.\n\nThe core logic will be about deciding how many items of each weight to include.  I can start by trying a number of weight-3 items (because they consume the most capacity), and then see how much weight capacity remains for the other types.  Essentially, I can try combinations, like how many weight 3 items? Then, how many weight 2? Finally, take as many weight 1 items as possible. The combination that yields the highest total cost, considering the weight limit, will be the optimal solution. I can store the max cost as I go and return that as the answer.\n",
