            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**I've got a tricky problem to solve!** It's about figuring out the fewest extra tiles I need to draw to create a winning combination, called a mentsu. I'm starting with just three tiles, and these tiles can be numbers (1-9) paired with suits (m, p, or s). A mentsu can be either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three sequential tiles of the same suit).\n\nMy approach will be to check for different scenarios. First, I'll see if the three tiles I begin with already form a mentsu. If so, I need zero extra draws, easy! If not, I'll see if drawing just one tile is enough to create a mentsu. This involves carefully looking at my initial tiles and checking if any two of them can combine with a single extra tile to make a mentsu. This will involve checking for either a triplet by matching tiles or a sequence by making tiles sequential.\n\nIf one draw doesn't do it, I know I'll need two draws. This is because, even with the worst possible starting hand, I can always draw two of the same tile to create a triplet with one of the existing tiles. I'll represent the tiles in a structured way to make this process easier, sorting them to identify sequences or identical tiles easily. This seems like a complete approach, I'm confident I can find the answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu (meld). She starts with three tiles. A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet of three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit).\n\nThe maximum number of tiles she might need to draw is 2. This is because with 3 initial tiles, she can always pick one of her existing tiles (e.g., '1m') and draw two more identical tiles ('1m', '1m') to form a koutsu ('1m', '1m', '1m'). Thus, the answer will be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nLet's break down the solution into checking for 0, 1, and 2 draws:\n\n1.  **Parse Input Tiles:**\n    The input tiles are strings like \"1s\", \"9m\", \"2p\". We convert them into a more usable format, such as `(number, suit)` tuples (e.g., \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`). Sorting these tuples (first by number, then by suit) can sometimes simplify comparisons, though it's not strictly necessary for all checks.\n\n2.  **Check for 0 Draws:**\n    We first check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n    A helper function `is_mentsu(t1, t2, t3)` is used for this:\n    *   **Koutsu Check:** If all three tiles `t1, t2, t3` are identical (e.g., `(1, 'm'), (1, 'm'), (1, 'm')`), it's a koutsu.\n    *   **Shuntsu Check:** If all three tiles have the same suit (e.g., `(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')`), we then check if their numbers are sequential. We sort the numbers `[t1[0], t2[0], t3[0]]` to ensure they are in ascending order before checking if `num[0] + 1 == num[1]` and `num[1] + 1 == num[2]`.\n    If `is_mentsu` returns `True` for the initial three tiles, the answer is 0.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 Draw:**\n    If 0 draws are not sufficient, we check if drawing just one tile can form a mentsu. After drawing one tile, Tokitsukaze will have four tiles in hand. A mentsu can be formed by any three of these four tiles.\n    Let the initial tiles be `T1, T2, T3`. We draw `T_new`. The four tiles are `{T1, T2, T3, T_new}`.\n    A mentsu can be formed by:\n    *   `{T1, T2, T_new}`\n    *   `{T1, T3, T_new}`\n    *   `{T2, T3, T_new}`\n    We iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from the initial hand: `(T1, T2)`, `(T1, T3)`, and `(T2, T3)`. For each pair `(A, B)`:\n    *   **Can form Koutsu with 1 draw?** If `A` and `B` are identical (e.g., `(1, 'm'), (1, 'm')`), we can draw another `A` (i.e., `(1, 'm')`) to form a koutsu `[A, A, A]`.\n    *   **Can form Shuntsu with 1 draw?** If `A` and `B` have the same suit (e.g., `(1, 'm'), (2, 'm')`):\n        *   If their numbers differ by 1 (e.g., `1m, 2m`), we can draw `3m` (or `0m` if `1m, 2m` are not `1,2` or `8,9` but `2,3` for example, then we can draw `1m` or `4m`). At least one valid tile can always be drawn to complete the sequence.\n        *   If their numbers differ by 2 (e.g., `1m, 3m`), we can draw the middle tile `2m`. This always forms a valid shuntsu.\n    If any of these conditions are met for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n4.  **Check for 2 Draws:**\n    If neither 0 draws nor 1 draw is sufficient, then the answer must be 2. As explained earlier, it's always possible to form a koutsu with 2 draws by picking any tile from the initial hand and drawing two more identical copies of it.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (3p 9m 2p):**\n\n1.  **Parse and Sort:**\n    `initial_tiles_str = ['3p', '9m', '2p']`\n    `parsed_tiles = [(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]` (after sorting)\n\n2.  **Check for 0 Draws:**\n    `is_mentsu((2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm'))`:\n    *   Koutsu: `(2, 'p') == (3, 'p')` is false.\n    *   Shuntsu: Suits are 'p', 'p', 'm'. Not all same suit.\n    Returns `False`.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 Draw:**\n    Consider pairs from `parsed_tiles`:\n    *   Pair `((2, 'p'), (3, 'p'))`:\n        *   Are they identical? No.\n        *   Are they same suit? Yes, 'p'.\n        *   Numbers are 2 and 3. `abs(2 - 3) = 1`. This satisfies `diff == 1`.\n        Therefore, 1 draw is sufficient (e.g., draw `1p` to form `[1p, 2p, 3p]` or `4p` to form `[2p, 3p, 4p]`).\n    The function prints `1` and exits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s1, s2, s3 = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    initial_tiles_str = [s1, s2, s3]\n\n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    # Example: '1s' -> (1, 's')\n    parsed_tiles = []\n    for tile_str in initial_tiles_str:\n        parsed_tiles.append((int(tile_str[0]), tile_str[1]))\n\n    # Sort tiles.
