You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Replacing Digits Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Replacing Digits\" problem, and the goal is clear: maximize the value of string 'a' by strategically replacing its digits with digits from string 's'.  The key constraint here is that we can only use each digit from 's' *once*.  It's a classic optimization problem with a greedy flavor.\n\nMy initial thought is that to maximize the resulting number, I need to focus on the leftmost digits first, because those have the most impact on the number's overall magnitude.  I'm thinking, if I can find a digit in 's' that's *larger* than the corresponding digit in 'a', I should definitely make the swap. I can't look at the whole number, but digit by digit is fine.\n\nTo make things efficient, I'll need to sort 's' in descending order. That way, I can quickly grab the largest available digit from 's' and see if it's better than the current digit in 'a'.  If I sort 's' from largest to smallest, the first element will be the best potential replacement for each position.\n\nSo, the algorithm will go like this: I'll start from the left of 'a' and, for each position, check if there's a larger digit available in 's'. If there is, swap them and move to the next digit in 's'. If not, leave the digit in 'a' as it is. It's important to remember that I can only use a digit from 's' once. So, as I use a digit from 's', I'll have to keep track and \"remove\" it from consideration for later comparisons.\n\nEffectively, I'll iterate through 'a', and for each digit, find the largest available digit in 's' and see if it is bigger than the digit currently in 'a'. If so, I'll replace it and move to the next digit. If not, I keep going. This should give me the optimized solution!\n",
