Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Let's tackle this triangle counting problem with a Python script.** My objective is to efficiently determine the number of non-degenerate triangles where the side lengths,  `x, y, z`, are integers falling within specified ranges: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure the triangles are valid, meaning they adhere to the non-degeneracy condition: the sum of any two sides must exceed the third. I'm leveraging the problem's constraints (`A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`) which *implicitly* imply that `x <= y <= z`. Because of this, two triangle inequalities, `x + z > y` and `y + z > x`, are *always* satisfied. Therefore, the *only* crucial condition to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nNow, the challenge is to avoid a computationally expensive brute-force approach. A triple loop over `x, y, z` would result in a time complexity of `O((B-A+1)(C-B+1)(D-C+1))`, leading to an unacceptable runtime. I must devise a more efficient strategy.\n\nMy refined approach involves iterating over `x` and `y` and then calculating the *number* of valid `z` values efficiently.  For fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy the conditions `C <= z <= D` and `z < x + y`. This translates into finding the number of integers within the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.  This number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nTo optimize further, I will avoid nested loops completely. I'll focus on summing over all possible `x+y` combinations, I will do this by pre-computing a difference array to represent the number of `x,y` pairs for each sum `S=x+y`. To do this, I iterate over `x`.  For a given `x`  we know that  `y` must fall within `[B,C]`. Consequently, the sum `S = x+y` will fall within `[x+B, x+C]`. I'll use a `count_pairs` array, and a `diff` array that tracks the changes to it to avoid nested loops. I initialize the count to 0, and add 1 at `count_pairs[x+B]` and subtract 1 at `count_pairs[x+C+1]` for all x. Finally calculate the cumulative prefix sum which is equivalent to number of pairs.\n\nNow, with `x` and `y` efficiently dealt with, the problem has been reduced to summing the number of  `count_pairs[k] * f(k)`. Where `count_pairs[k]` is the number of (x,y) pairs that sum to k. and `f(k)` is the number of valid values of z that can be paired with (x,y) given k.\n\nThe implementation utilizes Python's lists for efficient storage and manipulation of the count array. I'll employ the faster `sys.stdin.readline` for input and `sys.stdout.write` for output. Given the constraint limits, this method is feasible and likely to be acceptably fast. I must take into account that the maximum possible value is `B+C`, which is `10^6` and therefore I have to make a list which handles these indexes. After careful consideration of the array index ranges and the logic, the code is ready for execution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy the conditions `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given range constraints: `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `C <= z <= D`.\nFrom `x <= B` and `B <= y`, it follows that `x <= y`.\nFrom `y <= C` and `C <= z`, it follows that `y <= z`.\nCombining these, we get `x <= y <= z`. This ordering is always true for any `x, y, z` chosen according to the given ranges.\n\nFor a non-degenerate triangle with sides `x, y, z`, the triangle inequalities must hold:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nSince we established `x <= y <= z`:\n- `y + z > x`: As `y >= x` and `z >= 1` (since `C >= 1`), `y + z >= x + 1 > x`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n- `x + z > y`: As `z >= y` and `x >= 1`, `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nA naive triple loop over `x, y, z` would be too slow given `D` up to `5 * 10^5`. We need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet's fix `x` and `y` and count the valid `z` values.\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= D` and `z < x + y`.\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nTo optimize the counting, we can group `x` and `y` pairs by their sum `S = x + y`.\nLet `count_pairs[S]` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = S`.\nThen the total number of triangles is `sum_{S} (count_pairs[S] * (number of valid z for S))`.\n\nThe range of possible sums `S = x + y` is from `A + B` (minimum `x` + minimum `y`) to `B + C` (maximum `x` + maximum `y`).\nThe maximum value for `B + C` is `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`.\n\nWe can efficiently calculate `count_pairs[S]` for all `S` in `[A+B, B+C]` using a difference array (or sweep line) technique:\n1. Initialize an array `count_pairs_diff` of size `B + C + 2` with zeros. This array will store changes in counts.\n2. Iterate `x` from `A` to `B`:\n   For each `x`, `y` can range from `B` to `C`. This means `x + y` can range from `x + B` to `x + C`.\n   For every `k` in the range `[x + B, x + C]`, there is one `y` (namely `k - x`) that forms the sum `k` with `x`.\n   So, for each `x`, we effectively add 1 to `count_pairs[k]` for all `k` in `[x + B, x + C]`.\n   Using a difference array, this range update is done by:\n     `count_pairs_diff[x + B] += 1`\n     `count_pairs_diff[x + C + 1] -= 1`\n3. After iterating through all `x`, convert `count_pairs_diff` into the actual `count_pairs` array using prefix sums:\n   `count_pairs[k] = count_pairs_diff[k] + count_pairs[k-1]` (where `count_pairs[k-1]` is 0 for `k=0`).\n   More precisely, initialize `current_count = 0`. Then, for `k` from `A+B` to `B+C`:\n     `current_count += count_pairs_diff[k]`\n     `count_pairs[k] = current_count`\n\nOnce `count_pairs[S]` is computed for all relevant `S`:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Iterate `S` from `A + B` to `B + C`:\n   a. Get `num_xy_pairs = count_pairs[S]`. If `num_xy_pairs` is 0, continue to the next `S`.\n   b. Calculate `num_z_for_S = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`. This is the number of `z` values for sum `S`.\n   c. Add `num_xy_pairs * num_z_for_S` to `total_triangles`.\n\nThe time complexity:\n- Initializing `count_pairs_diff`: `O(B+C)`\n- Loop for `x` (updating `count_pairs_diff`): `O(B-A+1)`, which is `O(B)`.\n- Prefix sum calculation for `count_pairs`: `O(B+C)`.\n- Loop for `S` (calculating total triangles): `O(B+C)`.\nThe dominant term is `O(B+C)`, which is `O(10^6)` in the worst case. This is efficient enough.\n\nExample: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n1. `max_s = B+C = 5`. `count_pairs_diff` array of size `5+2=7`.\n2. `x=1`: `count_pairs_diff[1+2]+=1` (`count_pairs_diff[3]+=1`), `count_pairs_diff[1+3+1]-=1` (`count_pairs_diff[5]-=1`).\n   `count_pairs_diff = [0,0,0,1,0,-1,0]`\n3. `x=2`: `count_pairs_diff[2+2]+=1` (`count_pairs_diff[4]+=1`), `count_pairs_diff[2+3+1]-=1` (`count_pairs_diff[6]-=1`).\n   `count_pairs_diff = [0,0,0,1,1,-1,-1]`\n4. Prefix sums for `count_pairs` (array of size `5+1=6`):\n   `count_pairs[3] = 1` (from `x=1, y=2`)\n   `count_pairs[4] = 1+1 = 2` (from `x=1, y=3` and `x=2, y=2`)\n   `count_pairs[5] = 2-1 = 1` (from `x=2, y=3`)\n   `count_pairs = [0,0,0,1,2,1]` (for indices 0 to 5)\n5.

(Triangles: `(1,3,3)`, `(2,2,3)`)\n   `S=5`: `count_pairs[5]=1`. `num_z = max(0, min(4, 5-1)-3+1) = max(0, min(4,4)-3+1) = max(0, 4-3+1) = 2`. `total_triangles += 1*2 = 2`.
