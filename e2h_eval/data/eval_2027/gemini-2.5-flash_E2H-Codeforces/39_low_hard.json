Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Road to 1600 - The Vun Conundrum**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Road to 1600\" problem to tackle. It's asking for a Python script to generate an N x N board filled with numbers from 1 to N*N, with a twist: the rook's vun cost must be strictly less than the queen's. If no such board exists, I need to print -1.\n\nFirst things first, I need to deeply understand the movement rules and the vun calculation. It seems we start at '1' and move to the smallest unvisited reachable cell in each step, which is a key concept. If we're stuck (no reachable cells), we teleport to the smallest unvisited cell and pay a vun.\n\nThe challenge is to create a scenario where the rook gets \"stuck\" more often than the queen, leading to a higher vun count for the rook. The queen's movement is much more flexible, as it can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, giving it the potential to reach more cells and avoid getting trapped. This makes me suspect the solution involves a carefully crafted board that benefits the queen by forcing the rook into disadvantageous positions.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the number of reachable cells for each piece. The rook's reach is pretty straightforward: 2N - 2 cells. The queen, however, is more complex, with a reach that can be far greater. Initially, my intuition was that the queen should generally pay less vuns because of its mobility. But, clearly, the problem implies that there are cases where the rook outmaneuvers the queen in this regard. This means I need to focus on edge cases or board configurations that force the queen into suboptimal movements.\n\nLet's rethink this whole \"getting stuck\" concept. A piece gets stuck when all reachable cells are already visited. This means a rook is stuck if all cells in its row and column are visited, while the queen needs to have its row, column, and diagonals occupied. I'm starting to visualize different board structures that could create this scenario. Maybe a pattern of blocked cells or a specific distribution of numbers could be the key.\n\nLet's look at the example given for N=4, since the problem implies that such a board does exist. My intuition at the moment is that this needs to have a somewhat complex structure. I should start to analyze this N=4 example closely to see if I can find a pattern.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an `N x N` board with numbers from `1` to `N*N` such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print `-1`.\n\nLet's analyze the rules for paying vuns:\n1. The figure starts at cell `1` (which is marked visited).\n2. In each step, it looks for the minimum-numbered *unvisited* cell reachable in one move. It moves there and marks it visited.\n3. If all reachable cells are already visited, but there are still unvisited cells on the board, the figure \"teleports\" to the minimum-numbered *unvisited* cell on the entire board and pays `1` vun. This cell is marked visited.\n4. The process stops when all `N*N` cells are visited.\n\nA rook moves horizontally and vertically. A queen moves horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. This means a queen can always reach at least as many cells as a rook from any position. In general, a queen has more choices. This usually implies that a queen is less likely to get \"stuck\" (i.e., all reachable cells are visited) than a rook. If a queen gets stuck less often, it would pay fewer or equal vuns compared to a rook. Therefore, finding a board where `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` requires a specific strategy to make the queen get stuck more often.\n\nLet's consider small values of `N`:\n- For `N=1`: The board is `[1]`. Both figures start at `1` and immediately stop. Vuns: `0` for both. `0 < 0` is false. So `N=1` has no solution.\n- For `N=2`: A `2x2` board has numbers `1, 2, 3, 4`.\n  - If we place `1` at `(0,0)`:\n    - Rook from `(0,0)` can reach `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.\n    - Queen from `(0,0)` can reach `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`.\n    The queen always has more options. It is hard to make the queen pay more.\n    Let's try to construct a board.\n    Consider placing `1` and `2` far apart, e.g., `1` at `(0,0)` and `2` at `(1,1)`.\n    If `1` is at `(0,0)`, `2` at `(1,1)`, `3` at `(0,1)`, `4` at `(1,0)`:\n    `[1 3]`\n    `[4 2]`\n    Rook path: `1` (at `(0,0)`). Unvisited: `{2,3,4}`.\n      Reachable from `(0,0)`: `3` (at `(0,1)`), `4` (at `(1,0)`). Min is `3`. Move to `3`.\n      Visited: `{1,3}`. Current: `(0,1)`.\n      Reachable from `(0,1)`: `4` (at `(1,0)`). Min is `4`. Move to `4`.\n      Visited: `{1,3,4}`. Current: `(1,0)`.\n      Reachable from `(1,0)`: None (all `(0,0)` and `(1,1)` are not reachable).\n      All reachable cells from `(1,0)` are visited (none). Unvisited: `{2}`. Teleport to `2`. Pay `1` vun.\n      Rook vuns: `1`.\n    Queen path: `1` (at `(0,0)`). Unvisited: `{2,3,4}`.\n      Reachable from `(0,0)`: `3` (at `(0,1)`), `4` (at `(1,0)`), `2` (at `(1,1)`). Min is `2`. Move to `2`.\n      Visited: `{1,2}`. Current: `(1,1)`.\n      Reachable from `(1,1)`: `3` (at `(0,1)`), `4` (at `(1,0)`). Min is `3`. Move to `3`.\n      Visited: `{1,2,3}`. Current: `(0,1)`.\n      Reachable from `(0,1)`: `4` (at `(1,0)`). Min is `4`. Move to `4`.\n      Visited: `{1,2,3,4}`. All visited. Stop.\n      Queen vuns: `0`.\n    In this case, `vuns_rook (1) > vuns_queen (0)`. So `N=2` has no solution.\n\nIt seems that for small `N` (specifically `N=1, 2, 3`), it's impossible.\nThe example for `N=4` shows a solution. Let's analyze the example board:\n`4  3  6 12`\n`7  5  9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16  2`\n\nThe key idea for the example solution seems to be:\n1. Place `1` in the middle or near the middle. In the example, `1` is at `(2,1)`.\n2. Place numbers `2, 3, ..., N*N` in a way that forces the queen to get stuck.\n\nConsider a pattern where we fill numbers `1, 2, ..., N*N` in a specific order.\nIf we fill the board in a checkerboard pattern, alternating small and large numbers, it might force the queen to jump around.\nHowever, a simpler pattern might be to fill the top-left quadrant with small numbers, and the bottom-right quadrant with large numbers. This might create a \"barrier\" for the queen.\n\nLet's try a construction strategy:\nPlace numbers `1` to `ceil(N*N/2)` in one half of the board, and `ceil(N*N/2)+1` to `N*N` in the other half.\nFor example, fill the top-left `N/2 x N` rectangle (or `N x N/2` rectangle) with small numbers, and the rest with large numbers.\nThis is similar to the example `N=4` where `1` is in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by alternating small and large numbers.\nWe have `N*N` cells. Let `k = N*N`.\nWe can fill `k/2` cells with small numbers (from `1` to `k/2`) and `k - k/2` cells with large numbers (from `k/2 + 1` to `k`).\nLet's try to put small numbers in the \"top-left half\" and large numbers in the \"bottom-right half\" of the grid.\nSpecifically, for `N` rows:\n- Fill the first `ceil(N/2)` rows with small numbers.\n- Fill the remaining `floor(N/2)` rows with large numbers.\nWithin these groups, we can fill them sequentially.\n\nExample `N=4`:\n`ceil(N/2) = 2`, `floor(N/2) = 2`.\nNumbers `1` to `8` are small. Numbers `9` to `16` are large.\nFill first 2 rows with `1..8`, remaining 2 rows with `9..16`.\n`1  2  3  4`\n`5  6  7  8`\n`9 10 11 12`\n`13 14 15 16`\n\nLet's trace this simple board:\nRook from `1` (at `(0,0)`):\nPath: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`. (No vuns yet)\nCurrent at `8` (at `(1,3)`). Visited: `{1..8}`.\nReachable: `(0,3)` (value `4`, visited), `(1,0)` (value `5`, visited), `(1,1)` (value `6`, visited), `(1,2)` (value `7`, visited).\nAll reachable cells from `(1,3)` are visited.\nUnvisited: `{9..16}`. Min is `9`. Teleport to `9`. Pay `1` vun.\nRook vuns: `1`.\n\nQueen from `1` (at `(0,0)`):\nPath: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`. (No vuns yet)\nCurrent at `8` (at `(1,3)`). Visited: `{1..8}`.\nReachable from `(1,3)`:\n  Horizontal/Vertical: `(0,3)` (value `4`, visited), `(1,0)` (value `5`, visited), `(1,1)` (value `6`, visited), `(1,2)` (value `7`, visited).\n  Diagonal: `(0,2)` (value `3`, visited), `(2,2)` (value `11`, unvisited), `(2,4)` (invalid), `(0,4)` (invalid).\n  Min unvisited reachable is `11`. Move to `11`.\n  (This is the key difference: Queen can reach `11` diagonally, Rook cannot).\nQueen vuns: `0`.\n\nThis simple construction `vuns_rook (1) > vuns_queen (0)` is not what we want. We need `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` has `vuns_rook = 1` and `vuns_queen = 2`.\nThe key must be to make the queen get stuck *more often* than the rook.\nThis means we need to construct a board where the queen's *additional* reachable cells are quickly filled with small numbers, so it gets stuck.\n\nConsider filling the board in a way that small numbers are spread out diagonally.\nThis would make the queen traverse the board quickly using its diagonal moves, potentially visiting many cells early.\nA simple way to achieve this is to fill cells `(i,j)` such that `i+j` is even with small numbers, and cells `(i,j)` such that `i+j` is odd with large numbers, or vice versa. This creates a checkerboard pattern.\n\nLet's try this strategy:\nFill cells `(r, c)` where `(r+c)` is even with numbers `1, 2, ...` up to `ceil(N*N/2)`.\nFill cells `(r, c)` where `(r+c)` is odd with numbers `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ...` up to `N*N`.\n\nLet `count_even = ceil(N*N/2)`. Let `count_odd = N*N - count_even`.\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = count_even + 1`\n\nCreate an `N x N` board.\nIterate `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  If `(r+c)` is even: `board[r][c] = small_num`; `small_num += 1`\n  Else (`(r+c)` is odd): `board[r][c] = large_num`; `large_num += 1`\n\nLet's test this for `N=4`:\n`count_even = ceil(16/2) = 8`. Small numbers: `1..8`.\n`count_odd = 16 - 8 = 8`. Large numbers: `9..16`.\n\nBoard:\n`(0,0)` even: `1`  `(0,1)` odd: `9`  `(0,2)` even: `2`  `(0,3)` odd: `10`\n`(1,0)` odd: `11` `(1,1)` even: `3`  `(1,2)` odd: `12` `(1,3)` even: `4`\n`(2,0)` even: `5`  `(2,1)` odd: `13` `(2,2)` even: `6`  `(2,3)` odd: `14`\n`(3,0)` odd: `15` `(3,1)` even: `7`  `(3,2)` odd: `16` `(3,3)` even: `8`\n\nResulting board:\n`1  9  2 10`\n`11 3 12  4`\n`5 13  6 14`\n`15  7 16  8`\n\nLet's trace this board for `N=4`:\nStart at `1` (at `(0,0)`). Visited: `{1}`.\n\nRook:\n1. Current `(0,0)` (value `1`). Reachable unvisited: `9` (at `(0,1)`), `11` (at `(1,0)`). Min is `9`. Move to `9`.\n   Visited: `{1,9}`. Current `(0,1)`.\n2.

Stop.\nQueen vuns: `0`.\n\nThis checkerboard pattern also yields `vuns_rook (1) > vuns_queen (0)`. So this pattern doesn't work either.\n\nWhat if `N` is odd?\nFor `N=3`: `N*N = 9`. `count_even = ceil(9/2) = 5`. `count_odd = 4`.\nSmall numbers: `1..5`.

Queen vuns: `0`.\n\nThis checkerboard pattern yields `vuns_rook = 0` and `vuns_queen = 0` for `N=3`.\nThis means `N=3` also has no solution.\n\nSummary of current findings:\n- `N=1`: No solution.\n- `N=2`: No solution.\n- `N=3`: No solution.\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` has `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 2`. This implies that a solution exists for `N=4`.\nWhat is special about `N=4`? It's an even number.\nThe patterns tried (`top-half small, bottom-half large` and `checkerboard`) did not work for `N=4`.\n\nLet's re-examine the example board for `N=4`:\n`4  3  6 12`\n`7  5  9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16  2`\n\nThe numbers `1` to `N*N` are split into two groups:\n`group_A` (smaller numbers) and `group_B` (larger numbers).\nIn the example, `N=4`, `N*N=16`.\nThe numbers `1, 2, ..., 8` are small. The numbers `9, ..., 16` are large.\nLet's see where the small numbers are placed:\n`X  X  X  L`\n`X  X  L  L`\n`L  S  L  L` (1 is S)\n`L  X  L  S` (2 is S)\n\nThis doesn't seem to be a simple half-split or checkerboard.\nThe small numbers `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8` are:\n`1` at `(2,1)`\n`2` at `(3,3)`\n`3` at `(0,1)`\n`4` at `(0,0)`\n`5` at `(1,1)`\n`6` at `(0,2)`\n`7` at `(1,0)`\n`8` at `(3,1)`\n\nNotice that the small numbers `1..8` are placed in a way that they are close enough for the queen to pick them up, but also spread out enough that the queen might \"run out\" of small numbers in its vicinity.\n\nLet's count how many cells are in each \"half\" of the board.\nFor `N*N` cells, we can divide them into two sets of sizes `N*N/2`.\nLet's fill `N*N/2` cells with numbers `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nAnd the other `N*N/2` cells with numbers `N*N/2 + 1, ..., N*N`.\n\nThe key insight from the example `N=4` is that the rook gets 1 vun and the queen gets 2 vuns.\nThis means the queen gets stuck more often. This implies that the queen's \"extra\" moves (diagonal) must lead to already visited cells more often than the rook's moves.\nIf we place all \"small\" numbers (`1` to `N*N/2`) in a single contiguous block, say, the top-left `N/2 x N` rectangle.\nAnd all \"large\" numbers (`N*N/2 + 1` to `N*N`) in the remaining part.\nLet's try this for `N=4`. `N*N/2 = 8`.\nSmall numbers: `1..8`. Large numbers: `9..16`.\nBoard:\n`1  2  3  4`\n`5  6  7  8`\n`9 10 11 12`\n`13 14 15 16`\nAs seen before, this makes `vuns_rook=1`, `vuns_queen=0`. This is not a solution.\n\nWhat if we swap the small and large numbers?\nSmall numbers `1..8` in the bottom-right `N/2 x N` rectangle.\nLarge numbers `9..16` in the top-left `N/2 x N` rectangle.\nBoard:\n`9 10 11 12`\n`13 14 15 16`\n`1  2  3  4`\n`5  6  7  8`\n\nRook:\nStart at `1` (at `(2,0)`).\nPath: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`. No vuns.\nAt `8` (at `(3,3)`). All reachable cells are visited.\nUnvisited: `9..16`. Min is `9`. Teleport to `9`. Pay `1` vun.\nRook vuns: `1`.\n\nQueen:\nStart at `1` (at `(2,0)`).\nPath: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`. No vuns.\nAt `8` (at `(3,3)`).\nReachable unvisited (diagonally): `11` (at `(0,2)`), `15` (at `(1,2)`), `16` (at `(1,3)`).\nMin is `11`. Move to `11`.\nQueen vuns: `0`.\nStill `vuns_rook > vuns_queen`.\n\nThe crucial observation from the example N=4 trace is that the Queen visits `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`.\nThe Queen pays 2 vuns.\nThe Rook visits `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`.\nThe Rook pays 1 vun.\n\nThe example solution for N=4 has `1` at `(2,1)`.\nThe numbers `1` to `N*N/2` are `1` to `8`.\nThe numbers `N*N/2 + 1` to `N*N` are `9` to `16`.\nLet's call the cells filled with `1..8` \"small cells\" and `9..16` \"large cells\".\nSmall cells: `(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,0) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (3,3)`\nLarge cells: `(0,3) (1,2) (1,3) (2,0) (2,2) (2,3) (3,0) (3,2)`\n\nThe small numbers are somewhat spread out.\nThe queen gets stuck when it visits `15` (at `(1,3)`).\nFrom `15`, the queen can reach `(0,2)` (value `6`, visited), `(2,2)` (value `11`, visited), `(0,3)` (value `12`, visited), `(1,2)` (value `9`, visited), `(2,3)` (value `10`, visited).\nAll reachable cells from `15` are visited.\nUnvisited: `14, 16`. Min is `14`. Teleport to `14`. Pay `1` vun.\nThen from `14` (at `(2,0)`), reachable unvisited: `16` (at `(3,2)`). Min is `16`. Teleport to `16`. Pay `1` vun.\nOh, wait. In the example trace, `14` is at `(2,0)`. From `14`, queen can reach `(3,0)` (value `13`, visited). `(1,0)` (value `7`, visited). `(0,0)` (value `4`, visited). `(2,1)` (value `1`, visited).\nIt seems all cells reachable from `(2,0)` are visited.\nUnvisited: `16`. Min is `16`. Teleport to `16`. Pay `1` vun.\nSo the queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nThe rook gets stuck when it visits `15` (at `(1,3)`).\nFrom `15`, rook can reach `(0,3)` (value `12`, visited), `(1,2)` (value `9`, visited), `(2,3)` (value `10`, visited).\nAll reachable cells from `15` are visited.\nUnvisited: `14, 16`. Min is `14`. Teleport to `14`. Pay `1` vun.\nFrom `14` (at `(2,0)`), reachable unvisited: `16` (at `(3,2)`). Min is `16`. Move to `16`.\nSo the rook pays 1 vun.\n\nThe crucial part is that when the queen is at `15`, it can reach `11` at `(2,2)` diagonally. But `11` is already visited.\nWhen the rook is at `15`, it cannot reach `11` at `(2,2)`.\nThis means the queen visited `11` earlier than the rook. This is what caused the queen to get stuck.\n\nThe strategy should be:\n1. Place `1` somewhere that allows both pieces to move.\n2. Fill cells with `1, ..., N*N/2` (small numbers) such that:\n   - The queen visits many of them quickly using its diagonal moves.\n   - The rook is forced to visit them without using diagonals.\n3. Fill cells with `N*N/2 + 1, ..., N*N` (large numbers) such that:\n   - When a piece needs to teleport, it picks a large number.\n   - The queen's diagonal moves lead to cells that become visited *earlier* than the rook's path, causing the queen to get stuck.\n\nA simple construction that works for `N=4` and likely for all `N >= 4` (even `N`):\nDivide the `N x N` board into four `N/2 x N/2` quadrants.\nLet `M = N/2`.\nQuadrant 1 (top-left): `(0..M-1, 0..M-1)`\nQuadrant 2 (top-right): `(0..M-1, M..N-1)`\nQuadrant 3 (bottom-left): `(M..N-1, 0..M-1)`\nQuadrant 4 (bottom-right): `(M..N-1, M..N-1)`\n\nFill Quadrant 1 and Quadrant 4 with `1, ..., N*N/2` (small numbers).\nFill Quadrant 2 and Quadrant 3 with `N*N/2 + 1, ..., N*N` (large numbers).\n\nFor `N=4`, `M=2`.\nSmall numbers: `1..8`.

For `N >= 4` and `N` is even, use the quadrant filling strategy.\nWhat about `N >= 5` and `N` is odd?\nMy quadrant strategy does not work for `N=3`.\nThe problem is that for odd `N`, `M=N/2` is not an integer.\n`M = N // 2`.\nThe quadrants are defined as:\nQ1: `(0..M-1, 0..M-1)`\nQ2: `(0..M-1, M..N-1)`\nQ3: `(M..N-1, 0..M-1)`\nQ4: `(M..N-1, M..N-1)`\nThe central row/column `M` is covered by Q2, Q3, Q4.\nThis means the split of small/large numbers is not exactly half-half for odd N.\nSpecifically, for `N=3`, `M=1`.\nQ1: `(0,0)`\nQ2: `(0,1), (0,2)`\nQ3: `(1,0), (2,0), (1,1), (2,1)`\nQ4: `(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)`\nThis definition of quadrants is problematic for odd `N` because `(1,1)` is in both Q3 and Q4.\n\nA simpler way to define the two halves for any `N`:\nHalf 1: `(r, c)` where `r + c < N - 1` (cells above anti-diagonal)\nHalf 2: `(r, c)` where `r + c >= N - 1` (cells on or below anti-diagonal)\nOr simply fill the first `N*N/2` cells in row-major order with small numbers and the rest with large numbers.

It just says `N` up to `500`.\nIf `N` is odd, my current quadrant strategy yields `0` vuns for both.\n\nThe solution for `N=4` (my quadrant solution) relies on the queen reaching Q4 from Q1 via diagonals, visiting small numbers, getting stuck, and then teleporting to Q2/Q3 for large numbers. The rook, being restricted, cannot do this.\nFor odd `N`, the center cell `(M,M)` is `(N//2, N//2)`.\nIf `N` is odd, `M = N//2`.\nQ1: `(0..M-1, 0..M-1)`\nQ2: `(0..M-1, M..N-1)`\nQ3: `(M..N-1, 0..M-1)`\nQ4: `(M..N-1, M..N-1)`\nThis definition of quadrants is standard. The middle row `M` and middle column `M` are split.\nFor example, `(M,M)` is in Q4. `(M-1,M)` is in Q2. `(M,M-1)` is in Q3.\nSo the definition of quadrants works for odd `N` as well.\nLet's re-test `N=3` using this precise quadrant definition. `M=1`.\nQ1: `(0,0)`\nQ2: `(0,1), (0,2)`\nQ3: `(1,0), (2,0)`\nQ4: `(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)`\n\nSmall numbers `1..5`.

Rook vuns: `0`.\n\nQueen:\n`1(0,0) -> 2(1,1) -> 3(1,2) -> 4(2,1) -> 5(2,2) -> 6(0,1) -> 7(0,2) -> 8(1,0) -> 9(2,0)`.\nNo vuns. Queen vuns: `0`.\n\nThis still gives `0` vuns for both for `N=3`.\nSo the quadrant strategy does not work for odd `N`.\nThe problem might be that for odd `N`, the center cell `(M,M)` is a \"small\" number. This central point might act as a hub for the queen, allowing it to easily navigate to other small numbers. For even `N`, there is no single \"center\" cell, which might contribute to the queen getting stuck.\n\nGiven the example `N=4` is the smallest `N` for which a solution exists, and `N=1,2,3` do not have solutions, it is highly probable that `N` must be even and `N >= 4`.\nIf `N` is odd, it might be impossible. This is a common pattern in competitive programming problems where parity matters.\n\nFinal hypothesis:\n- If `N` is odd, or `N < 4`, print `-1`.\n- If `N` is even and `N >= 4`, use the quadrant filling strategy:\n  - `M = N // 2`\n  - Fill cells `(r, c)` where `(r < M and c < M)` or `(r >= M and c >= M)` with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\n  - Fill cells `(r, c)` where `(r < M and c >= M)` or `(r >= M and c < M)` with `N*N/2 + 1, ..., N*N`.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis.\nThe example output for `N=4` is a valid solution. My quadrant solution for `N=4` is also valid. This suggests multiple solutions can exist.\nThe condition `N < 4` implies `N=1,2,3`.\nIf `N` is odd, `N=1,3,5,...`. If `N` is odd and `N<4`, then `N=1,3`.\nMy strategy for `N=1,2,3` yields `0` vuns for both, so `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` is false.\nThus, for `N=1,2,3`, we should print `-1`.\nThis covers `N=1,2,3`.\nFor `N >= 4`:\nIf `N` is even, use the quadrant strategy.\nIf `N` is odd and `N >= 5` (e.g. `N=5`), my quadrant strategy gives `0` vuns for both. So it does not work.\nIt's possible that for all odd `N`, no solution exists. Or a different construction is needed.\nHowever, usually, if a simple construction works for `N=4` and higher even `N`, and fails for small odd `N`, it is a strong hint that odd `N` values might not have solutions.\nThe problem statement itself has `N=4` as an example, not `N=5`.\n\nLet's consider why the quadrant strategy works for even `N` and not odd `N`.\nFor even `N`, `M = N/2`.\nQ1: `(0..M-1, 0..M-1)` (small numbers)\nQ2: `(0..M-1, M..N-1)` (large numbers)\nQ3: `(M..N-1, 0..M-1)` (large numbers)\nQ4: `(M..N-1, M..N-1)` (small numbers)\nThe numbers `1` to `N*N/2` are placed in Q1 and Q4.\nThe numbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` are placed in Q2 and Q3.\nThis creates a \"cross\" of large numbers separating the small numbers.\nWhen the queen starts at `1` (in Q1), it can quickly visit many small numbers in Q1 using both orthogonal and diagonal moves.\nThen it might jump to Q4 (also small numbers) using diagonal moves (e.g., from `(M-1, M-1)` to `(M,M)`).\nThis allows the queen to exhaust many small numbers quickly.\nWhen the queen is in Q1 or Q4, its diagonal moves might lead to other small numbers.\nIts orthogonal moves might lead to large numbers (in Q2 or Q3).\nThe rook's orthogonal moves might also lead to large numbers.\nThe crucial part is that the queen can use diagonals to cross the \"large number\" barrier between Q1 and Q4.\nSuppose the queen is at `(M-1, M-1)` (last small number in Q1). It has visited all small numbers in Q1.\nIt can move diagonally to `(M,M)` (first small number in Q4).\nThe rook from `(M-1, M-1)` cannot move directly to `(M,M)`. It would have to go `(M-1, M)` (large) then `(M, M)` (small).\nThis means the queen visits small numbers faster, using its diagonal advantage.\nBy the time the queen has visited all small numbers in Q1 and Q4, it has exhausted its options among small numbers.\nIt then has to pick from the large numbers in Q2 and Q3.\nThe rook, on the other hand, might get stuck more often within Q1 or Q4, as its options are more limited.\nFor example, from `(M-1, M-1)`, the rook could only go to `(M-1, M)` (large) or `(M, M-1)` (large).\nIf it picks a large number, it continues. If all reachable cells are visited, it teleports.\nThe key is that the queen, by visiting small numbers in Q1 and Q4 more efficiently, ends up with fewer small numbers available as \"next moves\" when it's in a large-number quadrant.\n\nFor odd `N`, the central row and column `M = N//2` are split between the \"large\" and \"small\" quadrants.\nQ1: `(0..M-1, 0..M-1)` (small)\nQ2: `(0..M-1, M..N-1)` (large)\nQ3: `(M..N-1, 0..M-1)` (large)\nQ4: `(M..N-1, M..N-1)` (small)\nThe middle row is `M`. The middle column is `M`.\nCells `(r,c)` where `r=M` and `c<M` are in Q3 (large).\nCells `(r,c)` where `r=M` and `c>=M` are in Q4 (small).\nCells `(r,c)` where `c=M` and `r<M` are in Q2 (large).\nCells `(r,c)` where `c=M` and `r>=M` are in Q4 (small).\nThis means the border between large and small is more \"porous\" for odd `N`.\nThe central cell `(M,M)` itself is a small number (in Q4).\nThis structure might make it easier for the rook to access small numbers in Q4 from Q1, or vice versa, without teleporting.\nFor example, from `(M-1, M-1)` (last in Q1), the rook can go to `(M-1, M)` (large, in Q2) or `(M, M-1)` (large, in Q3).\nThe queen can go `(M,M)` (small, in Q4).\nIf `(M,M)` is the minimum available, the queen takes it. The rook cannot.\nThis causes the queen to visit small numbers even faster.\nBut if the queen visits all small numbers early, it has to pick large numbers. If all reachable large numbers are visited, it gets stuck.\nThe problem for odd `N` might be that `N*N` is odd. `N*N/2` is not an integer.\n`N*N//2` small numbers, `N*N - N*N//2` large numbers.\nFor `N=3`, `N*N=9`. `N*N//2 = 4` small numbers. `9-4 = 5` large numbers.\nSo `1,2,3,4` are small. `5,6,7,8,9` are large.\nMy construction for `N=3`:\n`1  6  7`\n`8  2  3`\n`9  4  5`\nSmall numbers: `1,2,3,4`. Large numbers: `5,6,7,8,9`.\n`small_val` goes up to `N*N//2`.\n`large_val` starts at `N*N//2 + 1`.\n`small_val` is `1,2,3,4`. `large_val` is `5,6,7,8,9`.\nBoard:\n`1  5  6`\n`7  2  8`\n`9  3  4`\nRook: `1(0,0) -> 5(0,1) -> 6(0,2) -> 8(1,2) -> 2(1,1) -> 7(1,0) -> 9(2,0) -> 3(2,1) -> 4(2,2)`. Rook vuns: `0`.\nQueen: `1(0,0) -> 2(1,1) -> 3(2,1) -> 4(2,2) -> 5(0,1) -> 6(0,2) -> 7(1,0) -> 8(1,2) -> 9(2,0)`. Queen vuns: `0`.\nStill `0` vuns for both.\n\nIt is a common scenario in competitive programming that if a problem has a solution for `N=4` but not `N=1,2,3`, and the problem involves grid properties, then it often means solutions exist for `N \\ge 4` and `N` is even, and no solutions for odd `N`.\nI will stick with this hypothesis.\n\nFinal plan:\n1.
