Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Approach for \"Crazy Town\"**\n\nAlright, I'm facing the \"Crazy Town\" problem, a classic from the competitive programming sphere. Let's break this down. The core is finding the minimum \"steps\" to travel between a home and university block. Each step represents crossing a road. The input provides starting and ending coordinates, and the details of the roads. Essentially, I need to count how many roads \"separate\" these two points.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the roads as lines of the form `ax + by + c = 0`. The key insight is that each road splits the plane into two regions (and the road itself), and whether the home and university are on the same or opposite sides of the road determines if that road is a \"separator\".\n\nIf I evaluate `ax + by + c` at the home's coordinates, let's call it `val1`, and at the university's coordinates, `val2`, the sign of these values will reveal this separation. If `val1` and `val2` have the same sign (both positive or both negative), the road does *not* separate them. If the signs are different, the road *does* separate them.\n\nMy algorithm will read in the starting and ending points, then iterate through each road, performing this calculation. If the signs are different, I'll increment my \"steps\" counter. In the end, the total \"steps\" will be the solution, the minimum number of road crossings needed. This seems like a straightforward, efficient approach.\n",
