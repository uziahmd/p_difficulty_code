And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process on tackling this problem, explained in detail:**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to write a Python script that calculates the average sleep time over a series of \"weeks.\" Each \"week\" consists of *k* consecutive days from a set of *n* recorded sleep times. I immediately recognize this as a sliding window problem.\n\nThe core idea is to compute the average for all possible overlapping weeks, which means there are `n - k + 1` weeks to consider. To get that, I'll need to sum the sleep times for each week and then average them. The straightforward approach is to loop through each week, calculating the sum of the *k* days in that week, and then adding all those sums together.\n\nA naive implementation would result in an O(n*k) complexity, which isn't efficient if *n* and *k* are large, like 2 * 10^5. It's too slow. So, I need a smarter strategy.\n\nThis leads me to think about a sliding window approach, where instead of recalculating the sum of each week from scratch, I can reuse the previous week's sum. This would mean updating the current sum in O(1) time. The technique is:  if I know the sum of the first window, I can get the next week's sum by subtracting the element that's leaving the window and adding the element that's entering. This makes calculating the total sum much faster.\n\nNow I have an efficient algorithm. I will read in n and k, along with the array of sleep times. I calculate the sum of the first k elements. Then, I iterate through the remaining elements. In the loop, I subtract the element going out of the window and add the new element coming into the window, thus getting the sum for the next week and totaling it all.\n\nAfter the loop, the average is calculated by dividing the total sum by the number of weeks which is n-k+1. Python handles floating-point arithmetic.\n\nTo be extra certain, I will look at the worst-case time and space complexities. The sliding window approach has a time complexity of O(n) which is efficient for constraints that are given. The space complexity is O(n), as I store the input array. That's reasonable given constraints.\n\nI need to print the output in an appropriate format. Since the problem wants the output with at least 6 digits after the decimal point, I will format the average value using f-strings with a format specifier.\n\nFinally, I write the code and test it with a few examples, including edge cases like k=1 or k=n, to confirm it works correctly. I feel confident that this solution is solid.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\". A week is defined as `k` consecutive days. We are given `n` days of sleep records, `a1, a2, ..., an`.\n\nThere are `n - k + 1` possible weeks:\n1. Days `a1, a2, ..., ak`\n2. Days `a2, a3, ..., ak+1`\n...\n`n - k + 1`. Days `an-k+1, an-k+2, ..., an`\n\nLet `S_i` be the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week (starting from day `i` and ending at day `i+k-1`, using 1-based indexing for days).\nThe problem requires us to compute the sum of all these `S_i` values, and then divide this total sum by the number of weeks, `n - k + 1`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all `n - k + 1` possible weeks. For each week, we would sum its `k` days. This would take `O(k)` time for each week, leading to a total time complexity of `O((n - k + 1) * k)`. Given `n` can be up to `2 * 10^5`, this `O(n*k)` approach could be `O(n^2)` in the worst case (e.g., `k = n/2`), which is too slow (`(2 * 10^5)^2 = 4 * 10^{10}` operations).\n\nA more efficient approach involves using a **sliding window technique**.\nWe can calculate the sum of the first `k` days (`S_1`) directly.\nThen, to get the sum for the next week (`S_2`), we can update `S_1` by subtracting the first day's sleep time (`a1`) and adding the new day's sleep time (`ak+1`).\nIn general, `S_{i+1} = S_i - a_i + a_{i+k}`. This update takes `O(1)` time.\n\nHere's the algorithm using 0-based indexing for the array `a`:\n1. Read `n` and `k`.\n2. Read the `n` sleep times into a list `a`.\n3. Calculate the sum of the first window (days `a[0]` to `a[k-1]`):\n   `current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])`\n4. Initialize `total_sum_of_all_weeks` with this `current_week_sum`.\n5. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n - k` (inclusive). This `i` represents the starting index of the current window.\n   a. Update `current_week_sum` for the new window: subtract `a[i-1]` (the element leaving the window) and add `a[i+k-1]` (the element entering the window).\n      `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n   b. Add this `current_week_sum` to `total_sum_of_all_weeks`.\n6. The number of weeks considered is `num_weeks = n - k + 1`.\n7. Calculate the final average: `average_sleep_time = total_sum_of_all_weeks / num_weeks`.\n8. Print the `average_sleep_time` formatted to the required precision.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n- Reading input: `O(n)`\n- Calculating the initial `current_week_sum`: `O(k)`\n- The loop runs `n - k` times. Each iteration performs constant time operations (subtraction, addition). So, `O(n - k)`.\n- Total time complexity: `O(n) + O(k) + O(n - k) = O(n)`. This is efficient enough for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n- Storing the array `a`: `O(n)`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]):**\n1. `n=3, k=2`. `a=[3, 4, 7]`.\n2. `current_week_sum = sum(a[0:2]) = a[0] + a[1] = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n3. `total_sum_of_all_weeks = 7`.\n4. Loop `i` from `1` to `n - k = 3 - 2 = 1`. So, `i=1`.\n   a. `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n      `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1]`\n      `current_week_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2]`\n      `current_week_sum = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`.\n   b. `total_sum_of_all_weeks = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n5. Loop finishes.\n6. `num_weeks = n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n7. `average_sleep_time = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n8. Print `9.0000000000`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles all constraints and edge cases (like `k=1` or `k=n`). The maximum possible sum `total_sum_of_all_weeks` can be up to `(2 * 10^5) * (2 * 10^5 * 10^5) = 2 * 10^{15}`, which fits within Python's arbitrary-precision integers. The final division will produce a float, which Python handles automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and k from the first line of input\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the list of sleep times a from the second line of input\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first window (k days)\n    # This corresponds to the sum of a[0] through a[k-1]\n    current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\n    # Initialize total_sum_of_all_weeks with the sum of the first week.\n    # We will add subsequent week sums to this variable.\n    total_sum_of_all_weeks = current_week_sum\n\n    # Use a sliding window to calculate sums for the remaining weeks.\n    # The loop iterates for each possible starting position of a week,\n    # from index 1 up to n-k.\n    # The range(1, n - k + 1) covers these starting indices.\n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        # To get the sum of the current window (starting at index i)\n        # from the sum of the previous window (starting at index i-1):\n        # 1.
