    "thought": "**The \"Gluttony\" Problem: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem called \"Gluttony\". The goal is to create a Python script that takes an array of distinct integers and outputs a permutation of that array, where the sums of all non-empty, non-full subsets of the original and permuted arrays are distinct.  \n\nLet's break down my thinking. First, I analyzed the problem statement. The core constraint is: for any subset of the original array, its sum must be different from the sum of the corresponding subset in the permuted array. The array size can go up to 22, and the elements are integers up to 10^9.  \n\nI started with small cases to get a feel for the problem. For n=1, any permutation works (trivial). For n=2, I realized I could simply reverse the array. For n=3, I'm thinking about how the condition `a_i != b_i` for all i is an important concept.  I'm trying to figure out what kind of permutation of the original values would satisfy the sum-difference condition.\n\nI had a hunch about sorting the input array and cyclically shifting it. My initial thought was `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}` after sorting the values. This seemed to work for n=3. But, it is not always guaranteed to work for all 'n' values.\n\nI considered the example given:  `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]` and the expected output `b = [100, 1, 1000, 10]`.  This helped me realize that a simple cyclic shift of the sorted array, although tempting, is not the correct approach.\n\nI'm now thinking of the problem more systematically. I'm storing the original array and sorting it based on values. I'm trying to establish a method where for a given original array's value, I place a different value in the corresponding index for permutation array. Now, my idea is to cycle the values in the sorted order while making sure they are allocated to the correct indices in the b array. I am trying to establish a mapping between the indexes, to get a proper array that adheres to the distinct sum subsets condition. I still need to verify whether the method works or not. I'll test it thoroughly with various sample cases. I need to make sure this strategy works for all valid inputs and that I understand *why* it works. This is key to a robust solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements at these indices in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these indices in `b`. That is, `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i` for `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and properties:\n1. `n` is small (`1 <= n <= 22`). This suggests that solutions with complexity up to `O(n * 2^n)` or `O(n * n!)` for small `n` might be acceptable, but `n=22` makes `n!` too large. `2^n` is roughly 4 million for `n=22`, so `O(n * 2^n)` might be okay.\n2. `a_i` are distinct. This is crucial.\n\n**Case n=1:**\nIf `n=1`, there are no subsets `S` such that `0 < |S| < n`. The condition is vacuously true. `b` must be a permutation of `a`, so `b = [a_0]`.\n\n**Case n > 1:**\nA necessary condition for `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i` to hold for `S = {i}` (i.e., subsets of size 1) is `a_i != b_i` for all `i`. If `a_i = b_i` for any `i`, then `sum_{j in {i}} a_j = a_i` and `sum_{j in {i}} b_j = b_i`, which would violate the condition.\nThus, `b` must be a derangement of `a` in terms of indices, meaning `b_i` cannot be `a_i`.\n\nA common strategy for problems involving sums and permutations is to sort the array `a` and then apply a cyclic shift. Let `a_sorted` be the array `a` sorted in non-decreasing order.\nLet `a_sorted = [s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n-1}]`.\nConsider constructing a permutation `b'` by a cyclic shift of `a_sorted`:\n`b'_i = s_{(i+1)%n}`.\nThis `b'` array satisfies `b'_i != s_i` for all `i` (since `s_i` are distinct).\n\nNow, we need to map these shifted values back to the original positions.\nLet's store the original indices along with the values.\n`indexed_a = [(a_0, 0), (a_1, 1), ..., (a_{n-1}, n-1)]`.\nSort `indexed_a` based on values: `sorted_indexed_a = [(s_0, original_idx_0), (s_1, original_idx_1), ..., (s_{n-1}, original_idx_{n-1})]`.\nHere, `s_k` is the `k`-th smallest value in `a`, and `original_idx_k` is its original index in `a`.\n\nWe can construct `b` as follows:\nFor each `k` from `0` to `n-1`:\nThe value `s_k` was originally at index `original_idx_k`.\nWe want to replace `s_k` with `s_{(k+1)%n}`.\nSo, we set `b[original_idx_k] = s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n\nLet's verify this strategy:\n1. **`b` is a permutation of `a`**: The values `s_0, ..., s_{n-1}` are permuted to `s_1, ..., s_{n-1}, s_0`. Each value from `a` appears exactly once in `b`.\n2. **`a_i != b_i` for all `i` (for `n > 1`)**:\n   For any `j`, let `a_j` be the value at original index `j`. Let `k` be such that `s_k = a_j`. Then `j = original_idx_k`.\n   Our construction sets `b_j = s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n   Since `s_k` are distinct, `s_k != s_{(k+1)%n}` for all `k` (as long as `n > 1`).\n   Thus, `a_j != b_j` for all `j`. This covers all subsets `S` of size 1.\n\n3. **General condition `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i`**:\n   Let `S` be any non-empty proper subset of indices.\n   `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{k \\text{ s.t. } original_idx_k \\in S} s_k`.\n   `sum_{i in S} b_i = sum_{k \\text{ s.t. } original_idx_k \\in S} s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n   Let `S_k = \\{k \\mid original_idx_k \\in S\\}`. This `S_k` is a subset of indices for the sorted array.\n   The condition becomes `sum_{k \\in S_k} s_k != sum_{k \\in S_k} s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n   This is a known result: if `s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_{n-1}` are distinct numbers, then for any non-empty proper subset `S_k` of `{0, ..., n-1}`, `sum_{k \\in S_k} s_k != sum_{k \\in S_k} s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n   Proof sketch: Assume `sum_{k \\in S_k} s_k = sum_{k \\in S_k} s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n   Let `P = {k \\in S_k | (k+1)%n \\notin S_k}` and `M = {k \\notin S_k | (k+1)%n \\in S_k}`.\n   The sum equality implies `sum_{k \\in P} s_k = sum_{k \\in M} s_{(k+1)%n}`.\n   Since `s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_{n-1}`, `s_k < s_{(k+1)%n}` for `k < n-1`, and `s_{n-1} > s_0`.\n   This property implies that such an equality can only hold if `P` and `M` are empty, which means `S_k` must be either empty or the full set `{0, ..., n-1}`.\n   (A more rigorous proof involves considering the polynomial `X(t) = sum_{k in S_k} t^k` and `Y(t) = sum_{k in S_k} t^{(k+1)%n}`. The values `s_k` are distinct, so it's unlikely for `sum s_k` to be `sum s_{(k+1)%n}` unless `S_k` is empty or full.)\n\nThis strategy provides a valid `b` for `n > 1`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=[1000, 100, 10, 1]):**\n1. `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n2. `indexed_a = [(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n3. Sort `indexed_a`: `sorted_indexed_a = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   So `s_0=1, original_idx_0=3`\n   `s_1=10, original_idx_1=2`\n   `s_2=100, original_idx_2=1`\n   `s_3=1000, original_idx_3=0`\n4. Initialize `b = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (or any placeholder).\n5. Construct `b`:\n   For `k=0`: `b[original_idx_0] = s_{(0+1)%4}` => `b[3] = s_1 = 10`.\n   For `k=1`: `b[original_idx_1] = s_{(1+1)%4}` => `b[2] = s_2 = 100`.\n   For `k=2`: `b[original_idx_2] = s_{(2+1)%4}` => `b[1] = s_3 = 1000`.\n   For `k=3`: `b[original_idx_3] = s_{(3+1)%4}` => `b[0] = s_0 = 1`.\n6. Result: `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\n\nThis differs from the example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`, but it is a valid solution as per the problem statement (any valid `b` is accepted).\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read array `a`.\n3. If `n=1`, print `a[0]`.\n4. If `n > 1`:\n   a. Create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)` for each element in `a`.\n   b. Sort this list based on `value`.\n   c. Create a result array `b` of size `n`.\n   d. Iterate `k` from `0` to `n-1`:\n      Let `(s_k, original_idx_k)` be the `k`-th element of the sorted list.\n      Set `b[original_idx_k] = sorted_list[(k+1)%n][0]` (i.e., the value `s_{(k+1)%n}`).\n   e. Print elements of `b`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of `O(N log N)` due to sorting, which is efficient enough for `N=22`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Store (value, original_index) pairs\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort based on values\n    # sorted_indexed_a will be [(s_0, original_idx_0), (s_1, original_idx_1), ...]\n    # where s_0 < s_1 < ... are sorted values and original_idx_k is the original\n    # index of s_k in array a.\n    sorted_indexed_a = sorted(indexed_a)\n\n    # Initialize result array b\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # Construct b using the cyclic shift strategy\n    # For each k-th smallest value s_k (at original_idx_k),\n    # place the (k+1)%n-th smallest value s_{(k+1)%n} into b at original_idx_k.\n    for k in range(n):\n        current_value = sorted_indexed_a[k][0]\n        original_index = sorted_indexed_a[k][1]\n        \n        # The value to place at original_index is the next value in sorted order (cyclically)\n        next_value_in_sorted = sorted_indexed_a[(k + 1) % n][0]\n        \n        b[original_index] = next_value_in_sorted\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(*(b))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
