She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Analysis and Implementation for Tab Closure Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with crafting a Python script to address this competitive programming challenge involving tab management. The core of the issue boils down to figuring out the minimum time required to close tabs outside a specified range, `[l, r]`.\n\nThe allowed actions are pretty straightforward: moving the cursor one position left or right, each taking a second, and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor, also taking a second each.  `a` and `b` represent the minimum and maximum *open* tab indices initially from 1 to *n*.\n\nMy first thought was to consider all the possibilities and map out the operations. The goal is to get down to only the tabs within `[l, r]`. If `l=1` and `r=n`, we are done in zero seconds. I needed to identify the optimal path and that means taking the least amount of time.\n\nIf `l = 1`, then I had to go to `r` and close everything to the right in one second, which sums to `|pos - r| + 1`. Similarly if `r=n`, you go to `l` and close left, totaling `|pos - l| + 1`. This was easy.\n\nThe tricky bit came with the general case where `1 < l` and `r < n`. I had to realize I could do things in either order: close tabs to the left first and then to the right or vice versa. The time is equal to the distance from `pos` to either `l` or `r` plus the one second to close tabs. Then, the distance from `l` and `r`, whichever is closer `min(abs(pos-l), abs(pos-r)) + (r-l) +2`. The movement between `l` and `r` can be calculated and added.\n\nThe script needed to read the inputs (`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`). I handled the base cases, and then the general case was the min of the two, the simplification shown above.\n\nThe number of tabs, *n* is within 100, which means I can get away with a simple calculation, no need for any complex algorithm. The movement costs are not affected by the dynamically changing `a` and `b` as those are within the current range.\n\nI just needed to carefully craft the conditional logic.\n",
