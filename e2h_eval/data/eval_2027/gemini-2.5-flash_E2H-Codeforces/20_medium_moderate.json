For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a challenging combinatorial problem: counting ways to select values (`c_s`) for binary strings (`s`) to achieve a specific maximum multiset size (`f`). The constraint is that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. Each `c_s` represents an upper bound on the number of strings with prefix `s` we can have in our multiset. My initial thought process involves breaking down the problem and understanding what a \"beautiful multiset\" means and how its size is determined. This leads to thinking about a binary tree where each node represents a binary string prefix.\n\nI've realized this can be modeled as a prefix sum problem on a binary trie structure. My main idea is to use dynamic programming. We need to assign non-negative integer `N(s)` (representing the number of strings with prefix `s` in the multiset) that must satisfy the conditions: `N(s) <= c_s` and `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)`, and then maximize the total size of multiset that is `N(\"\")=N(0)+N(1)`. The core idea is that the maximum size can be calculated in a bottom-up (or top-down) manner: compute the maximum `N(s)` for all strings from length n down to 1 (with dp).\n\n**Developing the DP Recurrence**\n\nLet me define `dp[L][val]` as the number of ways to choose `c_{s'}` for all strings `s'` that are descendants of a fixed string `s` of length `L` (including `s` itself), such that the maximum possible count for `s` is `val`.\n\nBase Case: For strings `s` of length `n`, `dp[n][val]` is 1 if `0 <= val <= k` (since `c_s` can be assigned to all such strings and `N(s)=c_s=val`), and 0 otherwise.\n\nRecursive Step: For a string `s` of length `L < n`, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`. Let `v_0 = dp[s0]` and `v_1 = dp[s1]`. We want to find the number of ways to choose `c_s` and `c_{s'}` for descendants `s'` such that `dp[s] = val`.\n\nAfter some careful thought and analysis, I have the following recurrence, let `Q_L` is the number of all possible choices of value, and its suffix sum `SuffixSum_Q_L`:\n`dp[L][val] = Q_L(val) * (k-val+1) + SuffixSum_Q_L(val+1)`\n\nSo the total dynamic programming, will need to be `n-1` levels.\n\nThis gives me a dynamic programming solution. I need to compute the base case, and the Q from `L=n` to `1`, then the final Q and return `Q_1(f)`.\n\n**Optimization and Complexity Analysis**\nI've determined that convolution can be used, and this would be useful for the overall performance.\nThis solution seems to have a time complexity of `O(n K log K)`, where `n` is the string length and `K = k + 1`. This looks feasible for the given constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined. Let `N(s)` be the number of strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix. The conditions for a beautiful multiset are:\n1. `N(s) <= c_s` for all `1 <= length(s) <= n`.\n2. `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)` for all `1 <= length(s) < n`.\n3. `N(s) >= 0` for all `1 <= length(s) <= n`.\n\nWe want to maximize the total size of the multiset, which is `N(0) + N(1)`.\nThis can be computed using dynamic programming on the structure of the binary trie. Let `dp[s]` be the maximum possible value for `N(s)`.\n- For a string `s` of length `n` (a leaf in the trie): `dp[s] = c_s`. This is because `s` itself is a string in the multiset, and `N(s)` is simply its count.\n- For a string `s` of length `L < n` (an internal node): `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)`. To maximize `N(s)`, we should maximize `N(s0)` and `N(s1)`. So, `N(s)` can be at most `dp[s0] + dp[s1]`. Additionally, `N(s)` is constrained by `c_s`. Thus, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\n\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `dp[0] + dp[1]`.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to choose `c_s` values such that `dp[0] + dp[1] = f`.\nNotice the symmetry: all strings of the same length behave identically. This suggests that we can use a single DP state `dp[L][val]` representing the number of ways to choose `c_{s'}` values for all strings `s'` that are descendants of a fixed string `s` of length `L` (including `s` itself), such that `dp[s]` (the maximum count for `s`) is `val`.\n\nLet `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to assign `c_s'` values for all strings `s'` of length `L` to `n` that are descendants of a fixed (arbitrary) string `s` of length `L-1` such that `dp[s]` (the max count for `s`) is `val`. This is not exactly right.\nLet's redefine `dp[L][val]` as the number of ways to choose `c_{s'}` for all strings `s'` that are descendants of *any* string `s_L` of length `L` (including `s_L` itself), such that `dp[s_L] = val`.\n\n**Base Case (Length `n`):**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `dp[s] = c_s`. To achieve `dp[s] = val`, we must choose `c_s = val`.\nSince `c_s` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, there is `1` way to choose `c_s` if `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` ways otherwise.\nSo, `dp[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step (Length `L` from `n-1` down to `1`):**\nFor a string `s` of length `L`, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\nWe want to compute `dp[L][val]`. This involves summing over all possible values `v_0 = dp[s0]` and `v_1 = dp[s1]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `dp[s0] = v_0` is `dp[L+1][v_0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `dp[s1] = v_1` is `dp[L+1][v_1]`.\nSince these choices are independent, the number of ways to get `dp[s0]=v_0` and `dp[s1]=v_1` is `dp[L+1][v_0] * dp[L+1][v_1]`.\n\nNow we need to consider the choice for `c_s` to make `min(c_s, v_0 + v_1) = val`.\nLet `S = v_0 + v_1`. We need `min(c_s, S) = val`.\nThis implies `c_s >= val`.\nThere are two cases for `c_s`:\n1. If `c_s = val`: This choice is valid only if `val <= S`. There is `1` way to choose `c_s`.\n2. If `c_s > val`: This choice is valid only if `val = S`. In this case, `c_s` can be any integer from `val+1` to `k`. The number of ways is `k - (val+1) + 1 = k - val`.\n\nCombining these:\n- If `val < S`: `c_s` must be `val`. (1 way)\n- If `val = S`: `c_s` can be `val` (1 way) or `val+1, ..., k` (`k-val` ways). Total `1 + (k-val) = k-val+1` ways.\n- If `val > S`: 0 ways.\n\nAll `c_s` must be in `[0, k]`. So `val` must be in `[0, k]`.\n\nLet `Q_{L+1}(S) = \\sum_{v_0=0}^{K_{max}} \\sum_{v_1=0}^{K_{max}} (dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]) \\text{ where } v_0+v_1=S`.\nHere, `K_{max}` is `k`. The maximum sum `S` can be `2k`.\n`Q_{L+1}(S)` is the coefficient of `x^S` in the polynomial `(P_{L+1}(x))^2`, where `P_{L+1}(x) = \\sum_{v=0}^k dp[L+1][v] x^v`.\nThen `dp[L][val]` can be expressed using `Q_{L+1}`:\n`dp[L][val] = \\sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} Q_{L+1}(S) \\cdot 1 + Q_{L+1}(val) \\cdot (k-val+1)`.\nThis can be simplified using suffix sums. Let `SuffixSum_Q_{L+1}(X) = \\sum_{S=X}^{2k} Q_{L+1}(S)`.\nThen `\\sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} Q_{L+1}(S) = SuffixSum_Q_{L+1}(val+1)`.\nSo, `dp[L][val] = (Q_{L+1}(val) \\cdot (k-val+1) + SuffixSum_Q_{L+1}(val+1)) \\pmod{MOD}`.\nWe compute `dp[L]` for `L` from `n-1` down to `1`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe problem asks for `dp[0] + dp[1] = f`. This is equivalent to `Q_1(f) = \\sum_{v_0=0}^k \\sum_{v_1=0}^k (dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]) \\text{ where } v_0+v_1=f`.\nSo, after computing `dp[1]` array, we need to compute `Q_1(f)`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Initialize `dp_current` array of size `k+1`. `dp_current[val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise. (This represents `dp[n]`).\n2. Iterate `n-1` times (for `L` from `n-1` down to `1`):\n   a. Compute `Q_next` array. This is the convolution of `dp_current` with itself. `Q_next[S] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=S} dp_current[v_0] \\cdot dp_current[v_1]`. The array `Q_next` will have size up to `2k+1`. This can be done efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in `O(K \\log K)` time.\n   b. Compute `SuffixSum_Q_next` array. `SuffixSum_Q_next[X] = \\sum_{S=X}^{2k} Q_next[S]`. This takes `O(K)` time by iterating backwards: `SuffixSum_Q_next[2k+1] = 0`, `SuffixSum_Q_next[X] = (Q_next[X] + SuffixSum_Q_next[X+1]) % MOD`.\n   c. Initialize `dp_new` array of size `k+1`.\n   d. For `val` from `0` to `k`:\n      `dp_new[val] = (Q_next[val] * (k-val+1) + SuffixSum_Q_next[val+1]) % MOD`.\n   e. Set `dp_current = dp_new`.\n3. After `n-1` iterations, `dp_current` holds `dp[1]`.\n4. Compute the final `Q_1` array (convolution of `dp_current` with itself).\n5. The answer is `Q_1[f]`. If `f > 2k`, the answer is `0`.\n\n**Constraints and Complexity:**\n- `n <= 15`, `k, f <= 2 \\cdot 10^5`.\n- `MOD = 998244353` (a prime suitable for NTT).\n- The maximum value for `f` is `2k`.\n- The size of arrays for `dp` is `k+1`. The size for `Q` is `2k+1`.\n- Each iteration involves an NTT (convolution) which takes `O(K \\log K)` time, and suffix sums and `dp_new` computation take `O(K)` time.\n- Total time complexity: `O(n \\cdot K \\log K)`.\n- For `n=15, K=2 \\cdot 10^5`, `15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7`. This should be acceptable within typical time limits (1-2 seconds).\n\n**NTT Implementation Details:**\n- Need to find a power of 2 `N_FFT` such that `N_FFT >= 2K+1`.\n- The `MOD` is `998244353`. A primitive root modulo `MOD` is `3`.\n- Inverse of `N_FFT` modulo `MOD` is needed for inverse NTT.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Function for modular exponentiation (a^b % mod)\ndef power(a, b):\n    res = 1\n    a %= MOD\n    while b > 0:\n        if b % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * a) % MOD\n        a = (a * a) % MOD\n        b //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to compute modular inverse (a^-1 % mod)\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) implementation\n# dir = 1 for forward NTT, dir = -1 for inverse NTT\ndef ntt(a, dir):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    for length in range(2, n + 1, length):\n        wlen = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length)\n        if dir == -1:\n            wlen = inv(wlen)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1\n            for k in range(length // 2):\n                u = a[i + k]\n                v = (a[i + k + length // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + k] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + k + length // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n\n    if dir == -1:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n    return a\n\n# Polynomial multiplication using NTT\ndef multiply_polynomials(p1, p2):\n    len_p1 = len(p1)\n    len_p2 = len(p2)\n    result_len = len_p1 + len_p2 - 1\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to result_len\n    n_fft = 1\n    while n_fft < result_len:\n        n_fft <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials with zeros to n_fft length\n    a = list(p1) + [0] * (n_fft - len_p1)\n    b = list(p2) + [0] * (n_fft - len_p2)\n\n    # Perform NTT\n    a_fft = ntt(a, 1)\n    b_fft = ntt(b, 1)\n\n    # Pointwise multiplication\n    c_fft = [(a_fft[i] * b_fft[i]) % MOD for i in range(n_fft)]\n\n    # Inverse NTT\n    c = ntt(c_fft, -1)\n    \n    # Trim result to actual length\n    return c[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp_current[val] stores dp[L][val]\n    # Max value for dp[s] is k.
