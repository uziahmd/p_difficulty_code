The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan for tackling \"The Number Games\" problem. It's all about minimizing the sum of removed districts' fan counts while keeping the remaining districts connected.**\n\nFirst, I understand the input: we have a tree-like network of districts and fans. The core challenge is choosing which `k` districts to remove to maximize the total fan count of the remaining, connected group. Since fans per district grow exponentially (`2^i`), I instantly see that we need to prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. To put it another way, minimizing the sum of removed districts' fan counts is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the kept districts.\n\nThe connectivity constraint is key.  If we remove districts, the remaining districts must still form a connected subgraph.\n\nThe tempting approach is greedy: keep the districts with the largest indices and hope for the best.  But this could backfire if those high-index districts aren't well-connected. So, I need a strategy that guarantees connectivity.\n\nThe \"peel-off-leaves\" strategy immediately pops into my head. Let's iteratively remove districts that are leaves (connected to only one other district) and have the smallest indices. This approach, I believe, minimizes the total removed fan count while ensuring that the remaining districts always form a connected subgraph.\n\nEssentially, I'll build an adjacency list representing the district connections, track each district's degree (number of connections), and use a min-heap to store leaf districts, sorted by index. In each iteration, I extract the leaf with the smallest index, remove it, and adjust the degrees of its neighbors. If any neighbor's degree drops to 1, it becomes a new leaf and is added to the min-heap. This keeps the connected structure intact.\n\nThe heap will ensure that the smallest index leaf is always removed first, minimizing our objective. I'm essentially shrinking the tree by its \"exterior\" nodes.\n\nThe time complexity should be efficient: `O(N + K log N)` where `N` is the number of districts, and `K` is the number to be removed. The space should be `O(N)` for the adjacency list, degrees, and the removed node list.  I'm confident this solution works.\n\nI need to make sure I'm careful when reading the input and handling the edge cases. I'll remember that since `k` is less than `n`, it's not possible to remove all nodes, which should prevent any indexing problems, and ensure connectivity by design.\n\nAlright, time to code this up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove `k` contestants (districts) from a total of `n` districts, such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component. We want to maximize the total number of fans of the remaining contestants. The number of fans for a contestant from district `i` is `2^i`.\n\n**Understanding the Goal:**\nMaximizing the sum of `2^i` for `n-k` remaining districts is equivalent to minimizing the sum of `2^i` for the `k` removed districts.\nSince `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i` (e.g., `2^10` is much larger than `2^1 + ... + 2^9`), to maximize the sum, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger `i` values. Conversely, to minimize the sum of removed districts, we should prioritize removing districts with smaller `i` values.\n\n**Strategy: Greedy Removal of Smallest-Indexed Leaves**\nThe core idea is to iteratively remove `k` districts, always choosing the district that has the smallest index among all possible candidates for removal. The candidates for removal must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  Removing them keeps the remaining graph connected.\n2.  They should have a small index to minimize the `2^i` contribution to the removed sum.\n\nA node that can be removed without disconnecting the graph is a leaf (a node with degree 1) in the current graph. If we remove a leaf, its single neighbor remains connected to the rest of the graph, thus preserving connectivity.\n\nThis leads to the following greedy algorithm:\n1.  **Initialize:**\n    *   Build an adjacency list `adj` for the given tree structure.\n    *   Calculate the initial `degree` for each district.\n    *   Create a min-priority queue (min-heap) to store potential districts for removal.\n    *   Initialize a list `removed_nodes` to store the districts that are removed.\n\n2.  **Populate Initial Leaves:**\n    *   Iterate through all districts from `1` to `n`. If a district `i` has `degree[i] == 1` (i.e., it's a leaf), add its district number `i` to the `min_heap`.\n\n3.  **Iterative Removal:**\n    *   Loop `k` times (or until `k` districts are removed):\n        *   Extract the district `u` with the smallest district number from `min_heap`. This `u` is the best candidate for removal as it has the smallest `i` value among current leaves.\n        *   Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n        *   Decrement `k`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   Decrement `degree[v]`. This reflects that `v` has lost its connection to `u`.\n            *   If `degree[v]` becomes `1`, it means `v` has now become a leaf in the *remaining* graph. Add `v` to `min_heap` as it's now a candidate for removal. (We only process `v` if `degree[v]` was initially greater than 0, meaning `v` itself hasn't been removed yet).\n\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   Sort the `removed_nodes` list in increasing order of district numbers.\n    *   Print the sorted district numbers, space-separated.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n=6, k=3`\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\n\n1.  **Adjacency List and Degrees:**\n    *   `adj[1]=[2]`, `degree[1]=1`\n    *   `adj[2]=[1,6,4,3]`, `degree[2]=4`\n    *   `adj[3]=[2]`, `degree[3]=1`\n    *   `adj[4]=[2]`, `degree[4]=1`\n    *   `adj[5]=[6]`, `degree[5]=1`\n    *   `adj[6]=[2,5]`, `degree[6]=2`\n\n2.  **Initial Leaves:** Districts `1, 3, 4, 5` have degree 1.\n    `min_heap = [1, 3, 4, 5]` (Python's `heapq` maintains min-heap property)\n\n3.  **Iterative Removal (`k=3`):**\n    *   **Iteration 1 (k=3):**\n        *   `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)` -> `1`\n        *   `removed_nodes = [1]`. `k = 2`.\n        *   Neighbor of `1` is `2`. `degree[2]` becomes `3`. `2` is not a leaf.\n        *   `min_heap = [3, 4, 5]`\n    *   **Iteration 2 (k=2):**\n        *   `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)` -> `3`\n        *   `removed_nodes = [1, 3]`. `k = 1`.\n        *   Neighbor of `3` is `2`. `degree[2]` becomes `2`. `2` is not a leaf.\n        *   `min_heap = [4, 5]`\n    *   **Iteration 3 (k=1):**\n        *   `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)` -> `4`\n        *   `removed_nodes = [1, 3, 4]`. `k = 0`.\n        *   Neighbor of `4` is `2`. `degree[2]` becomes `1`. `2` is now a leaf!\n        *   `heapq.heappush(min_heap, 2)`.\n        *   `min_heap = [2, 5]` (sorted order for clarity)\n\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   `k` is now `0`, so the loop terminates.\n    *   `removed_nodes = [1, 3, 4]`.\n    *   Sorted `removed_nodes = [1, 3, 4]`.\n    *   Print `1 3 4`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Building adjacency list and calculating initial degrees: `O(N)` for `N-1` edges.\n    *   Populating initial heap: `O(N)` iterations, `O(log N)` for each push in worst case (if all are leaves), so `O(N log N)` worst case, but typically `O(N)` as there are at most `N` leaves.\n    *   Main loop runs `k` times:\n        *   `heapq.heappop()`: `O(log N)`\n        *   Degree updates and `heapq.heappush()`: `O(degree_of_u * log N)` in worst case, but `degree_of_u` is typically small for leaves. Each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint being removed). So, total for all `k` removals is `O(k log N)`.\n    *   Sorting `removed_nodes`: `O(k log k)`.\n    *   Overall: `O(N + k log N)`. Given `N <= 10^6`, `k < N`, this is efficient enough (`10^6 + 10^6 * log(10^6)` approx `2 * 10^7` operations).\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` for adjacency list, degrees array, heap, and `removed_nodes` list.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Adjacency list for the tree, using 1-based indexing\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    # Degree of each node in the current graph, using 1-based indexing\n    degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Read edges and build graph\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degree[u] += 1\n        degree[v] += 1\n\n    # Min-heap to store districts that are currently leaves, ordered by district number\n    min_heap = []\n    \n    # Initialize the heap with all initial leaves (nodes with degree 1)\n    # A tree with n >= 2 always has at least two leaves.\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if degree[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(min_heap, i)\n        # Handle n=1 case, though problem constraints k < n implies n >= 2\n        elif n == 1 and degree[i] == 0:\n             # If n=1, the single node has degree 0.
