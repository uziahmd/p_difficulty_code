    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Rudolf and Snowflakes\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and my goal is to figure out if, given a number `n` of vertices, we can construct a \"snowflake.\" A snowflake is built using a parameter `k > 1`.  I need a Python script to determine this.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my thought process:\n\n*   **Understanding the Snowflake Construction:** The problem defines how to build the snowflake iteratively. We start with a root node. Then, we add `k` children to the root. These children only connect to the root.  Crucially, \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" gets `k` more children. This branching *must* happen at least once.\n\n*   **Deriving the Vertex Count Formula:** I began by tracing the total number of vertices after each branching step.  Let `d` represent the depth of the snowflake, or the number of layers of branches.\n\n    *   At depth 0 (just the root): 1 vertex.\n    *   Depth 1 (adding the initial `k` children): `1 + k` vertices.\n    *   Depth 2 (branching from the initial `k` children): `1 + k + k^2` vertices.\n    *   In general, it's a geometric series. After `d` branching steps, we have `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d` vertices.\n\n    The sum of a geometric series is `(k^(d+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`. Since the branching must occur at least once (`d` must be at least 2), our lowest value for `d` is 2. The question asks if for a given `n`, we can find `k > 1` and `d >= 2` such that `n = 1 + k + ... + k^d`.\n*   **The Problem is to find `k` and `d`:** So, the real challenge is, given `n`, to determine if there's a valid pair of (`k`, `d`). This equation is `n = (k^(d+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`. I need to figure out how to efficiently search for these values.\n\n*   **Analyzing `d = 2`:** When d = 2, our equation becomes `n = 1 + k + k^2`.  Rearranging, it becomes `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.  I can use the quadratic formula to solve for `k`. This gives me `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.  `k` has to be an integer > 1, so `4n-3` must be a perfect square. If it is, then `k = (S - 1) / 2` where `S = sqrt(4n - 3)`  and `S` must be odd and `> 3`. So, this can be quickly checked for any input `n`.\n\n*   **Investigating Cases Where d > 2:** Now, for larger `d`, I need to figure out how to narrow down the search space for both `k` and `d`. Since `n` is up to 10^18, and `k > 1` and `d >= 2`, it can be that `k` is small and `d` is large or vice versa. The condition `k > 1` and `d >= 2` must always be met. I know that `n >= 7` because we need at least `1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7` vertices.\n    *   Bounding `k` and `d` is critical. Since `k^d < n`, the maximum of `k` is `n^(1/d)`.\n\n*   **Exploring the Bounds of `d`:** Let's assume that `k = 2`, its smallest value. This gives me `n = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^d` or `n = 2^(d+1) - 1`.   Since `n` is at most 10^18, then the maximum of `d + 1` is around `log2(10^18)`, which is about 60. Then d can reach the upper limit of around 59. This gives me an upper bound on how many `d` values to check.\n    *   I need to iterate from `d=3` to about `59`. This is a relatively small number of iterations.\n    *   For a fixed `d",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake structure. A snowflake is defined by a parameter `k > 1` and a depth `d >= 2`. The total number of vertices `N` in such a snowflake is given by the sum of a geometric series:\n`N = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`\n\nThis sum can be expressed as `N = (k^(d+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\nThe condition \"This step should be done at least once\" implies that the branching from the initial `k` vertices must occur at least once. This means `d` must be at least `2`.\n\nWe need to check if for a given `n` (up to `10^18`), there exist integers `k > 1` and `d >= 2` that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for `d`:\n\n**1. Case `d = 2`**\nThe equation becomes `n = 1 + k + k^2`.\nThis is a quadratic equation in `k`: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\nUsing the quadratic formula, `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(1 - 4 * 1 * (1 - n))) / 2 = (-1 +/- sqrt(1 - 4 + 4n)) / 2 = (-1 +/- sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.\nFor `k` to be an integer greater than 1:\n   - `4n - 3` must be a perfect square. Let `S = sqrt(4n - 3)`.\n   - `S` must be an integer.\n   - `k = (-1 + S) / 2` (since `k > 0`).\n   - For `k` to be an integer, `S` must be odd.\n   - For `k > 1`, `(-1 + S) / 2 > 1` implies `-1 + S > 2`, so `S > 3`.\nWe can check these conditions for `n`.\n\n**2. Case `d >= 3`**\nFor `d >= 3`, we need to find if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that `n = 1 + k + ... + k^d`.\nThe function `f(k) = 1 + k + ... + k^d` is monotonically increasing for `k > 1`. This allows us to use binary search for `k` for a fixed `d`.\n\nWhat are the possible ranges for `d` and `k`?\n- **Maximum `d`:** If `k` is minimal (`k=2`), then `n = 1 + 2 + ... + 2^d = 2^(d+1) - 1`.\n  Since `n <= 10^18`, `2^(d+1) - 1 <= 10^18`, so `2^(d+1) <= 10^18 + 1`.\n  `d+1 <= log2(10^18 + 1)`. `log2(10^18)` is approximately `18 * log2(10) approx 18 * 3.3219 approx 59.79`.\n  So `d+1` can be at most `59` (meaning `2^60 - 1` is slightly larger than `10^18`). Thus, `d` can range from `3` up to `58`.\n- **Maximum `k`:** For a fixed `d`, `k^d < n`, so `k < n^(1/d)`.\n  If `d=3`, `k < (10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6`.\n  If `d=58`, `k < (10^18)^(1/58)`, which is very close to `2`.\n\nThe approach for `d >= 3` is:\nIterate `d` from `3` to `58`.\nFor each `d`, perform a binary search for `k`.\nThe search range for `k` can be `[2, int(n**(1/d)) + 2]`. The `+2` is a safety margin for floating-point precision and to ensure we don't miss `k=2` for large `d`.\nInside the binary search:\n  - Calculate `current_sum = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^d`.\n  - During the sum calculation, we must be careful about potential overflows if `mid^i` becomes very large. In Python, integers handle arbitrary size, but we can optimize by checking `if term > n // mid` before multiplying `term * mid`. If this condition is true, `term * mid` would exceed `n`, so `current_sum` would also exceed `n`.\n  - If `current_sum == n`, we found a solution, return \"YES\".\n  - If `current_sum < n`, increase `low = mid + 1`.\n  - If `current_sum > n`, decrease `high = mid - 1`.\n\nIf after checking all `d` values, no `k` is found, return \"NO\".\n\n**Edge cases:**\n- The smallest possible snowflake has `k=2, d=2`, which gives `1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7` vertices. So, if `n < 7`, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n**Complexity:**\n- The loop for `d` runs about `58 - 3 + 1 = 56` times.\n- Inside the loop, binary search for `k` takes `log(max_k)` iterations. `max_k` is `10^6` for `d=3`, but quickly decreases.\n- Inside the binary search, calculating the sum takes `d+1` iterations.\nThe total operations per test case are roughly `sum_{d=3}^{58} (log(n^(1/d)) * d)`. This simplifies to `sum_{d=3}^{58} ( (1/d) * log(n) * d ) = sum_{d=3}^{58} log(n)`.\nThis is approximately `56 * log(10^18) approx 56 * 60 = 3360` operations.\nWith `10^4` test cases, the total operations are `10^4 * 3360 approx 3.36 * 10^7`, which is well within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # Smallest possible snowflake has k=2, d=2 => 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7 vertices.\n    # So if n < 7, it's impossible.\n    if n < 7:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Case 1: d = 2\n    # n = 1 + k + k^2\n    # k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(1 - 4(1-n))) / 2 = (-1 + sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2\n    \n    val = 4 * n - 3\n    s_float = math.isqrt(val) # integer square root\n    \n    if s_float * s_float == val: # Check if val is a perfect square\n        if s_float % 2 == 1: # S must be odd for k to be integer\n            k = (s_float - 1) // 2\n            if k > 1: # k must be > 1\n                print(\"YES\")\n                return\n\n    # Case 2: d >= 3\n    # Iterate d from 3 up to max_d.\n    # Max d occurs when k=2. n = 2^(d+1) - 1.\n    # 2^(d+1) <= n + 1\n    # d+1 <= log2(n+1)\n    # For n = 10^18, log2(10^18+1) approx 59.79.
