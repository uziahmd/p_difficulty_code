    "thought": "**My Approach to the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and need a Python solution. The core of it seems to be calculating the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to wrap my head around what a \"good\" tree *is*. It's an edge-weighted tree with `n` vertices, where each edge has a weight of either `1` or `-1`. The crucial condition is that for every vertex, the product of the weights of all edges incident to it must be `-1`. I can represent this mathematically:  `product_{j such that (i,j) is an edge} w(i,j) = -1` for each vertex `i`.\n\nNow, let me analyze this condition further. If I multiply all these vertex conditions together, I get: `product_{i=1 to n} (product_{j such that (i,j) is an edge} w(i,j)) = product_{i=1 to n} (-1)`. The right side simplifies to `(-1)^n`. The left side is a bit more interesting. Every edge appears exactly twice in this product. So, the left side becomes `product_{(u,v) is an edge} (w(u,v) * w(u,v)) = product_{(u,v) is an edge} (w(u,v)^2)`. Since `w(u,v)` is either `1` or `-1`, `w(u,v)^2` is always `1`.  Therefore, the left side simplifies to `1`.\n\nThis gives me the equation `1 = (-1)^n`. This means `n` must be even. If `n` is odd, this condition is impossible to satisfy, which is crucial. This explains the given example of `n=1` with an output of `0`. If I find the number of good trees is zero when `n` is odd, then the total sum is zero.\n\nTherefore, my first step will be to handle the odd `n` case and return 0 immediately. Now, assuming `n` is even, I can move forward.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to count these good trees. I will fix a specific tree structure, which determines which edges are present, and then I will try to assign edge weights that meet the \"good\" condition. There are `n^(n-2)` possible tree structures. Fixing the edges, I observe that the \"good\" condition has constraints. If I choose all the edge weights except one, say `(x, y)`, then the \"good\" condition for vertex `x` (or `y`) will *uniquely* determine the weight of `(x, y)`. This tells me there's some kind of constraint I can leverage to build the solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. An edge-weighted tree has `n` vertices, and each edge has a weight of either `1` or `-1`. A tree is \"good\" if for each vertex `i`, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to `i` is `-1`. `d(u,v)` is the sum of weights of edges on the unique path between `u` and `v`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the \"good\" condition. For each vertex `i`, let `P_i = product_{j such that (i,j) is an edge} w(i,j) = -1`.\nConsider the product of `P_i` over all vertices `i`:\n`product_{i=1 to n} P_i = product_{i=1 to n} (-1) = (-1)^n`.\nOn the other hand, each edge `(u,v)` with weight `w(u,v)` contributes `w(u,v)` to `P_u` and `w(u,v)` to `P_v`. So, `w(u,v)` appears twice in the overall product `product_{i=1 to n} P_i`.\nThus, `product_{i=1 to n} P_i = product_{(u,v) is an edge} (w(u,v) * w(u,v)) = product_{(u,v) is an edge} (w(u,v)^2)`.\nSince `w(u,v)` is either `1` or `-1`, `w(u,v)^2 = 1`.\nSo, `product_{i=1 to n} P_i = product_{(u,v) is an edge} 1 = 1`.\nEquating the two expressions for `product_{i=1 to n} P_i`, we get `1 = (-1)^n`.\nThis implies that `n` must be an even number. If `n` is odd, `(-1)^n = -1`, which contradicts `1 = -1`.\nTherefore, if `n` is odd, there are no good trees. In this case, the sum of `d(1,n)` is `0`. This covers the `n=1` case.\n\nNow, assume `n` is even.\nFor any given tree structure, we need to count how many ways we can assign weights to its `n-1` edges such that it is a good tree.\nLet's fix an arbitrary spanning tree structure.\nConsider the `n-1` equations `P_i = -1` for `i=1, ..., n`.\nWe have `n-1` variables (edge weights) and `n` equations.\nPick an arbitrary edge, say `(u,v)`. If we assign weights to all `n-2` edges except `(u,v)`, then the weight `w(u,v)` is uniquely determined by the condition `P_u = -1` (or `P_v = -1`).\nLet's verify this. Suppose we fix `w(e)` for all `e != (u,v)`.\nThen `w(u,v) = -1 / (product_{e=(u,x), x!=v} w(u,x))`. This uniquely determines `w(u,v)` to be either `1` or `-1`.\nOnce `w(u,v)` is determined, all `n-1` edge weights are set.\nWe need to check if all `n` conditions `P_i = -1` are satisfied.\nWe know that `product_{i=1 to n} P_i = 1`. If we satisfy `n-1` conditions `P_i = -1`, then `product_{i=1 to n-1} P_i = (-1)^{n-1}`.\nSince `n` is even, `n-1` is odd. So `product_{i=1 to n-1} P_i = -1`.\nThen `P_n = (product_{i=1 to n} P_i) / (product_{i=1 to n-1} P_i) = 1 / (-1) = -1`.\nSo, if `n` is even, fixing any `n-2` edge weights uniquely determines the remaining edge weight, and all `n` conditions are satisfied.\nThis means for any given tree structure, there are `2^(n-2)` ways to assign weights to make it a good tree (choose `n-2` weights arbitrarily, the last `n-1`th is determined).\n\nThe problem asks for `sum_{T good} d(1,n)`.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{(u,v) on path P_1,n} w(u,v)`.\nBy linearity of expectation, `sum_{T good} d(1,n) = sum_{T good} sum_{(u,v) on P_1,n} w(u,v) = sum_{(u,v)} sum_{T good where (u,v) is on P_1,n} w(u,v)`.\nLet `E` be the set of all possible edges `(u,v)` between distinct vertices `u,v` in `[1,n]`.\n`sum_{T good} d(1,n) = sum_{(u,v) in E} sum_{T good s.t. (u,v) in P_1,n} w(u,v)`.\n\nConsider a specific edge `(u,v)`. For this edge to be part of `P_1,n`, it must be that `u` is on the path from `1` to `v`, and `v` is on the path from `u` to `n` (or vice versa).\nThe total number of trees on `n` labeled vertices is `n^(n-2)`.\nThe number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge is `n^(n-3)` if `n > 2`. If `n=2`, there is only 1 tree, and `(1,2)` is an edge.\nThe number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge and it's on the path `P_1,n` means that removing `(u,v)` splits the tree into two components, one containing `1` and `u` (say `C_1`), and the other containing `v` and `n` (say `C_2`).\nLet `k` be the size of `C_1` (the component containing `1` and `u`). Then `C_2` has size `n-k`.\nThe number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge and it separates `1,u` from `v,n` (meaning `1` is in the component of `u` after removing `(u,v)`, and `n` is in the component of `v` after removing `(u,v)`) is given by a standard result: `k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * (n-2 choose k-1)`. This is for a fixed `u,v`. Summing over `k` from `1` to `n-1` gives `n^(n-3)`. This is the number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge.\n\nLet's fix an edge `(u,v)`. For each tree `T` containing `(u,v)` on the path `P_1,n`, there are `2^(n-2)` ways to assign weights to make `T` good.\nFor `n` even, the total number of good trees is `n^(n-2) * 2^(n-2)`.\n\nConsider an edge `(u,v)`. What is `sum_{T good s.t. (u,v) in P_1,n} w(u,v)`?\nFor a fixed tree `T` (structure and edge `(u,v)` on `P_1,n`), we need to sum `w(u,v)` over all `2^(n-2)` good weight assignments.\nLet `w_0` be the weight of `(u,v)`.\nFor a fixed tree structure, and `n` even, we choose `n-2` edges' weights arbitrarily. Let's say we choose weights for all edges except `(u,v)`. Then `w(u,v)` is uniquely determined. There is only one choice for `w(u,v)`. So this sum is just `w(u,v)` itself.\nThis approach does not seem to easily simplify the sum.\n\nLet's use a different approach. The sum `d(1,n)` is path sum.\nThe sum `sum_{T good} d(1,n)` is `sum_{T good} sum_{(u,v) in P_1,n} w(u,v)`.\nThis can be rewritten as `sum_{(u,v)} sum_{T good, (u,v) in P_1,n} w(u,v)`.\nLet `N_k` be the number of trees where `(u,v)` is on the path `P_1,n` and `w(u,v)=k`.\nThe contribution of edge `(u,v)` to the total sum is `N_1 - N_{-1}`.\nWe need to calculate `sum_{(u,v)} (N_1(u,v) - N_{-1}(u,v))`.\n\nConsider the conditions `P_i = -1`.\nLet `x_e` be `w(e)`. The conditions are `product_{e incident to i} x_e = -1`.\nThis is a system of linear equations in `log_(-1)` space (or `GF(2)` if we map `1 -> 0` and `-1 -> 1`).\nLet `y_e = (1-w(e))/2`, so `y_e=0` if `w(e)=1` and `y_e=1` if `w(e)=-1`.\nThen `w(e) = 1 - 2y_e`.\nThe product condition `product w(e) = -1` becomes `sum y_e = 1 (mod 2)` for each vertex `i`.\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations over `GF(2)` for the `n-1` variables `y_e`.\nAs shown, since `n` is even, this system has `2^(n-2)` solutions for any given tree structure.\n\nLet's consider the path `P_1,n`. Let its edges be `e_1, e_2, ..., e_L`.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{j=1 to L} w(e_j)`.\nThe sum `sum_{T good} d(1,n)` is `sum_{T structure} sum_{weight assignments W good for T} sum_{e in P_1,n(T)} w(e)`.\n\nA key insight for similar problems is often to use the Matrix Tree Theorem or generating functions. However, the problem has constraints on weights.\nAnother common technique is to sum over all edges `(u,v)` and count how many times `w(u,v)` appears on a path `P_1,n` with a certain value.\n\nLet's consider the specific values for small `n`.\n`n=2`: `n` is even. Only one tree `(1,2)`. `P_1: w(1,2)=-1`, `P_2: w(1,2)=-1`. So `w(1,2)=-1`. `d(1,2)=-1`. Modulo `998244353`, this is `998244352`. Correct.\n`n=4`: `n` is even.\nTotal good trees: `4^(4-2) * 2^(4-2) = 4^2 * 2^2 = 16 * 4 = 64`.\nExample output for `n=4` is `-10`.\nThe number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge and is on `P_1,n` for a fixed `u,v` is `(n-2) * n^(n-4)` if `u,v` are not `1,n`. If `u,v = 1,n`, it's `n^(n-3)`.\nFor `n=4`, the number of trees where `(u,v)` is an edge is `4^(4-3) = 4`.\nThe number of trees where `(u,v)` is on `P_1,4`:\nIf `(u,v) = (1,4)`: `4^(4-3) = 4` trees.\nIf `(u,v) = (1,x)` or `(x,4)`: `(n-2) * n^(n-4) = (4-2) * 4^(4-4) = 2 * 1 = 2` trees.\nIf `(u,v) = (x,y)` where `x,y` are not `1,4`: `(n-2) * n^(n-4) = 2` trees.\n\nLet's fix an edge `e=(u,v)`. We want to find `sum_{T good, e in P_1,n} w(e)`.\nFor a fixed tree structure `T`, with `e=(u,v)` on `P_1,n`. How many weight assignments are good? `2^(n-2)`.\nLet `w_e` be the weight of `e`.\nThe sum is `sum_{T structure, e in P_1,n} sum_{W good for T} w_e`.\nConsider an edge `e=(u,v)`. When we choose `n-2` edges' weights arbitrarily, `w_e` is fixed.\nWhat if we choose `n-2` edges *not including* `e`? Then `w_e` is determined.\nWhat if we choose `n-2` edges *including* `e`? Then `w_e` is chosen arbitrarily, and one other edge's weight is determined.\n\nLet's use the `y_e` formulation. `y_e = 0` for `w(e)=1`, `y_e=1` for `w(e)=-1`.\nWe want to sum `d(1,n) = sum_{e in P_1,n} (1 - 2y_e)`.\nThe sum is `sum_{T good} sum_{e in P_1,n} (1 - 2y_e)`.\nThis is `sum_{T good} (length(P_1,n) - 2 * sum_{e in P_1,n} y_e)`.\n\nConsider the sum of `y_e` over all edges `e` for a specific tree `T` and a specific vertex `i`.\n`sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis means `deg(i) - sum_{e incident to i} w(e) / 2 = 1 (mod 2)`.\n`sum_{e incident to i} w(e) = deg(i) - 2 * 1 (mod 2) = deg(i) (mod 2)`.\nBut we know `product w(e) = -1`, which means `sum y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nSo `deg(i)` must be odd for all `i`.\nThis is a very strong condition! If a tree has any vertex with even degree, it cannot be a good tree.\nA tree where all vertices have odd degree is called an \"odd degree tree\".\nHowever, the sum of degrees `sum deg(i) = 2(n-1)`. If all `deg(i)` are odd, then `sum deg(i)` is the sum of `n` odd numbers.\nIf `n` is even, `sum deg(i)` is even. This is consistent.\nIf `n` is odd, `sum deg(i)` is odd. This is a contradiction, as `2(n-1)` is always even.\nThis confirms `n` must be even.\n\nSo, a tree is good if and only if `n` is even AND all vertices have odd degree.\nIf `n` is odd, the answer is `0`.\nIf `n` is even, we only consider trees where all vertices have odd degree. For such a tree, there are `2^(n-2)` ways to assign weights.\n\nLet `N_odd` be the number of trees on `n` labeled vertices where all vertices have odd degree.\nThe sum becomes `sum_{T with odd degrees} sum_{W good for T} d(1,n)`.\nLet `e=(u,v)` be an edge.\n`sum_{T with odd degrees} sum_{W good for T} w(e) * [e in P_1,n]`.\nFor a fixed tree structure `T` (with odd degrees), what is `sum_{W good for T} w(e)`?\nThere are `2^(n-2)` weight assignments.\nLet's choose `n-2` edges' weights arbitrarily, say all edges except `e_0`. Then `w(e_0)` is determined.\nWhat if we choose `n-2` edges *not including* `e`? Then `w(e)` is determined.\nConsider an edge `e=(u,v)`. When we pick `n-2` other edges, say `e_1, ..., e_{n-2}`, and assign them arbitrary weights. The weight of `e` is then determined.\nThere are `2^(n-2)` good weight assignments for `T`.\nLet `w(e)` be the weight of `e` in one such assignment.\nLet `w'(e)` be the weight of `e` in another assignment.\nIf we flip the weight of one edge `e_k` (from `1` to `-1` or vice versa), then the product condition for its endpoints `i,j` will flip. So `P_i` becomes `1` and `P_j` becomes `1`. This is not good.\nTo maintain the good property, if we flip `w(e_k)`, we must flip another edge's weight incident to `i` and another edge's weight incident to `j`. This propagation is complex.\n\nHowever, the `y_e` formulation is linear.\n`sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nLet `y` be the vector of `n-1` variables `y_e`.\nLet `A` be the `n x (n-1)` incidence matrix of the tree. `A_ie = 1` if `e` is incident to `i`, `0` otherwise.\nThe system is `A y = 1_n (mod 2)`, where `1_n` is the vector of all ones.\nThe sum of all equations is `sum_i (sum_{e incident to i} y_e) = sum_i 1 (mod 2)`.\n`sum_e (sum_{i incident to e} y_e) = n (mod 2)`.\n`sum_e (2 y_e) = n (mod 2)`.\n`0 = n (mod 2)`. This confirms `n` must be even.\nThe rank of `A` over `GF(2)` is `n-1` (because it's a tree, so it's connected, and `n` is even).\nThis means there is exactly one solution for `y` for a given tree structure.\nThis contradicts my earlier finding of `2^(n-2)` solutions. What went wrong?\n\nThe rank of the incidence matrix `A` of a connected graph with `n` vertices over `GF(2)` is `n-1`.\nThis means the kernel of `A` has dimension `(n-1) - (n-1) = 0`. So `A` is invertible (if it were square).\nBut `A` is `n x (n-1)`. It has full column rank.\nThe system `A y = b (mod 2)` has a solution if and only if `b` is in the image of `A`.\nThe image of `A` over `GF(2)` is the set of vectors `b` such that `sum b_i = 0 (mod 2)`.\nIn our case `b = 1_n`, the vector of all ones. `sum b_i = sum_i 1 = n (mod 2)`.\nIf `n` is odd, `sum b_i = 1 (mod 2)`, so `b` is not in the image of `A`. No solutions.\nIf `n` is even, `sum b_i = 0 (mod 2)`, so `b` is in the image of `A`. There is at least one solution.\nSince `A` has rank `n-1`, the solution is unique.\n\nOkay, my analysis of `2^(n-2)` solutions was incorrect.\nLet's re-evaluate the number of solutions.\nPick an arbitrary vertex `r` as root. For any edge `e=(u,v)` where `v` is child of `u`, `w(e)` can be written as `w(r,u) * P_u / product_{e'=(u,c), c!=v} w(e')`.\nThis suggests a unique solution.\nThe standard argument is: choose a root, say `1`. For any vertex `i != 1`, `P_i = -1` can be used to determine `w(i, parent(i))` if all `w(i, child(i))` are known.\nWe can do a DFS from root `1`. For any vertex `u`, after visiting all its children `v_1, ..., v_k` and determining `w(u,v_j)`, we can use `P_u = -1` to determine `w(u, parent(u))`.\nThis determines all edge weights except for the edge `(1, parent(1))` (which doesn't exist for root `1`).\nAll edges `(u, parent(u))` for `u != 1` are determined.\nThe weights `w(u,v)` are uniquely determined by `P_u` for `u != 1` and `P_v` for `v != 1`.\nThe only remaining condition is `P_1 = -1`.\nDoes this condition hold? We know `product_{i=1 to n} P_i = 1`.\nIf `P_i = -1` for `i=2, ..., n`, then `product_{i=2 to n} P_i = (-1)^(n-1)`.\nSince `n` is even, `n-1` is odd. So `product_{i=2 to n} P_i = -1`.\nThen `P_1 = (product_{i=1 to n} P_i) / (product_{i=2 to n} P_i) = 1 / (-1) = -1`.\nSo, `P_1 = -1` is automatically satisfied.\nThis means for any given tree structure, if `n` is even, there is exactly one way to assign weights to make it a good tree.\nIf `n` is odd, there are no good trees.\n\nSo, for `n` even, the sum is `sum_{T structure} d(1,n)` where `w(e)` are the unique weights for `T`.\nThis simplifies the problem significantly!\nThe number of good trees is `n^(n-2)` if `n` is even, and `0` if `n` is odd.\nWe need to calculate `sum_{T structure} sum_{e in P_1,n(T)} w(e)`.\n`w(e)` is either `1` or `-1`.\nLet `w(e)` be determined by the unique assignment for `T`.\nLet's fix an edge `e=(u,v)`. We want to find its total contribution: `sum_{T structure, e in P_1,n(T)} w(e)`.\nThe number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is part of `P_1,n` is `(n-2) * n^(n-4)` if `u,v` are not `1,n`.\nIf `(u,v)=(1,n)`, it is `n^(n-3)`.\n\nWhat is `w(u,v)` for the unique assignment?\nLet `y_e = 1` if `w(e)=-1`, `0` if `w(e)=1`.\n`sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)` for all `i`.\nLet `d(i)` be the degree of `i`.\n`w(u,v) = (-1)^(y_{u,v})`.\nWe need to find `y_{u,v}` for a given tree `T`.\nPick an arbitrary root, say `1`. For any edge `(x,y)` where `y` is a child of `x`:\n`y_{x,y} = (sum_{z child of y, z!=x} y_{y,z}) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis can be computed with a DFS from root `1`. For any `u != 1`, `y_{u, parent(u)}` is determined by `sum_{v child of u} y_{u,v} = 1 (mod 2)`.\nSpecifically, `y_{u, parent(u)} = (sum_{v child of u} y_{u,v}) + 1 (mod 2)`.\nThe base cases are leaves `l != 1`. For a leaf `l`, `y_{l, parent(l)} = 1 (mod 2)`.\nSo, `w(l, parent(l)) = -1`.\nThis means all edges incident to leaves (except for leaf `1`) must have weight `-1`.\nThis is a very important observation!\n\nIf `n=1`, output `0`.\nIf `n=2`, `w(1,2)=-1`. `d(1,2)=-1`.

So `w(2,3)=1`.\nVertex `3`: `w(2,3)w(3,4)=-1`. `(1)(-1)=-1`. Consistent.\nPath `P_1,4` is `1-2-3-4`. Edges `(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)`. Weights `-1, 1, -1`.\n`d(1,4) = -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1`.\nThere are `(n-2)!` such paths (permutations of intermediate vertices). `(4-2)! = 2`.\nSo `1-2-3-4` and `1-3-2-4`. Both give `d(1,4)=-1`.\nTotal contribution: `2 * (-1) = -2`.\n\nSum for `n=4`: `-4 + (-4) + (-2) = -10`. This matches the example.\n\nThe pattern for `w(u,v)`:\nFor any leaf `l != 1`, `w(l, parent(l)) = -1`.\nFor any node `u` with children `v_1, ..., v_k`, `w(u, parent(u)) = product_{j} w(u, v_j)`.\nIf `u` is a leaf (and `u!=1`), `w(u, parent(u)) = -1`.\nThe path `P_1,n` has length `L`.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{e in P_1,n} w(e)`.\nLet `1 = v_0, v_1, ..., v_L = n` be the path `P_1,n`.\n`w(v_i, v_{i+1})`.\n`y_{v_i, v_{i+1}} = 1` if `w(v_i, v_{i+1}) = -1`, `0` if `w(v_i, v_{i+1}) = 1`.\n`y_{u, parent(u)} = 1` for leaves `u != 1`.\nConsider the path `P_1,n`. Let `v_0=1, v_1, ..., v_L=n`.\nThe weight `w(v_i, v_{i+1})` depends on the subtree rooted at `v_{i+1}` (if `v_i` is parent of `v_{i+1}`).\nMore precisely, `y_{u, parent(u)} = 1 + sum_{v child of u} y_{u,v} (mod 2)`.\nThis means `y_{u, parent(u)} = 1 + (number of children of u whose edge to u has weight -1) (mod 2)`.\nThis is hard to sum over all trees.\n\nLet's consider the total sum over all trees.\n`sum_{T} d(1,n) = sum_{T} sum_{e=(u,v) in P_1,n} w(u,v)`.\n`= sum_{e=(u,v)} sum_{T s.t. e in P_1,n} w(u,v)`.\nFor a fixed edge `e=(u,v)`, we need to sum `w(u,v)` over all trees `T` where `e` is on `P_1,n`.\nLet `N(1,u,v,n)` be the number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_1,n`.\nThis is `k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * (n-2 choose k-1)` where `k` is the size of the component containing `1` and `u` after removing `e`.\nThis is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * (n-2 choose k-1))` trees where `e` is an edge.\nThis sum is `n^(n-3)` if `n>2`. For `n=2`, it's `1`.\nFor a fixed `e=(u,v)` on `P_1,n`, what is `w(u,v)`?\nLet `T_u` be the component containing `u` (and `1`) when `e` is removed, and `T_v` be the component containing `v` (and `n`).\n`w(u,v) = -1` if `u` is a leaf in `T_u` (and `u != 1`).\n`w(u,v) = -1` if `v` is a leaf in `T_v` (and `v != n`).\nThis is not quite right because `w(u,v)` is determined by all `n-1` vertex conditions.\n\nLet's use the result from a similar problem: \"Sum of distances in trees\".\nThe sum of `d(1,n)` over all `n^(n-2)` trees, where edge weights are `1`, is `(n-1) * n^(n-3) * n * (n-1) / 2`.\nThis is not directly useful since weights are not fixed.\n\nThe unique weight assignment for a tree `T` is determined by `y_e = 1` iff `w(e)=-1`.\n`sum_{e inc to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nConsider the path `P_1,n`.

This is the total length of all paths.\nThe sum `sum_{T} length(P_1,n)` is `(n-1) * n^(n-3)`.\n`sum_{T} d(1,n) = sum_{T} (length(P_1,n) - 2 * sum_{e in P_1,n} y_e)`.\nThis is `(n-1) * n^(n-3) - 2 * sum_{T} sum_{e in P_1,n} y_e`.\n\nLet's consider the edge `(1,x)`. `w(1,x)` can be `1` or `-1`.\n`y_{1,x} = sum_{v child of x} y_{x,v} + 1 (mod 2)`.\nIf `x` is a leaf (and `x!=1`), then `y_{1,x}=1`.

Let its length be `L`.\nThe number of edges `e` on `P_1,n` that have `w(e)=-1` is `sum_{e in P_1,n} y_e`.\nThe value of `y_{u,v}` (where `v` is child of `u`) is `1` if the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at `v` (excluding `v` itself if `v` is `1`) is odd.\nThis is a standard result: `y_{u,v} = 1` if `size(subtree_v)` is odd, and `0` if `size(subtree_v)` is even.\nThis is true if the root `1` is not involved.\nThe sum of `y_e` incident to `i` is `1 (mod 2)`.\nIf `v` is a child of `u`, `y_{u,v} = (sum_{x child of v} y_{v,x} + 1) (mod 2)`.\nThis means `y_{u,v} = 1` if `sum_{x child of v} y_{v,x}` is `0 (mod 2)`.\n`y_{u,v} = 0` if `sum_{x child of v} y_{v,x}` is `1 (mod 2)`.\nThis is `1` if `v` has an even number of children whose edges to `v` have weight `-1`.\n\nLet's use a simpler formulation.\nFor an edge `(u,v)`, `w(u,v) = (-1)^(N_v)`, where `N_v` is the number of edges `(v,x)` such that `x` is in the component of `v` after removing `(u,v)` and `w(v,x)=-1`.\nMore precisely, `w(u,v) = product_{x in N(v) \\ {u}} w(v,x) * (-1)`.\nThis means `w(u,v) = (-1)^(1 + sum_{x in N(v) \\ {u}} y_{v,x})`.\nLet's consider the path `P_1,n = (v_0,v_1), (v_1,v_2), ..., (v_{L-1},v_L)`. `v_0=1, v_L=n`.\n`w(v_i, v_{i+1}) = (-1)^(1 + sum_{x in N(v_{i+1}) \\ {v_i}} y_{v_{i+1},x})`.\nThe sum `sum_{x in N(v_{i+1}) \\ {v_i}} y_{v_{i+1},x}` is the parity of the number of edges with weight `-1` in the component formed by `v_{i+1}` and its `N(v_{i+1}) \\ {v_i}` neighbors.\nThis is equivalent to the parity of the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at `v_{i+1}` (if we consider `v_i` as its parent), excluding `n` if `v_{i+1}=n`.\nLet `s(v)` be the size of the subtree rooted at `v` (considering `u` as parent of `v`).\nThen `y_{u,v} = 1` iff `s(v)` is odd.\nThis is a common result for the sum of degrees modulo 2.\nSo `w(u,v) = -1` if the size of the component containing `v` (when `(u,v)` is removed) is odd.\n`w(u,v) = 1` if the size of the component containing `v` (when `(u,v)` is removed) is even.\n\nLet `C_v` be the component containing `v` when `(u,v)` is removed from `T`.\nThen `w(u,v) = (-1)^(|C_v|)`. (This is for a different set of conditions, `product w(e) = 1` for all nodes.)\nFor our condition `product w(e) = -1`, the rule is:\n`w(u,v) = -1` if the component containing `v` has an odd number of vertices, AND `v` is not `1`.\n`w(u,v) = 1` if the component containing `v` has an even number of vertices, AND `v` is not `1`.\nThis is if `u` is the parent of `v`.\nIf `v` is `1`, then `w(u,1) = -1` if the component containing `1` has an odd number of vertices.\nLet's use the definition: `w(u,v) = (-1)^(sum_{x in C_v} 1 (mod 2))`.\nThis is if `sum_{i} deg(i)` is odd.\nNo, let's stick to `y_e` and its relation to subtree sizes.\nThe value of `y_{u,v}` (where `v` is a child of `u`) is `1` if the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at `v` (excluding `v` itself if `v=1`) is odd.\nThis is `y_{u,v} = 1` iff `size(subtree_v)` is odd.\nLet's verify this for `n=4`, tree `1-2-3-4`.\nRoot at `1`.\n`y_{1,2}`: `size(subtree_2) = 3`. Odd. So `y_{1,2}=1`, `w(1,2)=-1`.\n`y_{2,3}`: `size(subtree_3) = 2`. Even. So `y_{2,3}=0`, `w(2,3)=1`.\n`y_{3,4}`: `size(subtree_4) = 1`. Odd. So `y_{3,4}=1`, `w(3,4)=-1`.\nThis matches the `n=4` calculation. `d(1,4) = -1+1-1 = -1`.\n\nSo, for an edge `(u,v)` on `P_1,n`, with `u` being the parent of `v` (when rooted at `1`), `w(u,v) = -1` if the size of the subtree rooted at `v` is odd, and `w(u,v) = 1` if it is even.\nThe sum is `sum_{T} sum_{e=(u,v) in P_1,n} (-1)^(size(subtree_v))`.\nThe sum `sum_{T} d(1,n)` can be computed by summing over all possible edges `(u,v)` and all possible sizes `k` of the component `C_v` (subtree `v`).\nFor a fixed edge `(u,v)`, and a fixed size `k` for the component `C_v` (containing `v` and `n`), the number of trees where `(u,v)` is on `P_1,n`, and `|C_v|=k` is `(n-k)^(n-k-1) * k^(k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)`.\nThe contribution of such trees for edge `(u,v)` is `(-1)^k * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * k^(k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)`.\nSum this over `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\nThis is for a fixed edge `(u,v)`.\nThis value `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * k^(k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)` is the sum for a single edge `(u,v)`.\nHow many edges `(u,v)` are there? `n(n-1)/2`.\nBut `(u,v)` is on `P_1,n`.\nThe number of such paths `P_1,n` that contain `(u,v)` is `(n-2) * n^(n-4)`.\nThis calculation is for ANY edge `(u,v)`.\nThe number of trees where `(u,v)` is on `P_1,n` and `v` is in the `k`-sized component is `(n-k)^(n-k-1) * k^(k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)`.\nThe sum of `d(1,n)` is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * k^(k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)`.\nThis is the total contribution of all edges `(u,v)` where `v` is in the `k`-sized component and `u` is in the `n-k`-sized component.\nLet `S_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)`.\nThis is the sum of `w(u,v)` for all edges `(u,v)` on `P_1,n` over all trees.\nWait, this formula `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)` is for one specific pair of nodes `(1,n)`.\nThe total sum is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * C(n-2, k-1)`.\nThis is the sum for `d(1,n)` over all trees.\n\nLet's check `n=4`.\n`S_4 = sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^k * k^(k-1) * (4-k)^(4-k-1) * C(2, k-1)`.\n`k=1`: `(-1)^1 * 1^0 * 3^2 * C(2,0) = -1 * 1 * 9 * 1 = -9`.\n`k=2`: `(-1)^2 * 2^1 * 2^1 * C(2,1) = 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.\n`k=3`: `(-1)^3 * 3^2 * 1^0 * C(2,2) = -1 * 9 * 1 * 1 = -9`.\n`S_4 = -9 + 8 - 9 = -10`.
