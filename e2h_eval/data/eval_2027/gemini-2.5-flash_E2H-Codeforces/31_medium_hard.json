            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solution Plan for \"Vanya and Cards\"**\n\nOkay, so I've broken down this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The goal is clear: find the minimum cards Vanya needs to reach a total card sum of zero. I'm given the number of cards found (`n`), the maximum absolute value on a card (`x`), and the values of the found cards.\n\nMy initial thought is to calculate the sum of the found cards (`S`). Then, the sum of new cards must be `-S`. To minimize the number of new cards, I'll need each card to contribute as much as possible to achieve this negative target sum.\n\nIf the current sum is zero, I need no new cards. If the sum isn't zero, it will be either positive or negative, let's call it the `target_sum`. For `target_sum` of either sign, I'll add new cards of value either `x` or `-x` to balance.\n\nTo find the minimum cards, I'll use the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by the max value, `x`.  This gives me `ceil(abs(S)/x)`. Let's test this strategy with a few cases to be sure I haven't missed any edge conditions.\n\nI've thought through several edge cases, like when the sum is initially zero, or when all initial cards are the same value. The strategy seems robust.\n\nNow, it's a matter of translating this into Python code. I'll read in the input, calculate the sum, take the absolute value, and then calculate the ceiling of the absolute sum divided by `x`. Using `math.ceil` is the correct way to calculate it. The Python script looks good to go.\n",
