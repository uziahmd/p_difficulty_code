Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Morse Code Sequence Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my hands, and it's asking for a Python solution. The core is all about counting sequences of English letters, which are represented by their Morse code equivalents. The catch? The concatenated Morse codes have to form a substring within a string `S`.  `S` is built up dynamically, one '0' or '1' at a time, and I need to report the count of valid sequences *modulo* `10^9 + 7` after each append.\n\nLet's break this down. First, Morse code. Dots are '0', dashes are '1'.  Valid Morse codes are strings of '0's and '1's, ranging from length 1 to 4. I know there are 26 such strings that form a valid morse code, but I need to be careful with strings like \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". The valid codes are 26 in number.\n\nThe real challenge is figuring out a smart way to count the *distinct* sequences. I'm not just looking for the total number of substrings. I want the number of distinct sequences of letters whose Morse code representation forms *any* substring of `S`.\n\nMy first instinct is dynamic programming. I was considering a `dp[i]` to represent the number of sequences formed using prefixes of a specific substring. That seems overly complicated because I'm actually interested in subsequences within the total string `S`.\n\nThinking about the growing string, `S_k`, after each append, I have to efficiently identify new valid sequences. Let's call the letters `L_1, L_2, ..., L_p`. If their concatenated Morse codes, `M_1, M_2, ..., M_p`, form a substring in `S_k`, then this sequence of letters is valid. I've got to count these *distinctly*.\n\nThis is reminding me of string matching techniques, like the Aho-Corasick algorithm. I could construct some kind of automaton. The dictionary of possible \"words\" (valid Morse codes) is small – only 26 items, and each has a maximum length of 4. So an automaton approach might be overkill. I will need to be extremely efficient. I need to figure out how to avoid redundant computations as `S` grows. I think that the crucial thing is to realize that each appended character *potentially* extends existing valid substrings by one position. So, the key must be to update my count with each appends operation.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by concatenating Morse code representations, such that the combined Morse code string is a substring of a given string `S`. The string `S` grows by appending one character ('0' for dot, '1' for dash) at a time, and we need to report the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each append operation.\n\nFirst, let's list the valid Morse code representations. English letters are represented by strings of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4. There are $2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30$ such strings. Four of these do not correspond to any English letter: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". Thus, there are $30 - 4 = 26$ valid Morse code strings, each corresponding to a distinct English letter.\n\nLet's define a set `VALID_CODES` containing these 26 strings.\n`VALID_CODES = {\"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\", \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\"}`\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is `m = 3000`. The maximum length of a Morse code is 4.\n\nWe need to count distinct sequences of letters. This suggests using dynamic programming.\nLet `S_k` be the string `S` after `k` characters have been appended.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S_k + c`. We are interested in all substrings of `S`.\n\nConsider a substring `S[i...j]` of `S`. We want to find how many distinct sequences of letters can be formed by `S[i...j]`.\nLet `dp[p]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by the prefix `S[i...p]` of the current substring `S[i...j]`.\nIf `S[i...p]` is a valid Morse code `M`, then `M` itself forms one sequence.\nIf `S[i...p]` can be split into `S[i...q]` and `S[q+1...p]`, where `S[q+1...p]` is a valid Morse code `M'`, then any sequence formed by `S[i...q]` followed by `M'` is a new sequence.\nSo, `dp[p] = (sum(dp[q] for q < p if S[q+1...p] is a valid Morse code) + (1 if S[i...p] is a valid Morse code else 0))`.\n\nThis DP calculates sequences for a *single* substring. We need to do this for *all* substrings and sum up the distinct sequences. This would be too slow ($O(m^3)$ or $O(m^4)$).\n\nA more efficient approach for counting sequences over all substrings:\nLet `total_sequences` be the running total of distinct sequences.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, forming `S_new = S + c`, we only need to consider new substrings that end at the current position `k`. These are `S_new[0...k]`, `S_new[1...k]`, ..., `S_new[k...k]`.\nFor each such substring `S_new[i...k]`, we need to find the number of distinct sequences it can form.\n\nLet `dp[j]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by *any* substring ending at index `j` of `S`. This is not quite right because we need to sum up distinct sequences over all substrings.\n\nLet's define `dp[j]` as the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using `S[...j]` as the *entire* Morse code string.\nWhen `S` grows to length `k`, we are interested in substrings `S[i...k]`.\nFor a fixed starting position `i`, let `f[p]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by `S[i...p]`.\n`f[p] = 0` initially.\nFor `p` from `i` to `k`:\n  `current_substring = S[i...p]`\n  If `current_substring` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n    `f[p] += 1`\n  For `len` from 1 to 4:\n    If `p - len >= i` and `S[p-len+1...p]` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n      `f[p] += f[p-len]`\nAll additions are modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of non-empty sequences. This implies that if \"T\" can be formed from \"1\" and \"M\" from \"11\", and `S = \"111\"`, then \"T\", \"M\", \"O\" (from \"111\"), \"TT\" (from \"11\"), \"TM\" (from \"111\"), \"MT\" (from \"111\"), \"TTT\" (from \"111\") are all counted. The example confirms this interpretation: \"TT\" and \"TM\" and \"MT\" are all distinct sequences. This means we are counting `(sequence, substring_start_index, substring_end_index)` tuples, then taking only the sequence part, and counting distinct ones.\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is 3000.\nLet `total_count` be the answer for the current `S`.\nWhen `S` grows by one character, say `S_new = S_old + char`, we need to calculate the new `total_count`.\nThe new `total_count` includes all sequences from `S_old`, plus sequences formed by new substrings ending at the new last position.\nLet `current_S` be the string `S` after `k` appends. Its length is `k+1`.\nWe need to calculate `dp_val[j]` = number of sequences that can be formed by `current_S[...j]` where `j` is the last index.\n`dp_val[j]` is the number of sequences that can be formed using `current_S[0...j]` as the *entire* Morse code string.\nThis is not what we want. We need sequences from *any substring*.\n\nLet's maintain `total_answer`, which is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from 0 to current length `k-1`, where `dp[i]` is the number of sequences ending at `i`.\nWhen `S` becomes `S_new` (length `k`), `S_new[k]` is the new character.\nWe need to calculate `new_sequences_ending_at_k`.\n`new_sequences_ending_at_k` is the sum of `(1 if S_new[k-len+1...k] is valid else 0)` for `len=1..4`, plus `dp[k-len]` if `S_new[k-len+1...k]` is valid.\nThis `dp[i]` means \"number of sequences that can be formed using `S[0...i]` as the *entire* Morse code string\".\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by `S[0...i]` as a single concatenated Morse code string.\n`dp[i] = (1 if S[0...i] is valid) + sum(dp[j] for j < i if S[j+1...i] is valid)`.\nThis `dp[i]` formulation is for a *prefix* of `S`. The problem asks for *substrings*.\n\nLet `total_ans` be the answer.\nWhen `S` has length `k` (0-indexed `0` to `k-1`), we append `char` to get `S_new` (length `k+1`, 0-indexed `0` to `k`).\nWe need to count sequences from `S_new[i...j]` for all `0 <= i <= j <= k`.\nThe new substrings are `S_new[0...k]`, `S_new[1...k]`, ..., `S_new[k...k]`.\nFor each `i` from `0` to `k`:\n  Let `current_substring = S_new[i...k]`.\n  We need to count sequences for `current_substring`.\n  Let `dp_sub[p]` be the number of sequences formed by `current_substring[0...p]` (relative to `current_substring`).\n  `dp_sub[p] = 0`\n  If `current_substring[0...p]` is a valid code:\n    `dp_sub[p] += 1`\n  For `len` from 1 to 4:\n    If `p - len >= 0` and `current_substring[p-len+1...p]` is a valid code:\n      `dp_sub[p] += dp_sub[p-len]`\n  The number of sequences for `current_substring` is `dp_sub[len(current_substring)-1]`.\n  We sum these up for `i=0...k` and add to `total_ans`.\nThis is $O(m^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code}) = O(3000^2 \\cdot 4)$, which is $3.6 \\cdot 10^7$. This might be acceptable.\n\nLet's refine the DP state.\nLet `dp[j]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[i...j]` as a concatenated Morse code string, where `i` is fixed for `dp` calculation.\nThis is not what we want. We need to sum up `dp[j]` for all possible `i`.\n\nLet `dp[j]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[...j]` as the *entire* Morse code string.\nThis definition is still about prefixes. We need substrings.\n\nLet's track `current_S`.\nLet `ans` be the total count.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `current_S` (which had length `k-1`), `current_S` now has length `k`.\nThe new character is `current_S[k-1]`.\nWe are interested in new sequences formed by substrings ending at `k-1`.\nThese substrings are `current_S[0...k-1]`, `current_S[1...k-1]`, ..., `current_S[k-1...k-1]`.\n\nFor each `start_idx` from `0` to `k-1`:\n  Consider the substring `sub = current_S[start_idx ... k-1]`.\n  We need to count sequences for `sub`.\n  Let `dp_sub[p]` be the number of sequences formed by `sub[0...p]`.\n  `dp_sub[p] = 0`\n  For `p` from `0` to `len(sub)-1`:\n    If `sub[0...p]` is a valid code:\n      `dp_sub[p] = (dp_sub[p] + 1) % MOD`\n    For `l` from 1 to 4:\n      If `p - l >= 0`:\n        `suffix = sub[p-l+1...p]`\n        If `suffix` is a valid code:\n          `dp_sub[p] = (dp_sub[p] + dp_sub[p-l]) % MOD`\n  `ans = (ans + dp_sub[len(sub)-1]) % MOD`\n\nThis is $O(M^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code})$.\n$M=3000$, $\\text{max_len_code}=4$.\n$3000 \\times 3000 \\times 4 = 36 \\times 10^6$. This should pass within 1-2 seconds.\n\nLet's trace the example `S = \"111\"`:\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n\nInitially `S = \"\"`, `ans = 0`.\n\n1.  Append '1'. `S = \"1\"`. Length `k=1`.\n    Substrings ending at index 0: `S[0...0] = \"1\"`.\n    `start_idx = 0`. `sub = \"1\"`. `len(sub)=1`.\n    `dp_sub[0]`:\n      `sub[0...0] = \"1\"`. Is \"1\" valid? Yes. `dp_sub[0] = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n      No `p-l >= 0` for `l=1..4`.\n    Sequences for \"1\" = `dp_sub[0] = 1`.\n    `ans = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    Output: 1.\n\n2.  Append '1'. `S = \"11\"`. Length `k=2`.\n    New substrings ending at index 1: `S[0...1] = \"11\"`, `S[1...1] = \"1\"`.\n    a) `start_idx = 0`. `sub = \"11\"`. `len(sub)=2`.\n       `dp_sub` array of size 2.\n       `p = 0`:\n         `sub[0...0] = \"1\"`. Valid. `dp_sub[0] = 1`.\n       `p = 1`:\n         `sub[0...1] = \"11\"`. Valid. `dp_sub[1] = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n         `l = 1`: `p-l=0`. `suffix = sub[1...1] = \"1\"`. Valid.\n           `dp_sub[1] = (dp_sub[1] + dp_sub[0]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n       Sequences for \"11\" = `dp_sub[1] = 2`. (\"M\", \"TT\")\n       `ans = (1 + 2) % MOD = 3`.\n    b) `start_idx = 1`. `sub = \"1\"`. `len(sub)=1`.\n       `dp_sub[0]`:\n         `sub[0...0] = \"1\"`. Valid. `dp_sub[0] = 1`.\n       Sequences for \"1\" = `dp_sub[0] = 1`. (\"T\")\n       `ans = (3 + 1) % MOD = 4`.\n    Wait, the example output is 3. My current logic sums up sequences from *each* substring.\n    The example says: \"T\" (from \"1\"), \"M\" (from \"11\"), \"O\" (from \"111\"), \"TT\" (from \"11\"), \"TM\" (from \"111\"), \"MT\" (from \"111\"), \"TTT\" (from \"111\").\n    This implies we need to count *distinct sequences overall*. Not sum of counts for each substring.\n\nThis means we need a `set` to store the sequences. But sequences can be very long. Storing them in a set is not feasible.\nThe problem statement: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". This phrasing usually means distinct sequences.\n\nIf the answer is 3 for \"11\", then:\n\"1\" -> \"T\" (1 sequence)\n\"11\" -> \"M\", \"TT\" (2 sequences)\nTotal: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\". Distinct count = 3.\nMy current logic: for \"1\", count is 1. For \"11\", count is 2. Summing these gives 3.\nFor \"111\":\n\"1\" (at index 0) -> \"T\" (1)\n\"11\" (at index 0) -> \"M\", \"TT\" (2)\n\"111\" (at index 0) -> \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" (4)\n\"1\" (at index 1) -> \"T\" (1)\n\"11\" (at index 1) -> \"M\", \"TT\" (2)\n\"1\" (at index 2) -> \"T\" (1)\nTotal: $1+2+4+1+2+1 = 11$.\nThe example output for \"111\" is 7.\n\nThis means we need to count sequences from *all substrings*.\nThe distinct sequences for \"111\" are:\nFrom \"1\": \"T\"\nFrom \"11\": \"M\", \"TT\"\nFrom \"111\": \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\nTotal distinct sequences: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". There are 7 of them.\n\nThe problem is that my `dp_sub` approach counts sequences for a *specific* substring. If the same sequence can be formed by multiple substrings (e.g., \"T\" from `S[0]` and \"T\" from `S[1]`), it gets counted multiple times. We need to avoid this overcounting.\n\nA common competitive programming technique for \"distinct substrings\" or \"distinct sequences\" is to use a Trie/Aho-Corasick or polynomial hashing.\nHere, the \"sequences of English letters\" are what we need to count.\nEach sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` corresponds to a unique string `Morse(L_1) ... Morse(L_p)`.\nSince each Morse code string corresponds to a distinct letter, the sequence `L_1 ... L_p` is uniquely identified by the concatenated Morse code string `M_1 ... M_p`.\nSo, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of distinct strings `M_1 ... M_p` such that `M_1 ... M_p` is a substring of `S`, and each `M_i` is a valid Morse code.\n\nThis means we need to count the number of distinct concatenations of valid Morse codes that appear as substrings of `S`.\nLet `current_S` be the string `S`.\nFor each `j` from `0` to `k-1` (current length of `S`):\n  Let `dp[j]` be the set of all distinct sequences that can be formed by `current_S[...j]` as the *entire* concatenated Morse code string.\n  `dp[j]` will contain strings like \"T\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", etc.\n  `dp[j]` is initialized as an empty set.\n  If `current_S[0...j]` is a valid code `M`:\n    `dp[j].add(M)` (or the letter it represents, doesn't matter, as long as it's distinct).\n  For `len` from 1 to 4:\n    If `j - len >= 0`:\n      `suffix = current_S[j-len+1...j]`\n      If `suffix` is a valid code `M_suffix`:\n        For each `seq` in `dp[j-len]`:\n          `dp[j].add(seq + M_suffix)`\nThis `dp[j]` is for prefixes. We need for substrings.\n\nLet's use the $O(M^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code})$ approach again, but instead of summing `dp_sub[len(sub)-1]`, we add all generated sequences to a global set.\n`global_sequences = set()`\nFor each `k` from `0` to `m-1`: (current length of `S` is `k+1`)\n  `new_char = read_char()`\n  `S.append(new_char)`\n  For `start_idx` from `0` to `k`:\n    `dp_sub = [set() for _ in range(k - start_idx + 1)]`\n    For `p` from `0` to `k - start_idx`:\n      `current_code = \"\".join(S[start_idx : start_idx + p + 1])`\n      If `current_code` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n        `dp_sub[p].add(current_code)`\n      For `l` from 1 to 4:\n        If `p - l >= 0`:\n          `suffix_code = \"\".join(S[start_idx + p - l + 1 : start_idx + p + 1])`\n          If `suffix_code` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n            For `prev_seq` in `dp_sub[p-l]`:\n              `dp_sub[p].add(prev_seq + suffix_code)`\n    `global_sequences.update(dp_sub[k - start_idx])`\n  `print(len(global_sequences) % MOD)`\n\nThis approach is correct in terms of counting distinct sequences.\nHowever, storing strings in a set and concatenating them repeatedly is too slow and memory-intensive.\nThe strings `prev_seq + suffix_code` can grow very long. The maximum length of `S` is 3000. If `S` is \"000...0\", a sequence could be \"A A A ... A\" where 'A' is \"0\". This sequence would have length 3000. Storing strings of length 3000 in a set is not feasible.\n\nSince we only need the count modulo $10^9 + 7$, this suggests we need to count without explicitly storing strings.\nThis means we need to count *distinct hash values* of these sequences.\nIf we use polynomial hashing, we can represent each sequence `L_1 ... L_p` by a pair of hash values `(h1, h2)` to minimize collisions.\n\nLet's use two hash functions:\n`hash_val = (char_code_1 * P^0 + char_code_2 * P^1 + ... ) % M`\nWe need to assign a unique integer code to each English letter (or its Morse code string).\nLet's map each of the 26 valid Morse code strings to an integer from 1 to 26.\n`MORSE_TO_INT = {code: i+1 for i, code in enumerate(VALID_CODES)}`\n\nNow, a sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` can be represented by a sequence of integers `int(M_1) int(M_2) ... int(M_p)`.\nWe can compute a polynomial hash for this integer sequence.\n`H(seq) = (int(M_1) * BASE^(p-1) + int(M_2) * BASE^(p-2) + ... + int(M_p) * BASE^0) % MOD`\n\nLet `global_hashes = set()` to store `(h1, h2)` pairs.\nWhen `S` grows to length `k` (0-indexed `0` to `k-1`):\n  `new_char = read_char()`\n  `S.append(new_char)`\n  For `start_idx` from `0` to `k`:\n    `dp_sub_hashes = [set() for _ in range(k - start_idx + 1)]`\n    For `p` from `0` to `k - start_idx`:\n      `current_code_str = \"\".join(S[start_idx : start_idx + p + 1])`\n      If `current_code_str` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n        `int_code = MORSE_TO_INT[current_code_str]`\n        `h1 = int_code % MOD1`\n        `h2 = int_code % MOD2`\n        `dp_sub_hashes[p].add((h1, h2))`\n      For `l` from 1 to 4:\n        If `p - l >= 0`:\n          `suffix_code_str = \"\".join(S[start_idx + p - l + 1 : start_idx + p + 1])`\n          If `suffix_code_str` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n            `int_suffix_code = MORSE_TO_INT[suffix_code_str]`\n            For `prev_h1, prev_h2` in `dp_sub_hashes[p-l]`:\n              `new_h1 = (prev_h1 * BASE1 + int_suffix_code) % MOD1`\n              `new_h2 = (prev_h2 * BASE2 + int_suffix_code) % MOD2`\n              `dp_sub_hashes[p].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n    `global_hashes.update(dp_sub_hashes[k - start_idx])`\n  `print(len(global_hashes) % MOD)`\n\nThis approach is correct and should be efficient enough.\nThe number of elements in `dp_sub_hashes[p]` can be at most `26^p`. This is too large.\n`dp_sub_hashes[p]` stores hashes of sequences that form `sub[0...p]`.\nThe maximum length of `sub` is `k+1 = 3000`. So `p` can be up to 2999.\nThe size of `dp_sub_hashes[p]` can be huge. E.g., for `S = \"0000...\"`, `VALID_CODES` contains \"0\".\n`dp_sub_hashes[0]` for \"0\" has hash for \"A\".\n`dp_sub_hashes[1]` for \"00\" has hash for \"AA\".\n`dp_sub_hashes[2]` for \"000\" has hash for \"AAA\".\n`dp_sub_hashes[3]` for \"0000\" has hash for \"AAAA\".\n`dp_sub_hashes[4]` for \"00000\" has hash for \"AAAAA\".\nThis is still only one sequence per `p`.\n\nBut if `S = \"0101\"`. `VALID_CODES` contains \"0\", \"1\", \"01\", \"10\".\n`sub = \"0101\"`\n`p=0`: \"0\" -> hash(\"A\")\n`p=1`: \"01\" -> hash(\"B\")\n         \"0\" + \"1\" -> hash(\"AC\") (if \"1\" maps to \"C\")\n         `dp_sub_hashes[1]` could have 2 hashes.\n`p=2`: \"010\" -> no single code.\n         \"01\" + \"0\" -> hash(\"BA\")\n         \"0\" + \"10\" -> hash(\"AD\") (if \"10\" maps to \"D\")\n         `dp_sub_hashes[2]` could have 2 hashes.\n`p=3`: \"0101\" -> no single code.\n         \"010\" + \"1\" -> hash(\"BA\" + \"C\")\n         \"01\" + \"01\" -> hash(\"BB\")\n         \"0\" + \"101\" -> no `101` code.\n         \"0\" + \"10\" + \"1\" -> hash(\"AD\" + \"C\")\n         `dp_sub_hashes[3]` could have 3 hashes.\n\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for a substring of length `L` is exponential in `L`.\nFor `L=3000`, this is too many. `dp_sub_hashes[p]` can contain up to `26^4` hashes if `p` is large enough, or `26 * 26 * ... * 26` hashes.\nThe total number of distinct sequences can be `26^1 + 26^2 + ... + 26^3000`. This is huge.\nThe maximum value of `m` is 3000.\nThe problem statement says: \"Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $10^9 + 7$.\"\nThis implies that the total count of distinct sequences itself can be very large, but the *number of distinct hash values* is what we need to count.\nThe size of `global_hashes` can be at most `MOD1 * MOD2`.\nThe number of elements in each `dp_sub_hashes[p]` can be at most `MOD1 * MOD2`.\n`MOD1` and `MOD2` are around `10^9`. So this is $10^{18}$ which is too large.\nThis means the number of distinct sequences is not that large. $M=3000$ implies that the number of distinct sequences is at most $M \\times \\text{max_seq_length_per_substring}$ or something similar.\nThe total number of sequences is limited by $26 \\times 4 \\times M^2$. No, this is not right.\n\nThe phrasing \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\"\nThe example output `1, 3, 7` for `S=\"1\"`, `S=\"11\"`, `S=\"111\"` is key.\n`S=\"1\"`: {\"T\"} -> 1\n`S=\"11\"`: {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"} -> 3\n`S=\"111\"`: {\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"} -> 7\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using *any* substring ending at index `i`.\nThis is exactly what the problem asks for, cumulative over all substrings.\nThis is a standard DP problem.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using `S[j...i]` for some `j <= i`.\nThis is still not right.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences whose Morse code representation *ends* at index `i` in `S`.\nThis is also not right.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to partition `S[0...i]` into valid Morse codes. This is for prefixes.\nThe problem is tricky because it's about *substrings*.\n\nLet `total_ans` be the answer after `k` appends.\nWhen `k+1`-th character is appended, `S` becomes `S_new`.\nThe new sequences are those which are formed by substrings `S_new[j...k]` for `0 <= j <= k`.\nLet `current_sequences_set` be a set of `(h1, h2)` pairs representing all distinct sequences found so far.\nWhen `S` grows to length `k` (0-indexed `0` to `k-1`):\n  `new_char = read_char()`\n  `S.append(new_char)`\n  `k_idx = len(S) - 1` (current last index)\n  `dp_at_k = [set() for _ in range(k_idx + 1)]`\n  `dp_at_k[j]` stores hash pairs for sequences that form `S[j...k_idx]`.\n  For `j` from `k_idx` down to `0`:\n    `sub = S[j...k_idx]` (this is `S[j:k_idx+1]`)\n    `p = len(sub) - 1` (relative index for `dp_at_k[j]`)\n    If `sub` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n      `int_code = MORSE_TO_INT[sub]`\n      `h1 = int_code % MOD1`\n      `h2 = int_code % MOD2`\n      `dp_at_k[j].add((h1, h2))`\n    For `l` from 1 to 4:\n      If `p - l >= 0`:\n        `suffix_code_str = \"\".join(S[j + p - l + 1 : j + p + 1])`\n        If `suffix_code_str` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n          `int_suffix_code = MORSE_TO_INT[suffix_code_str]`\n          For `prev_h1, prev_h2` in `dp_at_k[j]`: (this is `dp_at_k[j]` for `S[j...j+p-l]`)\n            `new_h1 = (prev_h1 * BASE1 + int_suffix_code) % MOD1`\n            `new_h2 = (prev_h2 * BASE2 + int_suffix_code) % MOD2`\n            `dp_at_k[j].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n  \nThis is incorrect. `dp_at_k[j]` should be sequences for `S[j...k_idx]`.\nThe inner loop `for p from 0 to k-start_idx` is for `S[start_idx...start_idx+p]`.\nLet's stick to the $O(M^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code})$ approach, but with hashing.\n\n`global_hashes = set()`\n`S = []`\n`MOD = 10**9 + 7`\n`BASE1 = 31` (or a larger prime for character codes)\n`BASE2 = 37`\n`MOD1 = 10**9 + 7`\n`MOD2 = 10**9 + 9`\n\n`VALID_CODES` set and `MORSE_TO_INT` dict.\nFor `i` from `0` to `m-1`:\n  `char = input()`\n  `S.append(char)`\n  `current_len = i + 1`\n  \n  For `start_idx` from `0` to `current_len - 1`:\n    `dp_sub_hashes = [set() for _ in range(current_len - start_idx)]`\n    For `p` from `0` to `current_len - 1 - start_idx`:\n      `end_idx = start_idx + p`\n      `current_code_str = \"\".join(S[start_idx : end_idx + 1])`\n      \n      If `current_code_str` in `VALID_CODES`:\n        `int_code = MORSE_TO_INT[current_code_str]`\n        `h1 = int_code % MOD1`\n        `h2 = int_code % MOD2`\n        `dp_sub_hashes[p].add((h1, h2))`\n      \n      For `l` from 1 to 4:\n        If `p - l >= 0`:\n          `suffix_start_idx = end_idx - l + 1`\n          `suffix_code_str = \"\".join(S[suffix_start_idx : end_idx + 1])`\n          If `suffix_code_str` in `VALID_CODES`:\n            `int_suffix_code = MORSE_TO_INT[suffix_code_str]`\n            For `prev_h1, prev_h2` in `dp_sub_hashes[p-l]`:\n              `new_h1 = (prev_h1 * BASE1 + int_suffix_code) % MOD1`\n              `new_h2 = (prev_h2 * BASE2 + int_suffix_code) % MOD2`\n              `dp_sub_hashes[p].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n    \n    `global_hashes.update(dp_sub_hashes[current_len - 1 - start_idx])`\n  \n  `print(len(global_hashes))`\n\nThis logic is correct. Let's analyze its complexity.\nOuter loop `i`: `m` iterations.\nSecond loop `start_idx`: `current_len` iterations (up to `m`).\nThird loop `p`: `current_len - start_idx` iterations (up to `m`).\nInside `p` loop:\n  `current_code_str` generation: $O(\\text{max_len_code})$ string join.\n  `VALID_CODES` lookup: $O(1)$ for hash set.\n  `dp_sub_hashes[p].add`: $O(1)$ for hash set.\n  Inner loop `l`: 4 iterations.\n    `suffix_code_str` generation: $O(\\text{max_len_code})$ string join.\n    `VALID_CODES` lookup: $O(1)$.\n    Loop `for prev_h1, prev_h2 in dp_sub_hashes[p-l]`:\n      This is the bottleneck. `dp_sub_hashes[p-l]` can contain many hashes.\n      The maximum number of distinct sequences for a substring of length `L` is `Fib(L+1)` if only length 1 codes are allowed, or more generally $C^L$.\n      The size of `dp_sub_hashes[p-l]` can be up to `MOD1 * MOD2` (if we don't care about collisions), or `26^4` for small `p`.\n      The actual number of distinct sequences for `S[start_idx...end_idx]` for `end_idx - start_idx + 1` up to `3000` is bounded by the problem's constraints.\n      The total number of distinct sequences is relatively small, as seen from the example.\n      Output for `m=5`: `1, 4, 10, 22, 43`.\n      Output for `m=9`: `1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 109, 213, 421, 833`.\n      These numbers are very small. Max is 833.\n      This means `dp_sub_hashes[p]` will never contain many elements.\n      The maximum number of distinct sequences generated for any substring of length 3000 is still small.\n      This is the key insight. The number of distinct sequences is not exponential in length, it is small.\n      So, the `for prev_h1, prev_h2 in dp_sub_hashes[p-l]` loop runs for a small number of elements.\n      Let `MAX_SEQUENCES_PER_SUBSTRING` be the max size of `dp_sub_hashes[p]`.\n      The complexity would be $O(M^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code} \\cdot \\text{MAX_SEQUENCES_PER_SUBSTRING})$.\n      If `MAX_SEQUENCES_PER_SUBSTRING` is around 1000 (from example), then $3000^2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1000 = 3.6 \\cdot 10^9$, which is too slow.\n\nThe problem states \"very easy question\". This implies a simpler DP.\nThe small numbers in the example output are a strong hint.\n`dp[i]` = number of distinct sequences that can be formed using substrings *ending exactly at index i*.\nThis is still not right.\nThe example output `1, 3, 7` suggests that `dp[k]` is the total count of distinct sequences after `k` appends.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by `S[0...i]`.\nThis is for prefixes.\nThe problem is about *any substring*.\n\nLet's re-read the example carefully:\n`S = \"111\"`\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nTotal 7 distinct sequences.\n\nThis is the set of all distinct sequences formed by *any* substring.\nThe `global_hashes` approach is correct in principle for this.\nThe only way for it to be efficient is if the number of hashes in `dp_sub_hashes[p]` (for a single substring) is very small.\nLet's re-examine `dp_sub_hashes[p]`. This set stores hashes of sequences that form `sub[0...p]`.\nIf `sub = \"111\"`, `start_idx = 0`.\n`p=0`: `sub[0]=\"1\"`. `dp_sub_hashes[0]` has hash of \"T\".\n`p=1`: `sub[0...1]=\"11\"`.\n  `current_code_str=\"11\"`. Valid. `dp_sub_hashes[1]` gets hash of \"M\".\n  `l=1`: `p-l=0`. `suffix=\"1\"`. Valid.\n    `prev_h` from `dp_sub_hashes[0]` (hash of \"T\").\n    `new_h` for \"T\" + \"T\" = \"TT\". `dp_sub_hashes[1]` gets hash of \"TT\".\n  So `dp_sub_hashes[1]` has hashes for \"M\", \"TT\". Size 2.\n`p=2`: `sub[0...2]=\"111\"`.\n  `current_code_str=\"111\"`. Valid. `dp_sub_hashes[2]` gets hash of \"O\".\n  `l=1`: `p-l=1`. `suffix=\"1\"`. Valid.\n    `prev_h` from `dp_sub_hashes[1]` (hashes of \"M\", \"TT\").\n    `new_h` for \"M\" + \"T\" = \"MT\". `dp_sub_hashes[2]` gets hash of \"MT\".\n    `new_h` for \"TT\" + \"T\" = \"TTT\". `dp_sub_sub[2]` gets hash of \"TTT\".\n  `l=2`: `p-l=0`. `suffix=\"11\"`. Valid.\n    `prev_h` from `dp_sub_hashes[0]` (hash of \"T\").\n    `new_h` for \"T\" + \"M\" = \"TM\". `dp_sub_hashes[2]` gets hash of \"TM\".\n  So `dp_sub_hashes[2]` has hashes for \"O\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", \"TM\". Size 4.\n\nThis matches the example. The number of sequences for `S[0...k-1]` is 1, 2, 4.\nThe total answer is the union of sequences from all substrings.\nFor `S=\"111\"`:\n`start_idx=0`, `sub=\"111\"`. `dp_sub_hashes[2]` has 4 hashes. Add to `global_hashes`. `global_hashes` size is 4.\n`start_idx=1`, `sub=\"11\"`. `dp_sub_hashes[1]` has 2 hashes (\"M\", \"TT\").\n  `global_hashes` already has \"M\", \"TT\" from \"111\" case (\"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", \"O\"). No, this is wrong.\n  \"M\" and \"TT\" are distinct from \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n  So `global_hashes` would become {hashes of \"O\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", \"TM\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. Size 6.\n`start_idx=2`, `sub=\"1\"`. `dp_sub_hashes[0]` has 1 hash (\"T\").\n  `global_hashes` would become {hashes of \"O\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", \"TM\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"T\"}. Size 7.\nThis matches the example.\n\nThe maximum size of `dp_sub_hashes[p]` is actually `2^p` for simple cases like \"111...\".\nFor `p=2999`, `2^2999` is too big.\nThe problem must have a property that limits the number of distinct sequences.\nThe total number of valid characters is 26.\nThe maximum length of `S` is 3000.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for `S` of length `k` is actually `26 * k * 4`? No.\nThe total number of distinct sequences is `m * (m+1) / 2 * (max_seq_len_per_substring)`.\n\nThe crucial observation must be that the number of sequences that can be formed by a substring `S[start_idx...end_idx]` is *small*.\nLet `N_s` be the number of distinct sequences for a substring `s`.\nThe total answer is `| union_{sub_s of S} {sequences for sub_s} |`.\nThe sum of `N_s` over all substrings `s` of `S` might be large, but the *union* is small.\n\nThe constraint `m <= 3000` strongly suggests an $O(m^2)$ solution.\nThe `dp_sub_hashes[p]` loop is the problem.\n`for prev_h1, prev_h2 in dp_sub_hashes[p-l]:`\nThis inner loop runs `len(dp_sub_hashes[p-l])` times.\nIf `len(dp_sub_hashes[p-l])` is always small (e.g., < 1000), then:\n$M \\times M \\times \\text{max_len_code} \\times \\text{small_number} = 3000^2 \\times 4 \\times 1000 = 3.6 \\times 10^{10}$ which is too slow.\nSmall number must be very small, like 1.\nIf `len(dp_sub_hashes[p-l])` is 1, then $3000^2 \\times 4 = 3.6 \\times 10^7$. This is acceptable.\nBut we saw for `S=\"11\"`, `dp_sub_hashes[1]` had 2 elements.\nFor `S=\"111\"`, `dp_sub_hashes[2]` had 4 elements.\nSo `len(dp_sub_hashes[p-l])` is not always 1. It seems to be $2^{p}$ for `S=\"1...1\"`.\n\nThe example output numbers are `1, 3, 7, 10, 22, 43, 51, 109, 213, 421, 833`.\nThese are `f(k)` where `f(k)` is the answer for `S` of length `k`.\n`f(1)=1`\n`f(2)=3`\n`f(3)=7`\n`f(4)=10` (from `1010` example output `22` for `m=4`, `S=\"1010\"`)\n`f(5)=43` (from `10101` example output `43` for `m=5`, `S=\"10101\"`)\n\nThe example `S=\"110001101\"`\n`k=1, S=\"1\"`, ans=1\n`k=2, S=\"11\"`, ans=3\n`k=3, S=\"110\"`, ans=10\n`k=4, S=\"1100\"`, ans=24\n`k=5, S=\"11000\"`, ans=51\n`k=6, S=\"110001\"`, ans=109\n`k=7, S=\"1100011\"`, ans=213\n`k=8, S=\"11000110\"`, ans=421\n`k=9, S=\"110001101\"`, ans=833\n\nThe total number of distinct sequences is indeed small (max 833 for `m=9`).\nThis means the `global_hashes` set will never contain more than about 1000 elements.\nAnd the `dp_sub_hashes[p]` sets for any specific substring will also be small.\nThe maximum size of `dp_sub_hashes[p]` for any `p` and any `start_idx` must be small.\nIf this is true, then the solution is $O(M^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code} \\cdot \\text{max_dp_sub_size})$.\nIf `max_dp_sub_size` is around 100, then $3000^2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 100 = 3.6 \\cdot 10^9$. Still too slow.\nIf `max_dp_sub_size` is around 10, then $3000^2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10 = 3.6 \\cdot 10^8$. This might pass. Python set operations are slower.\n\nLet's reconsider the `dp_at_k` formulation.\nLet `dp[j]` be the set of hashes of sequences that can be formed using `S[j...k_idx]` (where `k_idx` is the current last index of `S`).\nWhen we append `char` to `S`, `k_idx` becomes `len(S) - 1`.\nWe need to compute `dp[j]` for all `j` from `k_idx` down to `0`.\n`dp[k_idx]` (for substring `S[k_idx...k_idx]`):\n  `sub = S[k_idx]`\n  If `sub` is valid, `dp[k_idx].add(hash(MORSE_TO_INT[sub]))`.\nFor `j` from `k_idx-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[j]` (for substring `S[j...k_idx]`):\n  `current_prefix_str = S[j...k_idx]`\n  If `current_prefix_str` (length `k_idx-j+1`) is valid:\n    `dp[j].add(hash(MORSE_TO_INT[current_prefix_str]))`\n  For `l` from 1 to 4:\n    If `k_idx - j + 1 - l >= 0`: (i.e., `k_idx - l >= j`)\n      `suffix_str = S[k_idx - l + 1 ... k_idx]`\n      If `suffix_str` is valid:\n        `int_suffix_code = MORSE_TO_INT[suffix_str]`\n        For `prev_h1, prev_h2` in `dp[j]`: (this `dp[j]` would be for `S[j...k_idx-l]`)\n          `new_h1 = (prev_h1 * BASE1 + int_suffix_code) % MOD1`\n          `new_h2 = (prev_h2 * BASE2 + int_suffix_code) % MOD2`\n          `dp[j].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\nThis is still the same logic. The `dp[j]` here means `dp_sub_hashes[p]` from before, where `p = k_idx - j`.\n\nLet's check the constraints on the number of valid codes.\nLength 1: \"0\", \"1\" (2)\nLength 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" (4)\nLength 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\" (8)\nLength 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\" (12)\nTotal: 2+4+8+12 = 26.\nThe `VALID_CODES` set is correct.\n\nThe `MOD` for the final answer is $10^9 + 7$.

For `S=\"111\"`, it was `2^p`.\nThe difference is that \"1\" and \"11\" are valid. \"0\" and \"00\" are valid. \"000\" is valid. \"0000\" is valid.\nBut \"0011\" is not valid. \"0101\" is not valid. \"1110\" is not valid. \"1111\" is not valid.\nThe \"111\" example works because \"1\", \"11\", \"111\" are all valid.\nIf `S = \"1111\"`:\n`sub = \"1\"`: {\"T\"} (1)\n`sub = \"11\"`: {\"M\", \"TT\"} (2)\n`sub = \"111\"`: {\"O\", \"MT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\"} (4)\n`sub = \"1111\"`:\n  `current_code_str=\"1111\"`. Invalid.\n  `l=1`: `p-l=2`. `suffix=\"1\"`. Valid. `prev_h` from `dp_sub_hashes[2]` (4 hashes).\n    4 new sequences: \"OT\", \"MTT\", \"TMT\", \"TTTT\".\n  `l=2`: `p-l=1`. `suffix=\"11\"`. Valid. `prev_h` from `dp_sub_hashes[1]` (2 hashes).\n    2 new sequences: \"MTT\", \"TTM\".\n  `l=3`: `p-l=0`. `suffix=\"111\"`. Valid. `prev_h` from `dp_sub_hashes[0]` (1 hash).\n    1 new sequence: \"TOM\".\n  Total for \"1111\": {OT, MTT, TMT, TTTT, TTM, TOM}. Size 6. (MTT is repeated)\n  So, for \"1111\", `dp_sub_hashes[3]` has 6 elements.\nThe maximum size of `dp_sub_hashes[p]` is indeed small.\nIt's bounded by `26 * 26 * 26 * 26` (max 4 letters per sequence segment, but this is not right).\nThe number of sequences is limited because the length of the Morse code strings is at most 4.\nThis means for `S[j...k_idx]`, `dp[j]` can only be formed by concatenating `dp[j+1]`, `dp[j+2]`, `dp[j+3]`, `dp[j+4]` with appropriate suffix codes.\nThe maximum size of `dp[j]` is actually `max(size of dp[j+1] + 1, size of dp[j+2] + 1, size of dp[j+3] + 1, size of dp[j+4] + 1)`.\nThis recursive definition doesn't give a small bound.\n\nThe total number of sequences is bounded by `m * 26 * 4`. No.\nThe total number of distinct sequences is bounded by `m * 26 * 4^2`.\nThe number of distinct sequences might be small due to the specific set of invalid Morse codes.\nFor example, if \"0011\" is invalid, this might break certain paths.\n\nLet `N` be the maximum number of distinct sequences for any substring.\nThe $O(M^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code} \\cdot N)$ complexity becomes $3000^2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot N$.\nIf $N$ is around 100, $3.6 \\times 10^9$. If $N$ is around 10, $3.6 \\times 10^8$.\nFor Python, $3.6 \\times 10^8$ operations might be too slow. $10^7$ operations is usually the limit for 1-2 seconds.\nA factor of 36 is probably too much.\n\nLet's try to optimize the string slicing and `join`.\nInstead of `\"\".join(S[start_idx : end_idx + 1])`, we can use `S_str[start_idx : end_idx + 1]` where `S_str` is the current `S` as a string.\nThis changes string slice from `O(L)` to `O(L)`. No real change in complexity.\nThe `VALID_CODES` set lookups and `MORSE_TO_INT` dict lookups are `O(1)` on average.\nSet `add` operations are `O(1)` on average.\n\nThe only way for this to be $O(M^2)$ is if the number of elements in `dp_sub_hashes[p-l]` is effectively constant, say 1.\nBut we know it's not 1.\n\nMaybe the solution is not $O(M^2)$ per step.\nWhen `S` grows by one character, we only need to compute `dp_sub_hashes` for substrings ending at the new character.\n`S` has length `k`. New character at `S[k]`.\nSubstrings ending at `k`: `S[0...k]`, `S[1...k]`, ..., `S[k...k]`.\nFor each `j` from `0` to `k`:\n  Let `sub_j_k = S[j...k]`.\n  We need to compute the set of hashes for sequences forming `sub_j_k`.\n  Let `H_j_k` be this set.\n  `H_j_k` can be computed from `H_j_k-1` and the new character `S[k]`. No, this is not how it works.\n  `H_j_k` can be computed from `H_j_k-1` (sequences for `S[j...k-1]`) by appending a valid code `S[k]`.\n  And `H_j_k` can be computed from `H_j_k-2` (sequences for `S[j...k-2]`) by appending valid code `S[k-1...k]`.\n  And so on.\n  This is the `dp_sub_hashes` logic.\n\nLet `dp[j]` be the set of hashes of sequences that can be formed by `S[j...current_len-1]`.\nWhen `char` is appended, `current_len` becomes `current_len+1`.\nThe new `dp` array will have length `current_len+1`.\n`dp[current_len]` (for `S[current_len...current_len]`) is just `hash(MORSE_TO_INT[S[current_len]])` if `S[current_len]` is valid.\nFor `j` from `current_len-1` down to `0`:\n  `new_dp_j = set()`\n  `sub_str_from_j = S[j...current_len]`\n  If `sub_str_from_j` is valid (length `current_len-j+1`):\n    `new_dp_j.add(hash(MORSE_TO_INT[sub_str_from_j]))`\n  For `l` from 1 to 4:\n    If `current_len - l >= j`:\n      `suffix_str = S[current_len - l + 1 ... current_len]`\n      If `suffix_str` is valid:\n        `int_suffix_code = MORSE_TO_INT[suffix_str]`\n        For `h_prev` in `dp[j]`: (this `dp[j]` is for `S[j...current_len-l]`)\n          `new_h = (h_prev * BASE + int_suffix_code) % MOD`\n          `new_dp_j.add(new_h)`\n  `dp[j] = new_dp_j`\nThis is $O(M \\cdot \\text{max_len_code} \\cdot N)$ per step, where `N` is the max size of `dp[j]`.\nTotal $O(M^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code} \\cdot N)$.\nThis is the same complexity.\n\nThe problem is stated as \"very easy\". This usually implies a simple $O(M)$ or $O(M \\log M)$ or $O(M \\cdot \\text{small_constant})$ solution.\nThe `dp[i]` definition is usually for prefixes.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using `S[0...i]`.\n`dp[i] = dp[i-1]` (sequences from `S[0...i-1]`) + new sequences ending at `i`.\nNew sequences ending at `i`:\n  `S[j...i]` is a valid code `M_1`. Then `M_1` is a new sequence.\n  `S[j...i]` is `M_2 M_1`, where `M_1` is `S[k...i]` and `M_2` is `S[j...k-1]`.\nThis is exactly the `dp_sub_hashes` logic, but for the full prefix `S[0...i]`.\nLet `prefix_dp_hashes[i]` be the set of hashes of sequences that can be formed using `S[0...i]` as the *entire* concatenated Morse code string.\n`prefix_dp_hashes[i] = set()`\nFor `l` from 1 to 4:\n  If `i - l + 1 >= 0`:\n    `code_str = S[i-l+1...i]`\n    If `code_str` is valid:\n      `int_code = MORSE_TO_INT[code_str]`\n      If `l == i + 1`: (i.e., `S[0...i]` is `code_str`)\n        `prefix_dp_hashes[i].add(hash(int_code))`\n      Else:\n        For `prev_h` in `prefix_dp_hashes[i-l]`:\n          `new_h = (prev_h * BASE + int_code) % MOD`\n          `prefix_dp_hashes[i].add(new_h)`\n\nThis `prefix_dp_hashes[i]` will be a set of hashes for sequences that form `S[0...i]`.\nThe total answer is `| union_{0 <= i <= j <= k} {sequences for S[i...j]} |`.\nThis is still the `global_hashes` approach.\n\nThe constraint `m <= 3000` is very typical for $O(m^2)$ solutions.\nThe `len(dp_sub_hashes[p-l])` must be very small.\nLet's test this assumption. What is the maximum number of sequences for any substring?\nFor `S = \"000000000\"`, if \"0\" is 'A', \"00\" is 'B', \"000\" is 'C', \"0000\" is 'D'.\n`sub = \"0000\"`: {\"AAAA\", \"A B\", \"B A\", \"C A\", \"A C\", \"B B\", \"D\"}. 7 sequences.\nThis is not 1.\nThe maximum size of `dp_sub_hashes[p]` is indeed small.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for any substring of length at most 3000, using the 26 valid codes, might not exceed a few hundreds or thousands.\nIf `N_max` (max size of `dp_sub_hashes[p]`) is, say, 1000.\n$3000^2 \\times 4 \\times 1000 = 3.6 \\times 10^{10}$ operations.\nThis is too much for Python.\nA typical C++ solution would be $10^8$ operations per second. So $3.6 \\times 10^7$ is fine.\n\nThe only way for the $O(M^2 \\cdot \\text{max_len_code} \\cdot N)$ approach to pass is if `N` is very small, like 1 or 2, or if Python's set operations and hash calculations are extremely fast for small sets.\nThe example output for `m=9` is 833. This is the total number of distinct sequences.\nThe number of distinct sequences for a *single substring* is likely much smaller.\nFor \"1111\", we calculated 6 sequences.\nFor \"0000\", we calculated 7 sequences.\nFor \"0101\", \"0\" 'A', \"1\" 'B', \"01\" 'C', \"10\" 'D'.\n`sub = \"0101\"`\n`p=0`: \"0\" -> \"A\" (1)\n`p=1`: \"01\" -> \"C\", \"AB\" (2)\n`p=2`: \"010\" -> \"CB\", \"AD\" (2)\n`p=3`: \"0101\" -> \"CBA\", \"ADB\", \"CC\" (3)\nThe number of sequences per substring is indeed very small.\nLet's assume `N_max` is around 100. Then $3.6 \\times 10^8$ operations.\nThis might pass in Python if the constant factor is small.\nPython's string slicing and set operations are implemented in C, so they are relatively fast.\n\nLet's use a `tuple` for the Morse code representations in `VALID_CODES` and `MORSE_TO_INT` to make them hashable if needed (though strings are hashable).\nThe problem specifies \"very easy question\". This implies that the straightforward $O(M^2)$ approach (with the small constant factor from `max_len_code` and `N_max`) is intended.\n\nFinal check on the logic:\n`S` is built character by character.\n`global_hashes` stores all distinct sequence hashes found so far.\nAfter `k` appends, `S` has length `k`.\nWe iterate `start_idx` from `0` to `k-1`. For each `start_idx`, we consider substring `S[start_idx ... k-1]`.\nWe run a DP on this substring to find all sequences it can form.\n`dp_sub_hashes[p]` stores hashes of sequences for `S[start_idx ... start_idx+p]`.\nThis `dp_sub_hashes[p]` computation is correct.\nThen we `update` `global_hashes` with `dp_sub_hashes[current_len - 1 - start_idx]` (which is `dp_sub_hashes[last_idx_relative_to_sub]`).\nThis correctly gathers all distinct sequences for all substrings ending at the current `k-1` position.\nThe total `global_hashes` will contain all distinct sequences from *all* substrings of `S`.\n\nThis approach seems robust and correctly implements the problem statement. The only concern is performance, which hinges on the maximum number of distinct sequences for any substring. Given the \"very easy\" tag and `M=3000`, it's highly likely that this specific problem has a small `N_max`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define valid Morse codes and map them to integers for hashing\nVALID_MORSE_CODES_SET = {\n    \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\",\n    \"110\", \"111\", \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\",\n    \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\"\n}\n\n# Assign a unique integer to each valid Morse code for hashing\nMORSE_TO_INT = {code: i + 1 for i, code in enumerate(sorted(list(VALID_MORSE_CODES_SET)))}\n\n# Hashing parameters\nBASE1 = 31 # A prime number larger than max int_code (26)\nBASE2 = 37 # Another prime\nMOD1 = 1_000_000_007\nMOD2 = 1_000_000_009\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    current_s_list = []\n    global_hashes = set()\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        current_s_list.append(char)\n        \n        current_len = len(current_s_list)\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible start indices for substrings ending at current_len - 1\n        for start_idx in range(current_len):\n            # dp_sub_hashes[p] stores a set of (h1, h2) tuples\n            # representing distinct sequences for the substring S[start_idx : start_idx + p + 1]\n            dp_sub_hashes = [set() for _ in range(current_len - start_idx)]\n            \n            # Iterate over relative end index 'p' for the current substring S[start_idx : current_len]\n            # S[start_idx : start_idx + p + 1]\n            for p in range(current_len - start_idx):\n                end_idx = start_idx + p\n                \n                # Form the current code string\n                current_code_str = \"\".join(current_s_list[start_idx : end_idx + 1])\n                \n                # Case 1: The entire substring S[start_idx : end_idx + 1] is a single valid Morse code\n                if current_code_str in VALID_MORSE_CODES_SET:\n                    int_code = MORSE_TO_INT[current_code_str]\n                    h1 = int_code % MOD1\n                    h2 = int_code % MOD2\n                    dp_sub_hashes[p].add((h1, h2))\n                \n                # Case 2: The substring S[start_idx : end_idx + 1] is a concatenation of a sequence\n                # from S[start_idx : end_idx - l + 1] and a valid Morse code S[end_idx - l + 1 : end_idx + 1]\n                for l in range(1, 5): # Morse codes have length 1 to 4\n                    if p - l >= 0: # Check if there is a prefix part\n                        suffix_start_idx = end_idx - l + 1\n                        suffix_code_str = \"\".join(current_s_list[suffix_start_idx : end_idx + 1])\n                        \n                        if suffix_code_str in VALID_MORSE_CODES_SET:\n                            int_suffix_code = MORSE_TO_INT[suffix_code_str]\n                            \n                            # For each sequence hash from the prefix part S[start_idx : end_idx - l + 1]\n                            # (which corresponds to dp_sub_hashes[p-l])\n                            for prev_h1, prev_h2 in dp_sub_hashes[p - l]:\n                                # Compute hash for the new concatenated sequence\n                                new_h1 = (prev_h1 * BASE1 + int_suffix_code) % MOD1\n                                new_h2 = (prev_h2 * BASE2 + int_suffix_code) % MOD2\n                                dp_sub_hashes[p].add((new_h1, new_h2))\n            \n            # After computing all sequences for S[start_idx : current_len - 1],\n            # add them to the global set of all distinct sequences found so far.\n            # The last element of dp_sub_hashes corresponds to the full substring S[start_idx : current_len - 1]\n            global_hashes.update(dp_sub_hashes[current_len - 1 - start_idx])\n            \n        sys.stdout.write(str(len(global_hashes)) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
