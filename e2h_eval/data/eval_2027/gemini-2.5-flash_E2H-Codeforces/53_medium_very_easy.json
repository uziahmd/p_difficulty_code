    "thought": "**Analyzing the Longest Repeated Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so the task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The input string contains lowercase Latin letters and has a length of at most 100. Overlapping occurrences are allowed.\n\nThe plan is to use a brute-force approach. Since the string length is limited to 100, checking every possible substring isn't going to be too slow. The initial thought is to iterate through possible substring lengths, starting from the maximum possible length (N-1) down to 1. For each length, we'll check all substrings of that length and see if they occur at least twice. As soon as we find a substring that meets the criteria, its length will be the answer. If no such substring is found, the answer is 0.\n\nThe core of this is the \"count_overlapping\" function. Because occurrences can overlap, the simple `s.count()` method won't work, so it is necessary to manually check for them.\n\nThe algorithm is set up to read in a string, and from there to loop through possible substring lengths, and substrings of each length, counting overlapping occurrences. A refined algorithm ensures the efficient detection of substrings, by starting at the largest possible length. It iterates through each length and each possible substring, checking if the count of that substring is equal or greater than 2. If it is, the algorithm outputs the length and quits, given that it starts at the largest possible length. If none are found, the algorithm reports 0.\n\nThe revised algorithm also takes into account the potential overlapping occurrences. To find these occurrences, there is a revised check. The algorithm is going to loop through each possible substring, then loop again through the original string, checking if the current position, is equal to or great than 2. If it is, the found substring is the answer.\n\nBased on the nature of the problem, and given the small input size, even the brute-force approach with nested loops should be feasible. The code is structured to handle multiple test cases in the input, reading one string at a time. The code also accounts for empty strings, handling them gracefully. The output format is also as shown in the examples. The time complexity is estimated to be O(N^4), which, although not the most efficient, should still be acceptable given the string length constraint.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. The input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length is at most 100.\n\nGiven the small constraint on the string length (N <= 100), a brute-force approach is feasible. We want the *longest* such substring, so it's efficient to check possible lengths from largest to smallest.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the input string `s`. Let its length be `N`.\n2.  Define a helper function `count_overlapping(text, pattern)`:\n    *   This function counts how many times `pattern` appears in `text`, including overlapping occurrences.\n    *   It uses `text.find(pattern, start)` to find occurrences. After finding an occurrence at `start_index`, it continues the search from `start_index + 1` to allow for overlaps.\n3.  Iterate `length` from `N - 1` down to `1` (inclusive):\n    *   This loop checks for substrings of decreasing lengths. The first `length` for which we find a qualifying substring will be our answer.\n    *   For each `length`, iterate through all possible starting positions `i` for a substring of this `length`. `i` will range from `0` to `N - length`.\n    *   Extract the substring `substring = s[i : i + length]`.\n    *   Call `count_overlapping(s, substring)` to determine how many times this `substring` appears in the original string `s`.\n    *   If `count_overlapping(s, substring)` is `2` or more, it means we have found a substring of `length` that appears at least twice. Since we are iterating `length` from largest to smallest, this `length` is the longest possible. Print `length` and terminate the program.\n4.  If the loops complete without finding any substring that appears at least twice (i.e., no substring of length 1 or more qualified), it means the answer is `0`. Print `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (s = \"ababa\"):**\n\n*   `N = 5`.\n*   **`length = 4`**:\n    *   `i = 0`: `substring = \"abab\"`. `count_overlapping(\"ababa\", \"abab\")` returns 1.\n    *   `i = 1`: `substring = \"baba\"`. `count_overlapping(\"ababa\", \"baba\")` returns 1.\n*   **`length = 3`**:\n    *   `i = 0`: `substring = \"aba\"`.\n        *   `count_overlapping(\"ababa\", \"aba\")`:\n            *   `s.find(\"aba\", 0)` returns `0`. Count = 1. Next search from `start = 1`.\n            *   `s.find(\"aba\", 1)` returns `2`. Count = 2. Next search from `start = 3`.\n            *   `s.find(\"aba\", 3)` returns `-1`. Loop ends.\n        *   Returns 2.\n    *   Since `2 >= 2`, we found a substring (\"aba\") of length 3 that appears at least twice. This is the longest such substring. Print `3` and exit.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n*   The outer loop runs `N` times (for `length`).\n*   The inner loop runs `N` times (for `i`).\n*   Inside the inner loop:\n    *   Extracting `substring = s[i : i + length]` takes `O(length)` time.\n    *   The `count_overlapping` function:\n        *   The `while` loop runs at most `N` times (e.g., if `pattern` is a single character and `text` is all the same character).\n        *   Each call to `text.find(pattern, start)` takes `O((len(text) - start) * len(pattern))` in the worst case for a naive search, but Python's `str.find` is highly optimized and typically performs much better, closer to `O(len(text) - start + len(pattern))` on average.\n        *   Considering the total work done by `str.find` calls within `count_overlapping`, it effectively scans the string `s` for all occurrences of `substring`. The total complexity for `count_overlapping` is `O(N * length)`.\n*   Combining these, the total time complexity is roughly `N * N * (length + N * length)`, which simplifies to `O(N^3 * length)`. Since `length` can be up to `N`, the worst-case complexity is `O(N^4)`.\n*   For `N = 100`, `N^4 = 100^4 = 10^8`. While `10^8` operations can be slow in Python, string operations are implemented in C and are very fast. Given the problem is marked as \"very easy\", `O(N^4)` is likely the intended solution and should pass within typical time limits (1-2 seconds) for `N=100`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input string from standard input.\n    # .strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace, including the newline character.\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # Helper function to count overlapping occurrences of a pattern in a text.\n    def count_overlapping(text, pattern):\n        count = 0\n        start = 0\n        # Loop until no more occurrences are found\n        while True:\n            # Find the next occurrence of pattern starting from 'start'\n            start = text.find(pattern, start)\n            if start == -1:\n                # If find returns -1, no more occurrences were found\n                break\n            count += 1\n            # To find overlapping occurrences, we advance the search start position by 1.\n            # If we wanted non-overlapping occurrences, we would advance by len(pattern).\n            start += 1 \n        return count\n\n    # Iterate through possible substring lengths, from longest to shortest.\n    # N-1 is the maximum possible length (e.g., \"aaaa\" has \"aaa\" twice).\n    # 1 is the minimum possible length.\n    for length in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # Iterate through all possible starting positions for substrings of the current length.\n        # A substring of 'length' starting at 'i' ends at 'i + length - 1'.\n        # The last possible start index is n - length (e.g., for s=\"abc\", length=2,\n        # substrings are \"ab\" (i=0) and \"bc\" (i=1). n-length = 3-2 = 1.
