Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the X-Pattern Verification**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with creating a Python script to determine if an `n x n` grid forms an \"X\" shape.  The value of `n` is always odd and between 3 and 299, and the grid contains characters. My expertise tells me there's a neat, algorithmic approach to solve this.\n\nFirst, I need to define what constitutes a valid \"X\".  It boils down to three key conditions:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Consistency:** All the characters along *both* main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right, and top-right to bottom-left) must be identical.\n2.  **Off-Diagonal Consistency:**  All characters *not* on the diagonals must also be identical.\n3.  **Distinct Characters:** The character used for the diagonals must be different from the character used for the off-diagonal positions.\n\nI'm thinking I can represent the grid as a 2D list, `grid[row][col]`.  The diagonals are easy to identify: the main diagonal is where `row == col`, and the anti-diagonal is where `row + col == n - 1`.\n\nMy approach will be straightforward:\n\n1.  Read the value of `n`.\n2.  Read the grid input.\n3.  Identify a candidate diagonal character (`diag_char`).  I can safely pick `grid[0][0]` as it's always on the main diagonal.\n4.  Identify a candidate off-diagonal character (`other_char`). I can pick `grid[0][1]`. Since `n` is at least 3, this element can't be on either diagonal.\n5.  **Critical step:** Verify that `diag_char` and `other_char` are different.  If they're the same, it's immediately \"NO\".\n6.  Now, I'll iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid:\n    *   If the cell lies on a diagonal (`r == c` OR `r + c == n - 1`), check if its character matches `diag_char`.  If not, the pattern is invalid; it's a \"NO\".\n    *   If the cell *doesn't* lie on a diagonal, check if its character matches `other_char`. If not, it's a \"NO\".\n7.  If I can complete the entire iteration without finding any inconsistencies, that means the grid does indeed form an \"X\", and I'll output \"YES\".\n\nThat looks solid. Let me work through a quick example with `n = 3` and a sample grid, to ensure I'm getting the logic right.\n",
