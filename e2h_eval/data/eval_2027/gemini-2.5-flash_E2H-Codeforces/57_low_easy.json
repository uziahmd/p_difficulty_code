His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing and Minimizing Vasya's Rank**\n\nOkay, I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The goal is to figure out the absolute best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in this Olympiad. I'm given the number of participants, Vasya's minimum total score requirement, the first tour scores, and the second tour scores. All these scores are in arbitrary order, which is key to finding the optimal ranks.  The tie-breaking rule is the crucial detail here. Since the jury can assign places arbitrarily in case of ties, I can use that to my advantage.\n\nMy first thought is to understand the core of the problem. Vasya's score is a combination of his first and second tour scores, but I don't know which scores are his. I only know that the sum is at least `x`. My goal is to determine how to manipulate the pairings of the other participants to get Vasya the best and worst possible outcomes.\n\nFor the *best* rank, which is rank 1, I need to maximize Vasya's total score.  I want to make his score higher than everyone else's. I initially thought to simply pair the highest available scores. That would get the sum as high as possible. But then I realized I need to consider all possible pairings amongst the remaining scores. I need to get Vasya's score *at least* as high as everyone else's.\n\nIf I consider the two sorted lists of scores, then I can see that Vasya should ideally have `max(a) + max(b)` as his total score, if possible. If this is greater than or equal to `x`, then he can indeed *always* get the highest score.  Since tied scores are handled by the jury, this would guarantee his rank to be 1.  It is the optimal pairing, but I have to carefully consider the other `n-1` participants. I will work on it now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given his minimum total score `x` and the `n` scores from the first and second tours. The exact pairing of scores to participants is unknown.\n\n**Understanding the Ranking Rules:**\n*   Participants are sorted by the sum of points (highest sum gets first place).\n*   If multiple participants have the same total points, the jury can assign places arbitrarily among them. This means:\n    *   If Vasya has the highest score, he can always get 1st place.\n    *   If Vasya has a score `S` and `k` other people also have `S`, and no one has a score greater than `S`, Vasya could get any rank from 1st to `k+1`-th.\n    *   If Vasya has a score `S` and `k` people have scores strictly greater than `S`, and `m` people have score `S`, Vasya could get any rank from `k+1`-th to `k+m+1`-th.\n\n**1. Finding the Best Possible Rank:**\n\nTo achieve the best rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his own score and/or minimize the scores of others. Due to the tie-breaking rule, if Vasya can achieve a score `S_V` such that no other participant has a score strictly greater than `S_V`, he can be awarded 1st place.\n\nConsider the absolute maximum score Vasya could achieve: `max(a_i) + max(b_j)`. Let's say `a_max = max(a)` and `b_max = max(b)`. If `a_max + b_max >= x`, Vasya can claim these two scores. The remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` are then assigned to the other `n-1` participants. Even if some other participant ends up with `a_max + b_max` or a score very close to it, Vasya can still be placed 1st if his score is not strictly less than anyone else's highest score.\n\nThe simplest way for Vasya to get 1st place is if he can achieve a score `S_V` that is the highest among all participants. This is always possible. We just need to ensure that some `a_i` and `b_j` are assigned to Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. We can always pick the largest `a_i` and largest `b_j` (or any `a_i, b_j` that sum to `x` or more) for Vasya. The remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` from `b` are then paired up for the other participants. Regardless of how those `n-1` pairs sum up, Vasya can always be considered 1st among those with the maximum score.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank for Vasya is always **1**.\n\n**2. Finding the Worst Possible Rank:**\n\nTo find Vasya's worst rank, we need to:\n*   Minimize Vasya's total score (while still satisfying `S_V >= x`).\n*   Maximize the total scores of other participants.\n\nLet Vasya take some `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. The remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` are for the other `n-1` participants. To maximize the ranks of others (and thus worsen Vasya's rank), we should pair the remaining scores such that as many participants as possible get scores *higher than or equal to* Vasya's score.\n\nThis is a matching problem. We want to find a pairing of `a` and `b` scores (one `a_i` and one `b_j` for each participant) such that Vasya's rank is maximized. This means we want to maximize the number of people who score *strictly more* than Vasya, and then maximize the number of people who score *equal to* Vasya.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\n`a_sorted = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`\n`b_sorted = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`\n\nTo maximize the number of people who score higher than Vasya, we should try to give Vasya a relatively low score (but still `S_V >= x`), and give high scores to others.\n\nConsider pairing `a_i` with `b_{n-i+1}` (i.e., smallest `a` with largest `b`, second smallest `a` with second largest `b`, etc.). This strategy tends to equalize scores or create a spread where some scores are high and some are low.\n\nA more effective strategy to maximize others' scores is to sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. Then pair `a_i` with `b_i`. This is a greedy approach that attempts to maximize sums.\n`a_sorted = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` (ascending)\n`b_sorted_desc = [b_n, b_{n-1}, ..., b_1]` (descending)\nConsider `a_i + b_{n-i+1}` for all `i`. This is a common strategy to maximize the minimum sum, or sometimes to distribute sums efficiently.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful. Vasya is one of the participants. We need to find *one* `a_i` and *one* `b_j` for Vasya, and then pair the remaining `n-1` `a` scores with `n-1` `b` scores for the other participants.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's score to some `S_V = a_i + b_j` where `a_i + b_j >= x`. To make his rank worst, we want to maximize the number of other participants whose scores are `>= S_V`.\n\nThis can be rephrased: for each `a_k` in the first tour scores, we want to find a `b_l` in the second tour scores such that `a_k + b_l >= x`. If we can find such a `b_l`, then `a_k` and `b_l` could potentially be Vasya's scores. We want to find the minimum number of participants who *must* score strictly less than `x`.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nLet's sort `b` in ascending order: `b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n`.\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThis can be done using a two-pointer approach.\nInitialize a counter `count = 0`.\nUse two pointers: `ptr_a` starting at `0` (for `a_1`) and `ptr_b` starting at `n-1` (for `b_n`).\nWhile `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n    If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n        This means `a[ptr_a]` can be paired with `b[ptr_b]` to form a score of at least `x`. This pair can be assigned to *some* participant. We increment `count`, and move both pointers: `ptr_a` to `ptr_a + 1` (this `a` is used) and `ptr_b` to `ptr_b - 1` (this `b` is used).\n    Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`):\n        Since `a` is sorted ascending and `b` is sorted ascending, `a[ptr_a]` is the smallest available `a` score. If even pairing it with the largest available `b` score (`b[ptr_b]`) does not reach `x`, then `a[ptr_a]` cannot be paired with any of the remaining `b` scores to reach `x`. So, `a[ptr_a]` must be paired with some `b_k` such that `a[ptr_a] + b_k < x`. This `a[ptr_a]` will result in a score less than `x`. We \"use up\" `a[ptr_a]` by moving `ptr_a` to `ptr_a + 1`. This participant will definitely score less than `x`.\n\nThe `count` variable will give us the maximum number of participants who *can* achieve a score of at least `x`.\nVasya is one of these `count` participants. The remaining `n - count` participants will have scores strictly less than `x`.\nTo make Vasya's rank worst, we assume Vasya is among the `count` participants who score at least `x`, and he gets the lowest possible score among them. All `n - count` participants score less than `x`.\nAmong the `count` participants who score at least `x`, Vasya could be ranked last due to the jury's decision.\nSo, Vasya's worst rank would be `(n - count) + 1`.\n\nLet's verify this logic with an example:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]` -> sorted `a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]` -> sorted `b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n`ptr_a = 0` (`a[0]=3`), `ptr_b = 5` (`b[5]=8`), `count = 0`\n\n1.  `a[0] + b[5] = 3 + 8 = 11 >= 7`. `count = 1`. `ptr_a = 1`, `ptr_b = 4`.\n2.  `a[1] + b[4] = 4 + 6 = 10 >= 7`. `count = 2`. `ptr_a = 2`, `ptr_b = 3`.\n3.  `a[2] + b[3] = 4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 3`. `ptr_a = 3`, `ptr_b = 2`.\n4.  `a[3] + b[2] = 4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 4`. `ptr_a = 4`, `ptr_b = 1`.\n5.  `a[4] + b[1] = 5 + 3 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 5`. `ptr_a = 5`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n6.  `a[5] + b[0] = 6 + 0 = 6 < 7`. This pair cannot make `x`. `ptr_a = 6`.\nLoop ends because `ptr_a = 6` (which is `n`).\n\n`count = 5`.\nThis means 5 participants *can* score at least `x`. One of them is Vasya.\n1 participant *must* score less than `x`.\nIn the worst case for Vasya, the 1 participant scores less than `x`. Vasya is among the 5 who score at least `x`, and he is given the lowest rank among them.\nSo, Vasya's rank would be `(n - count) + 1 = (6 - 5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nWait, the example output is `1 5`. My calculation for worst case gives `2`. What's wrong?\n\nThe problem states: \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\"\nThis means if `k` participants have the highest score `S_max`, Vasya can be 1st. If `k` participants have score `S_max`, `m` participants have score `S_mid`, and `p` participants have `S_low`, and Vasya has `S_mid`, his worst rank could be `k + m`.\n\nLet's re-read the worst case scenario from the example:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\nWorst case scenario: Vasya gets 5th place if the table looks like that — `{4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}`, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\nTotal scores:\n`4+8 = 12`\n`4+6 = 10`\n`6+4 = 10`\n`5+4 = 9`\n`4+3 = 7` (Vasya's score)\n`3+0 = 3`\nSorted scores: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3`.\nVasya's score is 7.\nThere are 4 people with scores higher than 7 (12, 10, 10, 9).\nSo Vasya's rank is 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nMy `count` logic calculates the maximum number of people who *can* achieve `x` or more.\nIn the example: `count = 5`. These 5 people could be:\n`3+8=11`\n`4+6=10`\n`4+4=8`\n`4+4=8`\n`5+3=8`\nAnd `6+0=6` (this person scores less than `x`).\nIf Vasya is assigned `5+3=8`, his score is 8.\nThe other 4 people who can score >= x could be:\n`3+8=11`\n`4+6=10`\n`4+4=8`\n`4+4=8`\nAnd 1 person `6+0=6`.\nIf Vasya scores 8, and others score 11, 10, 8, 8, 6.\nSorted scores: `11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6`.\nVasya's score is 8. There are 2 people strictly above him (11, 10). There are 2 people equal to him.\nHis rank could be 2+1 = 3rd, or 2+2+1 = 5th.\nThe problem is that my `count` logic assumes we can perfectly assign `a_i` and `b_j` to maximize `count`. This is correct for `count`.\nHowever, to determine Vasya's worst rank, we need to consider *all possible pairings* for the other `n-1` participants, given Vasya's score.\n\nThe strategy for worst rank should be:\n1.  Vasya takes some `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n2.  The remaining `n-1` `a` scores and `n-1` `b` scores are paired up for the other `n-1` participants. To maximize Vasya's rank, we should pair them such that as many people as possible score *at least* Vasya's score.\n\nThis is exactly what the two-pointer approach does, but it does it for `x`. We need to do it for Vasya's score.\nThe key insight is that the two-pointer approach `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_V` counts how many pairs can achieve a sum of at least `S_V`.\nLet `a` be sorted ascending, `b` be sorted ascending.\nFor a fixed target score `S_target`, the number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= S_target` can be found using the two-pointer approach:\n`count_ge(S_target)`:\n    `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = n-1`, `count = 0`\n    while `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n        if `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_target`:\n            `count += 1`\n            `ptr_a += 1`\n            `ptr_b -= 1`\n        else:\n            `ptr_a += 1`\n    return `count`\n\nThis `count_ge(S_target)` function tells us the maximum number of participants that can achieve a score of at least `S_target`.\n\nWe know Vasya's score `S_V` must be at least `x`.\nTo find Vasya's worst rank, we want to maximize the number of people who score `S_other >= S_V`.\nThis is equivalent to finding the smallest `S_V` (where `S_V >= x`) such that `count_ge(S_V)` is maximized.\nNo, that's not quite right. We want to maximize `(n - count_ge(S_V)) + count_ge(S_V, excluding Vasya's score)`.\n\nLet `k = count_ge(x)`. This is the maximum number of participants that can achieve a score of at least `x`.\nVasya is one of these `k` participants.\nThe other `n-k` participants *must* score less than `x`.\nSo, Vasya's rank will be at least `(n-k) + 1`.\nIn the example: `count_ge(7) = 5`. So `(6-5)+1 = 2`. This is still not 5.\n\nThe crucial part is the jury decision: \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\"\nThis means if `P` people score `S_V` and `Q` people score `S_other > S_V`, Vasya's rank is `Q+1`.\nIf `P` people score `S_V` and `Q` people score `S_other > S_V`, and `R` people score `S_other < S_V`, Vasya's *worst* rank is `Q + P`.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's score `S_V = a_i + b_j` for some `i, j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nFor the remaining `n-1` participants, we need to pair the remaining `n-1` `a` scores and `n-1` `b` scores to maximize the number of people scoring `>= S_V`.\nThis is a standard maximum bipartite matching problem or a flow problem, but given `N=10^5`, that's too slow.\nThe two-pointer approach `count_ge(S_target)` correctly finds the maximum number of pairs that sum to at least `S_target`.\n\nThe problem is asking for the worst rank Vasya *could* have. This means we choose the pairing of all `n` participants (including Vasya) such that Vasya's rank is maximized.\nVasya's score is `S_V = a_i + b_j` for some `i, j` where `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThe other `n-1` participants get scores `S_k = a_p + b_q` for distinct `p, q` from the remaining indices.\nVasya's rank is `1 + (number of participants P such that S_P > S_V) + (number of participants P such that S_P = S_V AND jury places them before Vasya)`.\nTo maximize Vasya's rank, we want to maximize `(number of participants P such that S_P >= S_V)`.\n\nLet `a_sorted` be `a` sorted ascending, and `b_sorted` be `b` sorted ascending.\nWe are looking for a pairing `(a_{p_1}, b_{q_1}), ..., (a_{p_n}, b_{q_n})` (where `{p_i}` and `{q_i}` are permutations of `{1, ..., n}`) such that if Vasya is assigned `(a_{p_k}, b_{q_k})`, his rank is maximized.\n\nThe number of participants who score *at least* `S_target` can be found by `count_ge(S_target)`.\nIf `count_ge(S_target)` participants score at least `S_target`, then `n - count_ge(S_target)` participants score strictly less than `S_target`.\nIf Vasya scores `S_V`, and `count_ge(S_V)` participants (including Vasya) score at least `S_V`, then his worst rank would be `n - count_ge(S_V) + count_ge(S_V) = n`.\nNo, this is not right. If Vasya scores `S_V`, and `k` people score strictly more than `S_V`, and `m` people score exactly `S_V`, his worst rank is `k + m`.\nThe `count_ge(S_V)` is `k+m`. So his rank is `k+m`.\n\nLet `f(S)` be the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `S`. This is `count_ge(S)` using the two-pointer method.\nVasya's score `S_V` must be at least `x`.\nTo maximize Vasya's rank, we want to maximize `f(S_V)`.\nThe problem states \"It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x.\" This means `f(x) >= 1`.\nIf Vasya gets a score `S_V >= x`, then `f(S_V)` is the number of people who can score at least `S_V`.\nHis worst rank would be `f(S_V)`.\nWe need to find a pairing such that `S_V >= x` and `f(S_V)` is maximized.\nThis means we want to find the maximum possible value of `f(S_V)` for any `S_V >= x`.\nThe function `f(S)` is monotonically non-increasing. `f(S_1) >= f(S_2)` if `S_1 < S_2`.\nSo, to maximize `f(S_V)` for `S_V >= x`, we should pick `S_V = x`.\nThen `f(x)` is the maximum number of participants who can score at least `x`.\nIf `f(x)` participants score at least `x`, and Vasya is one of them, his worst rank among these `f(x)` participants is `f(x)`.\nSo, the worst rank is `f(x)`.\n\nLet's re-check the example:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n`f(7)` calculation (from above):\n1. `3+8=11 >= 7`. `count = 1`. `ptr_a=1, ptr_b=4`.\n2. `4+6=10 >= 7`. `count = 2`. `ptr_a=2, ptr_b=3`.\n3. `4+4=8 >= 7`. `count = 3`. `ptr_a=3, ptr_b=2`.\n4. `4+4=8 >= 7`. `count = 4`. `ptr_a=4, ptr_b=1`.\n5. `5+3=8 >= 7`. `count = 5`. `ptr_a=5, ptr_b=0`.\n6. `6+0=6 < 7`. `ptr_a=6`.\n`f(7) = 5`.\n\nSo, if my logic is correct, the worst rank is 5. This matches the example output!\n\nThe best rank is always 1.\nThe worst rank is `count_ge(x)`, where `count_ge(x)` is the maximum number of participants that can achieve a total score of at least `x`.\n\n**Algorithm for Worst Rank:**\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Initialize `count = 0`, `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = n-1`.\n4. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n    a. If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n        This pair can achieve at least `x`. Increment `count`. Move both pointers: `ptr_a++`, `ptr_b--`.\n    b. Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`):\n        The current `a[ptr_a]` (smallest available `a`) cannot make `x` even with `b[ptr_b]` (largest available `b`). So `a[ptr_a]` cannot be part of any pair that sums to `x` or more using the remaining `b` values. This `a[ptr_a]` must be paired with some `b_k` such that `a[ptr_a] + b_k < x`. So, this `a` score cannot contribute to a sum of `x` or more. Move `ptr_a++`.\n5. The `count` will be the maximum number of participants who can score at least `x`. This is Vasya's worst possible rank.\n\nThis approach works because it finds the maximum number of successful pairings. Each such successful pairing could be Vasya's or another participant's. If Vasya is one of these `count` participants, and all `count` participants score at least `x`, then the jury can decide to place Vasya last among them. The `n - count` participants who cannot score `x` or more will always be ranked below these `count` participants. So Vasya's worst rank is `count`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Sorting `a`: `O(N log N)`\n*   Sorting `b`: `O(N log N)`\n*   Two-pointer scan: `O(N)`\nTotal time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\nSpace complexity: `O(N)` for storing sorted arrays (or `O(1)` if sorting in-place and input is mutable).\n\nThis seems correct and fits within typical competitive programming limits for `N=10^5`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best possible rank is always 1.\n    # Vasya can always choose the highest available score from tour A and highest available score from tour B\n    # such that their sum is >= x.
