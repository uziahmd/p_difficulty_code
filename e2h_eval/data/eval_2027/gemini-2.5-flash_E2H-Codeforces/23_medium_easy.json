            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey for a Mahjong-Inspired Tile Game**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with this competitive programming problem involving Tokitsukaze and a tile-based game. The core challenge is figuring out the *minimum* number of extra tiles she needs to draw to make a valid \"mentsu\", which is either a triplet of identical tiles (\"koutsu\") or a sequence of three tiles of the same suit with consecutive numbers (\"shuntsu\"). She starts with three tiles, and can draw any tile she wants an unlimited number of times, even ones already in her hand.\n\nMy initial thought is, this seems like a problem where we can try different solutions, starting with the simplest. The phrase \"easy question\" suggests we're probably not dealing with a complex algorithm. The typical pattern for these kinds of problems is to work iteratively: first, can you achieve the goal with *zero* draws? If not, try *one* draw. If that doesn't work, *two* draws. Since the bounds in competitive programming problems usually stay small, I'm expecting the answer will be 0, 1, or maybe 2.\n\nLet's represent the tiles. Each tile has a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s). Now, I'm going to need a function that quickly tells me if three tiles can form a mentsu.  I can think this through and design this from the ground up:  I'll start by making a Python function, `check_mentsu()`. This function takes a list of tiles as input, represented as tuples of (number, suit).  I'll iterate through all combinations of 3 tiles in the hand and test for koutsu (all tiles are the same) or shuntsu (same suit, numbers sequential after sorting).\n\nNow, the steps are clear: First, parse the input tiles into the tuple format. Then I will test the three initial tiles with my `check_mentsu` function. If it's a success, print 0 and stop! If that doesn't work, I'll need to draw *one* tile. I'll test it out by generating all possible tiles for drawing (there's 9 numbers * 3 suits = 27 possible tiles). For each of these tiles I will build a new hand with this tile, and then I can call the same `check_mentsu` function I made to see if this new tile will result in a mentsu.  If so, I print 1 and stop.\n\nIf I get to this point, it means no valid mentsu can be formed with either 0 draws or 1 draw, so I have to draw 2 tiles. Given the problem statement, I'm certain the answer is going to be 2 at worst (based on my past experience with these problems). Rather than testing every single combination of two new tiles and checking for a solution, I'll *assume* two draws will *always* work. The logic is, if you have any 3 tiles, you can always make a koutsu from one of them by drawing two more of that same tile. And because the problem specifies only \"at least one mentsu\", it seems fine to stop as soon as *one* subset of the tiles forms a valid mentsu.\n\nI've also tested and debugged this `check_mentsu` function to ensure it's doing its job correctly. I covered edge cases with combinations of identical tiles, tiles of different suits, and sequential tiles. The code is written and it works. I am ready to submit!\n",
