Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Let's Tackle This \"Colored Boots\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Colored Boots\".  Basically, I have two lists of boots – left and right, both of length *n*.  Each boot has a color, and I need to figure out the maximum number of compatible pairs I can make. Compatible means the colors are either the same, or one or both of them are a wildcard, represented by '?'. The goal is to output the number of pairs and the indices of those pairs.\n\nThe input's pretty straightforward: *n* (the number of boots per leg), and the color strings for the left and right boots. The output needs to be the number of matched pairs and their indices.  The size of *n* is up to 150,000, which is important because it means I need to be efficient.\n\n**Thinking Through the Solution**\n\nMy first instinct is, this is a maximum matching problem, which often leads to using graph algorithms.  But with that *n* value, a general bipartite matching approach, like Hopcroft-Karp, is likely too slow.  I need something faster – a greedy approach or maybe a specialized flow algorithm.\n\nLet's dissect the compatibility rules. I can see there are four scenarios: exact matches (c, c), left wildcard (?, c), right wildcard (c, ?), and double wildcard (?, ?).  Here's the key: the '?' is super flexible. It can match with anything. Regular color boots are less flexible. So it is better to use the less flexible boots first.\n\n**A Greedy Approach Seems Promising**\n\nI'm thinking a greedy algorithm will work nicely.  Here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Exact Matches First:** I'll prioritize matching boots with the *exact* same color. So, 'a' with 'a', 'b' with 'b', and so on. These exact matches will be the least flexible as they are specific. To do this efficiently, I'll store the indices of each boot color using dictionaries/hashmaps. For each color, I will have a list of indices for left boots and another list for right boots.  I'll iterate through all the colors, and for each one, I'll match up boots of that specific color, one pair at a time.\n\n2.  **Wildcard Matches Next:** After I've exhausted all the exact matches, I'll be left with either:\n    *   Specific-colored boots that didn't find a match\n    *   '?' boots.\n\nI'll then match up the remaining specific-colored boots with any '?' boots.  A specific-colored boot can only match with a '?' boot.\nA '?' boot can match with any specific-colored boot. If there are still '?' boots remaining after that, I can pair them with each other.\n\nThis seems like a solid, efficient strategy.  I'll start by implementing this and see how it performs.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. A boot can be part of at most one pair. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are the same (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nWe need to output the maximum number of pairs and the 1-indexed indices of the boots forming these pairs.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The intuition behind the greedy strategy is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, thus leaving the more flexible boots ('?') available for later, when they might be needed to form pairs with otherwise unmatchable boots.\n\nHere's the greedy strategy:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices by Color:**\n    First, organize the boots. We can use lists of indices for each color. For example, `left_indices[color_code]` will store a list of 1-indexed indices of left boots with that specific color. Similarly for `right_indices`. We'll also need separate lists for `left_q_indices` (left boots with '?') and `right_q_indices` (right boots with '?').\n    A simple way to map colors 'a'-'z' to indices 0-25 is `ord(char) - ord('a')`.\n\n2.  **Match Specific Colors with Specific Colors:**\n    Iterate through all possible specific colors ('a' through 'z'). For each color `c`:\n    While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`:\n        Pop an index from `left_indices[c]` and an index from `right_indices[c]`. Form a pair and add it to our results.\n    This step uses up the most restrictive matches first.\n\n3.  **Match Remaining Specific Left Boots with Right Wildcards:**\n    After step 2, some specific-colored boots might still be unmatched.\n    Iterate through all specific colors `c` again:\n    While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right '?' boots (`right_q_indices` is not empty):\n        Pop an index from `left_indices[c]` and an index from `right_q_indices`. Form a pair and add it to our results.\n    This uses up specific left boots that couldn't find an exact match, pairing them with flexible right wildcards.\n\n4.  **Match Remaining Specific Right Boots with Left Wildcards:**\n    Similarly, iterate through all specific colors `c`:\n    While there are available right boots of color `c` AND available left '?' boots (`left_q_indices` is not empty):\n        Pop an index from `right_indices[c]` and an index from `left_q_indices`. Form a pair and add it to our results.\n    This uses up specific right boots that couldn't find an exact match, pairing them with flexible left wildcards.\n\n5.  **Match Remaining Wildcards with Wildcards:**\n    Finally, any remaining left '?' boots can be paired with any remaining right '?' boots.\n    While `left_q_indices` is not empty AND `right_q_indices` is not empty:\n        Pop an index from `left_q_indices` and an index from `right_q_indices`. Form a pair and add it to our results.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures we maximize the number of pairs because:\n- Exact matches (`c` with `c`) are prioritized, as they are the most restrictive.\n- Specific boots are then matched with wildcards, as specific boots are less flexible than wildcards.\n- Finally, wildcards are matched with wildcards, using up the most flexible boots. Any wildcard can match any other remaining boot, so matching them with each other is always optimal if no other specific match is possible.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 7`\n`l = abaca?b`\n`r = zabbbcc`\n\n1.  **Store Indices:**\n    `left_indices`: {'a': [1, 3, 5], 'b': [2, 7], 'c': [4]}\n    `left_q_indices`: [6]\n    `right_indices`: {'z': [1], 'a': [2], 'b': [3, 4], 'c': [5, 6, 7]}\n    `right_q_indices`: []\n\n2.  **Specific with Specific:**\n    - 'a': `left_indices['a']` has [1, 3, 5], `right_indices['a']` has [2].\n        - Pair (1, 2). `left_indices['a']` becomes [3, 5], `right_indices['a']` becomes [].\n        `pairs = [(1, 2)]`\n    - 'b': `left_indices['b']` has [2, 7], `right_indices['b']` has [3, 4].\n        - Pair (2, 3). `left_indices['b']` becomes [7], `right_indices['b']` becomes [4].\n        `pairs = [(1, 2), (2, 3)]`\n        - Pair (7, 4). `left_indices['b']` becomes [], `right_indices['b']` becomes [].\n        `pairs = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4)]`\n    - 'c': `left_indices['c']` has [4], `right_indices['c']` has [5, 6, 7].\n        - Pair (4, 5). `left_indices['c']` becomes [], `right_indices['c']` becomes [6, 7].\n        `pairs = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5)]`\n    - Other colors: No matches.\n\n    **After Step 2:**\n    `left_indices`: {'a': [3, 5], 'b': [], 'c': []} (only non-empty listed)\n    `left_q_indices`: [6]\n    `right_indices`: {'z': [1], 'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': [6, 7]}\n    `right_q_indices`: []\n    `pairs = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5)]`\n\n3.  **Specific Left with Right Wildcard:**\n    - `right_q_indices` is empty.
