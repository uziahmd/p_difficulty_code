Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need a Python script to solve this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. The core of it seems to be about finding the minimal radius of light from lanterns to illuminate a street.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We have a street that's a segment from 0 to `l`, and `n` lanterns at positions `a_i`. Each lantern has a light radius `d`, meaning it lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`. The goal is to find the minimum `d` such that the entire street is lit.\n\nThe key idea is to cover the entire street with these light segments. To do this efficiently, I need to consider the gaps and the edges.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking I'll approach it:\n\n1.  **Sort the Lanterns:** Ordering the lanterns by position (`a_i`) is crucial. This will make identifying gaps much easier.\n\n2.  **Handle Gaps Between Lanterns:** The distances between adjacent lanterns are the tricky part. For any two adjacent lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, I need to calculate the mid-point. To cover the gap, the radius `d` has to be at least half the distance between them: `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. The maximum of all these gap requirements will be a critical part of the solution.\n\n3.  **Handle the Street Ends:**\n    *   **Left End (0):** The first lantern must cover the left end of the street. This means the radius must be at least the position of the first lantern: `d >= a_1`.\n    *   **Right End (l):** Similarly, the last lantern must cover the right end.  Thus, `d >= l - a_n`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Requirements:** The final answer, `d`, has to satisfy *all* of these constraints simultaneously. So, I need to take the maximum of three values:\n    *   `a_1` (to cover the left end).\n    *   `l - a_n` (to cover the right end).\n    *   The maximum of all the `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` values (to cover the gaps).\n\nI'll put this into action with the sample case to solidify my strategy.\n",
