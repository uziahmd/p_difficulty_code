    "thought": "**The Core Insight: GCD and LCM Minimization**\n\nMy approach hinges on a key number theory observation: to minimize the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`, we must strategically control their greatest common divisor (GCD).  Since `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must divide the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, I can find the optimal `k` by considering divisors of `abs(b - a)`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal k**\n\nI iterate through all divisors, `d`, of `abs(b - a)`. For each `d`, I calculate the smallest non-negative `k` such that both `a+k` and `b+k` are divisible by `d`. This `k` is determined by finding the modular inverse, or `(-a) % d`. This ensures the GCD of `a+k` and `b+k` is at least `d`.\n\n**LCM Calculation and Best k Selection**\n\nFor each calculated `k`, I compute the actual LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` using `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)`.  I need to calculate the actual GCD of x=a+k and y=b+k. I then track the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k`. The final answer is the `k` that yielded the smallest LCM.  I also include logic to handle the case where `a == b` immediately returning `0`. I also carefully use the safe division to avoid integer overflow, though Python's large integers mean its not a big risk. Finally, I will return the lowest k that results in an optimal, lowest LCM.\n\nThis method explores all possibilities, guarantees the smallest non-negative `k`, and efficiently addresses the problem's constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If multiple `k` values result in the same minimum LCM, we should choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nA key property of the greatest common divisor (GCD) is that `gcd(X, Y)` must divide `abs(X - Y)`.\nIn our case, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must divide `abs((b+k) - (a+k))`, which simplifies to `abs(b - a)`.\nLet `diff = abs(b - a)`. This means that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `diff`.\n\nThis observation significantly limits the possible values for `gcd(a+k, b+k)`. Instead of searching for `k` directly, we can iterate through all possible values for `d = gcd(a+k, b+k)`, where `d` must be a divisor of `diff`.\n\nFor each divisor `d` of `diff`:\n1. We need to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` and `b+k` are both multiples of `d`.\n2. If `a+k` is a multiple of `d`, then `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod d`, which implies `k \\equiv -a \\pmod d`.\n3. The smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this condition is `k = (-a) % d`. (In Python, the `%` operator for negative numbers behaves as needed, e.g., `-6 % 4` is `2`).\n4. With this `k`, `a+k` is a multiple of `d`. Since `d` is a divisor of `diff = b-a`, `b-a` is also a multiple of `d`. Therefore, `b+k = (a+k) + (b-a)` will also be a multiple of `d`.\n5. So, for each divisor `d` of `diff`, we can calculate a `k` that ensures `d` divides both `a+k` and `b+k`. This `k` is a candidate for minimizing the LCM.\n6. For this `k`, we calculate `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. Then, we compute their actual GCD, `current_gcd = gcd(x, y)`. Note that `current_gcd` will be at least `d`, but could be larger.\n7. Finally, we calculate `current_lcm = (x // current_gcd) * y`. We use `(x // current_gcd) * y` to prevent potential intermediate overflow if `x * y` is very large, although Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this automatically.\n\nWe maintain `min_lcm_val` (initialized to infinity) and `best_k` (initialized to 0). For each `current_lcm` calculated:\n- If `current_lcm < min_lcm_val`, we update `min_lcm_val = current_lcm` and `best_k = k`.\n- If `current_lcm == min_lcm_val`, we update `best_k = min(best_k, k)` to ensure we pick the smallest `k`.\n\n**Special Case: `a == b`**\nIf `a == b`, then `diff = 0`. In this case, `lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k`, we must choose the smallest possible non-negative `k`, which is `0`. So, if `a == b`, the answer is `0`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Read integers `a` and `b`.\n2. If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n3. Calculate `diff = abs(b - a)`.\n4. Initialize `min_lcm_val = float('inf')` and `best_k = 0`.\n5. Find all divisors `d_val` of `diff`. We can do this efficiently by iterating `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(diff)`. If `i` divides `diff`, then both `i` and `diff // i` are divisors.\n6. For each `d_val` found:\n   a. Calculate `k = (-a) % d_val`.\n   b. Calculate `x = a + k` and `y = b + k`.\n   c. Calculate `current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)`.\n   d. Calculate `current_lcm = (x // current_gcd) * y`.\n   e. Compare `current_lcm` with `min_lcm_val` and update `min_lcm_val` and `best_k` according to the rules (smallest `k` for ties).\n7. Print `best_k`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- `a, b` are up to `10^9`, so `diff` can be up to `10^9 - 1`.\n- Finding divisors takes `O(sqrt(diff))` time. `sqrt(10^9)` is approximately `31622`.\n- For each divisor, `math.gcd` takes `O(log(max(x, y)))` time. `max(x, y)` can be up to `2 * 10^9`. `log(2 * 10^9)` is approximately `31`.\n- The total time complexity is roughly `O(sqrt(diff) * log(max(a, b)))`, which is well within typical time limits (`31622 * 2 * 31` operations, roughly `2 * 10^6` operations).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # If a and b are equal, then a+k and b+k are always equal.\n    # lcm(X, X) = X.
