Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition & Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Amusing Joke\" problem.  My initial thought is to break it down.  I have three strings: a guest's name, a host's name, and a pile of letters.  The core challenge is to figure out if the pile contains *exactly* the letters from the guest and host names, no more, no less.  Essentially, it's a multiset comparison.  I need to check if the character counts in the combined guest and host names perfectly match the character counts in the pile.\n\n**Conceptual Approach**\n\nThe simplest way I see to handle this is to count character frequencies. I can first concatenate the guest and host names, creating a \"combined\" string.  Then, I'll need to count the occurrence of each letter (A-Z, assuming uppercase) in *both* the combined name string and the pile string.  If, for any letter, the counts don't match, it's a \"NO\".  If all counts align, it's a \"YES\".  I'll store these counts, probably in dictionaries or maybe even arrays if the problem is restricted to uppercase letters only, given my knowledge of space and time complexities.\n\n**Handling Lengths & Edge Cases**\n\nBefore diving into the counting, I need a quick sanity check.  If the combined name string has a different length than the pile string, I can immediately conclude it's a \"NO\". No matter how the letters are arranged, it can't be a perfect match if the totals differ.\n\n**Alternative Method & Optimization**\n\nAn alternative, slightly less efficient, approach I can consider is to sort both the concatenated name and the pile string. Then, a simple comparison should suffice. However, this is likely to add an `O(n log n)` complexity whereas the dictionary or frequency count methods, where `n` is the length of the string, would be O(n). Sorting is probably the less optimal route.\n",
