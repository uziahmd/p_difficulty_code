Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Flawed Flow Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and here's how I'm thinking about it.  We've got this directed graph we need to build, with some tricky flow constraints.  The main goal is to orient the edges of the graph such that flow is conserved at all the intermediate nodes (not source or sink), there are no cycles, and the source has only outgoing edges. We are given the flow on each edge.\n\n**Key Constraints and Implications**\n\nFirst, flow conservation is standard, but the no-cycles part is critical. If we can topologically sort the nodes, that means all the flow effectively moves \"forward\" in a clear direction.  Vertex 1 (the source) must be the start of this topological order because it can't receive any flow. The problem says `n` is a sink, so I'm assuming all the flow needs to end up there, meaning `n` shouldn't have any outgoing edges. We have `net_flow[1] = -F`, `net_flow[n] = F`, and `net_flow[v] = 0` for all other vertices.\n\nThe no-cycles constraint is the hardest to keep track of, but also the most important. I figure the problem can be solved by making sure the directed edges follow a certain order. Thinking about the net flow for each node, I see the following things:\n\n*   For any intermediate node (`1 < v < n`), we need the same amount of flow in as out.\n*   The source needs to have all the flow leaving it.\n*   The sink needs to have all the flow arriving to it.\n\n**Developing a Strategy**\n\nThe constraint \"vertex 1 has no incoming edges\" has a very direct implication: any edge connected to vertex 1 must be directed away from it. This fixes the directions of some edges immediately. I can set the directions based on that rule. I can also maintain, for each node, a `balance` value that tells us the amount of net flow it *still* needs to send or receive.\n\nLet's assume the sum of the flow leaving 1 will become the \"total\" flow F.\n\nLet's have `current_inflow_sum[v]` and `current_outflow_sum[v]` for all nodes.  For any node `v` (other than the source or sink), we need `current_inflow_sum[v] == current_outflow_sum[v]`. This also implies that `degree_val[v]` has to be an even number. This condition guarantees an easy way of balancing flow at `v`.\n\nTo make the algorithm more efficient, I can use a queue and put any intermediate node into the queue only when `current_inflow[v] == sum_incident_flows[v] / 2`. The only vertices in the queue will have remaining edges whose directions can easily be determined.\n\nFor all intermediate nodes, this means for the node `v`, it will need half the incident edges to be incoming and the other half to be outgoing.\n\nSo, for any `(a, b)` edge with flow `c`:\n*   If `a == 1`, the edge is directed `1 -> b`.\n*   If `b == 1`, the edge is directed `a -> 1`.\n*   Else for other intermediate vertices we need to check if we can direct an edge `u -> v` to balance out its `demand`.\n\nThe main idea is to start with source/sink logic and then iteratively work towards achieving balance for other nodes. I will also have an array called `ans` that stores directions for all edges: `ans[i] = 0` means `a_i -> b_i` while `ans[i] = 1` means `b_i -> a_i`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct each edge in an undirected graph, given its flow volume, such that three conditions are met:\n1.  **Flow Conservation:** For every intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the sum of incoming flow equals the sum of outgoing flow.\n2.  **Source Constraint:** Vertex 1 (source) has no incoming edges.\n3.  **Acyclicity:** The resulting directed graph must not contain any cycles.\n\nWe are guaranteed that a solution always exists.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n**Condition 2 (Source Constraint):** Vertex 1 having no incoming edges means that any edge connected to vertex 1, say `(1, x)` with flow `c`, must be directed `1 -> x`. This immediately determines the direction of all edges incident to the source.\n\n**Condition 1 (Flow Conservation) and Condition 3 (Acyclicity):**\nFor any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the total flow entering `v` must equal the total flow leaving `v`. Let `total_incident_flow[v]` be the sum of flow volumes of all edges connected to `v`. If `v` is an intermediate vertex, then `total_incident_flow[v]` is the sum of incoming and outgoing flows. Since incoming flow must equal outgoing flow, each must be exactly `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`. This implies that `total_incident_flow[v]` must be an even number for all `1 < v < n`. The problem guarantees a solution, so this property must hold.\n\nThis observation is key: for any intermediate vertex `v`, we know exactly how much flow must enter `v` (`target_inflow[v] = total_incident_flow[v] / 2`) and how much must leave `v` (`target_outflow[v] = total_incident_flow[v] / 2`).\n\nWe can use a queue-based approach similar to Kahn's algorithm for topological sort. The idea is to direct edges greedily based on the flow conservation requirements.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Store edges with their original indices `(u, v, c, edge_idx)`.\n    *   Create an adjacency list `adj[v]` for each vertex `v`, storing `(neighbor, flow, edge_idx)` for each incident edge.\n    *   Initialize `ans` array of size `m` with -1 to store the direction for each edge.\n    *   Calculate `total_incident_flow[v]` for all `v` by summing up flow volumes of all edges incident to `v`.\n    *   Initialize `current_inflow[v] = 0` for all `v`. This will track the *actual* incoming flow for `v` from already directed edges.\n    *   Initialize a queue `q`.\n\n2.  **Process Source (Vertex 1):**\n    *   For every edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)` where `u=1` or `v=1`:\n        *   If `u=1`, direct `1 -> v`. Set `ans[edge_idx] = 0`.\n        *   If `v=1`, direct `1 -> u`. Set `ans[edge_idx] = 1`.\n        *   In either case, update `current_inflow[neighbor] += c` (where `neighbor` is the vertex other than 1).\n        *   If `neighbor` is an intermediate vertex (`1 < neighbor < n`) and `current_inflow[neighbor]` has reached its `target_inflow[neighbor]` (`total_incident_flow[neighbor] / 2`), add `neighbor` to the queue `q`.\n\n3.  **Process Sink (Vertex n):**\n    *   The sink vertex `n` is special. It accumulates all the flow. It does not have a `target_inflow` of `total_incident_flow[n] / 2`. Instead, it should receive the total flow from the source. It is usually assumed to have no outgoing edges in a max-flow context. The acyclicity constraint combined with `n` being a sink implies that any edge `(u, n)` must be directed `u -> n`.\n    *   We don't initialize `n` in the queue based on `current_inflow[n] == target_inflow[n]`. Instead, we'll let the flow \"drain\" towards `n`.\n\n4.  **Queue Processing:**\n    *   While the queue `q` is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue a vertex `u`.\n        *   Since `current_inflow[u]` has reached `target_inflow[u]`, all remaining undirected edges incident to `u` must be directed *out* of `u` to satisfy `total_outflow[u] = target_outflow[u]`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` via edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)`:\n            *   If `ans[edge_idx]` is still -1 (meaning this edge hasn't been directed yet):\n                *   Determine direction: if original edge was `(u, v)`, `u -> v` means `ans[edge_idx] = 0`. If original edge was `(v, u)`, `u -> v` means `ans[edge_idx] = 1`.\n                *   Update `current_inflow[v] += c`.\n                *   If `v` is an intermediate vertex (`1 < v < n`) and `current_inflow[v]` has now reached `target_inflow[v]`, add `v` to the queue `q`.\n\n5.  **Output:** Print the values in the `ans` array.\n\nThis approach ensures acyclicity because we only direct edges *out* of a vertex `u` once its incoming flow requirement is met. This implies `u` comes before its newly directed neighbors in a topological sort. Vertex 1 starts the process, and flow propagates, eventually reaching `n`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`N=3, M=3`\nEdges:\ne0: (3, 2, 10)\ne1: (1, 2, 10)\ne2: (3, 1, 5)\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    `adj = {1: [(2,10,1), (3,5,2)], 2: [(3,10,0), (1,10,1)], 3: [(2,10,0), (1,5,2)]}`\n    `ans = [-1, -1, -1]`\n    `total_incident_flow = [0, 15, 20, 15]` (for v=0,1,2,3)\n    `target_inflow = [0, 0, 10, 0]` (v=2 needs 20/2=10 incoming)\n    `current_inflow = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    `q = deque()`\n\n2.  **Process Source (Vertex 1):**\n    *   Edge e1: (1, 2, 10). Original `(1,2)`. Direct `1 -> 2`. `ans[1] = 0`.\n        `current_inflow[2] += 10`. `current_inflow = [0,0,10,0]`.\n        `current_inflow[2]` (10) == `target_inflow[2]` (10). Add `2` to `q`. `q = [2]`.\n    *   Edge e2: (3, 1, 5). Original `(3,1)`. Direct `1 -> 3`. `ans[2] = 1` (since `b_i=1`, `1 -> a_i` implies `1 -> 3`).\n        `current_inflow[3] += 5`. `current_inflow = [0,0,10,5]`.\n        `3` is the sink, not an intermediate node, so don't check `target_inflow`.\n\n3.  **Queue Processing:**\n    *   Dequeue `u = 2`.\n    *   `current_inflow[2]` (10) equals `target_inflow[2]` (10). All remaining edges from `2` must be outgoing.\n    *   Neighbor of 2: `3` via edge e0 (flow 10). `ans[0]` is -1.\n        Original edge e0: `(3, 2)`. We need `2 -> 3`. So `ans[0] = 1` (since `a_i=3, b_i=2`, `b_i -> a_i` means `2 -> 3`).\n        `current_inflow[3] += 10`. `current_inflow = [0,0,10,15]`.\n        `3` is the sink, not an intermediate node.\n\n    *   Queue is empty.\n\n4.  **Output:** `ans = [1, 0, 1]`. This matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Store edges with their original indices\n    # edges[i] = (u, v, c) for the i-th edge\n    edges_info = []\n    # Adjacency list: adj[u] stores (neighbor, flow, edge_idx)\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges_info.append((u, v, c))\n        adj[u].append((v, c, i))\n        adj[v].append((u, c, i))\n\n    # ans[i] will store 0 if edges_info[i] is u -> v, 1 if v -> u\n    ans = [-1] * m\n\n    # total_incident_flow[v] stores the sum of flow volumes of all edges incident to v\n    total_incident_flow = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for u, v, c in edges_info:\n        total_incident_flow[u] += c\n        total_incident_flow[v] += c\n\n    # current_inflow[v] tracks the sum of flow volumes of edges directed INTO v\n    current_inflow = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Queue for vertices whose incoming flow requirement is met\n    q = collections.deque()\n\n    # Process edges connected to the source (vertex 1)\n    # All edges incident to 1 must be directed OUT of 1\n    for neighbor, flow, edge_idx in adj[1]:\n        if ans[edge_idx] == -1: # Ensure each edge is processed once\n            u_orig, v_orig, _ = edges_info[edge_idx]\n            \n            # Determine direction: 1 -> neighbor\n            if u_orig == 1:\n                ans[edge_idx] = 0  # u_orig -> v_orig means 1 -> neighbor\n            else: # v_orig == 1\n                ans[edge_idx] = 1  # v_orig -> u_orig means 1 -> neighbor\n\n            current_inflow[neighbor] += flow\n\n            # If neighbor is an intermediate vertex and its incoming flow requirement is met\n            # The target incoming flow for an intermediate vertex v is total_incident_flow[v] / 2\n            if 1 < neighbor < n and current_inflow[neighbor] == total_incident_flow[neighbor] // 2:\n                q.append(neighbor)\n\n    # Process vertices from the queue\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n\n        # For vertex u, its incoming flow requirement is met.\n        # So, all remaining undirected edges incident to u must be directed OUT of u.\n        for neighbor, flow, edge_idx in adj[u]:\n            if ans[edge_idx] == -1: # If this edge hasn't been directed yet\n                u_orig, v_orig, _ = edges_info[edge_idx]\n                \n                # Determine direction: u -> neighbor\n                if u_orig == u:\n                    ans[edge_idx] = 0  # u_orig -> v_orig means u -> neighbor\n                else: # v_orig == u\n                    ans[edge_idx] = 1  # v_orig -> u_orig means u -> neighbor\n                \n                current_inflow[neighbor] += flow\n\n                # If neighbor is an intermediate vertex and its incoming flow requirement is met\n                if 1 < neighbor < n and current_inflow[neighbor] == total_incident_flow[neighbor] // 2:\n                    q.append(neighbor)\n\n    # Print the results\n    for direction in ans:\n        sys.stdout.write(str(direction) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
