There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Games in a Tennis Tournament: A Python Script Mindset**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this \"Tennis Championship\" problem and how to approach it with a Python script. The core challenge is maximizing the games played by the winner of a knockout tournament, given this specific rule about game differences between players.  It’s making me think about optimal tournament structures.\n\nMy initial thought is to formalize the problem. We have `n` players, and the rule is that two players can only compete if the absolute difference in their number of wins is at most one.  We can represent the state of the tournament with a distribution: `P(k)` where `k` is the number of wins, and `P(k)` is the count of players with those wins.  Initially, `P(0)` is `n`, and everything else is zero.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of \"funneling\" players.  I want to understand the maximum number of players we can \"funnel\" into a single winner who has played a certain number of games. Let's call this the \"winner\", and its number of games played `k`.\n\nThinking about the logic of the game, if the winner, `W`, has won `k` games, their next opponent can have won `k-1` or `k` games. So the key is tracking this kind of flow of players. It seems like the state of the tournament is important. I'm going to have to track how wins spread to different players.\n\nSo I need to find `f(k)`, the maximum number of players that can lead to a winner with `k` games. And if `N(k)` is the minimum number of players necessary for a winner with `k` games, how is that related to `f(k)`?\n\nSo, how do I actually build this in Python? It seems like I'll need to simulate the tournament, making sure to follow the rule. I could model the tournament state, update it after each game, and keep track of the winner's game count. I could use a loop and some conditional statements to manage the \"funneling\" process.  I'm envisioning a data structure to store this tournament state, maybe a dictionary or a list to represent the game counts of the remaining players. I think a dynamic programming approach might be useful here because the winner's game count depends on all previous steps.\n\nLet's start by sketching out how to model the state and the game logic. Then, I can focus on building up a function that maximizes the winner's games for a given number of initial players. I'm excited to figure out a clear mathematical relationship between the number of initial players and the maximum number of games the winner can play!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\nInitially, a player has played 0 games. To win 1 game, a player must play against another player who has played 0 games. So, 2 players are needed for a winner to play 1 game.\n`f(0) = 1` (a player who has played 0 games)\n`f(1) = 2` (Player A (0 games) vs Player B (0 games). Winner plays 1 game.)\n\nNow, consider a winner who has played `k` games. To play their `(k+1)`-th game, this player (let's call them `W`) must play against another player (`X`).\n`W` has played `k` games. According to the rule, `X` must have played `k-1` or `k` games.\n\nTo maximize the games played by the ultimate winner, we want to ensure `W` always plays against the \"strongest\" possible opponent that satisfies the rule, which means an opponent who has also played many games. This strategy helps to conserve players for later rounds.\n\nLet's assume `W` (who has played `k` games) always plays against `X` who has played `k-1` games. This is the most \"efficient\" way to advance `W` because `X` requires fewer initial players to produce.\nTo produce `W` (who has played `k` games), we need `f(k)` players.\nTo produce `X` (who has played `k-1` games), we need `f(k-1)` players.\nWhen `W` plays `X`, `W` wins and now has `k+1` games played. The total number of players required for this `k+1` game winner is `f(k) + f(k-1)`.\nSo, `f(k+1) = f(k) + f(k-1)`.\n\nThis is the recurrence relation for Fibonacci numbers.\nLet's re-index:\n`F_0 = 1` (1 player who has played 0 games)\n`F_1 = 2` (2 players to get a winner who has played 1 game)\n`F_2 = F_1 + F_0 = 2 + 1 = 3` (3 players to get a winner who has played 2 games)\n`F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 3 + 2 = 5` (5 players to get a winner who has played 3 games)\n`F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = 5 + 3 = 8` (8 players to get a winner who has played 4 games)\n...\n`F_k` is the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games.\n\nThe sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` corresponds to `Fib(k+2)` where `Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, ...`.\nSo, `f(k) = Fib(k+2)`.\nFor example:\n`f(0) = Fib(2) = 1` (This is not quite right if we think about 1 player being a winner without playing, but it works for the recurrence. Let's adjust the base cases to match standard Fibonacci definitions.)\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games.\n`dp[0] = 1` (A player who has played 0 games)\n`dp[1] = 2` (Two players, P1(0) vs P2(0), winner plays 1 game)\n\nFor a winner to play `k` games, they must have won `k-1` games and then played their `k`-th game.\nTo maximize the number of games played by the ultimate winner, we want to use the minimum number of players for each intermediate winner.\nThe ultimate winner (`W`) plays their `k`-th game. They had `k-1` wins. Their opponent (`X`) must have `k-1` or `k-2` wins.\nTo minimize the total players, `X` should have `k-2` wins.\nSo, `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`.\n\nLet's list the sequence `dp[k]`:\n`dp[0] = 1` (1 player, 0 games played)\n`dp[1] = 2` (2 players, 1 game played by winner)\n`dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3` (3 players, 2 games played by winner)\n`dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5` (5 players, 3 games played by winner)\n`dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5 + 3 = 8` (8 players, 4 games played by winner)\n\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` are Fibonacci numbers shifted. If `F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, F_5=8, ...` then `dp[k] = F_k+1`.\nOr, if `Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, ...` then `dp[k] = Fib(k+2)`.\n\nWe are given `n` players and want to find the maximum `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`.\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `Fib(k+2) <= n`.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n\nExample walkthrough:\n`n = 2`:\n`dp[0] = 1`\n`dp[1] = 2`\nSince `dp[1] <= 2`, the maximum `k` is 1. Output: 1.\n\n`n = 3`:\n`dp[0] = 1`\n`dp[1] = 2`\n`dp[2] = 3`\nSince `dp[2] <= 3`, the maximum `k` is 2. Output: 2.\n\n`n = 4`:\n`dp[0] = 1`\n`dp[1] = 2`\n`dp[2] = 3`\n`dp[3] = 5`\nSince `dp[2] <= 4` but `dp[3] > 4`, the maximum `k` is 2. Output: 2.\n\n`n = 10`:\n`dp[0] = 1`\n`dp[1] = 2`\n`dp[2] = 3`\n`dp[3] = 5`\n`dp[4] = 8`\n`dp[5] = 13`\nSince `dp[4] <= 10` but `dp[5] > 10`, the maximum `k` is 4. Output: 4.\n\nThis approach matches all example cases.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `dp[k-2]` or `Fib(k)`)\n2. Initialize `b = 2` (representing `dp[k-1]` or `Fib(k+1)`)\n3. Initialize `count = 1` (representing `k`, starting from `k=1` where `dp[1]=2` players are needed)\n4. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate `next_fib = a + b`\n   b. Update `a = b`\n   c. Update `b = next_fib`\n   d. Increment `count`\n5. The final `count` value will be the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nLet's trace with `n=10`:\nInitial: `a=1`, `b=2`, `count=1`\n\nIteration 1: `b=2 <= 10` is true.\n  `next_fib = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `b = 3`\n  `count = 2`\n\nIteration 2: `b=3 <= 10` is true.\n  `next_fib = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  `a = 3`\n  `b = 5`\n  `count = 3`\n\nIteration 3: `b=5 <= 10` is true.\n  `next_fib = 3 + 5 = 8`\n  `a = 5`\n  `b = 8`\n  `count = 4`\n\nIteration 4: `b=8 <= 10` is true.\n  `next_fib = 5 + 8 = 13`\n  `a = 8`\n  `b = 13`\n  `count = 5`\n\nIteration 5: `b=13 <= 10` is false. Loop terminates.\n\nThe result is `count - 1` because the loop increments `count` one last time after `b` becomes greater than `n`.\nThe `count` variable represents the `k` value for which `dp[k]` is `b`.\nWhen `b=2`, `count=1`.\nWhen `b=3`, `count=2`.\nWhen `b=5`, `count=3`.\nWhen `b=8`, `count=4`.\nWhen `b=13`, `count=5`.\nThe loop breaks when `b=13` (which is `dp[5]`) is `> n`. So the maximum `k` for which `dp[k] <= n` is the `count` from the previous iteration, which is `4`.\nSo, the output should be `count - 1`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate initial values to simplify:\n`k=0`: `dp[0]=1`\n`k=1`: `dp[1]=2`\n`k=2`: `dp[2]=3`\n...\n\nWe want to find max `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`.\nLet `a = 1` (representing `dp[0]`)\nLet `b = 2` (representing `dp[1]`)\nLet `ans = 1` (representing the current max games, corresponding to `b`)\n\nIf `n=1`, `b=2` is not `<= n`. Loop doesn't run. `ans` is 1. But for `n=1`, winner plays 0 games.\nThe problem states `n >= 2`. So `n=1` is not a valid input.\n\nFor `n=2`:\n`a=1, b=2, ans=1`\nLoop: `b=2 <= 2` is true.\n  `next_fib = 1+2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `b = 3`\n  `ans = 2`\nLoop: `b=3 <= 2` is false. Loop terminates.\nReturn `ans` which is 2. This is incorrect. For `n=2`, the answer is 1.\n\nThe `ans` variable should track the `k` value.\nLet `f_prev = 1` (players for k-2 games)\nLet `f_curr = 2` (players for k-1 games)\nLet `games_played = 1` (max games played by winner so far)\n\nIf `n=2`:\n`f_prev = 1`, `f_curr = 2`, `games_played = 1`\nLoop: `f_curr = 2 <= n` is true.\n  `f_next = f_prev + f_curr = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `f_prev = f_curr = 2`\n  `f_curr = f_next = 3`\n  `games_played = 2`\nLoop: `f_curr = 3 <= n` is false. Loop terminates.\nReturn `games_played` which is 2. Still incorrect.\n\nThe issue is that `games_played` is incremented *after* `f_curr` is updated to a value that might be greater than `n`.\nWe need to increment `games_played` only if the new `f_curr` is still `<= n`.\n\nCorrected logic:\n1. Initialize `f_prev = 1` (Represents `dp[0]`)\n2. Initialize `f_curr = 2` (Represents `dp[1]`)\n3. Initialize `games_played = 1` (Represents `k` for `dp[1]`)\n4. If `n == 2`, the answer is 1. (Special case for `n=2` or handle the loop carefully)\n   For `n=2`, `f_curr=2`. `games_played=1`. This is the correct answer. The loop should not run.\n   So, if `f_curr > n`, we should not enter the loop or update `games_played`.\n\nLet's use a simpler loop structure:\n1. `a = 1` (dp[0])\n2. `b = 2` (dp[1])\n3. `k = 1` (max games played)\n4. While `b <= n`:\n   `temp = b`\n   `b = a + b`\n   `a = temp`\n   `k += 1`\n5. Print `k-1`\n\nTrace with `n=2`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`\nLoop: `b=2 <= 2` is true.\n  `temp = 2`\n  `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `k = 2`\nLoop: `b=3 <= 2` is false. Loop terminates.\nPrint `k-1 = 2-1 = 1`. Correct for `n=2`.\n\nTrace with `n=3`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`\nLoop: `b=2 <= 3` is true.\n  `temp = 2`\n  `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `k = 2`\nLoop: `b=3 <= 3` is true.\n  `temp = 3`\n  `b = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  `a = 3`\n  `k = 3`\nLoop: `b=5 <= 3` is false. Loop terminates.\nPrint `k-1 = 3-1 = 2`. Correct for `n=3`.\n\nTrace with `n=4`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`\nLoop: `b=2 <= 4` is true.\n  `temp = 2`\n  `b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n  `a = 2`\n  `k = 2`\nLoop: `b=3 <= 4` is true.\n  `temp = 3`\n  `b = 2 + 3 = 5`\n  `a = 3`\n  `k = 3`\nLoop: `b=5 <= 4` is false. Loop terminates.\nPrint `k-1 = 3-1 = 2`. Correct for `n=4`.\n\nThis logic seems robust. The maximum `n` is `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. `Fib(90)` is approximately `2.88 * 10^18`. So, the loop will run about 90 times, which is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # dp[k] is the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games.\n    # dp[0] = 1 (A player who has played 0 games)\n    # dp[1] = 2 (Two players, P1(0) vs P2(0), winner plays 1 game)\n    # For k >= 2, dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]\n    # This is a Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...\n\n    # a represents dp[k-2]\n    # b represents dp[k-1]\n    # k represents the current number of games played by the winner for 'b' players\n    \n    a = 1  # Corresponds to dp[0]\n    b = 2  # Corresponds to dp[1]\n    k = 1  # Corresponds to 1 game played (for b=2 players)\n\n    # We want to find the maximum k such that dp[k] <= n.\n    # The loop continues as long as the number of players required for the next\n    # level of games (represented by b) is less than or equal to n.\n    # When b exceeds n, the previous k value was the maximum possible.\n    \n    # Example: n=2\n    # Initial: a=1, b=2, k=1\n    # Loop: b=2 <= n=2.
