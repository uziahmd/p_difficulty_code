Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Morse Code Sequence Counting**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem. It's about counting sequences of English letters that can be formed from substrings of a growing binary string, `S`. The string `S` is built up one character at a time, either '0' or '1', and I need to report the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each addition.\n\nThe core of this is understanding the Morse code representation. Dots ('0') and dashes ('1') make up letter representations. Each letter is represented by a string of 1 to 4 characters. There are 30 possible strings of lengths 1-4, but 4 of those don't correspond to letters. That leaves 26 unique strings corresponding to the 26 English letters.\n\nThe task then boils down to: at each step, find all the valid letter sequences that can be created from substrings of the current `S`. I need to figure out an efficient way to keep track of these counts as `S` grows.\n\nThe example walkthrough is helpful. For `S = \"111\"`, it illustrates how substrings like \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" map to letters.  Crucially, it shows that sequences can be formed by concatenating these letter representations from *different* substrings. For example, \"TT\" can come from the substrings \"1\" and \"1\", which would appear as \"11\" in the original string. This is the key: it's not just about individual letters represented by substrings, but about how different substrings can be combined to form sequences. So, I need an algorithm that can track the combinations dynamically as the string grows.\n\nI am thinking dynamic programming or a prefix sum type of solution might be best. I'll probably need some sort of state to represent valid sequences and how many exist. I'll need to figure out how to transition from one state (before appending the new character) to the next state (after appending). The modulo operation is straightforward, but the state management is where the complexity will lie. Let's get cracking on a Python solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by some substring of a growing string `S`. `S` starts empty, and characters ('0' or '1') are appended one by one. We need to report the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each append operation.\n\nLet's first understand the Morse code rules:\n1.  Dots are '0', dashes are '1'.\n2.  English letters are represented by strings of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4.\n3.  There are `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` such strings.\n4.  Four specific strings do not correspond to any letter: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n5.  The remaining `30 - 4 = 26` strings each correspond to a *distinct* English letter.\n\nThis means that any string of length 1 to 4, composed of '0's and '1's, that is *not* one of the four forbidden strings, represents a unique English letter.\n\nWe are looking for the number of *sequences of English letters*. A sequence of letters `L1 L2 ... Lk` is represented by a concatenation of their Morse codes `C1 C2 ... Ck`. This concatenated string `C1 C2 ... Ck` must be a substring of `S`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using a suffix of `S` of length `i` (i.e., `S[len(S)-i:]`).\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, let the new `S` be `S'`. We need to calculate the total number of sequences for `S'`.\n\nConsider the new character `c` appended to `S`. The new string `S'` has length `N`. We are interested in all substrings of `S'`.\nAny substring of `S'` that does not end at `S'[N-1]` (the newly appended character) would have already been considered in the previous step (for `S`). So, we only need to count new sequences that *end* at `S'[N-1]`.\n\nLet `f[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using a substring of `S` of length `i` that *ends* at `S[i-1]`.\nWhen `S` grows to length `N`, `S_N = S_{N-1} + c`.\nThe new sequences are those formed by substrings of `S_N` ending at `S_N[N-1]`.\nA substring ending at `S_N[N-1]` is of the form `S_N[j:N]` for some `0 <= j < N`.\nLet `s = S_N[j:N]`.\nIf `s` itself is a valid Morse code for a letter, say `L`, then `L` is a new sequence. This adds 1.\nIf `s` can be split into `s = s_prefix + s_suffix`, where `s_suffix` is a valid Morse code for a letter `L`, and `s_prefix` represents some sequence `Seq_P`, then `Seq_P + L` is a new sequence. The number of such sequences is `f[j + len(s_prefix)]` (using the definition of `f` for the string `S_N`).\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using substrings of `S` *ending at index `i`*.\nWhen `S` has length `N` (indices `0` to `N-1`), we want to calculate `dp[N-1]`.\n`dp[N-1]` is the sum of:\n1.  1, if `S[N-1]` is a valid Morse code for a letter.\n2.  `dp[N-2]`, if `S[N-2:N]` is a valid Morse code for a letter.\n3.  `dp[N-3]`, if `S[N-3:N]` is a valid Morse code for a letter.\n4.  `dp[N-4]`, if `S[N-4:N]` is a valid Morse code for a letter.\n(where `dp[k]` for `k < 0` is 0).\n\nMore precisely, for a string `S` of length `N`, `dp[N-1]` is calculated as follows:\n`dp[N-1] = 0`\nFor `L` from 1 to 4:\n  Let `sub = S[N-L:N]`.\n  If `N-L >= 0` and `sub` is a valid Morse code for a letter:\n    `dp[N-1] = (dp[N-1] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter `L` represented by `sub`)\n    If `N-L-1 >= 0`:\n      `dp[N-1] = (dp[N-1] + dp[N-L-1]) % MOD` (for sequences `Seq + L`)\n\nThe total answer after `N` characters are appended is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n\nLet's refine the `dp` state:\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using substrings of `S` *ending at index `k`*.\nWhen the `i`-th character `c` is appended to `S` (making `S` of length `i`), we calculate `dp[i-1]`.\nThe new character is `S[i-1]`.\n`dp[i-1]` is the sum of counts of sequences `Seq + L`, where `L` is a letter whose Morse code `C_L` is `S[j:i]` for some `j < i`, and `Seq` is any sequence represented by a substring ending at `j-1`.\nIf `j=0`, `Seq` is empty, so `L` itself is counted.\n\n`dp[i-1] = 0`\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n\nFor `len_code` from 1 to 4:\n  `start_idx = i - len_code`\n  If `start_idx >= 0`:\n    `code = S[start_idx : i]`\n    If `code` is a valid Morse code for a letter:\n      If `start_idx == 0`:\n        `dp[i-1] = (dp[i-1] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter `L`)\n      Else (`start_idx > 0`):\n        `dp[i-1] = (dp[i-1] + 1 + dp[start_idx-1]) % MOD` (for `L` and `Seq + L`)\n\nThe `dp` array would store values for indices `0` to `m-1`.\nThe total answer after `i` characters is `sum(dp[k] for k in range(i)) % MOD`.\n\nLet's list the forbidden codes:\n`FORBIDDEN = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\nA string `s` is a valid Morse code if its length is between 1 and 4 (inclusive) AND `s` is not in `FORBIDDEN`.\n\nExample walkthrough: `S = \"111\"`\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`S_list = []`\n`dp = []` (stores `dp[k]` for `k` from `0` to `m-1`)\n`total_ans = 0`\n\n1.  Append '1'. `S = \"1\"`. `i = 1`.\n    `dp[0]` calculation:\n    `len_code = 1`: `start_idx = 0`. `code = \"1\"`. Valid.\n      `start_idx == 0`: `dp[0] = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    `len_code = 2,3,4`: `start_idx < 0`. Skip.\n    `dp` array: `[1]`\n    `total_ans = (total_ans + dp[0]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n    Print 1.\n\n2.  Append '1'. `S = \"11\"`. `i = 2`.\n    `dp[1]` calculation:\n    `len_code = 1`: `start_idx = 1`. `code = \"1\"`. Valid.\n      `start_idx > 0`: `dp[1] = (0 + 1 + dp[0]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n    `len_code = 2`: `start_idx = 0`. `code = \"11\"`. Valid.\n      `start_idx == 0`: `dp[1] = (2 + 1) % MOD = 3`.\n    `len_code = 3,4`: `start_idx < 0`. Skip.\n    `dp` array: `[1, 3]`\n    `total_ans = (total_ans + dp[1]) % MOD = (1 + 3) % MOD = 4`.\n    Wait, example output is 3. What's wrong?\n\nThe problem asks for \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of S\".\nMy current `dp[k]` calculates sequences ending at index `k`.\nThe total answer is indeed `sum(dp[k])`.\nLet's re-evaluate the example.\n`S = \"1\"`:\n  Substring \"1\" is 'T'. Sequence: \"T\". Count = 1.\n  My `dp[0]=1`, `total_ans=1`. Correct.\n\n`S = \"11\"`:\n  Substrings: \"1\" (at index 0), \"1\" (at index 1), \"11\" (at index 0).\n  Sequences ending at index 0:\n    \"T\" (from \"1\") -> `dp[0] = 1`.\n  Sequences ending at index 1:\n    From `S[1:2]` (\"1\"): 'T'. This is one sequence. `+1`.\n    From `S[0:2]` (\"11\"): 'M'. This is one sequence. `+1`.\n    From `S[0:1]` (\"1\") + `S[1:2]` (\"1\"): 'TT'. This is one sequence. `+dp[0]`.\n    So `dp[1] = 1 (for \"T\") + 1 (for \"M\") + dp[0] (for \"TT\") = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.\n  My `dp[1]` calculation:\n    `len_code = 1`: `start_idx = 1`. `code = \"1\"`. Valid.\n      `start_idx > 0`: `dp[1] = (0 + 1 + dp[0]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`. (This counts \"T\" and \"TT\")\n    `len_code = 2`: `start_idx = 0`. `code = \"11\"`. Valid.\n      `start_idx == 0`: `dp[1] = (2 + 1) % MOD = 3`. (This counts \"M\")\n  So `dp[1]` is correct as 3.\n  Total sequences for `S=\"11\"`: `dp[0] + dp[1] = 1 + 3 = 4`.\n  The example output for \"11\" is 3. This indicates that the definition of what \"sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\" implies is different from what I'm calculating.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThe example for `S=\"111\"` lists 7 sequences: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\nThese are:\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"1\" + \"1\", which is \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"1\" + \"11\", which is \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"11\" + \"1\", which is \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\", which is \"111\")\n\nNotice that \"TT\" is represented by \"11\". \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" are all represented by \"111\".\nThis means that if a substring `sub` represents `C1 C2 ... Ck`, then that sequence is counted.\nThe crucial part is that `C1 C2 ... Ck` is *a* sequence. If `S = \"11\"`, then \"T\" is from `S[0:1]`. \"M\" is from `S[0:2]`. \"TT\" is from `S[0:2]` (concatenating `S[0:1]` and `S[1:2]`).\nMy `dp[k]` is counting sequences ending at `k`.\nFor `S=\"11\"`:\n`dp[0] = 1` (sequence \"T\" from `S[0:1]`)\n`dp[1] = 3` (sequences \"T\" from `S[1:2]`, \"M\" from `S[0:2]`, \"TT\" from `S[0:2]`)\nTotal `sum(dp)` is `1+3=4`. The example says 3.\n\nThe problem statement implies that we should count *distinct* sequences of letters.\nIf `S = \"11\"`, the substrings are \"1\", \"11\".\n\"1\" -> 'T'\n\"11\" -> 'M'\n\"11\" -> 'T' + 'T' -> 'TT'\nThe sequences formed are \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\". There are 3 distinct sequences.\n\nThis means my DP state is wrong. `dp[i]` should not be \"sequences ending at index `i`\".\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using a *prefix* of `S` of length `k`.\nThis is a standard DP approach for this type of problem.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the prefix `S[0...i-1]` into a sequence of Morse code letters.\nBase case: `dp[0] = 1` (representing an empty sequence, which is useful for calculations).\nFor `i` from 1 to `N`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `len_code` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i - len_code >= 0`:\n      `code = S[i - len_code : i]`\n      If `code` is a valid Morse code for a letter:\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - len_code]) % MOD`\n\nAfter calculating `dp[N]`, the total number of non-empty sequences formed from `S[0...N-1]` is `dp[N] - 1` (subtracting the empty sequence). This counts sequences that use the *entire* prefix `S[0...N-1]`.\nBut the problem wants sequences from *any substring*.\n\nThis is a classic \"number of paths in a DAG\" problem.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to form sequences of letters ending at index `i` of `S`.\nWhen `S` grows to length `N`:\n`current_dp_value = 0`\nFor `len_code` from 1 to 4:\n  `start_idx = N - len_code`\n  If `start_idx >= 0`:\n    `code = S[start_idx : N]`\n    If `code` is a valid Morse code:\n      If `start_idx == 0`:\n        `current_dp_value = (current_dp_value + 1) % MOD`\n      Else:\n        `current_dp_value = (current_dp_value + dp[start_idx-1] + 1) % MOD`\n`dp[N-1] = current_dp_value`\n\nThis is exactly what I had before, which yielded 4 for `S=\"11\"`.\nThe example output is 3.\nThe difference is:\nMy `dp[0]=1` (T from `S[0:1]`)\nMy `dp[1]=3` (T from `S[1:2]`, M from `S[0:2]`, TT from `S[0:1]S[1:2]`)\nTotal `1+3=4`.\n\nThe example output for \"11\" is 3. This means it counts \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\".\nThe \"T\" from `S[0:1]` and \"T\" from `S[1:2]` are distinct occurrences of the letter 'T', but they are the same *sequence* \"T\".\nThe problem is asking for the number of *distinct* sequences of English letters.\nThis means we need to use a `set` to store the actual sequences, which is too slow and memory intensive.\nWe need a DP that counts distinct sequences.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed using a substring of `S` ending at index `i`.\nWhen `S` has length `N`.\n`dp[N-1]` is the number of distinct sequences ending at `N-1`.\nThis is `sum_{k=1..4, S[N-k:N] is valid} (count of distinct sequences ending at N-k-1 + 1)`\nThe `+1` is for the single letter `L` represented by `S[N-k:N]`.\nThe `count of distinct sequences ending at N-k-1` is `dp[N-k-1]`.\nThe problem with this is that different `k` values might lead to the same sequence.\nE.g., `S = \"111\"`.\n`dp[2]` (ending at index 2).\n`k=1`: `S[2:3]`=\"1\" ('T'). Sequences are \"T\" and `Seq_ending_at_1` + \"T\".\n`k=2`: `S[1:3]`=\"11\" ('M'). Sequences are \"M\" and `Seq_ending_at_0` + \"M\".\n`k=3`: `S[0:3]`=\"111\" ('O'). Sequences are \"O\" and `empty` + \"O\".\n\n`S=\"1\"`: `dp_val[0]` = 1 (for \"T\")\n`S=\"11\"`:\n  `dp_val[1]` = ?\n  `S[1:2]`=\"1\" ('T'). New sequences: \"T\", `Seq_from_dp_val[0]` + \"T\" (\"TT\").\n  `S[0:2]`=\"11\" ('M'). New sequences: \"M\".\n  So, for `dp_val[1]`, we have \"T\", \"TT\", \"M\". Count = 3.\n  This matches the example output for \"11\".\n  The total answer after `N` appends is `sum(dp_val[k] for k in range(N))`.\n  For `S=\"11\"`, this sum is `dp_val[0] + dp_val[1] = 1 + 3 = 4`. Still not 3.\n\nThe example output is `1` for `S=\"1\"`, `3` for `S=\"11\"`, `7` for `S=\"111\"`.\nThis implies that the answer is *not* `sum(dp[k])`.\nIt seems the answer is just `dp[N-1]`, where `dp[k]` is the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using a *prefix* of `S` of length `k+1`.\nNo, that's not right either.\n`S=\"111\"`, `N=3`. `dp[2]` would be 7.\n`S=\"11\"`, `N=2`. `dp[1]` would be 3.\n`S=\"1\"`, `N=1`. `dp[0]` would be 1.\n\nLet's define `dp[i]` as the total number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by *any substring* of `S` of length `i+1` (i.e., `S[0...i]`).\nThis definition also doesn't fit the `sum(dp)` structure.\n\nThe problem is similar to counting distinct substrings, but with an additional layer of interpretation.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters formed by substrings of `S` ending at index `i`.\nTo calculate `dp[i]`:\nWe consider substrings `S[i-L+1 ... i]` for `L=1..4`.\nFor each such substring `sub` that is a valid Morse code for a letter `C`:\n  We add `C` to our set of sequences.\n  We also add `Seq + C` for all `Seq` in `dp[i-L]`.\nThis is where the problem is. If we add to a set, it's slow. If we count, we might overcount.\n\nLet's rethink the structure. We are appending a character `c` to `S`. Let `S_old` be the string before `c`, and `S_new = S_old + c`.\nThe total number of sequences for `S_new` is `Total(S_old) + NewSequences(S_new)`.\n`NewSequences(S_new)` are those sequences that use `c` (i.e., end at the last position of `S_new`).\nLet `count[k]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed using substrings of `S` ending at index `k`.\nWhen `S` grows from `S_old` to `S_new` (length `N`):\nWe need to calculate `count[N-1]`.\n`count[N-1]` is the number of distinct sequences `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` such that `Morse(L_1) ... Morse(L_p)` is `S[j:N]` for some `j`.\n\nThis is a standard problem that can be solved using Aho-Corasick or a suffix structure (like suffix automaton/tree), but the alphabet is small and string length is short (max 4).\nThe number of distinct letter sequences can be large, but `M` is only 3000. `M^2` is too slow. `M*4` is fine.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters ending at index `i`.\nWhen we append `c` to `S`, `S` becomes length `N`. We want to find `dp[N-1]`.\n`dp[N-1]` can be calculated from `dp[N-2], dp[N-3], dp[N-4], dp[N-5]`.\nFor `L` from 1 to 4:\n  `sub = S[N-L : N]`\n  If `sub` is a valid Morse code for a letter `char_L`:\n    The sequence `char_L` is added.\n    For `k = N-L-1`:\n      All sequences `Seq + char_L` where `Seq` ends at `k` are added.\nThe problem is that `Seq1 + char_L1` might be the same as `Seq2 + char_L2`.\nExample: `S = \"111\"`.\n`dp[0] = 1` (\"T\")\n`dp[1] = 3` (\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\")\n`dp[2]` (sequences ending at index 2):\n  `L=1`: `S[2:3]`=\"1\" ('T').\n    New sequences: \"T\"\n    From `dp[1]` (\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"): \"TT\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n    So far: \"T\", \"TT\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n  `L=2`: `S[1:3]`=\"11\" ('M').\n    New sequences: \"M\"\n    From `dp[0]` (\"T\"): \"TM\".\n    So far: \"T\", \"TT\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", \"M\", \"TM\".\n  `L=3`: `S[0:3]`=\"111\" ('O').\n    New sequences: \"O\".\n    So far: \"T\", \"TT\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", \"M\", \"TM\", \"O\".\nTotal 7 distinct sequences. This matches the example.\nSo, `dp[i]` is indeed the number of distinct sequences ending at index `i`.\nThe total answer is `sum(dp[k])`.\n\nMy `dp[i]` calculation was:\n`dp[i-1] = 0`\nFor `len_code` from 1 to 4:\n  `start_idx = i - len_code`\n  If `start_idx >= 0`:\n    `code = S[start_idx : i]`\n    If `code` is a valid Morse code for a letter:\n      If `start_idx == 0`:\n        `dp[i-1] = (dp[i-1] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter `L`)\n      Else (`start_idx > 0`):\n        `dp[i-1] = (dp[i-1] + 1 + dp[start_idx-1]) % MOD` (for `L` and `Seq + L`)\n\nLet's trace `S = \"11\"` again with this logic to get `dp[1]`.\n`i=2`. `S_list = ['1', '1']`.\n`dp` array will be `[dp[0], dp[1], ...]`.\n`dp[0]` was 1.\n`dp[1]` calculation:\n`current_dp_val = 0`\n`len_code = 1`: `start_idx = 1`. `code = S_list[1:2]` which is \"1\". Valid.\n  `start_idx == 0` is false.\n  `current_dp_val = (current_dp_val + 1 + dp[start_idx-1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + dp[0]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n`len_code = 2`: `start_idx = 0`. `code = S_list[0:2]` which is \"11\".

This matches the example's implicit `dp[1]`.\nThe total answer for `S=\"11\"` is `sum(dp[k] for k in range(2)) = dp[0] + dp[1] = 1 + 3 = 4`.\nThis is still not 3.\n\nThe problem is that the example outputs are `1, 3, 7` for `S=\"1\"`, `S=\"11\"`, `S=\"111\"`.\nThese are exactly `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]` as I calculated them.\nThis means the problem is asking for `dp[N-1]` (the number of distinct sequences ending at the last index), not the sum of all `dp` values.\n\nLet's confirm this interpretation with the second example: `S=\"10101\"`\n`m=5`\n`S` | `i` | `S_list` | `dp[i-1]` | `total_ans` (should be `dp[i-1]`)\n---|---|----------|-----------|------------\n`1` | `1` | `['1']` | `dp[0]=1` | `1`\n`10`| `2` | `['1','0']` | `dp[1]` calculation:\n    |   |            | `len_code=1, S[1:2]=\"0\"` (valid). `dp[0]=1`.

My `dp[1]` is wrong or my interpretation of `dp[1]` is wrong.\n\nLet's recalculate `dp[1]` for `S=\"10\"`:\n`S_list = ['1', '0']`.\nSequences ending at index 0:\n  `S[0:1]`=\"1\" ('T'). `dp[0]=1`.\nSequences ending at index 1:\n  `L=1`: `S[1:2]`=\"0\" ('E').\n    New sequences: \"E\".\n    From `dp[0]` (\"T\"): \"TE\".\n    So far for `dp[1]`: \"E\", \"TE\".\n  `L=2`: `S[0:2]`=\"10\" ('A').\n    New sequences: \"A\".\n    So far for `dp[1]`: \"E\", \"TE\", \"A\".\n`dp[1]=3`.\n\nThis means `dp[i-1]` (the number of distinct sequences ending at the current last index `i-1`) is what the example output shows.\nThe previous example `S=\"11\"`:\n`dp[0]=1` (\"T\")\n`dp[1]=3` (\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\")\nThe example output for `S=\"1\"` is `1`.\nThe example output for `S=\"11\"` is `3`.\nThis matches my `dp[i-1]` values.\n\nLet's recheck `S=\"10\"`.\n`S=\"1\"`: `dp_val[0]=1`. Output `1`.\n`S=\"10\"`: `dp_val[1]=3`. Output `4`.\nThis is a contradiction. My `dp_val[i-1]` matches the first sample, but not the second.\n\nWhat if the answer is `sum(dp[k])`?\n`S=\"1\"`: `dp[0]=1`. `sum=1`. Output `1`. (Matches)\n`S=\"11\"`: `dp[0]=1, dp[1]=3`. `sum=4`. Output `3`. (Mismatch)\n`S=\"111\"`: `dp[0]=1, dp[1]=3, dp[2]=7`. `sum=11`. Output `7`. (Mismatch)\n\nThis implies that the sample output is not `sum(dp[k])` nor `dp[k]`.\nThis is very confusing. Let's re-read the problem statement very carefully.\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThis usually means the total count of distinct sequences.\n\nLet's assume the example outputs are correct and try to reverse engineer.\n`S=\"1\"`: 1 sequence. (\"T\")\n`S=\"11\"`: 3 sequences. (\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\")\n`S=\"111\"`: 7 sequences.

Add \"TTT\".\n  `total_sequences = {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}`. Size = 7. Output 7. (Matches)\n\nThis confirms the interpretation: we need to count *distinct* sequences of letters.\nThe `set` approach is correct in logic but too slow. `M=3000`, max length of sequence could be `M`. Storing `M` strings of length `M` is `M^2` memory and operations.\n\nWe need a DP approach that counts distinct sequences.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing `S[0...i]`.\nThis is not what we want. We want sequences from *any substring*.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing a suffix of `S` ending at index `i`.\nThis is the `dp[i-1]` from my earlier calculation (the one that matched the first sample).\nLet's call this `count_ending[i]`.\n`count_ending[i]` = number of distinct sequences `L_1 ... L_k` such that `Morse(L_1)...Morse(L_k) = S[j...i]` for some `j`.\n\nWhen `S` grows to length `N` (new char `S[N-1]`):\nWe want to calculate `count_ending[N-1]`.\n`count_ending[N-1]` is the count of distinct sequences formed by `S[j...N-1]`.\nTo get this, we consider all possible ways to end a sequence at `N-1`:\n1. `S[N-1]` is a letter `L1`. This adds sequence `L1`.\n2. `S[N-2:N-1]` is a letter `L2`. This adds sequence `L2`.\n3. `S[N-3:N-1]` is a letter `L3`. This adds sequence `L3`.\n4. `S[N-4:N-1]` is a letter `L4`. This adds sequence `L4`.\n5. For each `L_x` above, we also add `Seq + L_x` where `Seq` is any sequence ending at `N-x-1`.\n\nThis is exactly what `(1 + dp[start_idx-1])` was doing.\nThe total answer is the sum of all `count_ending[i]` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n`S=\"1\"`: `count_ending[0]=1`. Total `1`.\n`S=\"11\"`: `count_ending[0]=1`. `count_ending[1]=3`. Total `1+3=4`.\nThis still does not match the example output of `3` for `S=\"11\"`.\n\nThe problem is that `count_ending[0]` for `S=\"11\"` refers to \"T\" from `S[0:1]`.\n`count_ending[1]` for `S=\"11\"` refers to \"T\" from `S[1:2]`, \"M\" from `S[0:2]`, \"TT\" from `S[0:2]`.\nThe sequence \"T\" appears in both `count_ending[0]` and `count_ending[1]`.\nIf we sum them, we overcount \"T\".\n\nThis implies that we need to count *all distinct sequences* formed by *any substring*.\nThis is typically handled by storing the actual sequences in a `set` or by using a suffix automaton.\nGiven `M=3000`, a suffix automaton might be feasible. Max states `2M`, max transitions `3M`.\nEach state in a suffix automaton corresponds to a set of end positions.\nFor each state, we can count the number of distinct sequences that map to the strings represented by that state.\n\nLet's use a simplified approach to count distinct sequences.\nFor each `i` from `0` to `N-1` (current string `S` has length `N`):\n  Let `sequences_at_i` be a set of strings (sequences of letters).\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i - L + 1 >= 0`:\n      `sub = S[i-L+1 : i+1]`\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code for letter `char_L`:\n        `sequences_at_i.add(char_L)`\n        If `i - L >= 0`:\n          For each `prev_seq` in `sequences_at_i_minus_L`:\n            `sequences_at_i.add(prev_seq + char_L)`\nThis is what the example implies. `sequences_at_i_minus_L` would be `sequences_at_i-L`.\nThis is `O(M * 4 * M * M)` roughly, too slow. `M^3` for string concatenations and set insertions.\n\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This is a small constant.\nThis suggests a DP where the state depends on the last few characters.\nLet `dp[k]` be the total number of distinct sequences that can be formed by *any* substring of `S[0...k]`.\nThis is exactly what we want.\nWhen we append `c` to `S`, `S` becomes `S_new` of length `N`. We need `dp[N-1]`.\n`dp[N-1] = dp[N-2]` (all sequences from `S_old`)\n`+` (new sequences formed by substrings ending at `N-1`).\nThe problem is that the \"new sequences\" might already be counted in `dp[N-2]`.\nE.g., `S=\"11\"`. `dp[0]` for `S=\"1\"` is 1 (\"T\").\nWhen `S=\"11\"`, `dp[1]` is `dp[0]` + `new_sequences_ending_at_1`.\n`new_sequences_ending_at_1` are \"T\" (from `S[1:2]`), \"M\" (from `S[0:2]`), \"TT\" (from `S[0:1]` + `S[1:2]`).\nThe \"T\" from `S[1:2]` is the same sequence as \"T\" from `S[0:1]`.\nSo `dp[1]` should be `dp[0]` (for \"T\") + \"M\" + \"TT\" = `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`. This matches.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\nLet `total_sequences[i]` be the set of all distinct sequences formed by substrings of `S[0...i]`.\n`total_sequences[i] = total_sequences[i-1]`\n  `union` `new_sequences_ending_at_i`\nWhere `new_sequences_ending_at_i` is the set of distinct sequences `L_1 ... L_k` such that `Morse(L_1)...Morse(L_k) = S[j...i]` for some `j`.\n\nWe can maintain `current_total_sequences` as a `set`.\nWhen `c` is appended to `S` (new length `N`):\n  `S_str += c`\n  `new_sequences_ending_at_N_minus_1 = set()`\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    `start_idx = N - L`\n    If `start_idx >= 0`:\n      `code = S_str[start_idx : N]`\n      If `code` is a valid Morse code for `char_L`:\n        `new_sequences_ending_at_N_minus_1.add(char_L)`\n        If `start_idx > 0`:\n          For `prev_seq` in `sequences_ending_at[start_idx-1]`:\n            `new_sequences_ending_at_N_minus_1.add(prev_seq + char_L)`\n  `sequences_ending_at[N-1] = new_sequences_ending_at_N_minus_1`\n  `current_total_sequences.update(new_sequences_ending_at_N_minus_1)`\n  Output `len(current_total_sequences)`.\n\nThis is `O(M * 4 * M * M)` in worst case. `M=3000`. `3000^3` is too large.\nWe need to count distinct sequences without storing them.\nThis means we need to count how many `prev_seq + char_L` are truly new, and how many are duplicates.\nThe duplicates can come from two sources:\n1. `prev_seq + char_L` is already in `current_total_sequences`.\n2. `prev_seq1 + char_L1` is the same as `prev_seq2 + char_L2` (both are new sequences ending at `N-1`).\n\nThis is a problem that uses hashing or string algorithms (like suffix automaton).\nSince the maximum length of a Morse code is 4, the maximum length of a sequence `prev_seq + char_L` could be `(N-1) + 1 = N`.\nThe number of distinct sequences could be up to `26^N` in theory, but limited by `2^N` (length of Morse code string).\nThe actual number of distinct sequences is probably not that large.\nMax number of distinct sequences from `S` of length `N` is `N * (2^4) = N * 16` roughly.\nFor `N=3000`, this is `3000 * 16 = 48000`. This is a small number.\nSo `current_total_sequences` set size can be up to `48000`.\nEach `sequences_ending_at[k]` set can also be up to `48000`.\n`M * 4 * 48000` set insertions/concatenations.\nString concatenation `prev_seq + char_L` takes `len(prev_seq)` time. `len(prev_seq)` can be up to `M`.\nSo `M * 4 * 48000 * M` operations. This is `3000 * 4 * 48000 * 3000` is too slow.\n\nThe key observation is that the number of actual *distinct* sequences of letters is small.\nLet `N_k` be the number of distinct sequences of letters. `N_k` is at most `26^k`.\nThe length of the Morse code string is at most 4.\nThe length of `S` is `M = 3000`.\nThe number of distinct sequences of letters can be related to the number of distinct substrings.\nA string of length `N` has `O(N^2)` substrings.\nEach substring can be parsed in `O(N)` ways.\nSo, `O(N^3)` sequences. This is too large.\n\nA different approach:\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences ending at index `i`.\nLet `current_total_distinct_sequences` be the total count.\nWhen we append `S[i]`:\n  `newly_formed_sequences_ending_at_i = set()`\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i - L + 1 >= 0`:\n      `code = S[i-L+1 : i+1]`\n      If `code` is a valid Morse code for `char_L`:\n        `newly_formed_sequences_ending_at_i.add(char_L)`\n        If `i - L >= 0`:\n          For `prev_seq` in `sequences_ending_at[i-L]`:\n            `newly_formed_sequences_ending_at_i.add(prev_seq + char_L)`\n\n  `num_new_distinct_sequences = 0`\n  For `seq` in `newly_formed_sequences_ending_at_i`:\n    If `seq` not in `current_total_distinct_sequences_set`:\n      `num_new_distinct_sequences = (num_new_distinct_sequences + 1) % MOD`\n  `current_total_distinct_sequences = (current_total_distinct_sequences + num_new_distinct_sequences) % MOD`\n  `current_total_distinct_sequences_set.update(newly_formed_sequences_ending_at_i)`\n  `sequences_ending_at[i] = newly_formed_sequences_ending_at_i`\n  Print `current_total_distinct_sequences`.\n\nThe problem is still string operations and set operations on strings.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences of letters is actually small.\nIt's the number of states in the Aho-Corasick automaton built on all possible sequences of letters.\nThe maximum length of a sequence of letters is `M`.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences that can be formed from a string of length `M` is `O(M^2)`.\nFor `M=3000`, `M^2 = 9 * 10^6`.

This is `9 * 10^6 * 2 * 8 bytes = 144 MB` for storage.\nOperations `9 * 10^6` set insertions per step.\nThis means the `sequences_ending_at[k]` sets and `current_total_distinct_sequences_set` cannot be this large.\nThe maximum size of `sequences_ending_at[k]` is at most `M`.\nThe maximum size of `current_total_distinct_sequences_set` is at most `M^2`.\n\nThe number of distinct sequences of *letters* that can be formed from all substrings of a string `S` of length `N` is `O(N^2)` in the worst case.\nFor example, if all single characters are \"0\", \"00\", \"000\", \"0000\" are valid.\n`S = \"0000\"`\n\"0\"\n\"00\"\n\"000\"\n\"0000\"\n\"0\"+\"0\" (\"00\")\n\"0\"+\"0\"+\"0\" (\"000\")\n\"0\"+\"0\"+\"0\"+\"0\" (\"0000\")\n\"0\"+\"00\" (\"000\")\n\"00\"+\"0\" (\"000\")\n\"0\"+\"000\" (\"0000\")\n\"00\"+\"00\" (\"0000\")\n\"000\"+\"0\" (\"0000\")\n...\nThe number of *distinct* letter sequences is what matters.\nLet's analyze the number of distinct sequences for `S=\"111\"`.\n`N=1`: `S=\"1\"`. `sequences_ending_at[0] = {\"T\"}`. `total_set = {\"T\"}`. `total_count = 1`.\n`N=2`: `S=\"11\"`.\n  `new_ending_at_1 = set()`\n  `L=1`: `S[1:2]`=\"1\" ('T'). `new_ending_at_1.add(\"T\")`.\n    `start_idx=1 > 0`. `prev_seq` in `sequences_ending_at[0]` (\"T\").\n    `new_ending_at_1.add(\"T\"+\"T\")`. So `{\"T\", \"TT\"}`.\n  `L=2`: `S[0:2]`=\"11\" ('M'). `new_ending_at_1.add(\"M\")`. So `{\"T\", \"TT\", \"M\"}`.\n  `sequences_ending_at[1] = {\"T\", \"TT\", \"M\"}`.\n  Update `total_set`:\n    \"T\" is already in `total_set`.\n    \"TT\" is not. Add. `total_count = (1+1)%MOD = 2`. `total_set={\"T\", \"TT\"}`.\n    \"M\" is not. Add. `total_count = (2+1)%MOD = 3`. `total_set={\"T\", \"TT\", \"M\"}`.\n  Output `3`. (Matches)\n\n`N=3`: `S=\"111\"`.\n  `new_ending_at_2 = set()`\n  `L=1`: `S[2:3]`=\"1\" ('T'). `new_ending_at_2.add(\"T\")`.\n    `start_idx=2 > 0`. `prev_seq` in `sequences_ending_at[1]` (\"T\", \"TT\", \"M\").\n    `new_ending_at_2.add(\"T\"+\"T\")`, `new_ending_at_2.add(\"TT\"+\"T\")`, `new_ending_at_2.add(\"M\"+\"T\")`.\n    So far: `{\"T\", \"TT\", \"TTT\", \"MT\"}`.\n  `L=2`: `S[1:3]`=\"11\" ('M'). `new_ending_at_2.add(\"M\")`.\n    `start_idx=1 > 0`. `prev_seq` in `sequences_ending_at[0]` (\"T\").\n    `new_ending_at_2.add(\"T\"+\"M\")`.\n    So far: `{\"T\", \"TT\", \"TTT\", \"MT\", \"M\", \"TM\"}`.\n  `L=3`: `S[0:3]`=\"111\" ('O'). `new_ending_at_2.add(\"O\")`.\n    `start_idx=0`.\n    So far: `{\"T\", \"TT\", \"TTT\", \"MT\", \"M\", \"TM\", \"O\"}`.\n  `sequences_ending_at[2] = {\"T\", \"TT\", \"TTT\", \"MT\", \"M\", \"TM\", \"O\"}`.\n  Update `total_set`:\n    \"T\" (in `total_set`)\n    \"TT\" (in `total_set`)\n    \"TTT\" (not in `total_set`). `total_count = (3+1)%MOD = 4`. `total_set` gets \"TTT\".\n    \"MT\" (not in `total_set`). `total_count = (4+1)%MOD = 5`. `total_set` gets \"MT\".\n    \"M\" (in `total_set`)\n    \"TM\" (not in `total_set`). `total_count = (5+1)%MOD = 6`. `total_set` gets \"TM\".\n    \"O\" (not in `total_set`). `total_count = (6+1)%MOD = 7`. `total_set` gets \"O\".\n  Output `7`. (Matches)\n\nThe logic seems correct. The issue is performance.\nThe size of `sequences_ending_at[k]` can be at most `4k` (each position can contribute 4 sequences). This is `O(M)`.\nThe size of `current_total_distinct_sequences_set` can be at most `M * 4 * M = O(M^2)`.\nNo, it's not `M*4*M`. It's `M` positions, each position can be the end of `4` Morse codes.\nEach `sequences_ending_at[k]` can have size at most `4 * (1 + sum(size of sequences_ending_at[j]))`.\nThis is where it grows to `O(M^2)`.\nFor example, `S = \"000...0\"` (N times).\n`sequences_ending_at[0]` = {\"A\"} (if \"0\" is A)\n`sequences_ending_at[1]` = {\"A\", \"AA\", \"B\"} (if \"0\" is A, \"00\" is B)\n`sequences_ending_at[2]` = {\"A\", \"AA\", \"AAA\", \"B\", \"AB\", \"BA\", \"C\"} (if \"000\" is C)\nThe number of sequences grows rapidly.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences is `O(N^2)`.\nFor `N=3000`, `N^2 = 9 * 10^6`.\nA set of `9 * 10^6` hash tuples is `144MB`. This is acceptable memory.\nThe time complexity is `M * (4 * O(M) + O(M^2)) = O(M^3)` in worst case.\n`3000^3` is too slow.\nThe `O(M^2)` part comes from iterating `newly_formed_sequences_ending_at_N_minus_1_hashes` and `current_total_distinct_sequences_set.update()`.\nThe iteration over `sequences_ending_at[start_idx-1]` is `O(M)`. `4 * O(M)` is `O(M)`.\nSo the inner loop is `O(M)`. Total `O(M^2)` if `set` operations are `O(1)`.\n`M * O(M) = O(M^2)`.\n`3000^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is feasible.\nPython `set` operations are `O(1)` average for hashable types.\nThe string concatenation `prev_seq + char_L` is `O(len(prev_seq))`. Max `O(M)`.\nThis makes the `set.add` operation `O(M)` if we store strings.\nIf we store hashes, `set.add` is `O(1)`.\n\nSo the polynomial hashing approach should work.\n`P1 = 31`, `MOD1 = 10^9 + 7`.\n`P2 = 37`, `MOD2 = 10^9 + 9`.\nThe values for `char_L_hash1` and `char_L_hash2` should be `ord(char_L) - ord('A') + 1`. This maps 'A' to 1, 'B' to 2, etc. These are small.\n\nImplementation details:\n`S_list`: list of chars for efficiency.\n`sequences_ending_at`: list of sets. `sequences_ending_at[k]` is the set of hashes for sequences ending at `k`.\n`current_total_distinct_sequences_set`: a set of hashes.\n`current_total_distinct_sequences`: an integer.\n\nForbidden codes:\n`FORBIDDEN = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\nA helper function `is_valid_morse(code_str)` is useful.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    P1 = 31  # Prime for first hash\n    P2 = 37  # Prime for second hash\n    MOD1 = 10**9 + 7\n    MOD2 = 10**9 + 9\n\n    FORBIDDEN = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    # Precompute hash values for single letters 'A' through 'Z'\n    # These are used as base values for char_L_hash1 and char_L_hash2\n    # We can just map '0' to 1, '1' to 2, etc. for Morse codes,\n    # but the problem is about English letters.
