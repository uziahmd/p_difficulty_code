The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Neko Finds Grapes\" problem, and here's how I'm thinking about it.  It's a classic pairing problem. I need to maximize the number of chests opened, and the opening criteria boils down to this: a chest and a key work together if their sum is odd.  That immediately tells me I need to look at parity – whether the numbers are even or odd.\n\nMy first thought is to divide and conquer:  Let's separate the chests and keys into even and odd categories.  I can quickly count how many even and odd chests I have (`chests_even`, `chests_odd`) and the same for keys (`keys_even`, `keys_odd`).\n\nThe core of the strategy is this: an even chest *needs* an odd key, and an odd chest *needs* an even key.  Therefore, I'll calculate the maximum number of pairings of each type.\n\nFor even chests, I'm limited by the smaller number between `chests_even` and `keys_odd`. That number represents the maximum pairings I can make between the even chests and odd keys.  Similarly, the maximum number of odd chest pairings will be the minimum of `chests_odd` and `keys_even`.\n\nSince a key can open at most one chest and a chest can be opened by at most one key, I can then simply add these two maximums together. This gives me the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThe first example illustrates this perfectly. I count the even and odd chests and keys.  Then, by finding the minimums of the two pairings as just discussed, I have my answer. It's a clean and efficient algorithm, and the final solution is the sum of these two independent pairings.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of chests Neko can open given a set of chests and keys. A key `b_j` can unlock a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. This condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` implies that one of `a_i` and `b_j` must be even, and the other must be odd.\n\nLet's categorize the chests and keys based on their parity:\n\n1.  **Even Chests:** Chests with an even number `a_i`.\n2.  **Odd Chests:** Chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n3.  **Even Keys:** Keys with an even number `b_j`.\n4.  **Odd Keys:** Keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n\nFor a chest to be opened, its parity must be different from the key's parity:\n\n*   An **Even Chest** can only be opened by an **Odd Key**.\n*   An **Odd Chest** can only be opened by an **Even Key**.\n\nSince each key can be used at most once and each chest can be opened at most once, we can consider these two types of pairings independently.\n\nLet's count the number of each type:\n*   `count_chests_even`: Number of even-numbered chests.\n*   `count_chests_odd`: Number of odd-numbered chests.\n*   `count_keys_even`: Number of even-numbered keys.\n*   `count_keys_odd`: Number of odd-numbered keys.\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum pairings for each type:\n\n1.  **Pairing Even Chests with Odd Keys:** The number of such pairings is limited by the available even chests and available odd keys. Thus, we can make at most `min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd)` such pairings.\n\n2.  **Pairing Odd Chests with Even Keys:** Similarly, the number of such pairings is limited by the available odd chests and available even keys. We can make at most `min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)` such pairings.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximum pairings from these two independent categories:\n\n`Total Max Chests = min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd) + min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `count_chests_even = 0`, `count_chests_odd = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`, check its parity:\n    *   If `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `count_chests_even`.\n    *   If `a_i % 2 != 0`, increment `count_chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `count_keys_even = 0`, `count_keys_odd = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`, check its parity:\n    *   If `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `count_keys_even`.\n    *   If `b_j % 2 != 0`, increment `count_keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate the result: `min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd) + min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)`.\n7.  Print the result.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest numbers and key numbers once to count parities, and then a constant number of operations to calculate the final answer. The time complexity will be O(n + m).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    count_chests_even = 0\n    count_chests_odd = 0\n\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            count_chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            count_chests_odd += 1\n\n    count_keys_even = 0\n    count_keys_odd = 0\n\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            count_keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            count_keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Max pairings of (even chest, odd key)\n    pairings1 = min(count_chests_even, count_keys_odd)\n\n    # Max pairings of (odd chest, even key)\n    pairings2 = min(count_chests_odd, count_keys_even)\n\n    print(pairings1 + pairings2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
