A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Plan for Solving the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem and need a Python script to figure out the solution. Let me break down the problem and outline my approach.  The input is a single line with eight integers: `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `d`, `p`, `nl`, and `np`. These represent the number of friends, drink-related quantities, and so on. My goal is to determine the maximum number of toasts *each* friend can make, ensuring everyone has the same amount.\n\nThe calculations are pretty straightforward.  I need to compute the maximum number of toasts possible based on the available resources.  First, let's look at the drink. I realized that my initial logic for drink was wrong. The initial calculations had some errors. The sample helped with clarifying the issue. It looks like `nl` is the amount needed per toast for each friend, and the total drink per toast is not `n*nl`, but `nl`. The quantity `(k*l)/nl` is the number of toasts *possible for one person* due to the drink. Then this amount must be divided by the number of friends, `n`. Using integer division, the calculation for the drink-based toasts per friend becomes `((k * l) // nl) // n`. Let's save that variable: `toasts_per_friend_drink`.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the lime-based toasts.  We have `c` limes and each is sliced into `d` pieces, so the total slices available are `c * d`.  Each friend needs one slice per toast, so the limes will limit the maximum toasts.\n\nFinally, I'll consider the salt. I can calculate the salt-based toasts similarly to the drink and limes. I have `p` grams of salt, and each friend needs `np` grams per toast, so `p // (n * np)` provides the maximum toast based on salt.\n\nOnce I have the maximum toasts for each resource, the solution is the *minimum* of these values.  That's the limiting factor.  So, I'll find the smallest of `toasts_per_friend_drink`, the lime-based toasts (which is just `(c * d) // n`), and the salt-based toasts.  That will be the answer!  I'm confident this will work. Let's start coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given constraints on drink, lime, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\nLet's break down the resources:\n\n1.  **Drink:**\n    *   Total milliliters of drink available: `k` bottles * `l` ml/bottle = `k * l` ml.\n    *   Each friend needs `nl` ml of drink per toast.\n    *   So, the total number of \"portions\" of drink (each `nl` ml) available is `(k * l) / nl`.\n    *   Since there are `n` friends and they all make the same number of toasts, these total portions must be divided among the `n` friends.\n    *   Number of toasts per friend based on drink: `((k * l) // nl) // n`. We use integer division (`//`) because partial toasts are not possible.\n\n2.  **Limes:**\n    *   Total number of lime slices available: `c` limes * `d` slices/lime = `c * d` slices.\n    *   Each friend needs 1 slice of lime per toast.\n    *   So, the total number of \"portions\" of lime (each 1 slice) available is `c * d`.\n    *   These total portions must be divided among the `n` friends.\n    *   Number of toasts per friend based on limes: `(c * d) // n`.\n\n3.  **Salt:**\n    *   Total grams of salt available: `p` grams.\n    *   Each friend needs `np` grams of salt per toast.\n    *   So, the total number of \"portions\" of salt (each `np` grams) available is `p / np`.\n    *   These total portions must be divided among the `n` friends.\n    *   Number of toasts per friend based on salt: `(p // np) // n`.\n\nTo find the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, we must take the minimum of the toasts possible based on each resource, as the most limiting resource dictates the final count.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is `min(toasts_per_friend_drink, toasts_per_friend_limes, toasts_per_friend_salt)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input line and split it into integers\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Calculate toasts based on drink\n    # Total milliliters of drink: k * l\n    # Total portions of drink (each nl ml): (k * l) // nl\n    # Toasts per friend from drink: ((k * l) // nl) // n\n    toasts_from_drink = (k * l) // nl // n\n\n    # Calculate toasts based on limes\n    # Total lime slices: c * d\n    # Toasts per friend from limes (each friend needs 1 slice): (c * d) // n\n    toasts_from_limes = (c * d) // n\n\n    # Calculate toasts based on salt\n    # Total grams of salt: p\n    # Total portions of salt (each np grams): p // np\n    # Toasts per friend from salt: (p // np) // n\n    toasts_from_salt = p // np // n\n\n    # The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the minimum of these three\n    result = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_limes, toasts_from_salt)\n\n    # Print the result\n    sys.stdout.write(str(result) + '\\n')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
