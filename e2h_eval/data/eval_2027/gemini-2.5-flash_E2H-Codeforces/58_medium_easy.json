You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Journey of Finding Odd Cycles**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core of this problem is figuring out the fewest edges I need to toss into a graph to force it to have a simple odd-length cycle, and then count how many different ways I can make that happen.\n\nMy first thought is always to understand the heart of what makes an odd cycle tick. It's all about non-bipartiteness. If the original graph isn't bipartite, boom, I already have an odd cycle (and the answer is just one way to create it: do nothing). This means, the initial step is all about determining bipartite-ness of a graph. That's a BFS/DFS check with some clever color-coding.\n\nNow, if the graph is bipartite, things get interesting. I know I have to add at least one edge. The whole \"add one edge\" strategy rests on the principle: connect vertices within the same partition of a bipartite component. Doing so essentially \"closes\" a path and creates that odd cycle. This means a minimum of `t=1` and `w` depends on the count of such possibilities across the components.\n\nNext, the real work starts. I need to figure out the number of ways, `w`, to create the odd cycle. To create the odd cycle I must analyze the connected components. I 2-color them, and focus on those with size 2 or greater. Calculating the possibilities for `w` gets a bit mathy - it's about partitioning and combining, counting the pairings that form the odd cycle. If the bipartite-ness is 1, `t=1` and `w` is the sum of ways to connect two vertices in the same part for all the components.\n\nNow, if that doesn't work (all my bipartite components are either isolated vertices or single edges), I know I need at least two edges (`t=2`). Here, the problem morphs into the idea of creating a triangle (a 3-cycle), since that's the simplest odd cycle I can build. A number of scenarios must be considered: the cases where some existing edges exist between these vertices, or the cases where they are isolated, and therefore I need to add more edges.\n\nIf there's an existing edge, `t` will be 2 because you just pick the third. If all vertices are isolated, I need three edges and `t=3`.\n\nSo, the trick is a clever cascade of checks: is it already non-bipartite? Can I make it with one edge? If not, what's the minimum number of edges to force that triangle or the simplest odd cycle into existence? Then, it's about counting the ways, keeping it all nice and efficient.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so. A simple cycle means each vertex occurs at most once. An odd length cycle must consist of more than one vertex.\n\nThe core concept here is that a graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. Therefore, we are looking for the minimum number of edges to add to make the graph non-bipartite.\n\nWe can analyze the problem by considering possible values for `t`:\n\n**Case 0: `t = 0`**\nThe graph already contains an odd cycle. We can check this by attempting to 2-color the graph using BFS or DFS.\n- Initialize `color` array for all vertices to -1 (uncolored).\n- Iterate through each vertex `i` from 1 to `N`. If `i` is uncolored, start a BFS/DFS from `i`, assigning it color 0.\n- For each neighbor `v` of a vertex `u` with color `c`:\n    - If `v` is uncolored, assign it color `1-c` and add it to the queue/stack.\n    - If `v` is already colored and `color[v] == c`, then we've found an edge connecting two vertices of the same color. This indicates an odd cycle, so the graph is not bipartite.\n- If we find such a conflict in any connected component, then `t = 0` and `w = 1` (there's only one way to add 0 edges: add nothing). We print `0 1` and exit.\n\n**Case 1: `t = 1`**\nIf the graph is bipartite (i.e., `t` is not 0), we need to add at least one edge. Adding a single edge creates an odd cycle if and only if it connects two vertices within the same partition of a bipartite component.\n- After determining the graph is bipartite, we need to count the number of ways to add one edge.\n- For each connected component:\n    - Perform a 2-coloring (this step is already done in Case 0, we just need to collect partition sizes). Let `s0` be the number of vertices in partition 0 and `s1` be the number of vertices in partition 1.\n    - The number of ways to add an edge between two vertices in partition 0 is `s0 * (s0 - 1) / 2`.\n    - The number of ways to add an edge between two vertices in partition 1 is `s1 * (s1 - 1) / 2`.\n    - The total ways for this component is `(s0 * (s0 - 1) // 2) + (s1 * (s1 - 1) // 2)`.\n    - We sum these counts over all connected components. Let this sum be `t1_ways`.\n- If `t1_ways > 0`, then `t = 1` and `w = t1_ways`. We print `1 t1_ways` and exit.\n    - Note that adding an edge between two vertices in the same partition `u, v` cannot be a parallel edge, because existing edges in a bipartite graph always connect vertices from different partitions.\n\n**Case 2: `t = 2` or `t = 3`**\nIf `t` is not 0 or 1, it means the graph is bipartite, and for every connected component, `s0 * (s0 - 1) // 2 + s1 * (s1 - 1) // 2` is 0. This implies that for every component, `s0 < 2` and `s1 < 2`.\nThis condition means every connected component is either:\n    - An isolated vertex (e.g., `s0=1, s1=0` or `s0=0, s1=1`).\n    - A single edge (e.g., `s0=1, s1=1`).\nIn this scenario, we must add at least two edges to form an odd cycle. The simplest odd cycle is a triangle (length 3).\n\nWe need to consider two sub-cases:\n\n2a. **If the graph contains at least one existing edge (`m > 0`):**\n    - We can form a triangle by picking an existing edge `(u, v)` and any third vertex `w` (distinct from `u` and `v`).\n    - Then, we add two new edges: `(u, w)` and `(v, w)`. This forms the triangle `u-w-v-u`.\n    - This requires `t = 2` edges to be added.\n    - The number of ways `w` is `m * (N - 2)`. We choose one of the `m` existing edges, and one of the `N-2` remaining vertices.\n    - These added edges `(u,w)` and `(v,w)` cannot be parallel to existing edges because `w` is distinct from `u,v`. If `w` is an isolated vertex, `(u,w)` and `(v,w)` are new. If `w` is part of another edge `(w,x)`, then `(u,w)` and `(v,w)` are new as well, because `u` and `v` are in different partitions from `w` and `x` in the bipartite graph.\n    - We print `2 (m * (N - 2))` and exit.\n\n2b. **If the graph contains no existing edges (`m = 0`):**\n    - All vertices are isolated.\n    - To form an odd cycle, we must add at least 3 edges to form a triangle.\n    - We pick any three distinct vertices `u, v, w` and add edges `(u, v)`, `(v, w)`, and `(w, u)`.\n    - This requires `t = 3` edges to be added.\n    - The number of ways `w` is `N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) // 6` (the number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices from `N`).\n    - Note: If `N < 3`, this formula correctly yields 0 ways, meaning no such cycle can be formed. The problem statement implies `N >= 3` for an odd cycle to be possible.\n    - We print `3 (N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) // 6)` and exit.\n\nThis covers all possible scenarios.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    edges = [] # Store edges for later use if needed, or just m\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        edges.append((u, v))\n\n    color = [-1] * (n + 1) # -1: uncolored, 0: partition 0, 1: partition 1\n    is_bipartite = True\n\n    # Case 0: Check if graph already contains an odd cycle (t=0)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if color[i] == -1:\n            q = collections.deque()\n            q.append((i, 0))\n            color[i] = 0\n            \n            while q:\n                u, c = q.popleft()\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = 1 - c\n                        q.append((v, 1 - c))\n                    elif color[v] == c:\n                        is_bipartite = False\n                        break\n                if not is_bipartite:\n                    break\n        if not is_bipartite:\n            break\n\n    if not is_bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    # If we reach here, the graph is bipartite.\n    # Case 1: Check if we can form an odd cycle by adding 1 edge (t=1)\n    # Reset colors for a fresh component-wise coloring and counting, or reuse if careful.\n    # Re-initialize color to -1 to ensure correct component processing for counts\n    color = [-1] * (n + 1) \n    t1_ways = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if color[i] == -1: # Unvisited vertex, start BFS for a new component\n            s0 = 0\n            s1 = 0\n            q = collections.deque()\n            q.append((i, 0))\n            color[i] = 0\n            s0_count = 1 # Count for current component's partition 0\n            s1_count = 0 # Count for current component's partition 1\n            \n            component_q_idx = 0\n            component_q = [(i, 0)] # Store (vertex, color) for current component's BFS\n\n            while component_q_idx < len(component_q):\n                u, c = component_q[component_q_idx]\n                component_q_idx += 1\n\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if color[v] == -1:\n                        color[v] = 1 - c\n                        if 1 - c == 0:\n                            s0_count += 1\n                        else:\n                            s1_count += 1\n                        component_q.append((v, 1 - c))\n            \n            # Add ways to form odd cycle within this component\n            t1_ways += s0_count * (s0_count - 1) // 2\n            t1_ways += s1_count * (s1_count - 1) // 2\n\n    if t1_ways > 0:\n        print(f\"1 {t1_ways}\")\n        return\n\n    # If we reach here, t is not 0 or 1.\n    # This means the graph is bipartite, and all components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\n    # Case 2: t=2 or t=3\n\n    if m > 0: # There is at least one edge in the graph\n        # We can form a triangle with t=2.\n        # Pick an existing edge (u, v).
