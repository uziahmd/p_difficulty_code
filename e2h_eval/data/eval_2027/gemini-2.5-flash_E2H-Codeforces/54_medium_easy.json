Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Reflecting on the Angle Problem**\n\nAlright, so I've been tasked with crafting a Python script to find three vertices in a regular n-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a target angle 'a'. My first thought was to dive into the geometry of regular polygons and inscribed angles. It's clear that the vertices of an n-gon lie on a circle, and angles formed by these vertices are inscribed angles, half the measure of the subtended arc.\n\nI started by labeling the vertices from 1 to n. The central angle between adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. Now, the trick is connecting this to the inscribed angle formed by three vertices. I decided to fix the vertex of the angle (v2) as vertex 2. This way, I can analyze the angle v1-2-v3 more systematically. Then the arc between vertices v1 and v3 (excluding v2) is the key. The number of 'steps' along the polygon from v1 to v3 represents the arc length.\n\nAfter some analysis, I derived a formula: if vertex v1 is vertex 1, and v3 is vertex k, the angle 1-2-k equals (k-1) * (180/n). This is the key. Then I did a quick check on this formula for a triangle, square and pentagon. I realized there was a small error. The formula assumes the arc is from vertex 1 to vertex k *not containing the angle vertex*. After making the adjustment by moving my reference to v2 being 1, the new formula is correct, it should be k = number of segments between the vertices and the angle at vertex 1.\n\nSo, the next step is finding a suitable k that gives an angle close to the input 'a'. The angles can range from 180/n to (n-2) * (180/n). I want to minimize the absolute difference `|k * (180/n) - a|`. I realized that this is a search problem where I can iterate through `k` from 1 to `n-2` and calculate the difference. For efficiency, using a base_angle unit simplifies the approach, setting to 180/n. I determined an algorithm where a target k can be determined in O(1) time and added into an array. Finally, I found the k values and selected the one.\n\nNow I need to choose the vertices, once I know `k`. Let's set `v2` as vertex 1, `v1` as vertex 2. Then, `v3` will be `2 + best_k`. This formula ensures `v1, v2, v3` are distinct and valid vertex indices.\n\nI am also making sure to take care of edge cases and making sure it adheres to the prompt requirements.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these three vertices.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular N-gon**\n\n1.  **Inscribed Angles:** All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` with `v2` as the vertex of the angle is an inscribed angle.\n2.  **Angle Measure:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n3.  **Arc Segments:** In a regular `n`-gon, the arc between any two adjacent vertices subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees. Therefore, an arc covering `k` segments (edges of the polygon) subtends a central angle of `k * (360/n)` degrees.\n4.  **Possible Angles:** If an inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends an arc of `k` segments (where `v2` is *not* on this arc), its measure will be `(1/2) * k * (360/n) = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Range of `k`**\n\nLet's fix `v2` (the vertex of the angle) to be vertex 1.\nTo form an angle, `v1` and `v3` must be distinct vertices other than `v2`.\n*   The smallest possible angle occurs when `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to `v2`. For example, `v1=2` and `v3=3`. The arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2=1`) consists of 1 segment (the edge `2-3`). So, `k=1`.\n*   The largest possible angle occurs when `v1` and `v3` are the furthest possible vertices from `v2` while still forming an angle. For example, `v1=2` and `v3=n`. The arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2=1`) consists of `n-2` segments (edges `2-3`, `3-4`, ..., `(n-1)-n`). So, `k=n-2`. This angle `(n-2) * (180/n)` is the internal angle of the regular `n`-gon.\n\nThus, the possible values for `k` (the number of segments in the subtended arc) range from `1` to `n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` that minimizes `|k * (180/n) - a|`.\nLet `base_angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\nWe are looking for `k` such that `k * base_angle_unit` is closest to `a`.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` closest to `a / base_angle_unit`.\nLet `target_k_float = a / base_angle_unit`.\nThe optimal integer `k` will be either `floor(target_k_float)` or `ceil(target_k_float)`, provided these values are within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n\nWe can check these two candidate `k` values:\n1.  `k_floor = int(target_k_float)`\n2.  `k_ceil = int(math.ceil(target_k_float))`\n\nWe add `k_floor` to our candidate list if `1 <= k_floor <= n-2`.\nWe add `k_ceil` to our candidate list if `1 <= k_ceil <= n-2` and `k_ceil` is different from `k_floor` (to avoid duplicate checks if `target_k_float` is an integer).\nThen, we iterate through these (at most two) candidates, calculate `|angle - a|`, and pick the `k` that yields the minimum difference.\n\n**Choosing Vertices `v1, v2, v3`**\n\nOnce we have the `best_k` that minimizes the difference:\nWe can choose `v2` (the angle vertex) to be vertex 1.\nWe can choose `v1` to be vertex 2.\nThen, to ensure the arc `v1-v3` has `best_k` segments, `v3` must be vertex `2 + best_k`.\nThis choice guarantees `v1, v2, v3` are distinct:\n*   `v2 = 1`\n*   `v1 = 2` (distinct from `v2`)\n*   `v3 = 2 + best_k`. Since `best_k >= 1`, `v3 >= 3`, so `v3` is distinct from `v1` and `v2`.\nAlso, since `best_k <= n-2`, `v3 <= 2 + (n-2) = n`, so `v3` is a valid vertex index.\nThe output format is `v1 v2 v3`. So we print `2 1 (2 + best_k)`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`n=4, a=67`)**\n\n1.  `n=4, a=67`.\n2.  `base_angle_unit = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n3.  `target_k_float = 67 / 45.0 = 1.488...`.\n4.  Candidate `k` values:\n    *   `k_floor = int(1.488...) = 1`. This is in `[1, n-2] = [1, 2]`. Add `1`.\n    *   `k_ceil = int(math.ceil(1.488...)) = 2`. This is in `[1, 2]` and `2 != 1`. Add `2`.\n    *   `k_candidates = [1, 2]`.\n5.  Evaluate candidates:\n    *   For `k=1`: `angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`. `diff = abs(45.0 - 67) = 22.0`. `best_k = 1`, `min_diff = 22.0`.\n    *   For `k=2`: `angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`. `diff = abs(90.0 - 67) = 23.0`. `23.0` is not less than `22.0`.\n6.  Optimal `best_k = 1`.\n7.  Output vertices: `v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_k = 2+1 = 3`. Print `2 1 3`. (Matches example output)\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only checks a constant number of `k` values, making it suitable for `n` up to `10^5`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Calculate the base unit angle: the inscribed angle subtending 1 segment.\n    # An arc of 1 segment subtends a central angle of 360/n.\n    # An inscribed angle subtends half of that: (1/2) * (360/n) = 180/n.\n    base_angle_unit = 180.0 / n\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    # The target angle 'a' corresponds to some 'k' segments.\n    # We want k * (180/n) to be close to 'a'.\n    # So, k should be close to a / (180/n) = a * n / 180.\n    target_k_float = a / base_angle_unit\n\n    k_candidates = []\n    \n    # The optimal integer k must be either floor(target_k_float) or ceil(target_k_float).\n    k_floor = int(target_k_float)\n    k_ceil = int(math.ceil(target_k_float))\n\n    # The valid range for k (number of segments in the arc) is from 1 to n-2.\n    # Add k_floor if it's within the valid range.\n    if 1 <= k_floor <= n - 2:\n        k_candidates.append(k_floor)\n    \n    # Add k_ceil if it's within the valid range and different from k_floor.\n    # (k_ceil might be equal to k_floor if target_k_float is an integer)\n    if 1 <= k_ceil <= n - 2 and k_ceil != k_floor:\n        k_candidates.append(k_ceil)\n\n    # Iterate through the candidate k values to find the one that minimizes the difference.\n    for k in k_candidates:\n        current_angle = k * base_angle_unit\n        current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n\n        # If a new minimum difference is found, update best_k.\n        # If current_diff is equal to min_diff, any k is fine, so we keep the first one found.\n        if current_diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = current_diff\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Construct the output vertices using the best_k.\n    # We choose v2 (the angle vertex) to be vertex 1.\n    # We choose v1 to be vertex 2.\n    # Then, to have 'best_k' segments in the arc from v1 to v3 (not containing v2),\n    # v3 should be vertex (2 + best_k).\n    # This ensures v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_k are distinct and valid vertices.\n    v1_out = 2\n    v2_out = 1\n    v3_out = 2 + best_k\n\n    print(v1_out, v2_out, v3_out)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
