    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this string manipulation problem, and my main goal is to figure out the absolute smallest string I can get from a given initial one, using these specific swaps.  The key is that I can swap '0' and '1', and '1' and '2', but never '0' and '2'. This feels like a puzzle with some inherent constraints.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down what these swap rules really mean. It's like '0's and '2's are creating an immutable block. Because I can't directly swap them, their relative order is fixed. If I have \"0...2\" in the initial string, that order will be preserved no matter how I swap the other characters. This is a huge realization!\n\nNow, what about the '1's? They're the wildcards! They can freely move around '0's and '2's.  I can push them anywhere I want, essentially. This is a critical observation for optimizing the final string.\n\nSo, I'm thinking about how to construct the smallest possible string lexicographically.  I know I want the '0's at the beginning, then the '1's, and finally the '2's. But the key is the immutable block formed by '0's and '2's. Since the '0's and '2's need to remain in their original relative positions, I must find the optimal arrangement given the number of each character. It's like building the \"spine\" of the string with the '0's and '2's, and then inserting the '1's in the optimal positions. This means I need to carefully determine where the 0s and 2s can shift while still maintaining their initial relative order. It seems like the position of the 1s relative to the 0s and 2s will be the key to constructing the final string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1', and vice versa.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2', and vice versa.\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' and '2' cannot swap directly. This means if a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it will always appear before that same '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it will always appear before that same '0'. In essence, the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant.\n\nConsider the '1's:\nA '1' can swap with a '0' and also with a '2'. This implies that a '1' can effectively move past any '0' and any '2'. For example, to move a '1' past a sequence \"002\", it can swap with '0' to become \"0102\", then \"0012\". To move past \"20\", it can swap with '2' to become \"210\".\nThis \"freedom of movement\" for '1's means that all '1's can be grouped together. They can be moved to any contiguous block of positions relative to the '0's and '2's.\n\nTo make a string lexicographically smallest, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of '0', '1', and '2' in the input string `s`.\n`count_0`: number of '0's\n`count_1`: number of '1's\n`count_2`: number of '2's\n\nSince '0's and '2's cannot cross each other, the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved. This means we can imagine the '0's and '2's forming a \"skeleton\" for our final string. The '1's can be inserted anywhere into this skeleton.\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. We want to place all '0's first. Can we move all '0's to the very beginning?\n   A '0' can move past any '1'. So, all '0's can move past all '1's that are to their left.\n   However, a '0' cannot move past a '2'. If there is a '2' at some position `k`, and a '0' is at position `j > k`, this '0' cannot move to any position `i < k`.\n   This means all '0's that appear *before the first '2'* in the original string can be moved to the very beginning of the string.\n   All '0's that appear *after the first '2'* in the original string must remain after that '2'. In fact, they must remain after *all* '2's that appeared before them in the original string.\n\nConsider the characters '0' and '2' only. Let's form a string `s_02` by removing all '1's from `s`. The relative order of characters in `s_02` is fixed. For example, if `s = \"100210\"`, `s_02 = \"0020\"`.\nThe '1's can be inserted anywhere into this `s_02` string.\n\nTo make the final string lexicographically smallest:\n- We want to put all '0's first.\n- Then all '1's.\n- Then all '2's.\n\nLet's iterate through the original string `s`.\nWe can collect all '0's that appear before any '2's. These '0's can be moved to the very beginning of the string.\nAll '1's can be grouped together. To make the string lexicographically smallest, these '1's should appear as early as possible.\nThe '2's cannot move past '0's that were initially to their left.\n\nLet's count the total number of '1's. Let this be `num_ones`.\nNow, consider the string formed by all '0's and '2's, maintaining their relative order.\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n`num_ones = 2`\nThe '0's and '2's are `0`, `0`, `2`, `0`. Their relative order is fixed.\n`s_02 = \"0020\"`\n\nTo minimize lexicographically, we want to put as many '0's as possible first.\nAll '0's that appear before the *first* '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning.\nIn `s = \"100210\"`, the '0's before the first '2' are the first two '0's.\nSo, the string will start with these '0's.\n`\"00\"`\n\nNow, where do the '1's go? They can move past '0's. They can move past '2's.\nTo minimize the string, we want to put the '1's after all possible initial '0's.\nSo, after printing all '0's that appear before the first '2', we should print all `num_ones` '1's.\n`\"0011\"`\n\nWhat remains? All '2's, and any '0's that appeared after the first '2' in the original string. These characters must maintain their relative order.\nIn `s = \"100210\"`, the first '2' is at index 3. The '0' at index 5 is after it.\nSo, after `\"0011\"`, we append the '2's and remaining '0's in their original relative order.\nThe substring from `s` starting from the first '2' (inclusive), but excluding any '1's, would be `20`.\nSo, the result is `\"001120\"`.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n1. Count the total number of '1's (`num_ones`).\n2. Construct the result string `res`.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n   a. If `s[i]` is '0', append it to `res`.\n   b. If `s[i]` is '2':\n      This is the first '2' encountered. All '0's encountered so far have been moved to `res`. Now, we must place all '1's, because placing '1's after '0's and before '2's is lexicographically optimal.\n      Append `num_ones` '1's to `res`.\n      Append `s[i]` ('2') to `res`.\n      After this, all subsequent characters (excluding '1's) must be appended to `res` in their original relative order.\n      So, we can break the loop here and append the rest of the characters (excluding '1's) from `s` directly.\n\nThis logic correctly places all '0's that come before the *first* '2', then all '1's, then the first '2', and then the rest of the '0's and '2's in their original relative order. This ensures '0's are as far left as possible, '1's are as far left as possible (after '0's), and '2's respect the '0'-'2' relative order constraint.\n\nExample 1: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `num_ones = 2`.\n2. `res = \"\"`\n3. Iterate `s`:\n   - `s[0] = '1'`: Skip (it's a '1', we'll add all '1's later).\n   - `s[1] = '0'`: `res = \"0\"`.\n   - `s[2] = '0'`: `res = \"00\"`.\n   - `s[3] = '2'`: This is the first '2'.\n     - Append `num_ones` '1's: `res = \"0011\"`.\n     - Append `s[3]` ('2'): `res = \"00112\"`.\n     - Now, append remaining '0's and '2's from `s` (from index 4 onwards), skipping '1's.\n       - `s[4] = '1'`: Skip.\n       - `s[5] = '0'`: `res = \"001120\"`.\n     - Break.\nResult: `\"001120\"`.\n\nExample 2: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `num_ones = 4`.\n2. `res = \"\"`\n3. Iterate `s`:\n   - `s[0] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[1] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[2] = '2'`: This is the first '2'.\n     - Append `num_ones` '1's: `res = \"1111\"`.\n     - Append `s[2]` ('2'): `res = \"11112\"`.\n     - Now, append remaining '0's and '2's from `s` (from index 3 onwards), skipping '1's.\n       - `s[3] = '2'`: `res = \"111122\"`.\n       - `s[4] = '2'`: `res = \"1111222\"`.\n       - `s[5] = '1'`: Skip.\n       - `s[6] = '2'`: `res = \"11112222\"`.\n       - `s[7] = '1'`: Skip.\n     - Break (end of string).\nResult: `\"11112222\"`.\n\nExample 3: `s = \"20\"`\n1. `num_ones = 0`.\n2. `res = \"\"`\n3. Iterate `s`:\n   - `s[0] = '2'`: This is the first '2'.\n     - Append `num_ones` '1's: `res = \"\"`.\n     - Append `s[0]` ('2'): `res = \"2\"`.\n     - Now, append remaining '0's and '2's from `s` (from index 1 onwards), skipping '1's.\n       - `s[1] = '0'`: `res = \"20\"`.\n     - Break (end of string).\nResult: `\"20\"`.\n\nEdge case: String contains no '2's. e.g., `s = \"10010\"`\n1. `num_ones = 2`.\n2. `res = \"\"`\n3. Iterate `s`:\n   - `s[0] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[1] = '0'`: `res = \"0\"`.\n   - `s[2] = '0'`: `res = \"00\"`.\n   - `s[3] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[4] = '0'`: `res = \"000\"`.\n   - Loop finishes. No '2' was found.\n4. If no '2' was found, it means all '0's can be moved to the front. Then all '1's can be moved after them.\n   So, after the loop, if `num_ones` is still positive (and `first_two_idx` was not set), append all '1's.\n   This can be handled by a flag. If a '2' is found, we set a flag (or store its index). If not, we append all '1's at the end of the `res` string.\n\nRefined Algorithm:\n1. Count `num_ones = s.count('1')`.\n2. Initialize `result_parts = []`.\n3. Initialize `found_first_two = False`.\n4. Iterate `i` from `0` to `len(s) - 1`:\n   a. If `s[i] == '0'`:\n      If `not found_first_two`, append '0' to `result_parts`.\n      Else (`found_first_two` is True), append '0' to `result_parts`. (This means '0's after the first '2' are added directly).\n   b. If `s[i] == '1'`: Do nothing (we handle all '1's together).\n   c. If `s[i] == '2'`:\n      If `not found_first_two`:\n         `found_first_two = True`.\n         Append `num_ones` '1's to `result_parts`.\n      Append '2' to `result_parts`.\n5. After the loop, if `not found_first_two` (meaning there were no '2's in the string):\n   Append `num_ones` '1's to `result_parts`.\n6. Join `result_parts` to form the final string.\n\nThis revised algorithm correctly handles the \"no '2's\" case.\nExample: `s = \"10010\"`\n1. `num_ones = 2`.\n2. `result_parts = []`.\n3. `found_first_two = False`.\n4. Iterate `s`:\n   - `s[0] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[1] = '0'`: `not found_first_two` is True. `result_parts = ['0']`.\n   - `s[2] = '0'`: `not found_first_two` is True. `result_parts = ['0', '0']`.\n   - `s[3] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[4] = '0'`: `not found_first_two` is True. `result_parts = ['0', '0', '0']`.\n5. Loop ends. `not found_first_two` is True.\n   Append `num_ones` (2) '1's: `result_parts = ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1']`.\n6. Join: `\"00011\"`. This is correct.\n\nThe implementation can be optimized by building the string parts directly into a list of characters or strings, then joining them.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    result_parts = []\n    \n    found_first_two = False\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            # '0's before the first '2' are collected at the beginning.\n            # '0's after the first '2' are collected in their original relative order.\n            result_parts.append('0')\n        elif char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        elif char == '2':\n            # This is the first '2' we encounter.\n            # All '0's that were before this '2' have already been added to result_parts.\n            # Now, we insert all '1's.\n            # Then we add this '2'.\n            # Any subsequent '0's or '2's will be added in their original relative order.\n            if not found_first_two:\n                # Insert all '1's right before the first '2'\n                # The '0's currently in result_parts are those that appeared before the first '2'.\n                # We need to create a new list: [all_initial_0s] + [all_1s] + [current_2] + [rest_of_0s_and_2s]\n                # To do this, we collect the initial '0's, then append all '1's, then this '2',\n                # and then continue appending '0's and '2's as they appear.\n                \n                # The '0's collected so far are the ones before the first '2'.\n                # We save them, clear result_parts, then rebuild.\n                initial_zeros = \"\".join(result_parts)\n                result_parts = [initial_zeros] + ['1'] * num_ones + ['2']\n                found_first_two = True\n            else:\n                # If it's not the first '2', just append it.\n                result_parts.append('2')\n    \n    # If no '2' was found in the string, all '0's can go first, then all '1's.\n    if not found_first_two:\n        result_parts.append('1' * num_ones)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_parts) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
