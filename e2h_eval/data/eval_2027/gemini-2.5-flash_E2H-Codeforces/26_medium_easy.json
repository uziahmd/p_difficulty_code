Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Strategy for Counting Non-Degenerate Triangles**\n\nAlright, here's my plan. I'm tasked with counting integer triangles with sides `x`, `y`, and `z`, where the sides fall within specific ranges: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`. The key here is the non-degeneracy condition, which means `x + y > z`. Given that `x <= y <= z`, the inequality is simplified: it's the only one I need to explicitly check. The provided ranges mean this order is naturally enforced.\n\nI've got a constraint on the maximum value of `D`, which is 5 * 10<sup>5</sup>, so brute-force triple loops would be far too slow, a big no-no. So, I need an efficient approach!\n\nMy plan: Iterate over all possible pairs of `x` and `y`. For a fixed pair `(x, y)`, I'll calculate how many valid values of `z` exist. The constraints are `C <= z <= D` and `z < x + y`. So for fixed x, y count how many z in  `[C, min(D, x+y-1)]`. The total number of `z` is the key for a fixed `(x, y)` pair.\n\nSumming up all valid `(x,y,z)` triplets is how I will find the result. This would require iterating over all combinations of x, y which can be up to `(B-A+1)*(C-B+1)`. So it's still potentially slow.\n\nNow, a major optimization point! I noticed that the `z` count depends on `x + y` which repeats for different `x`, and `y`.\n\nLet `S = x + y`, and iterate over all valid sums.\n\nFor any given `k = x + y`, I must:\n\n1.  **Count pairs of `x` and `y`:** Determine how many pairs `(x, y)` from the given ranges add up to this `k`. I'll define this count as `count(k)`. This gives the number of (x, y) pairs that give sum = k.\n2.  **Valid `z` values:** Given the constraints, what are the ranges of z values given `k`? These valid `z` values depend on the sum of x and y.\n\nI'll iterate `k` from `A + B` to `B + C`. For each `k`, I'll find `count(k)` by solving for the bounds of `x`, given `x + y = k`. With `x` solved, `y` is just `k - x`, and the valid `y` values can be computed. Next, I find the valid `z` values for this `k`, and multiply `num_x_y_pairs` with `num_z_values` for each iteration.\n\nBy iterating over the sum `k`, I can efficiently count the triangles! Time complexity will be O(B+C). This will allow me to count the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` satisfying the required conditions, and this count will be my final answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x, y, z`, these are:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, it implies `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x <= y <= z` and `x, y, z` being positive integers (since `A >= 1`):\n- `x + z > y` is always true because `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, so `x + z >= 1 + y > y`.\n- `y + z > x` is always true because `y >= x` and `z >= C >= B >= y >= x`, so `y + z >= x + x = 2x`. Since `x >= 1`, `2x >= x+1 > x`.\n\nTherefore, the only condition we need to satisfy for non-degeneracy, given `x <= y <= z`, is `x + y > z`.\n\nCombining all conditions, we need to find the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (which is equivalent to `z <= x + y - 1`)\n\nA naive approach of iterating through `x`, `y`, and `z` would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1))`, which is too slow given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`.\n\nWe can optimize this by iterating over `x` and `y`, and for each pair `(x, y)`, counting the valid `z` values.\nFor a fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy:\n- `C <= z <= D`\n- `z <= x + y - 1`\n\nSo, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `(x, y)` pair is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThis is still `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`, which can be up to `O(5e5 * 5e5) = O(2.5 * 10^11)`, still too slow.\n\nTo further optimize, we can iterate over the sum `k = x + y`.\nThe minimum possible value for `k` is `A + B` (when `x=A, y=B`).\nThe maximum possible value for `k` is `B + C` (when `x=B, y=C`).\nSo, `k` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`. The maximum value for `B + C` is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`.\nIterating `k` from `A+B` to `B+C` is `O(10^6)` operations, which is feasible.\n\nFor each `k` in this range, we need to do two things:\n1. Count the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = k` and `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`. Let this be `num_x_y_pairs`.\n2. For this `k`, calculate the number of valid `z` values. Let this be `num_z_values`.\n\nThe total count of triangles will be the sum of `num_x_y_pairs * num_z_values` over all valid `k`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate `num_x_y_pairs` for a given `k`**\nWe have `x + y = k`, `A <= x <= B`, and `B <= y <= C`.\nFrom `y = k - x`, the condition `B <= y <= C` becomes `B <= k - x <= C`.\nThis implies `k - C <= x <= k - B`.\nCombining with `A <= x <= B`, `x` must satisfy:\n`max(A, k - C) <= x <= min(B, k - B)`.\nLet `x_min_for_k = max(A, k - C)` and `x_max_for_k = min(B, k - B)`.\nThe number of valid `x` values (and thus `(x, y)` pairs) is `num_x_y_pairs = max(0, x_max_for_k - x_min_for_k + 1)`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate `num_z_values` for a given `k`**\nFor a fixed `k = x + y`, `z` must satisfy:\n- `C <= z <= D`\n- `z <= k - 1`\nSo, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, k - 1)]`.\nLet `z_upper_bound = min(D, k - 1)`.\nThe number of valid `z` values is `num_z_values = max(0, z_upper_bound - C + 1)`.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\nInitialize `total_triangles = 0`.\nLoop `k` from `A + B` to `B + C` (inclusive):\n  1. Calculate `x_min_for_k = max(A, k - C)`.\n  2. Calculate `x_max_for_k = min(B, k - B)`.\n  3. Calculate `num_x_y_pairs = max(0, x_max_for_k - x_min_for_k + 1)`.\n  4. If `num_x_y_pairs` is 0, continue to the next `k` (no `(x, y)` pairs exist for this `k`).\n  5. Calculate `z_upper_bound = min(D, k - 1)`.\n  6. Calculate `num_z_values = max(0, z_upper_bound - C + 1)`.\n  7. Add `num_x_y_pairs * num_z_values` to `total_triangles`.\nPrint `total_triangles`.\n\nThe time complexity of this approach is `O(B + C)` because the loop runs `B + C - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1` times, and each iteration takes constant time. Given `C <= 5 * 10^5`, `B + C` can be up to `10^6`, so `O(10^6)` operations is well within typical time limits. Python's arbitrary-precision integers will handle the potentially large `total_triangles` value.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    # Iterate k = x + y\n    # k ranges from A+B to B+C\n    # The loop upper bound is B+C inclusive, so range(start, end+1)\n    for k in range(A + B, B + C + 1):\n        # Calculate num_x_y_pairs for current k\n        # Conditions for x, y:\n        # A <= x <= B\n        # B <= y <= C  and y = k - x\n        # Substitute y: B <= k - x <= C\n        # This implies:\n        # k - x <= C  =>  x >= k - C\n        # B <= k - x  =>  x <= k - B\n        # So, k - C <= x <= k - B\n\n        x_min_for_k = max(A, k - C)\n        x_max_for_k = min(B, k - B)\n\n        # Number of valid x values (and thus (x, y) pairs for this k)\n        # is x_max_for_k - x_min_for_k + 1.\n        # Use max(0, ...) to handle cases where x_max_for_k < x_min_for_k\n        num_x_y_pairs = max(0, x_max_for_k - x_min_for_k + 1)\n\n        if num_x_y_pairs == 0:\n            continue # No (x, y) pairs for this k, so no triangles\n\n        # Calculate num_z_values for current k\n        # Conditions for z:\n        # C <= z <= D\n        # z < x + y  => z < k  => z <= k - 1 (since z is integer)\n        # Combining these: C <= z <= min(D, k - 1)\n\n        z_upper_bound = min(D, k - 1)\n\n        # Number of valid z values for this k\n        # Use max(0, ...) to handle cases where z_upper_bound < C\n        num_z_values = max(0, z_upper_bound - C + 1)\n        \n        # Add the product to the total count\n        total_triangles += num_x_y_pairs * num_z_values\n\n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
