    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Exploration**\n\nOkay, so the problem's about finding a permutation `b` of an array `a` such that the sum of any subset of elements in `a` is *different* from the sum of the corresponding subset in `b`. The constraint on the subset size (not empty and not the whole set) is critical. `n` up to 22 makes me think I'm dealing with something that has at least exponential time complexity, perhaps related to the nature of subsets themselves.\n\n**Analyzing Small Cases**\n\nI started by looking at small values of `n`.  For `n=1`, there's no subset to check, so any permutation works. `n=2` is simple: swapping the two elements gives a valid `b`.\n\n**Formulating the Cyclic Shift Hypothesis**\n\nFor larger `n`, my initial intuition was leaning towards a cyclic shift.  I figured a left cyclic shift, `b_i = a_{(i+1) mod n}`, would distribute the sums differently.  I verified this worked for `n=3`.  I formalized this with the equation `b_i = a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}`.\n\n**Cyclic Shift Testing**\n\nI went deeper into this. I've realized that sums will be equal if `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} b_i`. This means the array indices must be \"transformed\" into an equivalent set under sums. With `b_i = a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}`, I realized that if `S = S'`, and given that the numbers are distinct, their sums should be unique. This would be a promising avenue.\n\n**Subsequent Investigation**\n\nI tried a range of numbers and confirmed the permutation in the example problem. I realized the cyclical shift might not be a general solution. This made me question if the cyclic shift always worked. I saw an example where `b` was `[a_1, a_3, a_0, a_2]`. I was puzzled and went through the steps again for `S={0,2}` and realized it was not quite a standard cyclic shift.\n\n**The Subset Sum Issue**\n\nI kept digging and started thinking about when `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} b_i` *could* happen. The key is in those subsets. I went to subset sums and `sum_{i \\in S} (a_i - a_{(i+1) mod n}) = 0` and this gave me the most insight. It sounds suspiciously like a subset sum variation.\n\n**The Powers of Two Insight**\n\nI then thought about what the problem *does* allow. If the numbers are not \"well-behaved\" it could be much trickier.  I looked at powers of two for distinctness; if `a_i` were powers of two, sums would be unique. This helped clarify how the cyclic shift actually worked.\n\n**Deep Dive into Subset Invariance**\n\nMy line of reasoning lead me to subsets that are \"invariant\" under the cyclic shift (i.e., `S` and `{i+1 mod n}` are the same). It seems like the single cycle only allows the set being equal to the full set, which is not allowed. However, even if two sets of sums (with corresponding numbers) are not the same, the sum can still be the same! For example, `{1, 5} = {2, 4}` in terms of addition.\n\n**Conclusion: Further Examination Required**\n\nI'm now quite sure it's about the subset sum problem. While my initial cyclic shift idea is a good starting point, and I think it probably works for many cases, there are surely pathological examples where it fails. This is because a more generalized cyclic shift can always make the sums equal (even if the sets of numbers are different). The next step is to explore more deeply how to find a more general cyclic permutation or determine if such a permutation always exists. The constraint that `a_i` are distinct is the key. Given arbitrary integers `a_i`, is there always a cyclic shift `p` such that `sum_{i \\in S} a_i != sum_{i \\in S} a_{p(i)}` for all `S`? This is the central question I'm trying to answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` of `n` distinct integers such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i` for `0 < |S| < n`. The constraint `n <= 22` suggests a solution that might involve exponential complexity, possibly `O(n * 2^n)` or `O(n^2 * 2^n)`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i`. This can be rewritten as `sum_{i in S} (a_i - b_i) != 0`.\nLet `c_i = a_i - b_i`. We need `sum_{i in S} c_i != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nA common strategy for permutation problems involving sums is to sort the array `a` first. Let's assume `a` is sorted in ascending order.\n`a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\n\nConsider the permutation `b` where `b_i = a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}`. This is a cyclic shift: `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\nFor this permutation, `c_i = a_i - a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}`.\nThe sum of all `c_i` is `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a_i - a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}) = (a_0 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a_0) = 0`.\nSo, if `S` is the set of all indices, `sum_{i in S} c_i = 0`. However, the problem explicitly excludes `S` being the full set of indices.\n\nThe crucial observation comes from the distinctness of `a_i` and the properties of sums.\nIf `a_i` are sorted, `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\nLet's try to construct `b` such that `b_i` is \"far\" from `a_i`.\nA simple cyclic shift `b_i = a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}` might fail if there's a subset `S` where `sum_{i \\in S} a_i = sum_{i \\in S} a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}`. This is equivalent to `sum_{i \\in S} (a_i - a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}) = 0`.\nFor example, if `a = [1, 5, 2, 6]` and `n=4`. Sorted `a = [1, 2, 5, 6]`.\nLet `a_0=1, a_1=2, a_2=5, a_3=6`.\nCyclic shift `b = [2, 5, 6, 1]`.\n`c = [a_0-a_1, a_1-a_2, a_2-a_3, a_3-a_0] = [1-2, 2-5, 5-6, 6-1] = [-1, -3, -1, 5]`.\nIf `S = {0, 2}`, `sum_{i \\in S} c_i = c_0 + c_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2 \\neq 0`.\nIf `S = {0, 1, 2}`, `sum_{i \\in S} c_i = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = -1 + (-3) + (-1) = -5 \\neq 0`.\nIt seems the cyclic shift often works.\n\nThe example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]` for `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]` is `b = [a_1, a_3, a_0, a_2]`.\nThis is also a cyclic shift of indices, just not `(i+1)%n`. Specifically, it uses the permutation `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)` which is a single cycle `(0 1 3 2)`. So `b_i = a_{p(i)}`.\nThe general argument that `sum_{i \\in S} a_i = sum_{i \\in S} a_{p(i)}` implies `S` is invariant under `p` (which is only true for empty or full set `S` if `p` is a single cycle of length `n`) is flawed. It only implies that the *multisets* of values are the same. Since `a_i` are distinct, it implies the *sets* of values are the same. But having different sets of values does not guarantee different sums. E.g. `{1, 6}` and `{2, 5}` both sum to 7.\n\nThe key insight for this problem, given `N <= 22`, is that we can use meet-in-the-middle or a similar technique if we need to check subset sums. However, the problem asks for *any* valid `b`.\n\nLet's re-examine the condition `sum_{i \\in S} (a_i - b_i) \\neq 0`.\nConsider the specific permutation where `b_i = a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}`. This is equivalent to sorting `a` first, then applying the cyclic shift.\n`a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\n`b_0 = a_1, b_1 = a_2, ..., b_{n-1} = a_0`.\nThen `c_i = a_i - b_i = a_i - a_{(i+1) \\pmod n}`.\nFor `i = 0, ..., n-2`, `a_i < a_{(i+1)}`, so `c_i = a_i - a_{(i+1)} < 0`.\nFor `i = n-1`, `c_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0 > 0`.\nSo, we have `n-1` negative `c_i` values and one positive `c_i` value.\nLet `C_neg = {c_0, ..., c_{n-2}}` and `C_pos = {c_{n-1}}`.\nWe need `sum_{i \\in S} c_i \\neq 0`.\nThe sum of all `c_i` is 0: `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i = (sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i) + c_{n-1} = 0`.\nThis means `c_{n-1} = -sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i`. Since `c_i < 0` for `i < n-1`, `-sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i` is a positive sum of absolute values.\nSo `c_{n-1} = |c_0| + |c_1| + ... + |c_{n-2}|`.\n\nNow, consider any non-empty proper subset `S`.\nCase 1: `n-1 \\notin S`.\nThen `S` only contains indices from `{0, ..., n-2}`. All `c_i` for `i \\in S` are negative.\nTherefore, `sum_{i \\in S} c_i` will be a sum of negative numbers, which must be strictly negative. So `sum_{i \\in S} c_i \\neq 0`. This case is fine.\n\nCase 2: `n-1 \\in S`.\nLet `S' = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`. `S'` is a subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\n`sum_{i \\in S} c_i = c_{n-1} + sum_{i \\in S'} c_i`.\nWe know `c_{n-1} = -sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i`.\nSo, `sum_{i \\in S} c_i = (-sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i) + sum_{i \\in S'} c_i`.\nThis sum is 0 if and only if `sum_{i \\in S'} c_i = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i`.\nThis can only happen if `S'` is equal to `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nIf `S' = {0, ..., n-2}`, then `S = {0, ..., n-1}`, which is the full set of indices. But the problem excludes the full set of indices.\nSince `S` is a proper subset, `S'` must be a proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nIf `S'` is a proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`, then `sum_{i \\in S'} c_i` is a sum of some negative numbers.\n`sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i` is the sum of *all* negative `c_i` values.\nSince all `c_i` for `i < n-1` are strictly negative, and `S'` is a proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`, it means `S'` is missing at least one index `j` from `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nTherefore, `sum_{i \\in S'} c_i > sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i` (because `sum_{i \\in S'} c_i - sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i = -sum_{j \\in \\{0,..,n-2\\}\\setminus S'} c_j > 0`).\nSo, `sum_{i \\in S'} c_i \\neq sum_{i=0}^{n-2} c_i`.\nThis means `sum_{i \\in S} c_i \\neq 0`.\n\nThis logic holds for all `n > 1`.\nFor `n=1`, `0 < k < n` is impossible, so any `b` is valid. The only permutation is `b=a`.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is:\n1. Handle `n=1`: print `a_0`.\n2. For `n > 1`:\n   a. Create pairs `(a_i, i)` to keep track of original indices.\n   b. Sort these pairs based on `a_i` values. Let the sorted array be `sorted_a`.\n   c. Construct `b` by taking elements from `sorted_a` in a cyclic shift. Specifically, `b[original_index_of_sorted_a[j]] = sorted_a[(j+1)%n].value`.\n   d. Print `b`.\n\nLet's walk through an example: `n=4`, `a=[1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n1. Original array with indices: `[(1000,0), (100,1), (10,2), (1,3)]`.\n2. Sort by value: `sorted_a = [(1,3), (10,2), (100,1), (1000,0)]`.\n   Let's denote `sorted_a[j]` as `(value_j, original_idx_j)`.\n   `sorted_a[0] = (1,3)`\n   `sorted_a[1] = (10,2)`\n   `sorted_a[2] = (100,1)`\n   `sorted_a[3] = (1000,0)`\n3. Construct `b`. `b` will be an array of size `n` initialized to zeros.\n   `b[original_idx_j] = value_{(j+1)%n}`\n   - For `j=0`: `b[original_idx_0] = value_1`. `b[3] = 10`.\n   - For `j=1`: `b[original_idx_1] = value_2`. `b[2] = 100`.\n   - For `j=2`: `b[original_idx_2] = value_3`. `b[1] = 1000`.\n   - For `j=3`: `b[original_idx_3] = value_0`. `b[0] = 1`.\n   So `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\n\nLet's check this `b` against the example's `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n`a_0=1000, a_1=100, a_2=10, a_3=1`.\n`b_0=1, b_1=1000, b_2=100, b_3=10`.\n`|S|=1`:\n`S={0}`: `a_0=1000, b_0=1`. OK.\n`S={1}`: `a_1=100, b_1=1000`. OK.\n`S={2}`: `a_2=10, b_2=100`. OK.\n`S={3}`: `a_3=1, b_3=10`. OK.\n`|S|=2`:\n`S={0,1}`: `a_0+a_1=1100, b_0+b_1=1+1000=1001`. OK.\n`S={0,2}`: `a_0+a_2=1010, b_0+b_2=1+100=101`. OK.\n`S={0,3}`: `a_0+a_3=1001, b_0+b_3=1+10=11`. OK.\n`S={1,2}`: `a_1+a_2=110, b_1+b_2=1000+100=1100`. OK.\n`S={1,3}`: `a_1+a_3=101, b_1+b_3=1000+10=1010`. OK.\n`S={2,3}`: `a_2+a_3=11, b_2+b_3=100+10=110`. OK.\nThis solution `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]` is different from the example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`, but it also satisfies all conditions. The problem states \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\"\n\nThis approach seems robust and covers all cases for `n > 1`.\n\nFinal check for edge cases:\n- `n=1`: Input `1\\n5`. Output `5`. (Handled)\n- `n=2`: Input `2\\n1 2`. `sorted_a = [(1,0), (2,1)]`.\n  `b[0] = 2`, `b[1] = 1`. Output `2 1`. (Matches example)\n\nThe logic relies on `a_i` being distinct, which is given.\nThe time complexity will be dominated by sorting, `O(N log N)`. This is very efficient for `N=22`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Store (value, original_index) pairs\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort based on values\n    indexed_a.sort()\n\n    # Construct the result array b\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # Apply the cyclic shift: b[original_index_of_indexed_a[j]] = value_of_indexed_a[(j+1)%n]\n    for j in range(n):\n        current_val, original_idx = indexed_a[j]\n        next_val, _ = indexed_a[(j + 1) % n]\n        b[original_idx] = next_val\n    \n    print(*(b))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
