For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script that can classify triads (three notes) as major, minor, or something \"strange.\"  The problem is well-defined, and the core concept is pretty straightforward, but there are a few nuances to consider.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the notes numerically.  That's easy enough: map C to 0, C# to 1, and so on up to B/H as 11.  The cyclic nature of the notes is key, which means I'll use modulo 12 to calculate distances.  The distance between two notes, say X and Y, will be `(Y - X + 12) % 12`. This handles the circular wrapping around the octave.\n\nThe heart of the problem lies in recognizing major and minor triads. The definitions give me the crucial intervals: major triads have intervals of 4 and 3 semitones, while minor triads are 3 and 4 semitones. The key is that the *order* of the notes matters in terms of these intervals. It's not simply about sorting and checking.\n\nThe input is three space-separated notes, and the output is a string (\"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\"). The problem guarantees that there's an unambiguous answer.\n\nInitially, I thought sorting the notes numerically would be enough. However, the problem explicitly mentions that there exists *some* ordering that satisfies the major/minor intervals. This forces me to consider all possible orderings/permutations of the three notes.\n\nSo, here's my revised plan.\n\n1.  **Read and Parse:**  Read the input string and split it into the three note names.\n2.  **Convert to Numbers:** Map the note names to their corresponding integer values (0-11).\n3.  **Permute:** Generate all possible orderings (permutations) of these three numerical representations.  Six possibilities, to be exact.\n4.  **Calculate Distances and Check:** For each permutation, calculate the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third.  If I find a combination of 4 and 3 (in either order), I classify it accordingly and stop. Otherwise, it's \"strange\".\n5.  **Return Output:** Output the classification: \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".\n\nThis approach is computationally slightly more expensive than sorting and a simple comparison. However, it explicitly addresses the problem's requirement of finding *any* valid ordering.  I should be able to implement this efficiently in Python.\n",
