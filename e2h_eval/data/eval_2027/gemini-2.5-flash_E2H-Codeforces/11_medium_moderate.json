A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Final Solution for \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I've got this. The \"Soft Drinking\" problem wants the maximum number of toasts friends can make, given limited resources. It's all about finding the bottleneck.  I'll read in the input, which is eight integers. The problem specifies the number of friends (`n`), drink bottles (`k`), drink per bottle (`l`), limes (`c`), lime slices per lime (`d`), salt (`p`), drink needed per toast (`nl`), and salt needed per toast (`np`).  The trick is to calculate the *total* toasts possible with each resource.\n\nFirst, calculate the total drink (`k * l`), lime slices (`c * d`), and salt (`p`). Then, calculate the \"individual toasts\" that *could* be made with each resource, *before* considering sharing. For drink, divide the total milliliters by the milliliters needed per toast per friend (`k * l // nl`). For limes, it's simply the total slices available. For salt, divide total grams by grams needed per toast per friend (`p // np`). The smallest of these three \"individual toast\" counts represents the *total* toasts possible *across all friends* due to the limiting resource. Now, since each friend makes the same amount of toasts, divide the total number of \"individual toasts\" possible by the number of friends (`n`).  That result, using integer division, is the maximum toasts each friend can make.  The edge cases are handled since all input numbers are positive integers. The code reads the input, calculates the results, and prints the integer answer. No need for complex imports; just `sys` for reading from stdin. Integer division is critical to avoid fractional toasts. Done.\n",
