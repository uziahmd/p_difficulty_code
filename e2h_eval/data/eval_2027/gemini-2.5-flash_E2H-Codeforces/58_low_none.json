You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Vitaly and Cycle\" Problem: A Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vitaly and Cycle\" problem, and I need a Python solution. The objective is to figure out the *minimum* number of edges, `t`, to add to a given graph to make an *odd-length simple cycle*, and then count the number of ways, `w`, to do that.  First, let's establish some ground rules.  We have an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, with no self-loops or parallel edges. It might not be connected.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down into cases.\n\n*   **Case 0: Odd Cycle Already Exists:** The easiest scenario. If the graph already has an odd cycle, then `t` is trivially 0, and there's only one way to achieve this (by not adding any edges). The key here is to efficiently check if the graph is bipartite because a graph has an odd cycle *if and only if* it's not bipartite.  BFS or DFS, with color assignment, seems ideal for this check. If I find an edge between vertices with the same color, boom, odd cycle detected.\n\n*   **Case 1: Bipartite Graph:** If it's bipartite, no odd cycles exist, so I have to add edges. The intuition is that to create an odd cycle in a bipartite graph, you need to add an edge connecting vertices *within the same partition*. Let's call the partitions L and R. An added edge `(u, v)` where both `u` and `v` are in either L or R would be the necessary edge. Now, I need to consider each connected component within this graph individually. I have a partition with size `L_i` and `R_i`. The edges I add have to be between two nodes in the same partition.\n\nThe minimum number of edges `t` is, therefore, 1. The edge can be `(u,v)` where `u` and `v` are within either `L_i` or `R_i`.  The number of ways `w` to do this will involve some combinatorics. For each connected component, I'll calculate `(|L_i| * (|L_i| - 1) / 2)` and `(|R_i| * (|R_i| - 1) / 2)`. Summing these values across all components gives me the total number of ways.\nIf, for some reason, the partitions of all connected components have fewer than 2 nodes, then it means that it's impossible to create an edge between two nodes in the same partition.  If `n=1`, we do nothing. if `n=2`, and `m=0`, partitions are `{1}, {2}`, and we need to add an edge. In this case, we have to connect vertices from *different* components.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w` - the number of ways to do so.\n\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. We can check for bipartiteness using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) by attempting to 2-color the graph.\n\nLet's analyze the cases:\n\n**Case 0: The graph already contains an odd cycle.**\nIf the graph is not bipartite, it already has an odd cycle. In this case, `t = 0` and `w = 1` (there's one way: add no edges).\n\n**Case 1: The graph is bipartite.**\nIf the graph is bipartite, we need to add at least one edge to create an odd cycle.\nDuring the bipartiteness check (e.g., using BFS), we can partition each connected component into two sets, say `color[v] = 0` and `color[v] = 1`.\nAn odd cycle is formed by adding an edge between two vertices that have the same color in their respective connected component.\n\n*   **Minimum edges `t = 1`**:\n    If we can add a single edge to form an odd cycle, this is the minimum. This happens if there exist two distinct vertices `u` and `v` in the same connected component such that `u` and `v` have the same color (i.e., they are in the same partition set). Adding an edge `(u, v)` will create an odd cycle.\n    The number of ways `w` to do this is the sum, over all connected components `i`, of:\n    `(count_0_i * (count_0_i - 1) / 2)` + `(count_1_i * (count_1_i - 1) / 2)`\n    where `count_0_i` is the number of vertices in partition 0 of component `i`, and `count_1_i` is the number of vertices in partition 1 of component `i`.\n    This scenario is possible if and only if at least one connected component has `count_0_i >= 2` or `count_1_i >= 2`.\n\n*   **Minimum edges `t = 2`**:\n    If `t = 1` is not possible, it means that for every connected component, both `count_0_i < 2` and `count_1_i < 2`. This implies that every connected component is either a single isolated vertex (`count_0=1, count_1=0` or `count_0=0, count_1=1`) or a single edge (`count_0=1, count_1=1`). In such a graph, any two vertices in the same partition are identical, so we cannot add an edge between distinct vertices of the same color within a component.\n    To form an odd cycle, we must connect vertices from different components.\n    Consider two distinct connected components, say `C_i` and `C_j`. Let `u` be a vertex in `C_i` and `v` be a vertex in `C_j`. We can add an edge `(u, v)`. Now `C_i` and `C_j` merge into a larger component. We still need to create an odd cycle. If the new component is bipartite, we need to add another edge.\n    If we add two edges `(u, v)` and `(v, w)` such that `u` and `w` are in the same partition of the combined graph (after adding `(u,v)`), then `(u, v, w)` forms an odd path (length 2) and adding `(u, w)` would form an odd cycle.\n    A simpler approach for `t=2`:\n    Take two distinct connected components, `C_i` and `C_j`. Pick a vertex `u` from `C_i` and a vertex `v` from `C_j`. Add an edge `(u, v)`. Now `C_i` and `C_j` are connected. This new combined component is still bipartite. To make it non-bipartite, we need to add another edge. We pick another vertex `x` from `C_i` (where `x` is distinct from `u`) and `y` from `C_j` (where `y` is distinct from `v`). If we add edge `(u,v)` and then `(x,y)`, this creates an odd cycle if `u` and `x` have the same color, and `v` and `y` have the same color.\n    No, this is not quite right.\n    To create an odd cycle with 2 edges, we need to pick 3 vertices `u, v, w`. Add edges `(u, v)` and `(v, w)`. This forms a path of length 2. If `u` and `w` are in the same partition of the *original* graph (i.e., they have the same color and are in the same component), then adding `(u, w)` would create an odd cycle. But we are in the `t=2` case, so `u` and `w` must be in *different* components.\n    So, we need to pick two vertices `u` and `v` from different components. Add an edge `(u, v)`. This connects them. The combined component is still bipartite. Now we need to add another edge `(x, y)` to make an odd cycle.\n    The minimum number of edges to connect three distinct components (say, `C_1, C_2, C_3`) is 2. For example, add `(v_1, v_2)` and `(v_2, v_3)` where `v_i \\in C_i`. This forms a path `v_1 - v_2 - v_3`. This path has length 2. If `v_1` and `v_3` are in the same partition *of the combined component formed by `C_1, C_2, C_3`*, then adding an edge `(v_1, v_3)` would form an odd cycle.\n    The colors of `v_1` and `v_3` in the combined component are `color(v_1)` and `color(v_2) + 1 (mod 2)`. And `color(v_3)` is `color(v_2) + 1 (mod 2)`. So `color(v_1)` and `color(v_3)` are the same.\n    Thus, if `n >= 3`, we can pick three distinct vertices `v_1, v_2, v_3` (each from a potentially different component). Add edges `(v_1, v_2)` and `(v_2, v_3)`. This forms a path of length 2. This path, combined with the \"virtual\" edge between `v_1` and `v_3` (which would have the same color if `v_1` and `v_3` were in the same component), creates an odd cycle.\n    The number of ways `w` for `t=2`:\n    Pick any 3 distinct vertices `u, v, w`. Add edges `(u, v)` and `(v, w)`. This uses 2 edges. The cycle formed is `u-v-w-u`. This cycle has length 3, which is odd.\n    The number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices is `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`. For each set of 3 vertices `{u, v, w}`, there are 3 ways to choose the \"middle\" vertex (e.g., `v` in `u-v-w-u`). So, `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 2` ways to choose the ordered path `u-v-w` (where `v` is the middle vertex).\n    This is `t = 2`. This case applies if `n >= 3` and `t=1` is not possible.\n\n*   **Minimum edges `t = 3`**:\n    If `t = 2` is not possible, it means `n < 3`.\n    If `n = 0, 1, 2`, we need to add `t=3` edges to form a 3-cycle.\n    If `n=0` or `n=1`, it's impossible to form a cycle. The problem states \"cycle of more than one vertex\", and usually `n>=3` for a cycle. Let's assume `n>=3` for `t=2`.\n    For `n=2`, we cannot form a 3-cycle. The only cycle possible is a 2-cycle (not simple) or a 3-cycle (not possible).\n    If `n=2`, the graph consists of two vertices `1` and `2`.\n    - If `m=0`, partitions are `{1}` and `{2}`. `t=1` is not possible. `t=2` requires 3 vertices, not possible. So we need `t=3`. We can add edges `(1,1), (1,2), (2,1)` - but loops and parallel edges are prohibited. This implies we need `n>=3` for a 3-cycle.\n    - If `n=2, m=1` (edge `(1,2)`), the graph is bipartite. Partitions are `{1}` and `{2}`. `t=1` not possible. `t=2` not possible.\n    The problem statement implies `n>=3` for a cycle of length 3.\n    If `n < 3`, we can't form a 3-cycle. The problem states \"simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex\". The smallest odd cycle is length 3.\n    If `n=0, 1, 2`, it's impossible to form a cycle of length 3.\n    However, the example `3 0` -> `3 1` suggests that for `n=3, m=0`, `t=3`. This implies we add edges `(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)`. There's only 1 way to do this.\n\nLet's refine the logic based on `n`:\n\n1.  **Check for existing odd cycle (bipartiteness)**:\n    Perform BFS/DFS for each connected component.\n    Initialize `color` array with -1 (unvisited).\n    For each unvisited vertex `s`:\n        Start BFS from `s`, setting `color[s] = 0`.\n        Maintain `count_0` and `count_1` for the current component.\n        If an edge `(u, v)` is found where `color[u] == color[v]`, then an odd cycle exists. Set `t = 0, w = 1` and terminate.\n        If BFS completes for a component, store `(count_0, count_1)` for that component.\n\n2.  **If the graph is bipartite (no odd cycle found in step 1)**:\n    We need to add edges.\n\n    *   **Attempt `t = 1`**:\n        Iterate through all connected components' `(count_0, count_1)` pairs.\n        If any `count_0 >= 2` or `count_1 >= 2`, then `t = 1` is possible.\n        Calculate `w = sum(count_0 * (count_0 - 1) / 2 + count_1 * (count_1 - 1) / 2)` over all components.\n        This is the minimum `t`.\n\n    *   **Attempt `t = 2`**:\n        If `t = 1` was not possible, it means all components have `count_0 < 2` and `count_1 < 2`. This implies components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\n        If `n >= 3`, we can always pick three distinct vertices `u, v, w`. Adding edges `(u, v)` and `(v, w)` forms a path `u-v-w`. This path has length 2. If `u` and `w` are connected by an edge, it forms a 3-cycle. Since `u, v, w` are distinct, adding `(u,v)` and `(v,w)` creates a path of length 2. The vertices `u` and `w` are at an even distance (2) from each other in the new graph. If we were to add an edge `(u,w)`, it would create an odd cycle of length 3.\n        The number of ways to pick 3 distinct vertices `u, v, w` and form edges `(u,v)` and `(v,w)` is `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 2`.\n        So, if `n >= 3` and `t=1` is not possible, then `t = 2` and `w = n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 2`.\n\n    *   **Attempt `t = 3`**:\n        If `t = 2` was not possible, it means `n < 3`.\n        If `n=0` or `n=1`: No cycle is possible. The problem statement implies `n>=3` for a cycle. This case should not occur if a solution is always possible.\n        If `n=2`: We have two vertices. A cycle must have length at least 3 to be odd. A 3-cycle requires 3 vertices. Thus, it's impossible to form an odd cycle with `n=2` vertices. This seems to be a contradiction with the problem statement that a solution always exists.\n        However, the example `3 0` -> `3 1` confirms that if `n=3, m=0`, we add `(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)` for `t=3, w=1`. This is for a specific set of 3 vertices.\n        So, if `n < 3` (which means `n=0, 1, 2`), it's impossible to form a 3-cycle. But if `n=3` and `t=1, t=2` are not possible (e.g., `m=0`), then `t=3, w=1`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the `t=2` and `t=3` cases more carefully for `n < 3`.\nThe problem implies \"simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex\". Smallest odd length is 3. A simple cycle of length 3 requires 3 distinct vertices.\nTherefore, if `n < 3`, it's impossible to form such a cycle. The problem's constraints `1 <= n <= 10^5` usually mean a solution always exists.\nSo, if `n=1` or `n=2`, it should be impossible. But the examples and typical competitive programming problems imply a solution is always found. The example `3 0 -> 3 1` confirms `n=3, m=0` leads to `t=3`.\n\nFinal refined logic:\n\n1.  **Bipartiteness check**:\n    Use BFS/DFS.

We assume this implies `n` is large enough.\n\nThe problem statement \"simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex\" implies length at least 3.\nSo for `n=1, n=2`, it's impossible to form such a cycle. The problem should guarantee `n>=3` if a solution always exists.\nGiven `1 <= n <= 10^5`, if `n=1` or `n=2`, it's impossible.\nThe example `3 0 -> 3 1` is key. It indicates that `n=3, m=0` is `t=3`.\nThis is consistent with `t=1` not being possible (no component has >=2 vertices in one partition), and `t=2` not being possible (no two vertices are connected by an edge, so cannot form a 2-path `u-v-w` to connect `u` and `w`).\nSo, the `t=2` case needs to be `n_comp_nodes >= 3` (number of vertices in components that are NOT isolated).\nNo, `n_comp_nodes` doesn't make sense.\nThe `t=2` logic (connecting 3 vertices `u, v, w` with `(u,v)` and `(v,w)`) works if `u,v,w` are *distinct* vertices.\nIf `n=3, m=0`, then `1,2,3` are isolated. We can pick `u=1, v=2, w=3`. Adding `(1,2)` and `(2,3)` forms a path. Now `1` and `3` are in different components. We need to add `(1,3)` to make an odd cycle. This means adding 3 edges.\nSo `t=2` is applicable only if there is at least one edge in the graph.\nIf `m=0`, then `t=2` is not possible.\n\nRevised logic for `t=2`:\nIf `t=1` is not possible, it means all components are either single vertices or single edges.\nTo create an odd cycle of length 3 with 2 added edges, we need to pick 3 vertices `u, v, w` and add `(u,v)` and `(v,w)`. This forms a path `u-v-w`. This path itself is not a cycle. To form a cycle of length 3, we would need to add `(u,w)`. This would be 3 added edges.\nThe `t=2` case is about forming an odd cycle of length 3 by adding two edges `(u,v)` and `(v,w)` where `u` and `w` are already connected by an edge, or more generally, `u` and `w` are in the same partition of some connected component.\nNo, that's `t=1`.\n\nLet's rethink `t=2` based on the bipartite property.\nIf the graph is bipartite, we want to add `k` edges to make it non-bipartite.\nMinimum `k=1`: add an edge between two same-colored vertices in a component. This is `t1_ways`.\nMinimum `k=2`: If `t1_ways=0`, we need to add at least 2 edges.\nConsider adding `(u,v)` and `(x,y)`.\nIf `u,v,x,y` are all distinct, this adds two edges.\nIf `u,v,x` are distinct, `y=v`. Add `(u,v)` and `(x,v)`. This creates a path `u-v-x`. If `u` and `x` are in the same component and have the same color, adding `(u,x)` would create an odd cycle. But `t1_ways=0` means this is not possible.\nSo `u` and `x` must be in different components.\nIf we add `(u,v)` and `(v,x)` where `u,v,x` are distinct vertices, we create a path `u-v-x`. This path has length 2.\nThe vertices `u` and `x` are now connected by a path of length 2. In a bipartite graph, if two vertices are connected by an even length path, they are in the same partition. So `u` and `x` are effectively \"same-colored\" in the new structure (if `v` is a \"pivot\").\nIf we add an edge `(u,x)` in addition to `(u,v)` and `(v,x)`, this forms a 3-cycle `u-v-x-u`. This takes 3 edges.\n\nThe `t=2` case must be:\nWe pick two distinct connected components, `C_1` and `C_2`.\nPick a vertex `u` from `C_1` and `v` from `C_2`. Add edge `(u, v)`.\nThe graph is still bipartite.\nNow we need to add another edge to make an odd cycle.\nPick another vertex `x` from `C_1` (distinct from `u`) and `y` from `C_2` (distinct from `v`).\nAdd edge `(x, y)`.\nNow we have edges `(u, v)` and `(x, y)`.\nIf `u` and `x` are in same partition of `C_1`, and `v` and `y` are in same partition of `C_2`, then `u-v-y-x-u` forms an odd cycle of length 4+1=5. This requires `|C_1| >= 2` and `|C_2| >= 2`.\nThis is `t=2`.\nNumber of ways:\nSum over all pairs of distinct components `(C_i, C_j)`:\n`(|L_i| * |L_j| * |R_i| * |R_j|)` (if `u,x \\in L_i`, `v,y \\in L_j` or `u,x \\in R_i`, `v,y \\in R_j`)\nNo, this is too complex.\n\nLet's stick to the simplest interpretation of forming an odd cycle: a 3-cycle.\nA 3-cycle `u-v-w-u` needs 3 vertices and 3 edges.\nIf we add `t` edges, the total number of edges is `m+t`.\nIf `t=0`: Graph already has an odd cycle.\nIf `t=1`: Add `(u,v)` where `u,v` are same color in a bipartite component.\nIf `t=2`: Add `(u,v)` and `(v,w)`. This forms a path `u-v-w`. This path has length 2. If `u` and `w` are in the same partition of the *original* graph (i.e., they have the same color and are in the same component), then adding `(u,w)` would create an odd cycle. But `t=1` would have covered this.\nSo `u` and `w` must be in *different* components.\nWe need to connect 3 vertices `u, v, w`.\nIf `u,v,w` are in 3 different components, say `C_u, C_v, C_w`. Add `(u,v)` and `(v,w)`. This connects them. The resulting structure is bipartite.\nTo make an odd cycle of length 3, we need to add `(u,w)`. This means `t=3`.\n\nThe only way `t=2` makes sense for forming a 3-cycle is if one of the edges already exists.\nSuppose we have an edge `(u,v)`. We want to form `u-v-w-u`. We need to add `(v,w)` and `(w,u)`. This is `t=2`.\nThis is possible if `n >= 3`.\nThe number of ways `w` for `t=2` (adding two edges to form a 3-cycle with one existing edge):\nPick an existing edge `(a,b)`. Pick a third vertex `c` not `a` or `b`. Add edges `(a,c)` and `(b,c)`. This forms a 3-cycle `a-b-c-a`.\nThe number of ways is `m * (n-2)`.\nThis applies if `m > 0` and `n >= 3`.\n\nSo, the logic should be:\n1.  Bipartiteness check. If not bipartite, `t=0, w=1`.\n2.  If bipartite:\n    a.  Calculate `t1_ways`. If `t1_ways > 0`: `t=1, w=t1_ways`.\n    b.  Else (`t1_ways == 0`):\n        i.  If `m > 0` and `n >= 3`: `t=2, w = m * (n-2)`.\n            This means we pick an existing edge `(u,v)` and a third vertex `w`. Add `(u,w)` and `(v,w)`. This forms a 3-cycle.\n        ii. Else if `n >= 3`: (`m == 0` and `n >= 3`). This is `n=3, m=0` case from example.\n            `t=3, w=1`. (Only one way to form `1-2-3-1` with 3 vertices).\n        iii. Else (`n < 3`): This implies `n=1` or `n=2`. It's impossible to form a 3-cycle.\n             The problem must implicitly assume `n>=3` for a solution to exist for `t=2` or `t=3`.\n             If `n=1` or `n=2`, `t1_ways=0` is always true. `m=0` or `m=1` for `n=2`.\n             For `n=2, m=0`: `t1_ways=0`, `m=0`, `n<3`.\n             For `n=2, m=1`: `t1_ways=0`, `m>0`, `n<3`.\n             These cases are impossible for a 3-cycle.\n             Since the problem guarantees a solution, there must be an implicit constraint `n>=3` for these cases.\n             Or perhaps the output for `n<3` is `0 0` (impossible)? No, problem usually specifies.\n\nLet's assume the problem always has a valid `t, w` output. This means `n>=3` is implied for cases where `t>1`.\n\nFinal Algorithm:\n\n1.  Read `n, m`.\n2.
