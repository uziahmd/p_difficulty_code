Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process on how to tackle this problem:**\n\nMy goal is to find three vertices of a regular n-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a given angle 'a'.  The core idea hinges on understanding the geometry of regular polygons and inscribed angles.  First, I'll need a way to relate the number of sides of the polygon to the actual angle formed.\n\nI'll start by numbering the vertices from 0 to n-1.  Without loss of generality, I can fix one vertex, say vertex '0', as the vertex of the angle I want to calculate.  Let's call the other two vertices 'i' and 'j'. The angle 'i-0-j' is an inscribed angle.  The key is that the inscribed angle is half of the central angle that spans the same arc.\n\nThe central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.  So, the arc between vertices 'i' and 'j' that *doesn't* contain vertex 0 determines the angle.  If there are 'k' sides between 'i' and 'j' along this arc, then the central angle is k * (360/n) degrees, and the inscribed angle is half of that, so k * (180/n) degrees. The critical thing here is that 'k' must be at least 1, and no more than n-2 because our three vertices must be distinct.\n\nMy next step is to figure out how to find the *best* value for 'k'. I want to minimize the difference between the actual angle (which is k * 180/n) and the target angle 'a'.  This can be done with a simple search, iterating through possible values of k from 1 to n-2, calculating each angle, and keeping track of the one that gets the closest to the target.\n\nI can optimize this search a bit. The function k * (180/n) is monotonic, so I could use a form of binary search for finding the optimal 'k', or I can directly calculate `target_k_float = a * n / 180.0`. This gives me the real number value `k` should be. I round it down, and up, to get two candidate k's (floor and ceil). Then I just check these two k's (or 1 if the target is small, or n-2 if it's large). This significantly reduces the time complexity to essentially a constant time.\n\nNow, all I need to do is output three vertices. Once I have the optimal 'k', I fix the first vertex at '1' and vertex 2 as the angle vertex. Then, calculate the third vertex using the optimal `k`. I construct the output list of 3 vertices, with the angle's vertex in the middle, as requested by the problem.\n\nThat should be my complete approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these three vertices.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\n1.  **Circumcircle Property:** All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle.\n2.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An angle formed by three vertices of a polygon inscribed in a circle is an inscribed angle. Its measure is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n3.  **Unit Arc:** In a regular `n`-gon, the central angle subtending one side (the arc between two adjacent vertices) is `360/n` degrees.\n4.  **Possible Angles:** If an inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends an arc consisting of `k` sides of the `n`-gon (where this arc does not contain `v2`), then the measure of the angle is `k * (360/n) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Range of `k`**\n\nFor `v1, v2, v3` to be distinct vertices:\n*   The arc between `v1` and `v3` (not containing `v2`) must have at least one side, so `k >= 1`.\n*   The remaining arc (containing `v2`) must also have at least two sides (one from `v1` to `v2` and one from `v2` to `v3`). So, `n - k >= 2`, which implies `k <= n - 2`.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for `k` are integers from `1` to `n-2`.\nThe possible angles that can be formed are `1 * (180/n), 2 * (180/n), ..., (n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`**\n\nLet `unit_angle = 180.0 / n`. We are looking for an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` that minimizes `|k * unit_angle - a|`.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` such that `k * unit_angle` is closest to `a`.\nWe can find a floating-point `k_target = a / unit_angle`.\nThe optimal integer `k` will be either `floor(k_target)` or `ceil(k_target)`.\nWe must also ensure that the chosen `k` is within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n\nLet's consider the candidate integer `k` values:\n1.  `k_floor = int(k_target)`\n2.  `k_ceil = k_floor + 1`\n\nWe should evaluate these candidates, but also consider the boundary values of the range `[1, n-2]` in case `k_target` falls outside or near the boundaries.\nThe set of candidate `k` values to check efficiently is:\n*   `1` (the smallest possible `k`)\n*   `n-2` (the largest possible `k`)\n*   `k_floor` (if `k_floor` is within `[1, n-2]`)\n*   `k_ceil` (if `k_ceil` is within `[1, n-2]`)\n\nWe iterate through these candidates, calculate the angle `current_angle = k_candidate * unit_angle`, and find the absolute difference `|current_angle - a|`. We keep track of the `k` that yields the minimum difference.\n\n**Choosing Vertices**\n\nOnce the optimal `k` is found, we need to output three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3`.\nA simple and consistent choice is:\n*   `v2 = 2` (fixed as the vertex of the angle)\n*   `v1 = 1` (fixed as one endpoint of the arc)\n*   `v3 = 2 + k` (the other endpoint of the arc, `k` positions away from `v2` in the direction of `v1`'s \"other side\" relative to `v2`).\n    Since vertices are 1-indexed and `v3` must be distinct from `v1` and `v2`, and `k` is the number of sides between `v1` and `v3` (not containing `v2`), if `v1=1` and `v2=2`, then `v3` would be `2+k`. This `v3` value will be between `3` and `2 + (n-2) = n`. All these vertices `1, 2, 3, ..., n` are distinct.\n\nSo, the output vertices will be `1, 2, (2 + best_k)`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`n=4, a=68`)**\n\n1.  `n = 4`, `a = 68`.\n2.  `unit_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n3.  `k_target = a / unit_angle = 68 / 45.0 \\approx 1.511`.\n4.  Candidate `k` values:\n    *   `k_floor = int(1.511) = 1`\n    *   `k_ceil = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   `1` (smallest possible `k`)\n    *   `n-2 = 4-2 = 2` (largest possible `k`)\n    The set of unique candidates to check is `{1, 2}`.\n\n5.  Evaluate `k=1`:\n    *   `angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n    *   `diff = |45.0 - 68| = 23.0`.\n    *   Current `best_k = 1`, `min_diff = 23.0`.\n\n6.  Evaluate `k=2`:\n    *   `angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n    *   `diff = |90.0 - 68| = 22.0`.\n    *   Since `22.0 < 23.0`, update `best_k = 2`, `min_diff = 22.0`.\n\n7.  Optimal `k = 2`.\n8.  Output vertices: `1, 2, (2 + 2) = 1, 2, 4`.\n\nThis approach is efficient (O(1) time complexity) and correctly handles all cases within the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    unit_angle = 180.0 / n\n\n    # Calculate the target k as a float\n    k_target_float = a / unit_angle\n\n    best_k = -1\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n\n    # Candidate k values to check:\n    # 1.
