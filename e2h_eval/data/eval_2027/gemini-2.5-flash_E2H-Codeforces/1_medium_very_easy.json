The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Gilded Cell Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The dimensions are `w` for width (columns) and `h` for height (rows), and there are `k` rings. Each ring is just the border of an inner rectangle, and the rings get smaller as you go in.\n\nLet's break it down: The *i*-th ring has dimensions `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  It's a ring with a single-cell width. The first ring's outer dimensions are `w x h`, and each subsequent ring is 4 cells smaller in width and height compared to the previous one.  My goal is to calculate the total cells gilded across *all* `k` rings.\n\nI can do this. I'll define the *i*-th ring. Then I'll sum over *k* values to get the grand total. The inner rectangle dimensions for the *i*-th ring are `current_w = w - 4(i - 1)` and `current_h = h - 4(i - 1)`. I can either calculate `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4` or  `current_w * current_h - (current_w - 2) * (current_h - 2)`. This second method works if dimensions are at least 2. The problem states `w, h >= 3`, which satisfies that.  The perimeter formula is probably simpler to implement.\n\nThe problem guarantees `k \\le \\lfloor \\frac{min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\rfloor`. Let `min_dim = min(w, h)`. The smallest inner rectangle dimension is `min_dim - 4(k-1)`. Because of the `k` constraint, this number will always be at least 3, making it a viable rectangle to work with.\n\nFor each `i`-th ring I need to calculate, I need to sum over the rings' values (i.e. number of cells in the ring).  This will become a loop to sum all of the ring's gilded cell count, from `i=1` to `k`.  Then:\n\n`total_gilded_cells = sum_{i=1 to k} 2 * ( (w - 4(i - 1)) + (h - 4(i - 1)) ) - 4`\n\nAfter re-writing `i-1` as `j`, the previous expression is equivalent to:\n\n`total_gilded_cells = sum_{j=0 to k-1} (2 * (w + h - 8j) - 4)`.\n\nSo, for each ring (`j`), my code will need to calculate `current_w` and `current_h`. Then `cells_in_ring = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4`. I'll initialize my `total_gilded_cells` to `0` and, in a loop, add `cells_in_ring` to `total_gilded_cells`.\n\nI'll also have a check to handle input constraints. I'll read the input from the standard input (`sys.stdin`), splitting it into three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.  I'll print the result (the `total_gilded_cells`) to standard output. I'm ready to write the code.  Let's do this.\n",
