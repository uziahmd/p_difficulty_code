    "thought": "**Diving Deep into the \"Tree Sum\" Problem**\n\nI'm tackling a challenging programming problem: \"Tree Sum.\" The goal is to calculate the sum of `d(1, n)` across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, with the result modulo 998244353. A \"good\" tree is a specific type of tree where, for each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges equals -1. The function `d(u, v)` represents the sum of edge weights along the unique path between vertices `u` and `v`.\n\nMy initial step is to understand the core condition for a \"good\" tree. I start by considering the product of edge weights for each vertex. By multiplying these conditions across all vertices, I realize that the total number of vertices `n` must be even. If `n` is odd, there are no good trees, and the answer is 0. This quickly becomes a critical constraint for the rest of the solution.\n\nWith `n` being even, I move to understand how to assign weights (1 or -1) to the edges. Mapping edge weights to binary values (0 for 1, 1 for -1) and using GF(2) (modular arithmetic with 2), I express the \"good\" tree constraint as a system of linear equations: `M y = b (mod 2)`, where `M` is the incidence matrix of the tree, `y` is the vector of edge weights, and `b` is a vector of all ones. Because the sum of the rows of `M` is 0, the sum of `b` must also be 0, which confirms our earlier finding that n is even. The rank of `M` helps determine the solution space, and I find that, for any given tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign weights to meet the \"good\" tree condition. This unique weighting per tree is a major finding.\n\nThis leads me to think about efficiently calculating the overall sum. My focus shifts to the path between nodes 1 and n. I realize calculating this directly by iterating through each good tree is inefficient. Instead, I try to reason about edge contributions. My goal is to determine the number of times each edge lies on the unique path.\n\nI explore various approaches to counting trees with a particular edge on the path from 1 to n. I recall Cayley's formula and related concepts, leading me to focus on edge incidences and tree structures. After some struggle with the formula for `n` > 2, I come to a formula that holds when `n >= 2`. A key realization is that this is the same as counting the ways to separate the graph using an edge. I then go back to my formula: the number of trees containing a specific edge `(u,v)` is `2*n^(n-3)` when `n>=2`. However, it must be `n^(n-3)`. This is a classic result in graph theory. This value helps me count edge appearances across the sum of good trees.\n\nNext, I need to efficiently determine the path sum for each good tree. By considering the parity of edge weight sums on the path, I examine the system of equations over GF(2). I attempt to utilize the property of cuts in the tree, but I am unable to make meaningful progress with it.\n\nFinally, I think about the weights themselves. I know that the weight of an edge in a \"good\" tree is uniquely determined based on the other edges. This helps me find a strategy to analyze each edge independently.\n\nI am now focusing on efficiently accounting for the sign. The overall goal is to cleverly sum the path lengths or weight contributions over all possible edge combinations, hopefully canceling some terms or simplifying the calculation significantly. The ultimate goal is a fast algorithm, which remains a key open question.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. `d(u,v)` is the sum of edge weights on the unique path between `u` and `v`. A tree is \"good\" if for each vertex `i`, the product of weights of edges incident to `i` is `-1`. Edge weights are `1` or `-1`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the \"good\" tree condition.\nLet `w(e)` be the weight of an edge `e`. For each vertex `i`, `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1`.\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n`product_{i=1 to n} (product_{e incident to i} w(e)) = product_{i=1 to n} (-1) = (-1)^n`.\nOn the left side, each edge `e=(u,v)` is incident to exactly two vertices, `u` and `v`. So `w(e)` appears twice in the product. Thus, `product_{i=1 to n} (product_{e incident to i} w(e)) = product_{e in E} (w(e)^2)`. Since `w(e)` is `1` or `-1`, `w(e)^2 = 1`. So the left side is `1`.\nTherefore, we must have `1 = (-1)^n`. This implies that `n` must be an even number.\nIf `n` is odd, there are no good trees, so the sum of `d(1, n)` is `0`. This matches the example for `n=1`.\n\nNow, assume `n` is even.\nLet `y_e = 0` if `w(e) = 1` and `y_e = 1` if `w(e) = -1`. The condition `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1` translates to `sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations over `GF(2)`. For a tree, the incidence matrix `M` has rank `n-1` over `GF(2)`. The sum of all rows of `M` is the zero vector (each column has two `1`s). The sum of the right-hand side vector (all `1`s) is `n (mod 2)`. Since `n` is even, `n = 0 (mod 2)`. This means the system is consistent. Since the null space of `M` has dimension `(n-1) - rank(M) = 0`, the solution `y` (and thus the weights `w(e)`) is unique for any given tree structure.\nSo, for any tree structure on `n` labeled vertices (where `n` is even), there is exactly one way to assign weights `1` or `-1` to its edges to make it a good tree. The total number of good trees is `n^(n-2)`.\n\nWe need to calculate `S = sum_{T good} d_T(1, n)`.\n`d_T(1, n) = sum_{e on P_1n(T)} w_T(e)`.\nWe can rewrite `S` as `sum_{T good} sum_{e=(u,v) on P_1n(T)} w_T(u,v)`.\nBy linearity of expectation (or just swapping sums):\n`S = sum_{all possible edges e=(u,v)} sum_{T good, e on P_1n(T)} w_T(u,v)`.\n\nLet's determine `w_T(e)` for an edge `e=(u,v)`.\nConsider any cut `(S, V \\ S)`. The product of weights of edges in the cut is `product_{e in cut(S, V \\ S)} w(e) = (-1)^{|S|}`.\nIf we pick `S` to be the set of vertices in the component containing `u` when `e` is removed, and `v` is in `V \\ S`.\nThen `w(e) = (-1)^{|S|} * product_{e' in cut(S, V \\ S), e' != e} w(e')`.\nThis doesn't simplify much.\n\nLet's use a different property: `w_T(e) = (-1)^(dist_T(u,1) + dist_T(v,1) + 1)` is not generally true.\nInstead, let's look at the product of weights along a path.\nFor any path `P_xy` from `x` to `y`, let `W(P_xy) = product_{e in P_xy} w(e)`.\nFor a good tree, `W(P_xy) = (-1)^{length(P_xy)}` is not necessarily true.\nHowever, we can deduce `w(u,v)` in terms of `y_e` values.\n`y_e = (1 - w(e))/2`. So `w(e) = 1 - 2y_e`.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{e on P_1n} (1 - 2y_e) = length(P_1n) - 2 * sum_{e on P_1n} y_e`.\nConsider `sum_{e on P_1n} y_e (mod 2)`.\nFor any path `P_xy`, `sum_{e on P_xy} y_e` is the number of `-1` edges on `P_xy`.\nLet `A_i = sum_{e incident to i} y_e`. We know `A_i = 1 (mod 2)`.\nLet `P_1n = (1=v_0, v_1, ..., v_k=n)` be the path.\n`sum_{j=0}^{k-1} y_{(v_j, v_{j+1})} (mod 2)`.\nThis sum cannot be determined easily.\n\nLet's consider the product of weights `W(P_1n) = product_{e on P_1n} w(e)`.\nFor any tree `T` and any two vertices `u, v`, `W(P_uv) = (-1)^{dist_T(u,v)}` is not necessarily true.\nHowever, it is known that for any tree `T` and any two vertices `u,v`, the weight `w(u,v)` of an edge `(u,v)` can be expressed as `(-1)^(dist_T(u,1) + dist_T(v,1) + 1)` if `1` is the root and `w(e) = -1` for all edges connected to `1`. No.\n\nLet's use a known result for good trees: `w(u,v) = (-1)^(dist_T(u,x) + dist_T(v,x) + 1)` for any fixed vertex `x`.\nThis is also not generally true.\nA correct property for good trees is that for any two vertices `u,v`, `W(P_uv) = (-1)^{dist_T(u,v) + d_T(u) + d_T(v) + ...}`. This is getting too complicated.\n\nLet's use a result from a similar problem (e.g., related to `d_i` parities).\nFor any tree, `w(u,v)` is `(-1)` if `u` and `v` are in different \"parity components\" with respect to some root.\nFor a good tree, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{dist_T(u,r) + dist_T(v,r) + 1}` for any fixed root `r`.\nLet's verify this. Root the tree at `r`. Then `w(r,x) = (-1)^{dist_T(r,r) + dist_T(x,r) + 1} = (-1)^{0 + dist_T(x,r) + 1} = (-1)^{dist_T(x,r)+1}`.\nFor `x != r`, `product_{e incident to x} w(e) = (-1)`.\nLet `e=(u,v)` be an edge. Assume `v` is a child of `u`.\n`w(u,v) = (-1)^{dist_T(u,r) + dist_T(v,r) + 1}`.\nThen `d(1,n) = sum_{e=(u,v) on P_1n} (-1)^{dist_T(u,r) + dist_T(v,r) + 1}`.\nLet `r=1`. Then `w(u,v) = (-1)^{dist_T(u,1) + dist_T(v,1) + 1}`.\nLet `P_1n = (1=x_0, x_1, ..., x_k=n)`.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} w(x_j, x_{j+1}) = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (-1)^{dist_T(x_j,1) + dist_T(x_{j+1},1) + 1}`.\nOn the path `P_1n`, `dist_T(x_j,1) = j` and `dist_T(x_{j+1},1) = j+1`.\nSo `d(1,n) = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (-1)^{j + (j+1) + 1} = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (-1)^{2j+2} = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} 1 = k`.\nThis means `d(1,n) = length(P_1n)`.\nThis is a very strong result: For any good tree, `d(1,n)` is simply the length of the path `P_1n`. All edge weights on `P_1n` must be `1`.\nLet's verify this property.\nIf `w(u,v) = (-1)^{dist_T(u,r) + dist_T(v,r) + 1}` for all edges `(u,v)` and a fixed root `r`.\nFor any vertex `x`, let `parent(x)` be its parent. Let `children(x)` be its children.\n`product_{e incident to x} w(e) = w(x, parent(x)) * product_{c in children(x)} w(x,c)`.\n`w(x, parent(x)) = (-1)^{dist_T(x,r) + dist_T(parent(x),r) + 1} = (-1)^{dist_T(x,r) + (dist_T(x,r)-1) + 1} = (-1)^{2 dist_T(x,r)} = 1`.\n`w(x,c) = (-1)^{dist_T(x,r) + dist_T(c,r) + 1} = (-1)^{dist_T(x,r) + (dist_T(x,r)+1) + 1} = (-1)^{2 dist_T(x,r) + 2} = 1`.\nThis means if we define weights this way, all edge weights are `1`.\nBut then `product_{e incident to x} w(e) = 1` for all `x`, not `-1`.\nSo the property `w(u,v) = (-1)^{dist_T(u,r) + dist_T(v,r) + 1}` is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-examine `sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nLet `S` be any subset of vertices. `sum_{i in S} (sum_{e incident to i} y_e) = sum_{i in S} 1 = |S| (mod 2)`.\nThe left side is `sum_{e=(x,z)} (count of endpoints in S) * y_e`.\nIf `x,z` are both in `S`, `2 y_e = 0 (mod 2)`.\nIf `x in S, z not in S`, `1 y_e = y_e (mod 2)`.\nSo `sum_{e in cut(S, V \\ S)} y_e = |S| (mod 2)`.\nThis is the key. For any cut `(S, V \\ S)`, the number of `-1` edges in the cut is `|S| (mod 2)`.\n\nLet `e=(u,v)` be an edge. We want to find `w(u,v)`.\nConsider the cut formed by removing `e`. This splits `V` into two components, `C_u` (containing `u`) and `C_v` (containing `v`).\nLet `S = C_u`. Then `sum_{e' in cut(C_u, C_v)} y_{e'} = |C_u| (mod 2)`.\nSince `e` is the only edge in the cut, `y_e = |C_u| (mod 2)`.\nSo `w(u,v) = -1` if `|C_u|` is odd, and `w(u,v) = 1` if `|C_u|` is even.\nThe value of `w(u,v)` depends on the sizes of the components formed by removing `e`.\n\nNow, we need to sum `d(1,n)` over all good trees.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{e on P_1n(T)} w_T(e)`.\nWe can use the formula for `w_T(e)`: `w_T(e) = (-1)^{|C_u|}` (where `C_u` is the component containing `1` if `e` is on `P_1n` and `u` is closer to `1`).\nLet `e=(u,v)` be an edge on `P_1n(T)`. Let `u` be the endpoint closer to `1`.\nRemoving `e` splits `T` into `T_u` (containing `1` and `u`) and `T_v` (containing `n` and `v`).\nThen `w_T(e) = (-1)^{|V(T_u)|}`.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{e=(u,v) on P_1n(T), u closer to 1} (-1)^{|V(T_u)|}`.\n\nLet `N_k` be the number of good trees where the path `P_1n` has length `k`.\nFor a fixed length `k`, `d(1,n) = sum_{j=1}^{k} (-1)^j`.\nThis sum depends on `k`.\nIf `k` is even, `sum_{j=1}^{k} (-1)^j = 0`.\nIf `k` is odd, `sum_{j=1}^{k} (-1)^j = -1`.\nSo, `d(1,n)` is `-1` if `length(P_1n)` is odd, and `0` if `length(P_1n)` is even.\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{T good} (-1)^{length(P_1n(T))}` (if length is odd, then -1, else 0).\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{T good, length(P_1n(T)) is odd} (-1)`.\nSo we need to count the number of good trees where `length(P_1n)` is odd.\n\nThe number of trees on `n` labeled vertices where `1` and `n` are connected by a path of length `k` is given by a formula.\nThis is `(n-2 choose k-1) * k * n^(n-k-2) * (n-k)^(k-1)`. (This is for `n >= 2`).\nFor `n=2`, `k=1`. `(0 choose 0) * 1 * 2^(-1) * 1^0 = 1/2`. This is not an integer.\nThe formula for the number of trees on `n` vertices where `dist(1,n)=k` is `(n-2 choose k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`. This is also for specific vertices.\n\nLet's use a simpler approach for paths.\nThe total number of good trees is `n^(n-2)`.\nConsider the path `P_1n`. Each edge `e=(u,v)` on this path contributes `w_T(e)` to `d(1,n)`.\nThe total sum is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} N_k * (sum_{j=1}^{k} (-1)^j)`.\n`N_k` is the number of good trees where `dist(1,n)=k`.\nWe need to calculate `N_k`.\nThe number of trees on `n` labeled vertices such that `dist(1,n)=k` is `(n-2 choose k-1) * k * n^(n-k-2) * (n-k)^(k-1)`. This is for `k >= 1`.\nFor `n=2`, `k=1`: `(0 choose 0) * 1 * 2^(-1) * 1^0 = 1/2`. This formula is incorrect.\nThe number of trees on `n` labeled vertices where `dist(u,v) = k`:\n`N_k = (n-2 choose k-1) * k * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * n^(k-2)` for `k >= 1`.\nLet's check `n=2, k=1`: `(0 choose 0) * 1 * 1^0 * 2^(-1) = 1/2`. Still `1/2`.\nThe formula is `(n-2)! / ((k-1)! * (n-k-1)!) * k * n^(k-2) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`.\nFor `n=2, k=1`: `(0! / (0! * 0!)) * 1 * 2^(-1) * 1^0 = 1/2`.\nThis formula is for `n >= 2`, `1 <= k <= n-1`.\nThe number of trees on `n` vertices such that `dist(u,v) = k` is given by `(n-2)! / ((k-1)!(n-k-1)!) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`. This is also for specific `u,v`.\nNo, this is `(n-2 choose k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`. This is for rooted trees.\nThe number of trees on `n` labeled vertices where `1` and `n` are in different components of sizes `k` and `n-k` after removing an edge `e` is `(n-2 choose k-1) k^(k-1) (n-k)^(n-k-1)`.\n\nThe total number of trees where `dist(1,n)=k` is `(n-2 choose k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)` for `n >= 2`.\nFor `n=2, k=1`: `(0 choose 0) * 1^0 * 1^0 = 1`. This is correct.\nFor `n=4`:\n`k=1`: `(2 choose 0) * 1^0 * 3^2 = 1 * 1 * 9 = 9`.\n`k=2`: `(2 choose 1) * 2^1 * 2^1 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.\n`k=3`: `(2 choose 2) * 3^2 * 1^0 = 1 * 9 * 1 = 9`.\nTotal trees: `9+8+9 = 26`. But `4^(4-2) = 16`. This formula is incorrect.\nThe formula `(n-2 choose k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)` is for rooted trees or similar context.\n\nLet's use a simpler approach.\n`d(1,n)` is `0` if `length(P_1n)` is even, and `-1` if `length(P_1n)` is odd.\nSo the total sum is `(-1) * (number of good trees where length(P_1n) is odd)`.\nThe number of trees on `n` labeled vertices where `dist(u,v)` is odd or even:\nIt is known that the number of trees where `dist(u,v)` is odd is equal to the number of trees where `dist(u,v)` is even, for `n >= 3`.\nTotal trees `n^(n-2)`.\nIf `n` is even and `n >= 4`:\nNumber of trees where `dist(1,n)` is odd is `n^(n-2) / 2`.\nNumber of trees where `dist(1,n)` is even is `n^(n-2) / 2`.\nThis is a known result.\nFor `n=4`, total trees `16`. `dist(1,4)` odd is `8`. `dist(1,4)` even is `8`.\nSo if `n` is even and `n >= 4`, the sum is `(-1) * n^(n-2) / 2`.\n\nLet's check `n=2`.\nThere is 1 good tree. `P_12` has length `1` (odd). `d(1,2) = -1`.\nThe formula `(-1) * n^(n-2) / 2` gives `(-1) * 2^(0) / 2 = -1/2`. This is not an integer.\nThe formula `n^(n-2)/2` holds for `n >= 3`.\nFor `n=2`, the answer is `-1`.\n\nFor `n=4`:\nTotal good trees `4^(4-2) = 16`.\n`length(P_14)` is odd for `16/2 = 8` trees.\n`length(P_14)` is even for `16/2 = 8` trees.\nThe sum of `d(1,4)` is `8 * (-1) + 8 * 0 = -8`.\nThe example output for `n=4` is `998244343`, which is `-10 mod 998244353`.\nMy logic gives `-8`. The example gives `-10`. What is wrong?\n\nMy deduction `d(1,n) = 0` if `length(P_1n)` is even, and `-1` if `length(P_1n)` is odd, must be wrong.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{e=(u,v) on P_1n(T), u closer to 1} (-1)^{|V(T_u)|}`.\nLet `P_1n = (x_0=1, x_1, ..., x_k=n)`.\nLet `e_j = (x_{j-1}, x_j)`.\n`T_{x_{j-1}}` is the component containing `x_{j-1}` (and `1`) when `e_j` is removed.\n`|V(T_{x_{j-1}})|` is the size of the subtree rooted at `x_{j-1}` if we root `T` at `n` and `P_1n` is `(n, x_{k-1}, ..., x_0=1)`.\nOr, `|V(T_{x_{j-1}})|` is `j` if `x_0, ..., x_{j-1}` are the only vertices in `T_{x_{j-1}}`. This is only true if `T` is a path graph.\n\nThe sum `sum_{e in cut(S, V \\ S)} y_e = |S| (mod 2)` is correct.\nSo `w(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_u|}` where `C_u` is the component containing `u` (and `1` if `u` is closer to `1`) when `(u,v)` is removed.\nThe sum `d(1,n) = sum_{j=1}^{k} (-1)^{size_j}` where `size_j` is the size of the component containing `1` when `j`-th edge on path `P_1n` is removed.\nThe `size_j` values are not `j`. They can be arbitrary.\n\nLet's consider the total sum again:\n`S = sum_{T good} sum_{e=(u,v) on P_1n(T)} w_T(u,v)`.\nSwap sums: `S = sum_{all possible edges (u,v)} sum_{T good, (u,v) on P_1n(T)} w_T(u,v)`.\nBy symmetry, all edges `(u,v)` have the same contribution if `u` is `1` and `v` is `n`, or `u` is `1` and `v` is any other vertex, etc.\nNo, not all edges are symmetric with respect to `1` and `n`.\nThe path `P_1n` is special.\n\nLet `e=(u,v)` be an edge.\nThe number of trees where `e` is on the path `P_1n` is `(n-2)! * (n-1)^(n-k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-1 choose k)`.\nThis is also complicated.\n\nLet's use the result `sum_{e in cut(S, V \\ S)} w(e) = (-1)^{|S|}`.\nLet `S_i` be the set of vertices in the component containing `i` when `P_1n` is removed.\nLet `P_1n` have length `k`.\n`d(1,n) = sum_{j=1}^k w(e_j)`.\nConsider the path `P_1n`. Let `e_j = (x_{j-1}, x_j)` be the `j`-th edge on the path.\nWhen `e_j` is removed, the tree splits into two components. Let `S_j` be the component containing `x_{j-1}` (and `1`).\nThen `w(e_j) = (-1)^{|S_j|}`.\nSo `d(1,n) = sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{|S_j|}`.\n\nConsider the case where `n` is even.\nLet's analyze the contribution of each edge `e=(u,v)` to the total sum.\n`sum_{T good} d_T(1,n) = sum_{T good} sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_T(e)`.\nFix an edge `e=(u,v)`.\nThe number of trees where `e` is on the path `P_1n` and `u` is closer to `1` than `v` is `(n-2)! / ((i-1)! (n-i-1)!) * i^(i-1) * (n-i)^(n-i-1)`. This is `N_{i, n-i}` where `i` is the size of the component containing `1` and `u`.\nLet `N(i)` be the number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_1n`, `u` is closer to `1`, and `T_u` (component containing `1` when `e` is removed) has size `i`.\n`N(i) = (n-2 choose i-1) * i^(i-1) * (n-i)^(n-i-1)`. This is the number of trees where `1` is in a component of size `i` and `n` is in a component of size `n-i` when `(u,v)` is removed.\nFor each such tree, `w(u,v) = (-1)^i`.\nThe total contribution from a specific edge `(u,v)` being on `P_1n` is `sum_{i=1}^{n-1} N(i) * (-1)^i`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-2 choose i-1) * i^(i-1) * (n-i)^(n-i-1) * (-1)^i`.\nThis sum is `-(n-1) * n^(n-3)` if `n` is even and `n >= 2`.\nThis is a known identity for trees or similar structures.\nLet `f(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-2 choose i-1) * i^(i-1) * (n-i)^(n-i-1) * (-1)^i`.\nThis identity states `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = -(n-1) n^{n-3}` for `n \\ge 2`.\nThis is `sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^i N(i)`.\n\nThis sum `f(n)` is the total contribution of a specific edge `(u,v)` to `d(1,n)` over all good trees where `(u,v)` is on `P_1n`.\nThe total sum `S` is `sum_{u,v} f(n)`? No.\nWe sum `w(e)` for all edges `e` on `P_1n`.\nThe number of edges on `P_1n` varies.\n\nLet's use the identity: `sum_{T} d_T(u,v) = (n-1) * n^(n-3) * (n-1) * (n-2) / 2`.\nThis is for unweighted trees.\nThe total sum `S` is `sum_{e=(u,v)} sum_{T good, e on P_1n(T)} w_T(e)`.\nThe number of pairs `(u,v)` is `n(n-1)/2`.\nThe number of edges which are \"between\" `1` and `n` (i.e. on `P_1n`) is not fixed.\n\nThe total sum `S` is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} N_k * (sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{size_j})`.\nThis `size_j` depends on the specific tree.\n\nLet's use a simpler known result:\nThe sum of `d(u,v)` over all trees on `n` labeled vertices is `(n-1) * n^(n-2)`.\nThis is for unweighted trees where `d(u,v)` is path length.\nHere `d(u,v)` is sum of weights.\n\nLet's consider the result for `n=4` example: `-10`.\nMy logic based on `d(1,n) = 0` or `-1` gives `-8`.\nSo `d(1,n)` is not always `0` or `-1`.\nThis means `sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{|S_j|}` is not always `0` or `-1`.\nMy derivation `sum_{e in cut(S, V \\ S)} y_e = |S| (mod 2)` implies `w(u,v) = (-1)^{|S|}` where `S` is the component of `u` when `(u,v)` is removed.\nThis seems correct.\n\nLet's recheck `n=4` example.\nTotal `16` good trees.\n`d(1,4)` values: `-2` for `2` trees; `-1` for `8` trees; `0` for `4` trees; `1` for `2` trees.\nSum: `2*(-2) + 8*(-1) + 4*0 + 2*1 = -4 - 8 + 0 + 2 = -10`.\nThis implies that `d(1,4)` can take values other than `0` or `-1`.\nSo `sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{|S_j|}` is not always `0` or `-1`.\n\nMy deduction `d(1,n) = sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{|S_j|}` is correct.\nThe problem is that I assumed `sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{|S_j|}` is `0` or `-1`.\nThis happens if `|S_j| = j`. This is only true for a path graph.\n\nLet `X_e` be the random variable for `w(e)` for a good tree.\nWe want `E[d(1,n)] * n^(n-2)`.\n`E[d(1,n)] = sum_{e=(u,v)} P(e on P_1n) * E[w(e) | e on P_1n]`.\nFor a specific edge `e=(u,v)`, and `1 <= i < n`.\nLet `N(i)` be the number of trees where `e` is on `P_1n`, and removing `e` yields components of size `i` (containing `1`) and `n-i` (containing `n`).\n`N(i) = (n-2 choose i-1) * i^(i-1) * (n-i)^(n-i-1)`.\nFor such trees, `w(e) = (-1)^i`.\nSo, for a specific edge `e=(u,v)`, its contribution to the sum `sum_{T good} d_T(1,n)` is `sum_{i=1}^{n-1} N(i) * (-1)^i`.\nThis sum is `-(n-1) * n^(n-3)` (as per identity `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = -(n-1) n^{n-3}`).\nThis is the sum of `w(e)` over all good trees where `e` is on `P_1n` (and `u` is closer to `1`).\n\nThe total sum `S = sum_{e=(u,v)} sum_{i=1}^{n-1} N(i) * (-1)^i`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=1}^{n-1} N(i) * (-1)^i` is the contribution of one specific edge `e=(u,v)` to the total sum `S`.\nBy symmetry, every edge `(u,v)` contributes the same amount to `S`.\nThere are `n(n-1)/2` possible edges `(u,v)`.\nSo `S = n(n-1)/2 * (-(n-1) * n^(n-3))`.\n`S = -n(n-1)^2 * n^(n-3) / 2 = -n * (n-1)^2 * n^(n-3) / 2`.\nThis simplifies to `- (n-1)^2 * n^(n-2) / 2`.\n\nLet's check this formula: `S = -(n-1)^2 * n^(n-2) / 2`.\nFor `n=2`: `S = -(2-1)^2 * 2^(2-2) / 2 = -1^2 * 2^0 / 2 = -1/2`.\nStill `-1/2`. This formula is not an integer.\nThe identity `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = -(n-1) n^{n-3}` is for `n >= 2`.\nAnd it gives `-(2-1) * 2^(2-3) = -1 * 1/2 = -1/2` for `n=2`.\nThe issue is that `N(i)` depends on `e=(u,v)` being a specific edge.\nThe identity is for `sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-2 choose i-1) * i^(i-1) * (n-i)^(n-i-1) * (-1)^i`.\nThis is the sum over `i`, where `i` is the size of the component containing `1` when `e` is removed.\nThis is the sum of `w(e)` over all trees where `e` is on `P_1n`.\nThis sum is indeed `-(n-1) n^(n-3)`.\n\nThe crucial step is \"By symmetry, every edge `(u,v)` contributes the same amount to `S`\".\nIs it true that `sum_{T good, (u,v) on P_1n(T)} w_T(u,v)` is the same for all `(u,v)`?\nLet `e=(u,v)`. The path `P_1n` might contain `e`.\nThe `N(i)` formula counts trees where `1` is in a component of size `i` and `n` is in a component of size `n-i` when `e` is removed.\nThis means `e` is on the path `P_1n`.\nSo `sum_{i=1}^{n-1} N(i) * (-1)^i` is exactly `sum_{T good, e on P_1n(T)} w_T(e)`.\nThis sum is `-(n-1) n^(n-3)`.\nThis value is the contribution of one specific edge `e` to the total sum.\nSo `S = (number of edges) * (contribution of one edge)`.\nThe number of edges is `n(n-1)/2`.\nSo `S = n(n-1)/2 * (-(n-1) n^(n-3)) = -n(n-1)^2 n^(n-3) / 2 = -(n-1)^2 n^(n-2) / 2`.\nThis result is for `n >= 2`.\n\nLet's check `n=2`:\n`S = -(2-1)^2 * 2^(2-2) / 2 = -1/2`.\nThe actual answer is `-1`.\nThe identity `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = -(n-1) n^{n-3}` is for `n >= 2`.\nFor `n=2`, `k=1`. `(-1)^1 * (0 choose 0) * 1^0 * 1^0 = -1`.\nThe RHS for `n=2` is `-(2-1) * 2^(2-3) = -1 * 1/2 = -1/2`.\nSo the identity is actually `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = -n^{n-2}` for `n=2`, and `-(n-1)n^{n-3}` for `n \\ge 3`.\nLet's check `n=3`. `sum_{k=1}^{2} (-1)^k \\binom{1}{k-1} k^{k-1} (3-k)^{3-k-1}`.\n`k=1: (-1)^1 \\binom{1}{0} 1^0 (2)^1 = -1 * 1 * 1 * 2 = -2`.\n`k=2: (-1)^2 \\binom{1}{1} 2^1 (1)^0 = 1 * 1 * 2 * 1 = 2`.\nSum is `0`.\nRHS for `n=3`: `-(3-1) * 3^(3-3) = -2 * 1 = -2`.\nSo the identity is not `-(n-1)n^(n-3)` for `n=3`.\nThe identity is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{k} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = (-1)^n n^{n-2}` (for `n >= 2`).\nLet's check this.\n`n=2`: `(-1)^2 * 2^0 = 1`.

An edge-weighted tree has edges with weights `1` or `-1`. A tree is \"good\" if for each vertex `i`, the product of the weights of all edges incident to `i` is `-1`. `d(u,v)` is the sum of weights of edges on the unique simple path between `u` and `v`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the \"good\" tree condition.\nLet `w(e)` be the weight of an edge `e`. For each vertex `i`, `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1`.\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n`product_{i=1 to n} (product_{e incident to i} w(e)) = product_{i=1 to n} (-1) = (-1)^n`.\nOn the left side, each edge `e=(u,v)` is incident to exactly two vertices, `u` and `v`. So `w(e)` appears twice in the product. Thus, `product_{i=1 to n} (product_{e incident to i} w(e)) = product_{e in E} (w(e)^2)`. Since `w(e)` is `1` or `-1`, `w(e)^2 = 1`. So the left side is `1`.\nTherefore, we must have `1 = (-1)^n`. This implies that `n` must be an even number.\nIf `n` is odd, there are no good trees, so the sum of `d(1, n)` is `0`. This matches the example for `n=1` and `n=3`.\n\nNow, assume `n` is even.\nLet `y_e = 0` if `w(e) = 1` and `y_e = 1` if `w(e) = -1`. The condition `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1` translates to `sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations over `GF(2)`. For any given tree structure, this system has a unique solution for `y_e` (and thus for `w(e)`) if `n` is even.\nSo, for any tree structure on `n` labeled vertices (where `n` is even), there is exactly one way to assign weights `1` or `-1` to its edges to make it a good tree.\n\nLet's determine the weight `w(e)` for an edge `e=(u,v)` in a good tree `T`.\nConsider any cut `(S, V \\ S)` in `T`. The product of weights of edges in the cut is `product_{e' in cut(S, V \\ S)} w(e') = (-1)^{|S|}`. This is derived by multiplying `sum_{x in S} (sum_{e' incident to x} y_{e'}) = |S| (mod 2)`.\nIf we remove the edge `e=(u,v)`, the tree `T` splits into two connected components, say `T_u` (containing `u`) and `T_v` (containing `v`). The cut `(V(T_u), V(T_v))` contains only the edge `e`.\nTherefore, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{|V(T_u)|}`. (Alternatively, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{|V(T_v)|}` since `|V(T_u)| + |V(T_v)| = n`, and `n` is even, so `|V(T_u)|` and `|V(T_v)|` have the same parity).\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{T good} d_T(1, n)`.\n`d_T(1, n) = sum_{e on P_1n(T)} w_T(e)`.\nLet `P_1n(T) = (x_0=1, x_1, ..., x_k=n)` be the unique path from `1` to `n` in tree `T`. Let `e_j = (x_{j-1}, x_j)` be the `j`-th edge on this path.\nWhen `e_j` is removed, the tree `T` splits into two components. Let `S_j` be the component containing `x_{j-1}` (and `1`). Then `w_T(e_j) = (-1)^{|S_j|}`.\nSo, `d_T(1, n) = sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{|S_j|}`.\n\nThe total sum is `sum_{T good} sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{|S_j|}`.\nWe can swap the sums: `sum_{e=(u,v)} sum_{T good, e on P_1n(T)} w_T(e)`.\nBy symmetry, the contribution of any specific edge `e=(u,v)` to the total sum is the same.\nLet `C_n` be this common contribution: `C_n = sum_{T good, e on P_1n(T)} w_T(e)`.\nThe total sum we want is `n(n-1)/2 * C_n`. This is if all edges contribute equally, but the problem asks for `d(1,n)`, not `d(u,v)`. The path `P_1n` is specific.\n\nThe quantity `sum_{T good, e on P_1n(T)} w_T(e)` is the sum of weights of a specific edge `e=(u,v)` on the path `P_1n` over all good trees where `e` is indeed on the path `P_1n`.\nThis sum can be written as `sum_{i=1}^{n-1} N(i) * (-1)^i`, where `N(i)` is the number of trees on `n` labeled vertices where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_1n` and removing `e` results in `1` being in a component of size `i` and `n` in a component of size `n-i`.\nThe number `N(i)` is given by the formula `(n-2 choose i-1) * i^(i-1) * (n-i)^(n-i-1)`.\nSo, the sum of `d(1,n)` over all good trees is:\n`0` if `n` is odd.\n`sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * (n-2 choose k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)` if `n` is even.\n\nLet's verify this formula with the examples:\n-   **n = 1**: Odd, so `0`. Correct.\n-   **n = 2**: Even. Sum for `k=1`: `(-1)^1 * (2-2 choose 1-1) * 1^(1-1) * (2-1)^(2-1-1)`\n    `= (-1)^1 * (0 choose 0) * 1^0 * 1^0 = -1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = -1`.\n    Modulo `998244353`, this is `998244352`. Correct.\n-   **n = 4**: Even. Sum for `k=1, 2, 3`:\n    -   `k=1`: `(-1)^1 * (2 choose 0) * 1^0 * 3^2 = -1 * 1 * 1 * 9 = -9`.\n    -   `k=2`: `(-1)^2 * (2 choose 1) * 2^1 * 2^1 = 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.\n    -   `k=3`: `(-1)^3 * (2 choose 2) * 3^2 * 1^0 = -1 * 1 * 9 * 1 = -9`.\n    Total sum: `-9 + 8 - 9 = -10`.\n    Modulo `998244353`, this is `998244343`. Correct.\n\nThe formula matches all examples. We need to implement it efficiently.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  If `n` is odd, print `0`.\n3.  If `n` is even:\n    a.  Handle `n=2` as a base case: print `MOD - 1`. (This is covered by the general formula but good for clarity).\n    b.  Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo `998244353` up to `n` (or `MAXN = 5 * 10^5`).\n    c.  Implement a modular exponentiation function `power(base, exp)` to calculate `a^b mod M`.\n    d.  Implement `nCr_mod_p(n, r)` using precomputed factorials and inverse factorials.\n    e.  Initialize `ans = 0`.\n    f.  Loop `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n        i.   Calculate `term = nCr_mod_p(n - 2, k - 1)`.\n        ii.  Calculate `k_pow_k_minus_1 = power(k, k - 1)`. (Note: `0^0=1` is handled by `power` function).\n        iii. Calculate `n_minus_k = n - k`.\n        iv.  Calculate `n_minus_k_pow_n_minus_k_minus_1 = power(n_minus_k, n_minus_k - 1)`.\n        v.   Multiply these three parts: `current_term = (term * k_pow_k_minus_1) % MOD`.\n        vi.  `current_term = (current_term * n_minus_k_pow_n_minus_k_minus_1) % MOD`.\n        vii. If `k` is odd, subtract `current_term` from `ans`: `ans = (ans - current_term + MOD) % MOD`.\n        viii. If `k` is even, add `current_term` to `ans`: `ans = (ans + current_term) % MOD`.\n    g.  Print `ans`.\n\n**Edge cases for power function:**\n-   `power(base, 0)` should return `1`. Our `power` function correctly does this.\n-   `k` and `n-k` are always `1` or greater in the loop range `k` from `1` to `n-1`. So `base` for `power` will never be `0`.\n\nThe time complexity will be `O(MAXN + N log N)` for precomputation and the loop. `N log N` is for modular exponentiation inside the loop. `5 * 10^5 * log(5 * 10^5)` is roughly `5 * 10^5 * 19`, which is feasible.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\nMAXN = 5 * 10**5\n\nfact = [1] * (MAXN + 1)\ninv_fact = [1] * (MAXN + 1)\n\n# Modular exponentiation: calculates (base^exp) % MOD\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\ndef precompute_factorials():\n    for i in range(1, MAXN + 1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    \n    # inv_fact[MAXN] = fact[MAXN]^(MOD-2) % MOD\n    inv_fact[MAXN] = power(fact[MAXN], MOD - 2)\n    # inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    for i in range(MAXN - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\n# Calculates nCr % MOD\ndef nCr_mod_p(n, r):\n    if r < 0 or r > n:\n        return 0\n    num = fact[n]\n    den = (inv_fact[r] * inv_fact[n-r]) % MOD\n    return (num * den) % MOD\n\n# Precompute factorials once at the start\nprecompute_factorials()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n % 2 != 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Special case for n=2, as (n-2 choose k-1) becomes (0 choose 0)\n    # and the loop range for n-2 is 0.\n    # The general formula works for n=2 as well:\n    # k=1: (-1)^1 * nCr(0,0) * 1^0 * 1^0 = -1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = -1\n    # print(MOD - 1) # for n=2\n    \n    ans = 0\n    # Loop k from 1 to n-1\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        # Calculate nCr(n-2, k-1)\n        n_choose_r = nCr_mod_p(n - 2, k - 1)\n        \n        # Calculate k^(k-1)\n        k_pow = power(k, k - 1)\n        \n        # Calculate (n-k)^(n-k-1)\n        n_minus_k = n - k\n        n_minus_k_pow = power(n_minus_k, n_minus_k - 1)\n        \n        # Combine terms for current k\n        current_term = (n_choose_r * k_pow) % MOD\n        current_term = (current_term * n_minus_k_pow) % MOD\n        \n        # Add or subtract based on (-1)^k\n        if k % 2 == 1: # (-1)^k is -1\n            ans = (ans - current_term + MOD) % MOD\n        else: # (-1)^k is 1\n            ans = (ans + current_term) % MOD\n    \n    print(ans)\n\n```",
