    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Frog Jumping Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this Frog Jumping problem and need a Python solution. The core of it seems to be understanding this function `f(x)`. It's the count of distinct integers the frog can reach, but with a crucial constraint: it can *never* jump outside the range `[0, x]`. That's the key.  Then, I need to sum `f(i)` from `0` up to `m`.\n\nFirst, let's nail down what \"reachable\" means.  The frog starts at `0`. It can move either `+a` or `-b`. The real hurdle is keeping every intermediate position on its path within `[0, x]`.  If the frog tries to jump outside that range, the entire sequence is invalid for `f(x)`.\n\nLet's say `S_x` is the set of all reachable positions within `[0, x]`.  Then `f(x)` is simply the size of `S_x`. The only possible jumps initially are always positive `+a` since moving `-b` from `0` would place the frog outside of `[0,x]` if `b > 0`.  Each position reachable is going to be something like `c_a * a - c_b * b`, but again, the jumps must stay within the bound.\n\nI can visualize this as a sort of graph problem. Each integer is a node. The edges are `+a` and `-b`. The trick is finding all the nodes reachable from `0` while ensuring *every* step on the path is within `[0, x]`.\n\nSince there are no cyclic edges from a node to itself, BFS or DFS is the way to do this. A Breadth-First Search approach seems efficient here.  I can use a boolean array `reachable[p]` to track if a position `p` is achievable. I start with `reachable[0] = True`, put `0` in a queue, and iterate.\n\nFor each `curr` in the queue:\n*   If `curr + a <= x` and `reachable[curr + a]` is `False`, mark `reachable[curr + a]` as `True` and enqueue it.\n*   If `curr - b >= 0` and `reachable[curr - b]` is `False`, mark `reachable[curr - b]` as `True` and enqueue it.\n\nFinally, the sum that is asked of the user would be the summation of a counting of `reachable` positions for each `f(i)`, since they can be computed individually from `0` to `m`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i))` for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it starts at `0` and never jumps outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `S_x` be the set of integers reachable within `[0, x]`. Then `f(x) = |S_x|`.\nThe condition \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" is crucial. This means that from a position `k`, the frog can jump to `k+a` only if `k+a <= x`, and to `k-b` only if `k-b >= 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the set of reachable positions for a fixed `x`. We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from `0`.\nInitialize `reachable = {0}` and a queue `q = collections.deque([0])`.\nWhile `q` is not empty:\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  If `curr + a <= x` and `curr + a` not in `reachable`:\n    `reachable.add(curr + a)`\n    `q.append(curr + a)`\n  If `curr - b >= 0` and `curr - b` not in `reachable`:\n    `reachable.add(curr - b)`\n    `q.append(curr - b)`\n`f(x)` is then `len(reachable)`.\n\nThe maximum value of `x` is `m` (up to `10^9`), so we cannot compute `f(x)` for each `x` individually using BFS. However, `a` and `b` are up to `10^5`. This suggests that the behavior of `f(x)` might stabilize or become periodic after a certain point related to `a` and `b`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any reachable position `p` must be of the form `k_a * a - k_b * b` for some non-negative integers `k_a, k_b`. This implies `p` must be a multiple of `g`.\nFurthermore, the condition `k-b >= 0` means that we cannot jump below `0`. The first jump must always be `+a` (since `0-b = -b < 0`). So, all reachable positions must be non-negative.\n\nConsider the values `pos[r]` which stores the minimum reachable position `p` such that `p % g == r` and `p >= 0`.\nWe are interested in `p` such that `p % g == 0`. Let `dist[k]` be the minimum reachable position `p` such that `p % a == k` (or `p % g == k`).\nA standard approach for this type of problem is to use a 0-1 BFS (Dijkstra-like) on states `p % a`.\nLet `min_val[r]` be the minimum reachable position `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\nInitialize `min_val[0] = 0` and `min_val[r] = infinity` for `r \\neq 0`.\nUse a deque for 0-1 BFS:\n`q = collections.deque([(0, 0)])` (value, remainder)\nWhile `q` is not empty:\n  `curr_val, curr_rem = q.popleft()`\n  If `curr_val > min_val[curr_rem]`: continue\n\n  // Try jumping +a\n  // This just changes the value, not the remainder mod a.\n  // We don't need to explicitly explore `curr_val + a` as a new state for `min_val[curr_rem]`.\n  // `min_val[curr_rem]` already represents the minimum value for this remainder.\n  // Any value `curr_val + k*a` for `k > 0` will also have remainder `curr_rem`,\n  // but will be larger than `curr_val`. These values are implicitly \"reachable\"\n  // from `curr_val` as long as they are within `[0, x]`.\n\n  // Try jumping -b\n  `next_val = curr_val - b`\n  `next_rem = next_val % a`\n  If `next_val < 0`: continue (cannot jump below 0)\n  If `next_val < min_val[next_rem]`:\n    `min_val[next_rem] = next_val`\n    `q.appendleft((next_val, next_rem))` (0-cost edge: `next_val` is smaller)\n\nAfter this BFS, `min_val[r]` stores the smallest non-negative integer `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, *without the `x` constraint*.\nThe maximum value in `min_val` can be up to `a * b` (or `a * (a+b)`). Since `a, b <= 10^5`, this is about `10^{10}`, which is too large.\nHowever, `min_val[r]` cannot exceed `a * a` approximately (or `a * (a-1)`). The maximum value for `min_val[r]` is `a*(a-1) - b` for some `r`. A more precise bound is `a * (a-1)`. If `a` is `10^5`, then `a*a` is `10^{10}`. This is too large.\n\nThe values `min_val[r]` are actually bounded by `a * b / g`.\nThe maximum value of `min_val[r]` is `a * (a-1)` if `b` is large. If `b` is small, it can be `a * (a-1) - k * b`.\nThe maximum value in `min_val` is bounded by `a * (a-1)` (the largest value in `min_val` is `(a-1) * a - b * k` for some `k`, or `(a-1) * a`).\nA tighter bound for `min_val[r]` is `a * (a-1)`. If `a=10^5`, `a*(a-1)` is `10^{10}`. This is still too large.\n\nThe number of states `a` is `10^5`. The maximum value of `min_val[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]` is related to `a * (a-1)`.\nThe actual maximum for `min_val[r]` is `a * (a-1) - k*b` for some `k`.\nThis is at most `a * (a-1)`.\nIf `min_val[r]` is `V`, then all positions `V, V+a, V+2a, ...` are reachable.\nThe maximum value of `min_val[r]` can be `a * (a-1)`. This is `10^{10}` for `a=10^5`.\nThis means we have `a` values, each up to `10^{10}`.\nThe sum `sum(f(i))` goes up to `m=10^9`.\n\nThe problem is that `min_val[r]` can be very large.\nThe actual bound for `min_val[r]` is `a * (a-1)`.\nFor example, if `a=5, b=3`:\n`min_val`: `[0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`q = [(0,0)]`\nPop `(0,0)`:\n  `-b`: `0-3 = -3`. Invalid.\n`min_val = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\nNo new states. This is wrong.\nThe BFS should be on `min_val[r]` where `r` is `pos % g` for `g=gcd(a,b)`. This is `a/g` states.\nOr, it's `pos % a` and we need to check if `pos % g == 0`.\nLet's stick to `min_val[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]`.\n`min_val[0] = 0`.\nFrom `curr_val, curr_rem`:\n  `+a`: `curr_val + a`. `(curr_val + a) % a == curr_rem`. This is just `curr_val` itself, but larger.\n  `-b`: `curr_val - b`. If `curr_val - b >= 0`. New remainder `(curr_val - b) % a`.\nLet `d[r]` be the minimum reachable position `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p \\ge 0`.\n`d[0] = 0`, `d[r] = infinity` for `r \\neq 0`.\n`q = deque([(0,0)])`\nWhile `q`:\n  `val, rem = q.popleft()`\n  If `val > d[rem]`: continue\n\n  // Jump -b\n  `next_val = val - b`\n  If `next_val >= 0`:\n    `next_rem = next_val % a`\n    If `next_val < d[next_rem]`:\n      `d[next_rem] = next_val`\n      `q.appendleft((next_val, next_rem))` // 0-cost edge\n  \n  // Jump +a\n  // This is a 1-cost edge (in terms of values `val + a`).\n  // The state `val + a` has remainder `rem`.\n  // We are looking for minimum `val` for each remainder.\n  // The `+a` jump is not about finding a new minimum for a remainder.\n  // It's about finding values `val+a, val+2a, ...` which are implicitly reachable.\n  // If we have `val` for `rem`, then `val+a` for `rem` is also reachable.\n  // We need to find the minimum `val` for `rem`.\n  // The `+a` jump is useful to explore other remainders if it leads to a smaller value.\n  // E.g., from `val`, we can reach `val+a`. From `val+a`, we can jump `-b`.\n  // `(val+a-b) % a`. This is an 'edge' from `rem` to `(val+a-b)%a` with weight `a-b`.\n  \nThis is a standard shortest path problem on a graph with `a` nodes (remainders `0` to `a-1`).\nEdges are:\n1. From `r` to `(r-b)%a` with weight `-b`. (Actually, `(r-b+a)%a` with weight `-b`).\n   Since we want non-negative values, this is effectively `(r-b)%a` with value `val-b`.\n2. From `r` to `r` with weight `+a`. (This allows us to reach `val+a` from `val`).\n\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `k` is reachable from `0`.\n`dist[0] = 0`, `dist[r] = infinity` for `r \\neq 0`.\nUse a 0-1 BFS (Dijkstra-like):\n`q = collections.deque([(0, 0)])` // (value, remainder)\nWhile `q` is not empty:\n  `curr_val, curr_rem = q.popleft()`\n  If `curr_val > dist[curr_rem]`: continue\n\n  // Jump -b:\n  `next_rem_minus_b = (curr_rem - b % a + a) % a`\n  `next_val_minus_b = curr_val - b`\n  // We must ensure `next_val_minus_b >= 0`.\n  // If `curr_val >= b`, then `next_val_minus_b` is reachable.\n  // If `next_val_minus_b < dist[next_rem_minus_b]`:\n  //   `dist[next_rem_minus_b] = next_val_minus_b`\n  //   `q.appendleft((next_val_minus_b, next_rem_minus_b))`\n\n  // The `+a` jump is tricky. It doesn't change `curr_rem`.\n  // If we have `curr_val` for `curr_rem`, then `curr_val+a` is also reachable for `curr_rem`.\n  // From `curr_val+a`, we can jump `-b`. This leads to `(curr_val+a-b)` which has remainder `next_rem_minus_b`.\n  // The value is `curr_val+a-b`.\n  // This is an edge from `curr_rem` to `next_rem_minus_b` with weight `a-b`.\n  // So, from `curr_val` (for `curr_rem`), we can reach `curr_val + (a-b)` (for `next_rem_minus_b`).\n\n  // Let's refine the BFS for `dist[r]`:\n  // From `curr_val` for `curr_rem`:\n  // 1. Jump `-b`:\n  //    `target_val = curr_val - b`\n  //    If `target_val >= 0`:\n  //      `target_rem = target_val % a`\n  //      If `target_val < dist[target_rem]`:\n  //        `dist[target_rem] = target_val`\n  //        `q.appendleft((target_val, target_rem))` // 0-cost (smaller value)\n  // 2. Jump `+a` then `-b`:\n  //    `target_val = curr_val + a - b`\n  //    If `target_val >= 0`:\n  //      `target_rem = target_val % a`\n  //      If `target_val < dist[target_rem]`:\n  //        `dist[target_rem] = target_val`\n  //        `q.append((target_val, target_rem))` // 1-cost (larger value)\n  // This is a 0-1 BFS.\n  \nThe maximum value in `dist` array can be `a * (a-1)`. For `a=10^5`, this is `10^{10}`. Python handles large integers.\nThe number of states in BFS is `a`. Each state pushed to deque at most twice. Total time `O(a)`.\n\nAfter computing `dist[r]` for all `r \\in [0, a-1]`:\n`dist[r]` stores the smallest non-negative integer `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable from `0` (without `x` constraint).\nA position `p` is reachable within `[0, x]` if:\n1. `p` is reachable from `0` (i.e., `p = dist[p % a] + k * a` for some `k >= 0`).\n2. `p <= x`.\n3. `p` must be valid, i.e., `p >= 0`. (This is already handled by `dist` definition).\n\nSo, for a given `x`, `f(x)` is the count of all `p` such that `p \\le x` and `p = dist[p % a] + k * a` for some `k \\ge 0`.\nThis means for each `r \\in [0, a-1]`, we count how many `p` satisfy `p \\le x` and `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p \\ge dist[r]`.\nThe values are `dist[r], dist[r]+a, dist[r]+2a, ...`.\nThe largest such value is `dist[r] + k_max * a <= x`.\nSo `k_max * a <= x - dist[r]`.\n`k_max = floor((x - dist[r]) / a)`.\nThe number of such values for a given `r` is `k_max + 1`, provided `dist[r] <= x`.\nIf `dist[r] > x`, there are `0` values.\nSo, for each `r`, the count is `max(0, floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\n`f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\n\nWe need to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\n`sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\n`= sum_{r=0}^{a-1} sum_{i=0}^{m} max(0, floor((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\n\nLet's focus on `sum_{i=0}^{m} max(0, floor((i - D) / a) + 1)` for a fixed `D = dist[r]`.\nLet `g(i, D) = max(0, floor((i - D) / a) + 1)`.\n`g(i, D)` is `0` if `i < D`.\nIf `i >= D`, `g(i, D) = floor((i - D) / a) + 1`.\nLet `j = i - D`. Then `g(i, D) = floor(j / a) + 1`.\nThe sum is `sum_{i=D}^{m} (floor((i - D) / a) + 1)`.\nLet `k = i - D`. The sum becomes `sum_{k=0}^{m-D} (floor(k / a) + 1)`.\nLet `N = m - D`. We need to calculate `sum_{k=0}^{N} (floor(k / a) + 1)`.\nThis sum can be calculated efficiently.\nThe terms `floor(k/a)+1` are:\n`k=0, ..., a-1`: `floor(k/a)+1 = 1` (a terms)\n`k=a, ..., 2a-1`: `floor(k/a)+1 = 2` (a terms)\n...\n`k=q*a, ..., (q+1)*a-1`: `floor(k/a)+1 = q+1` (a terms)\n\nLet `q_max = floor(N / a)`.\nThe sum can be split into two parts:\n1. Full blocks: `k = 0, ..., q_max * a - 1`.\n   This is `a * (1 + 2 + ... + q_max) = a * q_max * (q_max + 1) / 2`.\n2. Remaining terms: `k = q_max * a, ..., N`.\n   The value of `floor(k/a)+1` for these terms is `q_max + 1`.\n   The number of terms is `N - q_max * a + 1`.\n   So, this part is `(N - q_max * a + 1) * (q_max + 1)`.\n\nThis calculation needs to be done for each `dist[r]`.\nThe total time complexity will be `O(a)` for BFS + `O(a)` for summing up.\nThis is `O(a)`. Given `a <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough. `m` can be `10^9`.\n\nLet's check constraints and potential edge cases:\n`m=0, a=1, b=1`: `f(0)=1`.

My calculation is `36`. What went wrong?\n\nThe definition of `f(x)`: \"number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nMy `dist[r]` calculation gives positions reachable *without the `x` constraint*.\nThe `x` constraint applies to *all intermediate jumps*.\nThis means `f(x)` is not simply `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nThe `dist[r]` values I calculated are the minimum points `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable from `0` *without any upper bound*.\nIf we want to reach `p` within `[0, x]`, then all intermediate positions must be `in [0, x]`.\n\nThis implies a different BFS structure.\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum upper bound `x` such that `k` is reachable from `0` and all intermediate positions are `in [0, x]`.\nThis is also not right.\nThe problem is `f(x)`. `f(x)` is monotonically non-decreasing.\n`f(x)` can be computed using a BFS where the maximum value in the queue is `x`.\nThe maximum value `a` is `10^5`.\nLet's consider `f(x)` values up to `x = 2 * a`. For `x=10^5`, this is `2*10^5`.\nFor small `x`, `f(x)` is simply the number of reachable points in `[0, x]`.\nThe maximum value of `a` is `10^5`.\nThe values `dist[r]` are correct for the \"ignoring `x` constraint\" part.\nThe `x` constraint means that if we are at `k`, we can jump `+a` only if `k+a <= x`, and `-b` only if `k-b >= 0`.\n\nLet `reachable_points_for_x` be the set of points for a given `x`.\n`reachable_points_for_x(x)`:\n  `q = deque([0])`\n  `visited = {0}`\n  While `q`:\n    `curr = q.popleft()`\n    If `curr + a <= x` and `curr + a` not in `visited`:\n      `visited.add(curr + a)`\n      `q.append(curr + a)`\n    If `curr - b >= 0` and `curr - b` not in `visited`:\n      `visited.add(curr - b)`\n      `q.append(curr - b)`\n  Return `len(visited)`.\n\nThis is what `f(x)` is defined as.\nThe issue is that `visited` values can go up to `x`. If `x` is `10^9`, this is too slow.\nThe maximum value that `curr` can take during the BFS is `x`.\nThe number of distinct reachable points is at most `x+1`.\nThe BFS takes `O(x+1)` time. This is too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation is that `f(x)` changes only when `x` crosses a reachable point.\nLet `R` be the set of all points reachable from `0` without any upper bound (`x` constraint).\n`R = { p | p = dist[p%a] + k*a, k >= 0 }`.\nThe `f(x)` is the number of points `p` in `R` such that `p <= x` AND all intermediate points to reach `p` are `<= x`.\nThis is a much stronger condition.\n\nLet `reachable_up_to_val[k]` be the minimum maximum value encountered on a path from `0` to `k`.\nThis is also not quite right.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be true if `k` is reachable.\n`dp[0] = true`.\n`q = deque([0])`\n`max_r = 0` (maximum reachable point so far)\nWhile `q`:\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  `max_r = max(max_r, curr)`\n  If `curr + a <= m` and `not dp[curr + a]`:\n    `dp[curr + a] = true`\n    `q.append(curr + a)`\n  If `curr - b >= 0` and `not dp[curr - b]`:\n    `dp[curr - b] = true`\n    `q.append(curr - b)`\n\nThis BFS will find all points reachable up to `m`.\nThe problem is that `f(x)` requires that *all intermediate jumps* are within `[0, x]`.\nSo, `f(x)` is not simply `count(p in dp such that p <= x)`.\n\nConsider the maximum value that `curr` can take during the BFS for `f(x)`. It's `x`.\nThe number of points `p` that can be generated by `a` and `-b` jumps is at most `a+b`.\nNo, it's not. It can be `a * (a-1)`.\nThe maximum value `k` such that `k` is reachable and `k < a * (a-1)` is `a * (a-1)`.\nThe total number of distinct reachable points is at most `a + b`.\nThe reachable points are `0, a, 2a, ..., k*a`.\nFrom `k*a`, we can jump `-b` to `k*a-b`.\nFrom `k*a-b`, we can jump `-b` to `k*a-2b`.\nOr `+a` to `k*a-b+a`.\nThe points are of the form `x_0 + n_a * a - n_b * b`.\nThe set of reachable points is `P = { k_a * a - k_b * b | k_a, k_b \\ge 0 }`.\nBut we need to consider the constraint `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `reachable_val[k]` be the minimum starting position `S` such that `k` is reachable from `S` by only `+a` and `-b` jumps, and all intermediate positions are `in [S, max_val]`.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's re-read the problem statement carefully: \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means that if we are at `k`, and we want to jump to `k+a`, then `k+a` must be `<= x`.\nIf we are at `k`, and we want to jump to `k-b`, then `k-b` must be `>= 0`.\n\nLet `max_reach_val = a + b`.\nLet's compute `f(x)` for `x` up to some `L = a+b`.\n`f(x)` for `x < a`: `f(x) = 1` (only `0` is reachable).\nFor `x >= a`:\n  `q = deque([0])`\n  `visited = {0}`\n  `max_val_in_q = 0`\n  While `q`:\n    `curr = q.popleft()`\n    `next_pos_a = curr + a`\n    If `next_pos_a <= x` and `next_pos_a` not in `visited`:\n      `visited.add(next_pos_a)`\n      `q.append(next_pos_a)`\n      `max_val_in_q = max(max_val_in_q, next_pos_a)`\n    `next_pos_b = curr - b`\n    If `next_pos_b >= 0` and `next_pos_b` not in `visited`:\n      `visited.add(next_pos_b)`\n      `q.append(next_pos_b)`\n      `max_val_in_q = max(max_val_in_q, next_pos_b)`\n  `f(x) = len(visited)`.\n\nThe crucial observation is that if `x` is large enough, specifically `x >= max(dist)`, where `dist` are the values from the 0-1 BFS, then `f(x)` will be `f(x-1) + 1` if `x` is reachable, and `f(x)` will be `f(x-1)` if `x` is not reachable.\nThe `dist` values are the minimum reachable points `p` for each `p % a`.\nThe maximum value in `dist` array can be `a * (a-1)` which is `10^{10}`.\nThis means that for `x` up to `10^{10}`, the behavior can be complex.\n\nLet's use the Example 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`.\n`f(0)`: `q=[0]`, `visited={0}`. `0+5 > 0`. `0-3 < 0`. `f(0)=1`.\n`f(1)`: `q=[0]`, `visited={0}`. `0+5 > 1`. `0-3 < 0`. `f(1)=1`.\n`f(2)`: `q=[0]`, `visited={0}`. `0+5 > 2`. `0-3 < 0`. `f(2)=1`.\n`f(3)`: `q=[0]`, `visited={0}`. `0+5 > 3`. `0-3 < 0`. `f(3)=1`.\n`f(4)`: `q=[0]`, `visited={0}`. `0+5 > 4`. `0-3 < 0`. `f(4)=1`.\n`f(5)`: `q=[0]`, `visited={0}`.\n  Pop `0`. `0+5=5`. `5<=5`. `visited={0,5}`. `q=[5]`.\n  `0-3=-3`.

The problem is its efficiency.\n\nThe values that `curr` can take during the BFS are up to `x`.\nThe maximum value `curr` can take without `+a` jumps leading to values `> x` is `x-a`.\nThe values are always `k*a - l*b`.\nThe maximum value that `curr` can reach before it *must* jump `+a` to `>x` is `x`.\nThe number of reachable points is at most `a+b`.\nThe maximum value for a reachable point `p` such that `p < a+b` is `a+b-1`.\nThe number of states in the BFS is bounded by `a+b`.\nThe total number of distinct integers reachable *without any upper bound* is `a/g + b/g - 1` if `gcd(a,b)=g`.\nNo, it is `a/g` if all values `0, g, 2g, ..., (a/g-1)*g` are reachable.\n\nLet `max_dist_val = max(dist[r])` from the 0-1 BFS (ignoring `x` constraint).\nThe `dist[r]` values are the smallest non-negative `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\nIf `x < max_dist_val`: We need to run the BFS up to `x`. This is `O(x)` time.\nIf `x >= max_dist_val`:\n  All `dist[r]` values are reachable.\n  For any `p = dist[r] + k*a`, if `p <= x`, then `p` is reachable.\n  Why? Because `dist[r]` is reachable. From `dist[r]`, we can make `k` jumps of `+a` to reach `p`.\n  Since `p >= dist[r]`, and `dist[r]` is the smallest value for that remainder, all intermediate jumps to reach `dist[r]` must be less than or equal to `dist[r]` (or `dist[r]` itself).\n  So if `x >= dist[r]`, then `dist[r]` is reachable within `[0, x]`.\n  Then `dist[r]+a` is reachable if `dist[r]+a <= x`.\n  This is true because `dist[r]` is reachable, and `dist[r]+a` is just one `+a` jump away.\n  The condition \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" means that from `k`, `k+a` must be `<=x` and `k-b` must be `>=0`.\n  If we reach `dist[r]` using only values `v <= dist[r]`, then if `x >= dist[r]`, we can reach `dist[r]` within `[0, x]`.\n  Then from `dist[r]`, we can reach `dist[r]+a` if `dist[r]+a <= x`.\n  And from `dist[r]+a`, we can reach `dist[r]+a-b` if `dist[r]+a-b >= 0`.\n  \nThe values `dist[r]` calculated by the 0-1 BFS are minimum values for each remainder `r`.\nLet `max_val_in_dist = max(dist[r] for r in range(a) if dist[r] != infinity)`.\nIf `m < max_val_in_dist`: We need to compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m` using the BFS.\nThe maximum value for `a` is `10^5`. The maximum value for `max_val_in_dist` could be `a*(a-1)` (e.g., `a=10^5, b=1`). This is `10^{10}`.\nThis means `max_val_in_dist` can be larger than `m`.\nIf `max_val_in_dist` is too large, we can't use it as a threshold.\n\nLet `P_k` be the set of reachable positions when the upper bound is `k`.\n`P_k` is the set of points `p` such that `p \\in [0,k]` and `p` is reachable.\n`f(k) = |P_k|`.\n`P_k` is computed by BFS.\nLet `limit = min(m, a + b + a)`. The sum `sum_{i=0}^{limit} f(i)` can be computed by BFS for each `i`.\nThis `limit` is arbitrary. A better limit would be related to `a` or `b`.\nThe maximum number of distinct reachable points is `a + b`.\nIt seems that the number of reachable points `f(x)` stabilizes after `x >= max(a,b)`.\nNo, this is wrong. `f(x)` continues to increase as long as `x` increases and `x` is a reachable point.\n\nThe example `m=100, a=100000, b=1` is interesting.\n`a` is very large. `b` is very small.\n`f(i)` for `i < a`: `f(i) = 1` (only `0` is reachable).\nFor `i` from `0` to `100`, `a=100000`. So `i < a` for all `i`.\nThus `f(i) = 1` for all `i` from `0` to `100`.\nSum `sum_{i=0}^{100} 1 = 101`. This matches example 3.\n\nExample `m=10^9, a=1, b=2019`.\n`a=1`. `dist[0]=0`. All integers are reachable.\n`f(i)`: `q=[0]`, `visited={0}`.\n  Pop `0`. `0+1=1`. `1<=i`. `visited={0,1}`. `q=[1]`.\n  `0-2019<0`.\n  Pop `1`. `1+1=2`. `2<=i`. `visited={0,1,2}`. `q=[2]`.\n  `1-2019<0`.\n  ...\n  Pop `k`. `k+1=k+1`. `k+1<=i`. `visited={0,...,k+1}`. `q=[k+1]`.\n  `k-2019`. If `k-2019>=0`, then `k-2019` is reachable.\n  For `f(i)`, `i` is the upper limit.\n  If `a=1`, then `0, 1, 2, ..., i` are all reachable.\n  The `k-b` jump is only relevant if it allows us to reach a point that is not `j*a`.\n  If `a=1`, all integers are of the form `j*a`.\n  So `f(i) = i+1`.\n  `sum_{i=0}^{m} (i+1) = sum_{j=1}^{m+1} j = (m+1)(m+2)/2`.\n  For `m=10^9`, `(10^9+1)(10^9+2)/2 = 500000001500000001`. This matches example 2.\n\nThis suggests that there is a threshold `L`.\nFor `i < L`, `f(i)` must be computed by BFS.\nFor `i >= L`, `f(i)` follows a pattern.\nWhat is `L`?\nLet `max_reachable_val = max(dist[r])`.\nIf `x >= max_reachable_val`:\n  Then for any `p = dist[r] + k*a`, if `p <= x`, then `p` is reachable.\n  The condition \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" is the key.\n  If `x` is large enough, say `x >= a * (a-1)`, then all `dist[r]` values are within `[0, x]`.\n  And if `dist[r]` is reachable, then `dist[r]+a` is reachable (provided `dist[r]+a <= x`).\n  And `dist[r]+a-b` is reachable (provided `dist[r]+a-b >= 0`).\n  This means that for `x` sufficiently large, the BFS will find all points `p = dist[r] + k*a` where `p <= x`.\n  The threshold `L` is `max_val_in_dist`.\n  The values `dist[r]` are the minimum *non-negative* values `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\n  The crucial point is that if `x` is large enough, specifically `x >= max_val_in_dist`, then any value `p = dist[r] + k*a` with `p \\le x` is reachable.\n  Why? Because `dist[r]` is reachable by a path that stays within `[0, dist[r]]`.\n  If `x >= dist[r]`, then this path stays within `[0, x]`.\n  From `dist[r]`, we can make `k` jumps of `+a`. All these intermediate positions `dist[r], dist[r]+a, ..., dist[r]+k*a` are within `[0, x]`.\n  So, for `x >= max_val_in_dist`, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\n  The `max_val_in_dist` can be `a * (a-1)`.\n  Let `L_max = a * (a-1)`.\n  If `m < L_max`:\n    We can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m` using the BFS.\n    The total time would be `m * (a+b)`. This is too slow if `m=10^5, a=10^5`. `10^{10}`.\n    The BFS for `f(i)` is `O(i + a + b)`. So `sum_{i=0}^m O(i)` is `O(m^2)`.\n    No, `O(i)` is the bound on number of states, which is actually `O(x)`. This is too slow.\n\nThe actual bound for `max_val_in_dist` is `a * (a-1)`.\nThe number of distinct reachable points is at most `a+b`.\nNo, it's not. The number of reachable points could be `m+1` if `a=1`.\n\nLet's reconsider the 0-1 BFS for `dist[r]`:\n`dist[r]` is the minimum `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable from `0` *without an upper bound constraint*.\nThe maximum value in `dist` is `K_max`.\nThe number of elements in `dist` is `a`.\nIf `m < K_max`:\n  We need to compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n  The BFS for `f(i)` is `O(a*b)` states. No.\n  The BFS for `f(i)` is `O(i)` states.\n  This is the problem.\n  The total sum `sum_{i=0}^m f(i)`.\n  If `m` is small, `m <= 2*a` (e.g., `2*10^5`), we can do BFS for each `i`.\n  Total time `O(m * (a+b))`. Still too slow.\n\nLet `L = 2 * a`. For `i <= L`, compute `f(i)` by BFS.\nFor `i > L`, `f(i)` has a certain pattern.\nThe number of reachable points for `x` up to `L` is at most `L+1`.\nThe BFS takes `O(L)` time. So `O(L*L)` if we do it for each `i`.\nThe `f(x)` function:\n`f(x)` is `len(reachable_points_for_x(x))`.\n`reachable_points_for_x(x)` can be efficiently updated from `reachable_points_for_x(x-1)`.\n`f(x) = f(x-1) + 1` if `x` is reachable and `x` was not reachable for `x-1`.\n`f(x) = f(x-1)` otherwise.\nTo determine if `x` is reachable:\n  `q = deque([0])`\n  `visited = {0}`\n  While `q`:\n    `curr = q.popleft()`\n    If `curr == x`: return `True`\n    If `curr + a <= x` and `curr + a` not in `visited`:\n      `visited.add(curr + a)`\n      `q.append(curr + a)`\n    If `curr - b >= 0` and `curr - b` not in `visited`:\n      `visited.add(curr - b)`\n      `q.append(curr - b)`\n  Return `False`.\nThis is `O(x)` for each `x`. Still `O(m^2)`.\n\nThe `dist[r]` values are the minimum `p` for each `p % a`.\nLet `K_0 = max(dist[r])`.\nIf `m < K_0`:\n  The `f(i)` function is irregular.\n  We need to compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n  The values `dist[r]` are the minimum *non-negative* values `p`.\n  For `i` from `0` to `min(m, K_0 + a + b)`:\n    We can compute `f(i)` using BFS. The number of states in BFS is `i`.\n    This is `O(i)`. Total `O(min(m, K_0)^2)`. Still too slow if `K_0` is large.\n    The number of states in BFS is `O(a+b)`.\n    `visited` set can contain up to `a+b` elements.\n    The maximum value can be `a+b`.\n    The maximum value for a reachable point is `a+b`.\n    No, this is wrong. The reachable points can be `k*a` which is very large.\n\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^m f(i)`.\nLet `L = a + b`.\nFor `i <= L`:\n  We can compute `f(i)` by BFS. The number of reachable points is at most `L+1`.\n  The BFS takes `O(L)` time. So `O(L^2)` for `sum_{i=0}^L f(i)`.\n  `L=2*10^5`. `L^2 = 4*10^{10}`. This is too slow.\n\nThe `dist` array calculated by the 0-1 BFS is correct for the \"without upper bound\" condition.\nLet `max_dist_val = max(dist[r] for r in range(a) if dist[r] != float('inf'))`.\nIf `m < max_dist_val`:\n  We need to compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n  The number of distinct reachable points for `f(i)` is at most `i+1`.\n  The values `dist[r]` are the minimum `p` for each `p % a`.\n  The number of reachable points `p <= i` is `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((i - dist[r])/a) + 1)`.\n  This is the formula `F(i)` that I derived earlier.\n  This formula `F(i)` is correct for `f(i)` *if `i` is large enough*.\n  Specifically, if `i >= max_dist_val`.\n  Let's verify this. If `i >= max_dist_val`, then for any `r`, `dist[r] <= i`.\n  The path to `dist[r]` stays within `[0, dist[r]]`. Since `dist[r] <= i`, this path is valid for `f(i)`.\n  From `dist[r]`, we can reach `dist[r]+k*a` by `k` jumps of `+a`.\n  All intermediate points `dist[r], dist[r]+a, ..., dist[r]+(k-1)*a` are `<= dist[r]+(k-1)*a`.\n  If `dist[r]+k*a <= i`, then all these intermediate points are `<= i`.\n  So `F(i)` is indeed `f(i)` for `i >= max_dist_val`.\n\nSo we can split the sum into two parts:\n1. `sum_{i=0}^{min(m, max_dist_val - 1)} f(i)`\n2. `sum_{i=max(0, max_dist_val)}^{m} F(i)`\n\nPart 2 is easy to compute using the `dist` values and the sum formula for `F(i)`.\n`sum_{i=K}^{M} F(i) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} sum_{i=K}^{M} max(0, floor((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1)`.\nFor each `D = dist[r]`:\n  `sum_{i=K}^{M} max(0, floor((i - D) / a) + 1)`\n  This sum can be computed by `sum_{k=0}^{M-D} (floor(k/a)+1)` minus `sum_{k=0}^{K-1-D} (floor(k/a)+1)`.\n  Each of these `sum_{k=0}^{N} (floor(k/a)+1)` takes `O(1)` time.\n  So Part 2 takes `O(a)` time.\n\nThe issue is Part 1: `sum_{i=0}^{min(m, max_dist_val - 1)} f(i)`.\nLet `L_eff = min(m, max_dist_val - 1)`.\nWe need to compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `L_eff`.\nThe `max_dist_val` can be `a * (a-1)`. This is `10^{10}`.\nIf `m < a * (a-1)`, then `L_eff` can be `m`.\nIf `m` is `10^9`, and `a` is `10^5`, `max_dist_val` can be `10^{10}`. Then `L_eff = m = 10^9`.\nWe cannot compute `f(i)` for `10^9` values using BFS.\n\nThe maximum value of `a` is `10^5`.\nLet's reconsider the BFS for `f(x)`. The number of states is `x+1`.\nBut it's not `x+1`. The number of states is bounded by the maximum point we can reach.\nThe maximum point we can reach in `[0, x]` is `x`.\nThe number of distinct integers reachable is at most `x+1`.\nThe BFS takes `O(x)` time.\nThe number of points reachable by `+a` and `-b` is at most `a+b`.\nNo, it's not `a+b`. It's `a/g` points.\n\nThe number of states in the BFS for `f(x)` is bounded by `a+b`.\nNo, it's bounded by `x`.\nThe maximum number of distinct values reachable by BFS from `0` to `x` is `x+1`.\nThe number of edges in BFS is `2 * (x+1)`. Total `O(x)`.\n\nThe `max_dist_val` is the crucial value.\nWhat if `m` is large, but `a` is small? `m=10^9, a=2, b=3`.\n`dist[0]=0, dist[1]=inf`.\n`q = deque([(0,0)])`\nPop `(0,0)`:\n  `target_val = 0-3 = -3`. Invalid.\n  `target_val = 0+2-3 = -1`. Invalid.\nQueue empty.\n`dist = [0, inf]`.\n`max_dist_val = 0`.\nSo `L_eff = min(m, -1) = -1`. Part 1 is empty sum.\nPart 2: `sum_{i=0}^{m} F(i)`.\n`F(i) = max(0, floor((i-0)/2)+1) = floor(i/2)+1`.\n`sum_{i=0}^{m} (floor(i/2)+1)`.\nThis is `sum_{k=0}^{m} (floor(k/a)+1)` with `a=2`.\nThis is `O(1)`. Correct.\n\nWhat if `a` is large, `b` is large? `m=10^9, a=10^5, b=10^5`.\n`dist[0]=0`.\n`q = deque([(0,0)])`\nPop `(0,0)`:\n  `0-b < 0`.\n  `0+a-b`. Let `a=10^5, b=10^5`. `0+a-b = 0`. `dist[0]=0`.\n  Queue empty.\n`dist = [0, inf, ..., inf]`.\n`max_dist_val = 0`.\nPart 2: `sum_{i=0}^m (floor((i-0)/a)+1)`.\nThis is `O(1)`. Correct.\n\nThe only case where `max_dist_val` can be large is when `b` is small relative to `a`.\nExample: `a=5, b=3`. `dist=[0,1,2,3,4]`. `max_dist_val = 4`.\n`L_eff = min(7, 4-1) = 3`.\nPart 1: `sum_{i=0}^{3} f(i)`.\n`f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1`.

Still not `19`.\n\nMy understanding of `f(x)` for `x >= max_dist_val` must be wrong.\nThe `max_dist_val` is the largest value `p` such that `p < a` and `p` is reachable.\nIf `x < a`, `f(x)` is `1`.\nIf `x >= a`, `f(x)` can be larger.\nThe maximum value of `max_dist_val` is `a * (a-1)`. This is `10^{10}`.\nThe BFS for `dist[r]` computes minimum `p` for `p \\pmod a`.\nThe maximum value `p` can be `a * (a-1)`.\nThe number of states in the BFS for `dist[r]` is `a`.\nThe `dist` values can be very large.\n\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^m f(i)`.\nLet `K = 2 * a`.\nWe calculate `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `min(m, K)` using the BFS.\nThe BFS for `f(i)` takes `O(i)` time. Total `O(K^2)`.\nThis is `(2a)^2 = 4a^2 = 4 * 10^{10}`. Too slow.\n\nThe BFS for `f(i)` has `visited` set. If `visited` has `V` elements, it takes `O(V)` time.\n`V <= i+1`.\nThe number of states in BFS is `a+b`.\nThe maximum value `p` in `visited` is `i`.\nThe maximum number of distinct values reachable is `i+1`.\nThe BFS for `f(i)` takes `O(i)` time. `sum_{i=0}^{min(m, K)} O(i)` is `O(min(m, K)^2)`.\n\nThe `K` should be `a+b`.\nLet `K_THRESHOLD = a+b`.\nIf `m < K_THRESHOLD`, then we can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m` using BFS for each `i`.\nThe BFS for `f(i)` can be optimized. `f(i)` can be computed from `f(i-1)`.\nInitialize `reachable_set = {0}`. `q = deque([0])`.\n`curr_sum = 0`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `m`:\n  While `q` is not empty and `q[0] + a <= i`:\n    `next_pos_a = q[0] + a`\n    If `next_pos_a` not in `reachable_set`:\n      `reachable_set.add(next_pos_a)`\n      `q.append(next_pos_a)`\n  While `q` is not empty and `q[0] - b >= 0`:\n    `next_pos_b = q[0] - b`\n    If `next_pos_b` not in `reachable_set`:\n      `reachable_set.add(next_pos_b)`\n      `q.append(next_pos_b)`\n  `f(i) = len(reachable_set)`.\n  `curr_sum += f(i)`.\nThis is not right. The BFS needs to be specific for each `i`.\nA point `p` is reachable for `f(i)` if `p <= i` and all intermediate points are `in [0,i]`.\nThis means the BFS should be limited to `[0,i]`.\nThe BFS for `f(i)` is `O(i)`.\n\nThe `K_THRESHOLD` value must be small enough.\nLet `L = a + b`.\nIf `m < L`:\n  `total_sum = 0`\n  For `i` from `0` to `m`:\n    `q = deque([0])`\n    `visited = {0}`\n    While `q`:\n      `curr = q.popleft()`\n      If `curr + a <= i` and `curr + a` not in `visited`:\n        `visited.add(curr + a)`\n        `q.append(curr + a)`\n      If `curr - b >= 0` and `curr - b` not in `visited`:\n        `visited.add(curr - b)`\n        `q.append(curr - b)`\n    `total_sum += len(visited)`\n  This is `O(m * (a+b))`. If `m=10^5, a=10^5, b=10^5`, this is `10^5 * 2*10^5 = 2*10^{10}`. Still too slow.\n\nThe solution must use the `dist` array.\nThe `dist` array is `min_val[r]` for `r` in `0..a-1`.\n`min_val[r]` is the minimum non-negative `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\nThe maximum value in `min_val` is `K_max = max(min_val)`.\nThis `K_max` can be `a * (a-1)`.\nIf `m < K_max`:\n  We need to compute `sum_{i=0}^m f(i)`.\n  The problem is that `f(i)` is not `F(i)` when `i < K_max`.\n  The `f(i)` calculation is tricky.\n  The maximum value of `a` or `b` is `10^5`.\n  The number of reachable points up to `K_max` is `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((K_max - 1 - dist[r])/a) + 1)`.\n  This is the value of `F(K_max - 1)`.\n  The number of distinct values is at most `a`.\n  The number of possible remainders `p % g` is `a/g`.\n  The maximum `K_max` is `a * (a-1)`.\n\nLet `L = 2 * a`.\nWe compute `dist[r]` for `r=0..a-1` using 0-1 BFS.

The maximum shortest path in a graph with `N` nodes and edge weights up to `W` is `N*W`.\nHere, edge weights are `a-b` (positive) and `-b` (negative).\nThis is why a 0-1 BFS (Dijkstra-like) is used.\nThe maximum value in `dist` is indeed bounded by `a+b`.\nSpecifically, `max_dist_val <= a+b-g`.\nThis is a common result for Frobenius coin problem / extended Euclidean algorithm.\nThe largest unreachable number (if `gcd(a,b)=1`) is `a*b - a - b`.\nThe minimum reachable values for `p \\pmod a` are bounded by `a*b`.\nIf `b` is `1`, `dist[r]` is `(a-r-1)`. Max is `a-1`.\nIf `a=5, b=3`, `dist=[0,1,2,3,4]`. Max is `4`. `a+b-g = 5+3-1 = 7`.\nThe bound `a+b-g` is a safe upper bound for `max_dist_val`.\n\nFinal check for the `sum_floor_plus_one` function:\n`sum_{k=0}^{N} (floor(k/A)+1)`\n`N=7, A=5`:\n`q_max = floor(7/5) = 1`.\n`res = 5 * 1 * 2 // 2 = 5`.\n`res += (7 - 1*5 + 1) * (1 + 1) = (7-5+1)*2 = 3*2 = 6`.\n`res = 5+6 = 11`.

What is wrong?\n\nThe `f(x)` calculation for `x < max_dist_val` must be done by the full BFS.\nThe `is_reachable` array in step 3 only tells if `k` is reachable within `[0, L_eff]`.\nIt does not say that `k` is reachable within `[0, i]` for `i < L_eff`.\nFor `f(5)`: `visited={0,2,5}`. `len=3`.\nMy `is_reachable` for `L_eff=4` is just `{0}`.\n`f(5)` is not `F(5)`. `F(5) = sum_{r=0}^4 max(0, floor((5-r)/5)+1) = 2+2+1+1+1 = 7`.\nThe example output `19` is correct. My current approach produces `26`.\n\nThe `f(i)` for `i < max_dist_val` is not `F(i)`.\nThe `f(i)` for `i >= max_dist_val` is `F(i)`.\nThe problem is that my `is_reachable` array in step 3 (for `L_eff`) is computed for `[0, L_eff]`.\nThis means `is_reachable[k]` is true if `k` is reachable *and all intermediate steps are in `[0, L_eff]`*.\nThis is correct.\n\nThe issue is that `f(i)` is `sum_{k=0}^i (is_reachable_in_range(k, i))`.\n`is_reachable_in_range(k, i)` is true if `k` is reachable from `0` and all intermediate steps are in `[0, i]`.\nThis is exactly what the BFS for `f(i)` does.\nSo `f(i)` is `len(visited)` from the BFS.\n\nThe `L_eff` is `min(m, a+b)`.\nThe `max_dist_val` is `a+b-g`.\nThe `dist` array values are `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\nThe maximum `p` is `a+b-g`.\nThis means if `x >= a+b-g`, then all `dist[r]` values are reachable *within `[0, x]`*.\nAnd from `dist[r]`, we can reach `dist[r]+k*a` by `k` jumps of `+a`.\nAll these intermediate points `dist[r], dist[r]+a, ..., dist[r]+(k-1)*a` are valid if `dist[r]+k*a <= x`.\nThis is correct.\nSo `f(x) = F(x)` for `x >= a+b-g`.\nLet `L = a+b-g`.\nPart 1: `sum_{i=0}^{min(m, L-1)} f(i)`.\nPart 2: `sum_{i=max(0, L)}^{m} F(i)`.\n\nLet `max_x_for_bfs = min(m, a+b)`.\nThe `a+b` bound is `2*10^5`.\nWe can use a BFS to compute `f_vals[i]` for `i` from `0` to `max_x_for_bfs`.\n`f_vals = [0] * (max_x_for_bfs + 1)`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\n`curr_reachable_set = {0}`.\n`f_vals[0] = 1`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `max_x_for_bfs`:\n  `newly_reachable = set()`.\n  For `p` in `curr_reachable_set`:\n    If `p+a == i`: `newly_reachable.add(i)`.\n    If `p-b == i`: `newly_reachable.add(i)`.\n  This is not BFS.\n\nThe BFS for `f(i)` is `O(i)`.\nThe total sum `sum_{i=0}^{L} f(i)` is `O(L^2)`.\nThis is `O((a+b)^2) = (2*10^5)^2 = 4*10^{10}`. This is too slow.\n\nThe problem requires a faster way to sum `f(i)` for `i < L`.\nThe values `f(i)` for `i=0...L` must be computed faster.\nThis is similar to `sum_{i=0}^L count(reachable_points <= i)`.\nThis is `sum_{k=0}^L (L-k+1) * is_reachable[k]`.\nThis `is_reachable[k]` is defined as `k` is reachable within `[0, L]`.\nThis is exactly what I had before.\nFor `m=7, a=5, b=3`: `L = a+b-g = 5+3-1 = 7`.\n`L_eff = min(7, 7) = 7`.\nPart 1: `sum_{i=0}^{7} f(i)`.\n  Compute `is_reachable[k]` for `k=0..7` (reachable within `[0,7]`).\n  `is_reachable = [T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T]` for `k=0..7`.

The example output is `19`.\n  My `is_reachable` for `L_eff=7` is `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}`.\n  But `f(5)=3`, `f(6)=3`.\n  The `is_reachable` array for `L_eff` is for the *entire* range `[0, L_eff]`.\n  `f(i)` is the count of reachable points *within `[0, i]`*.\n  So, `f(i)` is not `sum_{k=0}^i is_reachable[k]` (where `is_reachable` is for `[0, L_eff]`).\n\nI need to compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `L`.\n`L = a+b-g` (at most `2*10^5`).\n`f_vals = [0] * (L + 1)`.\n`curr_q = deque([0])`.\n`curr_reachable_set = {0}`.\n`max_val_in_curr_q = 0`.\n`f_vals[0] = 1`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `L`:\n  `f_vals[i] = f_vals[i-1]`.\n  While `curr_q`:\n    `p = curr_q.popleft()`.\n    // Try to jump `+a`\n    `next_p_a = p + a`.\n    If `next_p_a <= i` and `next_p_a` not in `curr_reachable_set`:\n      `curr_reachable_set.add(next_p_a)`.\n      `curr_q.append(next_p_a)`.\n    // Try to jump `-b`\n    `next_p_b = p - b`.\n    If `next_p_b >= 0` and `next_p_b` not in `curr_reachable_set`:\n      `curr_reachable_set.add(next_p_b)`.\n      `curr_q.append(next_p_b)`.\n  `f_vals[i] = len(curr_reachable_set)`.\nThis is still recalculating BFS for each `i`.\nThe `curr_q` should be reset for each `i`.\n\nThis is the standard problem for `f(i)`:\n`f_vals = [0] * (L+1)`.\n`total_sum = 0`.\n`reachable = [False] * (L+1)`.\n`reachable[0] = True`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\n`count = 1`.\n`total_sum += 1`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `L`:\n  If `reachable[i]`:\n    If `i + a <= L` and not `reachable[i+a]`:\n      `reachable[i+a] = True`\n      `q.append(i+a)`\n    If `i - b >= 0` and not `reachable[i-b]`:\n      `reachable[i-b] = True`\n      `q.append(i-b)`\n  While `q`:\n    `curr = q.popleft()`.\n    If `curr > i`: `q.appendleft(curr)` // Put back if too large for current `i`\n    Else:\n      // Process `curr`.
