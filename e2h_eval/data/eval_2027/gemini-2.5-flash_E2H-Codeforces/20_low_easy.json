For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Multiset of Strings\" Problem: A Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Multiset of Strings\" problem, and I need a Python solution. Let's break down what's going on here. We've got binary strings of varying lengths, and a \"beautiful\" multiset concept with these `c_s` values, where `s` is a string prefix.  The key is that the number of ways to choose these `c_s` values has to result in a maximum possible multiset size of exactly `f`.\n\nThe first thing that jumps out is the structure. These strings and their prefixes are screaming \"binary trie\"! It's a natural way to represent the relationships. A string of length `n` is a leaf, and shorter strings are internal nodes. The prefix condition translates to ancestor-descendant relationships in the trie.\n\nThinking about it more, if a string `s` has length `L`, the number of length-`n` strings with `s` as a prefix is `2^(n-L)`.  The constraint `count(s) <= c_s` is the crucial rule. `count(s)` is essentially the total \"flow\" or number of strings that start with `s`.\n\nTo maximize the multiset size, I want to pack as many strings as possible into the multiset, given the constraints.  Let `x_t` be the count of string `t` in the multiset. The total size is `sum(x_t)` for all length-`n` strings.  Every prefix `s` has a constraint `count(s) <= c_s`. The challenge is, how does increasing `x_t` affect `count(s)` for its ancestors in the trie?  It looks like a dynamic programming approach on the trie structure might be the way to go here.\n\nSo the problem becomes: maximize `sum(x_t)` (the multiset size) subject to `count(s) <= c_s` for all prefixes `s`. I'm starting to think this has a flavor of a max-flow or min-cut problem.  Each node's children contribute to its total count. So, `count(s) = count(s0) + count(s1)`.  The `c_s` values are upper bounds.  I need to figure out how to elegantly express this flow constraint in Python to find the correct number of ways to set those `c_s`'s.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all binary strings `s` of length 1 to `n` such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. A beautiful multiset consists of strings of length `n`, and for any prefix `s`, the count of strings in the multiset having `s` as a prefix must not exceed `c_s`.\n\nLet `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all strings `s` of length `L` to `n` (i.e., `s` is a suffix of some string of length `L-1`) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset, considering only strings that start with a particular prefix of length `L-1` and are constrained by `c_s` values *within this subtree*, is `val`.\n\nThis DP state is a bit tricky. A more common approach for trie-like problems is to think about the maximum number of items that can be \"pushed up\" from a subtree.\nLet `dp[depth][max_count]` be the number of ways to assign `c_s` values for all strings `s` in the subtree rooted at a node at `depth` (where the root is depth 0) such that the maximum number of full-length strings that can be placed in this subtree, respecting the `c_s` values *within this subtree*, is `max_count`.\nThe `c_s` values for strings *outside* this subtree (i.e., ancestors of the current node) also constrain `max_count`. However, the problem asks for the maximum possible size *overall*, which is determined by the most restrictive `c_s` in any path from root to leaf.\n\nConsider a binary trie of depth `n`. Each node `s` corresponds to a string. `c_s` is an upper bound on `count(s)`, the number of length-`n` strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is given by `min(c_s)` over all `s` that are prefixes of length-`n` strings in the multiset, where `s` can be any string from length 1 to `n`.\nMore precisely, the maximum size `M` is `min_{s} c_s'`, where `c_s'` is `c_s` if `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c_s'` is `c_s` if `s` is an internal node.\nThis is incorrect. The constraint is `count(s) <= c_s`.\nThe value `count(s)` for an internal node `s` is the sum of `count(s0)` and `count(s1)`.\nThe maximum number of strings we can put in the multiset is determined by a \"bottleneck\" `c_s` value.\nIf we consider any path from the root to a leaf (a string of length `n`), say `s_0, s_1, ..., s_n` (where `s_0` is the empty string, `s_i` is the prefix of `s_n` of length `i`), then the number of times `s_n` can appear in the multiset is limited by `c_{s_n}`.\nThe total number of strings in the multiset is `sum_{t of length n} x_t`.\nThe constraints are `sum_{t: s is prefix of t} x_t <= c_s`.\nThis structure is exactly what a min-cut formulation on a tree-like network would yield. The maximum flow from source to sink is the minimum capacity of any cut. In this case, the maximum total count of strings is `min_{s} c_s`. This is a known result for this specific type of prefix constraint.\n\nSo, the problem simplifies: we need to choose `c_s` for all `2(2^n - 1)` strings `s` (length 1 to `n`) such that `min(c_s)` over all these strings is exactly `f`.\nEach `c_s` can be chosen from `0` to `k`.\n\nLet `N_strings = 2(2^n - 1)` be the total number of binary strings `s` of length 1 to `n`.\nWe need to count ways to choose `c_s \\in [0, k]` for each of these `N_strings` strings such that `min_{s} c_s = f`.\n\nThis can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion or a direct counting method:\nTotal ways such that `min_{s} c_s >= f`:\nEach `c_s` must be chosen from `[f, k]`. There are `k - f + 1` choices for each `c_s`.\nSo, `(k - f + 1)^{N_strings}` ways.\n\nTotal ways such that `min_{s} c_s >= f+1`:\nEach `c_s` must be chosen from `[f+1, k]`. There are `k - (f+1) + 1 = k - f` choices for each `c_s`.\nSo, `(k - f)^{N_strings}` ways.\n\nThe number of ways such that `min_{s} c_s = f` is `(ways where min >= f) - (ways where min >= f+1)`.\nThis is `(k - f + 1)^{N_strings} - (k - f)^{N_strings}`.\nAll calculations should be done modulo 998244353.\n\nWe need to be careful about edge cases:\n1. If `f > k`: `k - f + 1` would be `0` or negative. `(k - f + 1)^{N_strings}` would be `0`. Similarly `k - f` would be negative. In this case, it's impossible for `min(c_s)` to be `f`, so the answer is `0`.\n2. If `f = 0`: `k - f + 1 = k + 1`. `k - f = k`. The formula becomes `(k+1)^{N_strings} - k^{N_strings}`. This is correct.\n3. If `f = k`: `k - f + 1 = 1`. `k - f = 0`. The formula becomes `1^{N_strings} - 0^{N_strings}`.\n   `1^{N_strings} = 1`.\n   `0^{N_strings}` is `0` if `N_strings > 0`, and `1` if `N_strings = 0`.\n   `N_strings = 2(2^n - 1)`. Since `n >= 1`, `N_strings >= 2(2^1 - 1) = 2`. So `N_strings > 0`.\n   Thus, `0^{N_strings} = 0`. The result is `1 - 0 = 1`. This is correct, as the only way `min(c_s) = k` is if all `c_s = k`. There's only one way.\n\nLet's check the constraints:\n`1 <= n <= 15`\n`N_strings = 2(2^n - 1)`. For `n=15`, `N_strings = 2(2^15 - 1) = 2(32768 - 1) = 2 * 32767 = 65534`.\n`1 <= k, f <= 2 * 10^5`\n\nThe exponent `N_strings` can be up to `65534`, which is fine for modular exponentiation.\nThe bases `k - f + 1` and `k - f` can be up to `2 * 10^5 + 1`.\n\nThe modulo is `998244353`.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    # Calculate the total number of binary strings of length 1 to n\n    # This is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2 * (2^n - 1)\n    num_strings = (1 << (n + 1)) - 2\n\n    # If f is greater than k, it's impossible to have min(c_s) = f\n    # because c_s can only go up to k.\n    if f > k:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Calculate (k - f + 1)^num_strings mod MOD\n    # This is the number of ways where min(c_s) >= f\n    base1 = k - f + 1\n    term1 = pow(base1, num_strings, MOD)\n\n    # Calculate (k - f)^num_strings mod MOD\n    # This is the number of ways where min(c_s) >= f + 1\n    base2 = k - f\n    term2 = pow(base2, num_strings, MOD)\n\n    # The result is (ways where min >= f) - (ways where min >= f + 1)\n    # Ensure the result is non-negative by adding MOD if necessary\n    ans = (term1 - term2 + MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
