She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Browser Tab Closing Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Browser\" problem and it's basically a shortest path problem in disguise. We've got `n` tabs, a cursor at `pos`, and we need to close tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. The core challenge is figuring out the most efficient way to get the cursor to the right positions to close those tabs.\n\nThe actions we can take - moving left, right, closing tabs to the left or right - are the edges in our implicit graph. The cost is time, and we're aiming to minimize the total seconds. Dynamic programming or a greedy approach feels like the way to go here.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the desired end state: only tabs `[l, r]` are open. That means closing `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\n\nI'm thinking about those edge cases. If `l=1` and `r=n`, we're done; zero seconds needed. That gives me a sanity check. Now, it seems logical to break this into two subproblems: closing tabs to the left and closing tabs to the right. The order we do them in might matter, though.\n\nTo close `[1, l-1]`, I need the cursor at or to the *right* of `l` and then I can do a \"close left\" operation. Similarly, to close `[r+1, n]`, the cursor needs to be at or to the *left* of `r` before a \"close right\" operation.\n\nI'm starting to think about different scenarios. Let's call the current cursor position `p`. The open range is `[current_a, current_b]` initially `[1, n]`.\n\nIf `l=1`, it's simpler: just close tabs `[r+1, n]`. We *have* to get the cursor to `r` and then close. The total seconds will be the absolute difference between the cursor position and `r` (how many moves to get there), plus the one second to close. So, `abs(pos - r) + 1`. That feels right.\n\nIf `r=n`, we only need to close `[1, l-1]`. Similar idea: cursor to `l`, then close. Need to formalize this more, though. I'm almost ready to start coding a solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. The cursor starts at `pos`. Each move (left/right) or close operation takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the operations and target state:\n1.  **Closing tabs `[1, l-1]`**: To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l` (or any tab to its right), and then we perform a \"close left\" operation. After this, the minimum index of an unclosed tab becomes `l`.\n2.  **Closing tabs `[r+1, n]`**: To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r` (or any tab to its left), and then we perform a \"close right\" operation. After this, the maximum index of an unclosed tab becomes `r`.\n\nWe need to perform both of these operations. The key insight is that the two closing operations can be performed in any order, or interleaved with cursor movements. The total time will be the sum of:\n*   Time to move the cursor to `l` (if we close left first) or `r` (if we close right first).\n*   Time for the first closing operation (1 second).\n*   Time to move the cursor from the position after the first close to the position needed for the second close.\n*   Time for the second closing operation (1 second).\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: No tabs need to be closed.**\nIf `l=1` and `r=n`, then all tabs are already within the desired range `[1, n]`. No operations are needed.\nTime = 0.\n\n**Scenario 2: Only tabs to the left need to be closed (`r=n`).**\nWe need to close `[1, l-1]`.\nThe cursor must move to `l` and then perform a \"close left\" operation.\n*   Time to move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n*   Time to close tabs `[1, l-1]`: 1 second.\nTotal time = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**Scenario 3: Only tabs to the right need to be closed (`l=1`).**\nWe need to close `[r+1, n]`.\nThe cursor must move to `r` and then perform a \"close right\" operation.\n*   Time to move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n*   Time to close tabs `[r+1, n]`: 1 second.\nTotal time = `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Scenario 4: Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`).**\nWe need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two close operations and potentially two sets of cursor movements.\n\nThere are two main strategies:\n\n**Strategy A: Close left first, then close right.**\n1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)`.\n2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: 1. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `r - l`. (Cursor always moves right from `l` to `r`).\n4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: 1. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\nTotal time for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\n**Strategy B: Close right first, then close left.**\n1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)`.\n2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: 1. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `r - l`. (Cursor always moves left from `r` to `l`).\n4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: 1. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\nTotal time for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n\nThe minimum time will be the minimum of these two strategies.\n`min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine all cases:\n\n1.  **If `l=1` and `r=n`**: `ans = 0`\n2.  **If `l=1` (only close right)**: `ans = abs(pos - r) + 1`\n3.  **If `r=n` (only close left)**: `ans = abs(pos - l) + 1`\n4.  **If `l > 1` and `r < n` (close both sides)**: `ans = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`\n\nThese conditions are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities. We can implement them as a series of `if/elif/else` statements.\n\nExample 1: `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`\nHere `l=2 > 1` and `r=4 < 6`. This is Scenario 4.\n`ans = min(abs(3 - 2), abs(3 - 4)) + (4 - 2) + 2`\n`ans = min(1, 1) + 2 + 2`\n`ans = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`\n\nExample 2: `n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3`\nHere `l=1` and `r=3 < 6`. This is Scenario 3.\n`ans = abs(3 - 3) + 1`\n`ans = 0 + 1 = 1`\n\nExample 3: `n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5`\nHere `l=1` and `r=5`. This is Scenario 1.\n`ans = 0`\n\nThe logic seems sound and covers all cases correctly.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are already within the desired range [l, r].\n    # This means l=1 and r=n.
