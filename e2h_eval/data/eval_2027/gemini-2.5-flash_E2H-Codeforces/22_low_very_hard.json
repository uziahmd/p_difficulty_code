After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Marks\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm taking a look at this \"Marks\" problem. It's a classic competitive programming scenario. The goal is to figure out how many students are successful, meaning they're the best in at least one subject.  \n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and output formats, and the constraints. We've got `n` students, `m` subjects, marks from 1 to 9, and `1 <= n, m <= 100`.  The input will be integers `n` and `m` on the first line, followed by `n` lines of marks, each with `m` characters.  The output is a single integer: the count of successful students.\n\nLooking at the example, it's clear what the logic is. For each subject, I need to determine the maximum mark achieved. Then, I need to check which students achieved that maximum mark for that subject. If a student achieves the maximum in at least one subject, they are considered successful.\n\nMy algorithm is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Input:** I'll read `n` and `m`, and the marks into a data structure, let's say a list of strings called `gradebook`.\n2.  **Max Marks:** I'll iterate through each subject (column). For each subject `j`, I initialize `max_mark_for_subject_j` to 0. Then, I iterate through each student's mark for that subject. I'll use `int()` to convert the character mark to an integer and update the `max_mark_for_subject_j` if a higher mark is found. I will save all the max marks in a list.\n3.  **Identify Successful Students:**  I'll iterate through each student (row). For each student, I check their marks against the maximum marks for each subject. If a student's mark matches the maximum for *any* subject, I mark them as successful. I can keep a counter for the successful students and increment it for each successful student I identify.\n4.  **Output:** Finally, I'll print the count of successful students.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach, and given the constraints, it should be quite efficient. Now, I just need to translate this into some Python code.\n",
