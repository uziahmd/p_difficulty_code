He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process as I tackled this string validation problem:**\n\nI started by carefully reading the problem statement, breaking down the rules for how a valid string could be formed (a block of 'a's, followed by 'b's, then 'c's). I defined the critical variables: initial 'a' count, appended 'b' count, and appended 'c' count.  I also clarified an important constraint: that there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\nI then analyzed the string's structure, recognizing that all 'a's must come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. The crucial condition was that the count of 'c's must equal either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. I thought hard about whether the problem allowed for zero 'c's, but deduced that it must have at least one.\n\nI devised a strategy: count the 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's, while also checking the order. I considered using a state machine with phases for 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's to enforce the correct sequence. To ensure correct order, I determined a simpler method would be to find the points where the string transitioned from 'a's to 'b's and 'b's to 'c's.\n\nI wrote the Python code, implementing the counting and order checking steps. I considered edge cases like empty strings and strings with only 'a's or 'b's. I then carefully tested my code with several examples, including the ones provided. I ensured that all of the example inputs worked. I also reviewed the code structure to confirm that it met the required time complexity of O(|S|) and space complexity of O(1).\n\nFinally, I meticulously re-read the problem to verify my understanding of the conditions and the expected input/output format. I noticed a potential inconsistency in the example output provided and the wording of the problem. I clarified that my code will assume a single string as input based on the problem statement. I thought about the possibility of multiple test cases, but made the standard assumption of one case per execution based on the wording. In the end, the solution seemed robust and efficient.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules involving characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's break down the rules and derive the conditions for a valid string.\n\n**Rules for forming the string:**\n\n1.  **A's step:** Starts with one or more 'a's. Let `num_a_initial` be this count. So, `num_a_initial >= 1`.\n2.  **B's step:** Appends one or more 'b's to the string. Let `num_b_appended` be this count. So, `num_b_appended >= 1`. At this point, the string has `num_a_initial` 'a's followed by `num_b_appended` 'b's. The problem states \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\", which is consistent with `num_a_initial >= 1` and `num_b_appended >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step:** Appends some 'c's to the string. Let `num_c_appended` be this count. The crucial condition is that `num_c_appended` must be equal to `num_a_initial` OR `num_c_appended` must be equal to `num_b_appended`. Since `num_a_initial >= 1` and `num_b_appended >= 1`, this implies that `num_c_appended` must also be `>= 1`.\n\n**Derived Conditions for a Valid String `S`:**\n\n1.  **Character Order:** The string `S` must follow a strict order: all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, followed by all 'c's. There cannot be any 'a's after 'b's or 'c's, nor any 'b's after 'c's.\n    *   Example: `aaabccc` is valid in terms of order. `abac` or `bbacc` are not.\n\n2.  **Minimum Counts:**\n    *   There must be at least one 'a' (`num_a >= 1`).\n    *   There must be at least one 'b' (`num_b >= 1`).\n    *   There must be at least one 'c' (`num_c >= 1`), as `num_c` must equal `num_a` or `num_b`, and both are at least 1.\n\n3.  **C's Condition:** The total count of 'c's (`num_c`) in the string must be equal to the total count of 'a's (`num_a`) OR equal to the total count of 'b's (`num_b`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nWe can check these conditions by iterating through the string once:\n\n1.  **Parse and Count:**\n    *   Initialize `num_a = 0`, `num_b = 0`, `num_c = 0`, and an index `idx = 0`.\n    *   **Phase 1 (Count 'a's):** Iterate while `idx` is within bounds and `S[idx]` is 'a'. Increment `num_a` and `idx`.\n    *   **Phase 2 (Count 'b's):** Iterate while `idx` is within bounds and `S[idx]` is 'b'. Increment `num_b` and `idx`.\n    *   **Phase 3 (Count 'c's):** Iterate while `idx` is within bounds and `S[idx]` is 'c'. Increment `num_c` and `idx`.\n\n2.  **Check Order Validity:**\n    *   After the three loops, if `idx` is not equal to the length of the string `n`, it means there was a character that did not fit the `a...b...c...` pattern (e.g., an 'a' after a 'b', or a 'b' after a 'c', or some other character entirely, though the problem guarantees only 'a', 'b', 'c'). In this case, the string is invalid, print \"NO\".\n\n3.  **Check Minimum Counts:**\n    *   If `num_a` is 0, or `num_b` is 0, or `num_c` is 0, the string is invalid. Print \"NO\".\n\n4.  **Check C's Condition:**\n    *   If `num_c` is equal to `num_a` OR `num_c` is equal to `num_b`, then the string is valid. Print \"YES\".\n    *   Otherwise, the string is invalid. Print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Trace (`aaabccc`):**\n\n1.  `S = \"aaabccc\"`, `n = 7`. `idx = 0`, `num_a = 0`, `num_b = 0`, `num_c = 0`.\n2.  **Phase 1:** `S[0]='a'`, `S[1]='a'`, `S[2]='a'`. `num_a` becomes 3. `idx` becomes 3.\n3.  **Phase 2:** `S[3]='b'`. `num_b` becomes 1. `idx` becomes 4.\n4.  **Phase 3:** `S[4]='c'`, `S[5]='c'`, `S[6]='c'`. `num_c` becomes 3. `idx` becomes 7.\n5.  **Order Check:** `idx` (7) == `n` (7). Order is valid.\n6.  **Minimum Counts Check:** `num_a=3`, `num_b=1`, `num_c=3`. All are `>= 1`. Valid.\n7.  **C's Condition Check:** `num_c == num_a` (3 == 3) is True. Print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(|S|) because it iterates through the string at most once. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few variables. This is efficient enough for `|S| <= 5000`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(S)\n\n    # Phase 1: Count 'a's\n    idx = 0\n    num_a = 0\n    while idx < n and S[idx] == 'a':\n        num_a += 1\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Phase 2: Count 'b's\n    num_b = 0\n    while idx < n and S[idx] == 'b':\n        num_b += 1\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Phase 3: Count 'c's\n    num_c = 0\n    while idx < n and S[idx] == 'c':\n        num_c += 1\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Check 1: All characters must have been consumed and in the correct a...b...c... order.\n    # If idx < n, it means there's a character that broke the sequence\n    # (e.g., 'a' after 'b', 'b' after 'c', or a non-'a'/'b'/'c' character, although problem guarantees only 'a','b','c').\n    if idx < n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Check 2: Minimum counts for 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n    # According to the rules:\n    # - A starts with at least one 'a' (num_a >= 1)\n    # - B appends at least one 'b' (num_b >= 1)\n    # - C appends 'c's equal to num_a or num_b, so num_c must also be at least 1.\n    if num_a == 0 or num_b == 0 or num_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Check 3: C's condition.\n    # Number of 'c's must be equal to number of 'a's OR number of 'b's.\n    if num_c == num_a or num_c == num_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
