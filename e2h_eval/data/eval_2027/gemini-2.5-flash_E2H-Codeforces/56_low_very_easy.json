Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Guard Duty Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and immediately my mind goes to the core challenge: finding a non-intersecting perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases.  It's a classic problem that's going to involve some geometric reasoning, which I enjoy.\n\nFirst off, the input makes it clear that we're dealing with 2D coordinates for the ships and bases, and the constraint that R and B are equal is key. If they aren't, \"No\" and we're done.  The small constraints on R and B (<= 10) are a major hint.  This suggests that brute-force approaches, such as trying all permutations, or a backtracking solution, are likely to be efficient enough to solve this. I'll keep that in mind. The \"no three points on the same line\" guarantee is also helpful – it simplifies the intersection checks.\n\nNow, let's nail down the core of the problem. If we have R=B=N, we need to map ships P1 to bases Q(sigma(1)), P2 to Q(sigma(2)), etc., where sigma is a permutation.  But, and this is crucial, the line segments connecting each ship to its base *cannot* intersect.  That's where the geometric heavy lifting comes in.\n\nTo figure out if two segments intersect, I'll need to use the orientation test (basically checking the cross product). If segments AB and CD intersect, we know that A and B must be on opposite sides of CD, and C and D must be on opposite sides of AB.  I can determine which side of a line a point is on using the orientation of the triangle formed by the endpoints of the line and the test point.  The cross product comes to mind immediately. Specifically, the expression `(xB - xA)(yC - yA) - (yB - yA)(xC - xA)`.  If the signs of the cross product values for the two tests match, the points are on the same side. If the signs differ, they're on opposite sides.  I'll need to encapsulate this logic in a neat function, likely named `orientation(A, B, C)`.\n\nSo, the plan is this:  Handle the R!=B case. Then, iterate through all possible permutations of base assignments. For each assignment, I need to go through all pairs of line segments and call that orientation function. If I find any intersections, this permutation is invalid.  If a permutation gets through the checks, I output \"Yes\".  If all permutations fail, I output \"No.\"  Now, let's get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a non-intersecting perfect matching exists between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases. A perfect matching means every spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and every base is assigned to exactly one spaceship. This implies that `R` must be equal to `B`. If `R != B`, no perfect matching is possible.\n\nThe core constraint is that the straight paths connecting a spaceship to its assigned base must not intersect. We are given that no two points coincide and no three points are collinear, which simplifies geometric intersection checks.\n\nGiven the small constraints (`R, B <= 10`), we can explore all possible assignments (permutations) and check the non-intersection condition for each.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Read `R` and `B`. Store the coordinates of Rebel spaceships in a list `rebels` and bases in a list `bases`.\n\n2.  **Check for Equal Numbers:** If `R != B`, it's impossible to form a perfect matching. Print \"No\" and exit.\n\n3.  **Iterate through Permutations:** If `R == B` (let `N = R`), we need to find a permutation of bases `(bases[p[0]], bases[p[1]], ..., bases[p[N-1]])` such that when `rebels[i]` is connected to `bases[p[i]]`, no two segments intersect.\n    Python's `itertools.permutations` function is ideal for generating all permutations of indices for the bases.\n\n4.  **Check Intersection for Each Permutation:** For each permutation `p` generated:\n    a.  Construct the `N` segments: `(rebels[i], bases[p[i]])` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n    b.  Iterate through all unique pairs of these segments `(segment_j, segment_k)` where `j != k`.\n    c.  For each pair, check if they intersect. If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid. Move to the next permutation.\n    d.  If all pairs of segments for the current permutation are non-intersecting, then we have found a valid assignment. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n\n5.  **No Valid Permutation Found:** If the loop finishes without finding any valid permutation, it means no such assignment exists. Print \"No\".\n\n**Geometric Intersection Check (Helper Function `do_intersect`):**\n\nTwo line segments `(P1, Q1)` and `(P2, Q2)` intersect if and only if:\n1.  `P1` and `Q1` lie on opposite sides of the line defined by `P2Q2`.\n2.  `P2` and `Q2` lie on opposite sides of the line defined by `P1Q1`.\n\nTo check if a point `R` lies on one side or the other of a line `PQ`, we can use the 2D cross product (or orientation test). The cross product `(Q - P) x (R - P)` gives a signed area related to the orientation of `(P, Q, R)`.\nLet `orientation(P, Q, R)` be `(Q.x - P.x) * (R.y - P.y) - (Q.y - P.y) * (R.x - P.x)`.\n-   If `orientation(P, Q, R) > 0`, `R` is counter-clockwise (left) of `PQ`.\n-   If `orientation(P, Q, R) < 0`, `R` is clockwise (right) of `PQ`.\n-   If `orientation(P, Q, R) == 0`, `P, Q, R` are collinear. (The problem guarantees no three points are collinear, so this case won't occur for distinct P, Q, R in our context, except if R is one of P or Q, which is also guaranteed not to happen as points are distinct).\n\nSo, `P1` and `Q1` are on opposite sides of `P2Q2` if `orientation(P2, Q2, P1)` and `orientation(P2, Q2, Q1)` have different signs (one positive, one negative).\nSimilarly for `P2` and `Q2` with respect to `P1Q1`.\n\nThe `do_intersect` function would look like this:\n`o1 = orientation(P1, Q1, P2)`\n`o2 = orientation(P1, Q1, Q2)`\n`o3 = orientation(P2, Q2, P1)`\n`o4 = orientation(P2, Q2, Q1)`\n\nSegments `(P1, Q1)` and `(P2, Q2)` intersect if `(o1 > 0 and o2 < 0) or (o1 < 0 and o2 > 0)` AND `(o3 > 0 and o4 < 0) or (o3 < 0 and o4 > 0)`.\nThis simplifies to `((o1 > 0 and o2 < 0) or (o1 < 0 and o2 > 0)) and ((o3 > 0 and o4 < 0) or (o3 < 0 and o4 > 0))`\nThis is equivalent to `(o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\nRebels: `(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)`\nBases: `(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)`\n\nLet's try the permutation `(0, 1, 2)` for bases (i.e., `rebels[0]` to `bases[0]`, `rebels[1]` to `bases[1]`, `rebels[2]` to `bases[2]`).\nSegments:\n1. `S0: ((0,0), (-2,1))`\n2. `S1: ((2,0), (0,3))`\n3. `S2: ((3,1), (2,2))`\n\nCheck pairs:\n- `S0` and `S1`: `orientation((0,0),(-2,1),(2,0))` is `( -2*0 - 1*2 ) = -2`. `orientation((0,0),(-2,1),(0,3))` is `( -2*3 - 1*0 ) = -6`. Same sign, so `(2,0)` and `(0,3)` are on the same side of `S0`. No intersection.\n- `S0` and `S2`: `orientation((0,0),(-2,1),(3,1))` is `( -2*1 - 1*3 ) = -5`. `orientation((0,0),(-2,1),(2,2))` is `( -2*2 - 1*2 ) = -6`. Same sign. No intersection.\n- `S1` and `S2`: `orientation((2,0),(0,3),(3,1))` is `( (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) ) = ( -2*1 - 3*1 ) = -5`. `orientation((2,0),(0,3),(2,2))` is `( (0-2)*(2-0) - (3-0)*(2-2) ) = ( -2*2 - 3*0 ) = -4`. Same sign. No intersection.\n\nAll pairs are non-intersecting. So, this permutation is valid.
