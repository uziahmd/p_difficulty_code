    "thought": "**Python Script for Gilded Cells**\n\nAlright, I'm tasked with writing a Python script to figure out the total number of \"gilded\" cells on a rectangular plate. The dimensions of the plate are `w` (width) and `h` (height). We also have a number of rings, `k`. Each ring represents a border around an inner rectangle. The inner rectangle's size shrinks with each ring, where the `i`-th ring sits on a rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  The ring itself has a width of one cell.\n\nThe problem breaks down like this: For each ring (from `1` to `k`), I need to calculate how many cells are on the border of its associated inner rectangle and then sum up the cell counts across all the rings.\n\nNow, I realized there's a neat formula to calculate the border cells of a rectangle with width `W` and height `H`: `2*W + 2*H - 4`. I double-checked this with some example rectangles (like a 3x3 square) to make sure it works correctly.\n\nThe critical piece here is making sure that the inner rectangle's dimensions are big enough that this border formula applies. My analysis revealed that the problem's constraints (`3 <= w, h` and the limit on `k`) ensure that the smallest dimension of the inner rectangle will *always* be at least three cells wide, which is critical for my border formula to be valid.\n\nSo, for each ring, I calculate the effective width and height, plug them into the border formula, and add that ring's cell count to a running total. In the end, this total gives me the number of all gilded cells.\n\nI went ahead and ran some examples by hand (`w=7, h=9, k=2`) to make sure my logic was spot on and my numbers were matching up.\n\nFinally, I got the Python script ready. It reads `w`, `h`, and `k` from a single input line, loops through the rings, calculates the dimensions, applies the border formula, and sums everything up. The final answer is then printed out. I double-checked the maximum possible values (like 100x100 and k=25) to confirm that the calculations won't cause any integer overflow issues. The script is efficient and meets all the problem's criteria. I am satisfied with the result.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. We are given the plate's width `w`, height `h`, and the number of gilded rings `k`.\n\nThe key information is how each ring is defined:\n1.  The `i`-th ring consists of all bordering cells on an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.\n2.  Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nLet's break down the calculation for a single ring:\n\nFor the `i`-th ring:\n*   Its effective width is `W_i = w - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n*   Its effective height is `H_i = h - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n\nThe number of cells on the border of a `W_i x H_i` rectangle can be calculated. For a rectangle where both dimensions are at least 2, the number of border cells is `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`. This formula counts all cells along the perimeter. The `-4` accounts for the four corner cells, which are counted twice (once for width, once for height) and need to be subtracted once.\n\nThe problem constraints are `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`.\nLet's analyze the minimum possible dimensions for `W_i` and `H_i`. The smallest dimensions will occur for the `k`-th ring.\nFor the `k`-th ring, the dimensions are `w - 4(k-1)` and `h - 4(k-1)`.\nFrom the constraint `k <= (min(w, h) + 1) / 4`:\n`4k <= min(w, h) + 1`\n`4(k-1) + 4 <= min(w, h) + 1`\n`4(k-1) <= min(w, h) - 3`\nThis implies `min(w, h) - 4(k-1) >= 3`.\nTherefore, for any ring `i` from `1` to `k`, both `W_i` and `H_i` will always be at least 3. This means the formula `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4` is always valid for calculating the number of cells in each ring.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n2.  Loop `i` from `1` to `k` (inclusive):\n    a.  Calculate `current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n    b.  Calculate `current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n    c.  Calculate `ring_cells = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n    d.  Add `ring_cells` to `total_gilded_cells`.\n3.  Print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\nLet's trace Example 3: `w=7, h=9, k=2`\n*   `total_gilded_cells = 0`\n\n*   **For i = 1 (first ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 7 - 0 = 7`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 9 - 0 = 9`\n    *   `ring_cells = 2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 0 + 28 = 28`\n\n*   **For i = 2 (second ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 7 - 4 = 3`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 9 - 4 = 5`\n    *   `ring_cells = 2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\n\nThe loop finishes. The output is `40`, which matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three integers w, h, and k from a single line of standard input.\n    # sys.stdin.readline() reads a line, .split() splits it into parts by whitespace,\n    # and map(int, ...) converts these parts to integers.\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize a variable to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    # Iterate from the first ring (i=1) up to the k-th ring (inclusive).\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        # Calculate the effective width for the current i-th ring.\n        # The problem states the i-th ring is on a rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1))x(h - 4(i - 1)).\n        current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        \n        # Calculate the effective height for the current i-th ring.\n        current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n\n        # Calculate the number of cells for the border of the current rectangle.\n        # Given the constraints (w, h >= 3 and k's upper bound), current_w and current_h\n        # will always be at least 3.
