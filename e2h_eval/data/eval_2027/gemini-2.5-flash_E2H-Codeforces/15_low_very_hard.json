They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Playoff Problem: Finding Winning Skill Levels**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle this \"Playoff\" competitive programming challenge.  Let's break this down systematically, as I would approach any such problem. The core is figuring out which teams *can* win based on the tournament's rules and structure.\n\nFirst, I've got to understand the tournament's setup.  We have $2^n$ teams with varying skill levels, represented by a permutation of $1$ to $2^n$. The tournament is a classic knockout structure with $n$ phases. Crucially, the outcome of each game (lower skill wins or higher skill wins) is determined by the string $s$. The phase number corresponds to the index of s. If $s[i-1]$ is '0', the lower skilled team wins in phase $i$. If it's '1', the higher skilled team wins.\n\nNow, let's hone in on winning conditions. For a team with skill $X$ to win, it must triumph in all $n$ of its games.  To model this, consider that in each phase, team X has to face an opponent. Now, depending on the game rule ('0' or '1') given by $s[i-1]$, we have different conditions for victory. If the game follows the rule that the lower-skilled team wins, the opponent's skill has to be *greater* than $X$ for $X$ to move on to the next phase. Conversely, if the higher-skilled team wins, the opponent's skill must be *less* than $X$.\n\nLet's introduce some notation. Let $c_0$ represent the number of phases where the lower-skilled team wins (where $s_i = '0'$), and $c_1$ the number of phases where the higher-skilled team wins ($s_i = '1'$).  It's clear that $c_0 + c_1 = n$.  The key insight is that a winning team with skill level X needs an appropriate number of opponents that are above and below it.\n\nFor $X$ to win, in $c_0$ games it will need opponents with skill *greater* than $X$, and in $c_1$ games it will need opponents with skill *less* than $X$. Therefore, I'll need to develop a strategy for determining, given the string $s$, which skill levels *can* be the winner. The problem now shifts to calculating the number of possible skill levels that satisfy these winning conditions, based on the specific structure of $s$. This will influence my approach, as I'll need to count the winning integer values efficiently. To achieve this, I'll need to carefully think about the restrictions each phase imposes on the potential winner.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) that can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ of length $n$ that dictates the rules for each phase. $s_i = '0'$ means in phase $i+1$, the lower-skilled team wins; $s_i = '1'$ means the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament. A team must win $n$ games to become the champion.\nLet $c_0$ be the count of '0's in the string $s$. These are the phases where the lower-skilled team wins.\nLet $c_1$ be the count of '1's in the string $s$. These are the phases where the higher-skilled team wins.\nWe know $c_0 + c_1 = n$.\n\nFor a team with skill $X$ to win:\n1. In the $c_0$ phases where the lower skill wins, $X$ must be lower than its opponent's skill. This means $X$ must be able to find $c_0$ opponents, each with skill greater than $X$. The smallest possible skill level for such an opponent is $X+1$. So, $X$ needs $c_0$ distinct skill levels greater than $X$ to be its opponents. The smallest $c_0$ distinct skill levels greater than $X$ are $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+c_0$.\n2. In the $c_1$ phases where the higher skill wins, $X$ must be higher than its opponent's skill. This means $X$ must be able to find $c_1$ opponents, each with skill less than $X$. The largest possible skill level for such an opponent is $X-1$. So, $X$ needs $c_1$ distinct skill levels less than $X$ to be its opponents. The largest $c_1$ distinct skill levels less than $X$ are $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-c_1$.\n\nAll these $c_0$ opponents and $c_1$ opponents must have distinct skill levels, and none of them can be $X$. In total, $X$ needs $c_0 + c_1 = n$ distinct opponents.\nThe total number of teams in the tournament is $2^n$. The skill levels are a permutation of $1, \\dots, 2^n$.\n\nConsider the set of skill levels $\\{1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nFor $X$ to win, it needs $c_0$ skill levels larger than $X$. The smallest value $X$ can take is $1$. If $X=1$, it can only win if $c_1=0$ (all '0's in $s$). If $c_1 > 0$, $X=1$ cannot win because it needs an opponent with skill less than $1$, which is impossible.\nFor $X$ to win, it needs $c_1$ skill levels smaller than $X$. The largest value $X$ can take is $2^n$. If $X=2^n$, it can only win if $c_0=0$ (all '1's in $s$). If $c_0 > 0$, $X=2^n$ cannot win because it needs an opponent with skill greater than $2^n$, which is impossible.\n\nMore generally:\n- $X$ needs $c_1$ opponents with skill less than $X$. This implies there must be at least $c_1$ skill levels available in the range $[1, X-1]$. So, $X-1 \\ge c_1$, which means $X \\ge c_1 + 1$.\n- $X$ needs $c_0$ opponents with skill greater than $X$. This implies there must be at least $c_0$ skill levels available in the range $[X+1, 2^n]$. So, $2^n - X \\ge c_0$, which means $X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nSo, for a skill level $X$ to be a potential winner, it must satisfy:\n$c_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nLet's check if this condition is sufficient. If $X$ satisfies this, can we always construct a permutation $p$ such that $X$ wins?\nYes. We can assign $X$ to some team. Then we pick $c_1$ distinct skill levels from $[1, X-1]$ to be $X$'s opponents in $c_1$ phases. We pick $c_0$ distinct skill levels from $[X+1, 2^n]$ to be $X$'s opponents in $c_0$ phases. All these $n$ opponents are distinct from each other and from $X$.\nThe remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skill levels can be assigned to the other teams in any way, ensuring that $X$ always meets its designated opponents and wins its games. The specific tournament structure (who plays whom) doesn't restrict $X$'s ability to find suitable opponents, only the number of available skill levels does. As long as there are enough skill levels available in the correct ranges, we can construct a permutation.\n\nFor example, to make $X$ win:\n1. Assign $X$ to team 1.\n2. In the $c_1$ phases where higher skill wins:\n   Assign $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-c_1$ to be $X$'s opponents in these phases.\n3. In the $c_0$ phases where lower skill wins:\n   Assign $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+c_0$ to be $X$'s opponents in these phases.\nThis uses $X$ and $n$ other distinct skill values. The remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skill values can be assigned to the remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ teams arbitrarily. The specific pairing of teams in the tournament doesn't matter for the *existence* of such a permutation. We only need to ensure that $X$ *can* win, not that it *will* win given a fixed permutation.\n\nTherefore, the winning integers $x$ are precisely those in the range $[c_1 + 1, 2^n - c_0]$.\nLet $min\\_winning\\_skill = c_1 + 1$.\nLet $max\\_winning\\_skill = 2^n - c_0$.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $c_0$ (number of '0's) and $c_1$ (number of '1's) in $s$.\n4. Calculate $min\\_winning\\_skill = c_1 + 1$.\n5. Calculate $max\\_winning\\_skill = (1 \\ll n) - c_0$.\n6. Print all integers from $min\\_winning\\_skill$ to $max\\_winning\\_skill$ in ascending order.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$c_0 = 1$ (for $s_1='0'$)\n$c_1 = 2$ (for $s_0='1', s_2='1'$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\n$min\\_winning\\_skill = c_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n$max\\_winning\\_skill = 2^n - c_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nWinning integers: $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nWait, the example output is `4 5 6 7`. Why is $3$ not included?\nMy logic for $X \\ge c_1 + 1$ is correct.\nLet's re-evaluate the problem statement carefully. \"If $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\nThe example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is `4 5 6 7`.\nMy derived range is $[3, 7]$. The example output is $[4, 7]$.\nThis implies that $c_1$ is not simply the count of '1's, but the number of games where the team *must* have a higher skill than its opponent.\nAnd $c_0$ is the number of games where the team *must* have a lower skill than its opponent.\n\nThe problem statement uses 1-indexed phases for $s_i$ and 0-indexed for string $s$. Let's stick to 0-indexed $s[i]$ for phase $i+1$.\n$s[i] = '0'$: lower skill wins.\n$s[i] = '1'$: higher skill wins.\n\nConsider $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nPhase 1 ($s[0]='1'$): higher skill wins.\nPhase 2 ($s[1]='0'$): lower skill wins.\nPhase 3 ($s[2]='1'$): higher skill wins.\n\nLet the team with skill $X$ win.\nIn phase 1, $X$ must beat an opponent $O_1$ with $O_1 < X$.\nIn phase 2, $X$ must beat an opponent $O_2$ with $O_2 > X$.\nIn phase 3, $X$ must beat an opponent $O_3$ with $O_3 < X$.\nSo, $X$ needs two opponents with skill less than $X$, and one opponent with skill greater than $X$.\nThe number of opponents with skill less than $X$ is $c_1 = 2$.\nThe number of opponents with skill greater than $X$ is $c_0 = 1$.\nMy logic for $c_0$ and $c_1$ is correct based on the string $s$.\n\nThe condition $X \\ge c_1 + 1$ (i.e., $X \\ge 2+1=3$) and $X \\le 2^n - c_0$ (i.e., $X \\le 8-1=7$) still holds.\nSo why is 3 not winning?\nThe key might be in the *order* of games. The problem is about *phases*, not just individual games.\n\"in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, and so on\"\n\"in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"1 vs 2\" plays against the winner of the game \"3 vs 4\", then the winner of the game \"5 vs 6\" plays against the winner of the game \"7 vs 8\", and so on.\"\n\nThis means the tournament structure is fixed. A team must win $n$ games.\nA team with skill $X$ can be placed anywhere in the initial $2^n$ slots.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ can possibly defeat in the tournament (its opponents) is $n$.\nThe minimum skill $X$ can have is $1$. The maximum is $2^n$.\nThe number of teams $X$ must defeat that are *stronger* than $X$ is $c_0$.\nThe number of teams $X$ must defeat that are *weaker* than $X$ is $c_1$.\nThis implies that $X$ must be able to find $c_0$ teams with skill $>X$ and $c_1$ teams with skill $<X$.\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $1+c_1$.\nThe largest $X$ can be is $2^n-c_0$.\n\nLet's re-check the example: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$c_0=1, c_1=2$.\nThe range is $[1+2, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nExample output: $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe difference is $3$. What is special about $3$?\nIf $X=3$, it needs $c_1=2$ opponents with skill $<3$ (i.e., $1, 2$) and $c_0=1$ opponent with skill $>3$ (e.g., $4$).\nThis is possible. $X=3$ can be assigned to some team. $1,2,4$ can be assigned to its opponents. The remaining $8-(1+3)=4$ skills can be assigned to the remaining teams.\n\nCould it be that $c_0$ and $c_1$ are swapped in my understanding?\nLet's count the number of '0's and '1's in $s$.\n$c_0 = s.count('0')$\n$c_1 = s.count('1')$\n\nThe problem states:\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\"\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\n\nThe indexing of $s$ is 0-based in Python. The phases are 1-based. So $s[i]$ refers to phase $i+1$.\n$c_0$ is the number of phases where the lower skill wins. If $X$ wins such a game, $X < \\text{opponent's skill}$.\n$c_1$ is the number of phases where the higher skill wins. If $X$ wins such a game, $X > \\text{opponent's skill}$.\n\nMy interpretation of $c_0$ and $c_1$ seems correct.\nPerhaps the problem's $s_i$ indexing refers to *rounds* of the tournament in a different way.\n\"The string $s$ which consists of $n$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows: if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\n\nThe phases are listed in order. Phase 1 has $2^{n-1}$ games. Phase 2 has $2^{n-2}$ games ... Phase $n$ has $2^{n-n}=1$ game (the final).\nThis means $s_0$ refers to the rule for phase 1 games, $s_1$ for phase 2, ..., $s_{n-1}$ for phase $n$.\n\nLet's check the example outputs for $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n$c_0 = 0, c_1 = 1$.\n$2^n = 2^1 = 2$.\nMy formula: $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0] = [1+1, 2-0] = [2, 2]$. So only $X=2$ can win.\nExample output: `2`. This matches.\n\nExample 2: $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n$c_0 = 1$ (for $s_0='0'$)\n$c_1 = 1$ (for $s_1='1'$)\n$2^n = 2^2 = 4$.\nMy formula: $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0] = [1+1, 4-1] = [2, 3]$. So $X=2, 3$ can win.\nExample output: `2 3`. This matches.\n\nSo, my formula seems to be correct for $n=1,2$. Why does it fail for $n=3, s=\"101\"$?\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$c_0 = s.count('0') = 1$.\n$c_1 = s.count('1') = 2$.\nMy formula: $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0] = [2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nExample output: `4 5 6 7`.\n\nThe problem might be that the $s_i$ character refers to the $i$-th character of the string $s$, but the phase index $i$ in \"during the $i$-th phase\" is 1-indexed.\nSo, $s_0$ refers to phase 1, $s_1$ refers to phase 2, ..., $s_{n-1}$ refers to phase $n$. This is what I assumed.\n\nWhat if the definition of $c_0$ and $c_1$ is reversed based on the string $s$?\nThe problem statement refers to $s_i$ where $i$ is the phase number. If $s$ is 0-indexed, $s_0$ is for phase 1.\nIf $s_i$ (where $i$ is the phase number, 1-indexed) is '0', lower skill wins.\nIf $s_i$ (where $i$ is the phase number, 1-indexed) is '1', higher skill wins.\nString $s$ is $s_0s_1\\dots s_{n-1}$. So $s_j$ in the string corresponds to $s_{j+1}$ in the problem text.\n\nLet's consider the number of games where a higher skilled team must win, and the number of games where a lower skilled team must win.\nLet $k_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$.\nLet $k_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\n\nIf $s_j = '0'$, then in phase $j+1$, lower skill wins. For $X$ to win, $X < \\text{opponent}$.\nIf $s_j = '1'$, then in phase $j+1$, higher skill wins. For $X$ to win, $X > \\text{opponent}$.\n\nSo, for $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$s_0='1'$ (phase 1): $X > \\text{opponent}$\n$s_1='0'$ (phase 2): $X < \\text{opponent}$\n$s_2='1'$ (phase 3): $X > \\text{opponent}$\n\nSo $X$ needs 2 opponents with skill $<X$, and 1 opponent with skill $>X$.\nThis is exactly what $c_1=2, c_0=1$ represents. My interpretation of $c_0, c_1$ is correct.\n\nCould it be that the $s_i$ rule refers to the *opponent's* skill relative to $X$? No, \"the team with the lower skill level wins\" means if $A$ plays $B$, and $skill(A) < skill(B)$, then $A$ wins. If $X$ is $A$, then $X$ wins if $X < skill(B)$.\n\nWhat if the string $s$ is interpreted in reverse?\n\"The string $s$ which consists of $n$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows: if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\n\nThis is a standard way to phrase it. $s_i$ is the $i$-th character of the string $s$. The phases are typically 1-indexed.\nSo $s_0$ is for phase 1, $s_1$ for phase 2, ..., $s_{n-1}$ for phase $n$.\nThis is what I have been using.\n\nWhat if the phases are ordered differently?\n\"The tournament consists of $2^n - 1$ games. They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs... After that, only $2^{n-1}$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $2^{n-2}$ games are played... This process repeats until only one team remains.\"\nThis describes the phases from phase 1 (most games) to phase $n$ (final game). So $s_0$ corresponds to phase 1 etc.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that $X$ needs to be stronger than vs. weaker than.\nThe total number of teams $X$ will face is $n$.\nThe minimum skill an opponent can have is $1$.\nThe maximum skill an opponent can have is $2^n$.\n\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be weaker than its opponent. It needs $c_0$ such opponents.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be stronger than its opponent. It needs $c_1$ such opponents.\n\nLet's check the number of '1's in $s$ that are *at the end* of the string.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$. $s_2='1'$. This is the final game.\nFor $n=1, s=\"1\"$. $s_0='1'$. This is the final game.\nFor $n=2, s=\"01\"$. $s_1='1'$. This is the final game.\n\nWhat if the indices of $s$ are interpreted in reverse order of phases?\nSo $s_{n-1}$ is for phase 1, $s_{n-2}$ for phase 2, ..., $s_0$ for phase $n$.\nLet $s' = s[::-1]$.\nThen $s'_0$ for phase 1, $s'_1$ for phase 2, ..., $s'_{n-1}$ for phase $n$.\nLet $c'_0 = s'.count('0')$ and $c'_1 = s'.count('1')$.\nThis is the same as $c_0$ and $c_1$. So reversing $s$ doesn't change the counts.\n\nWhat if the meaning of '0' and '1' is swapped?\nIf $s_i='0'$ means higher skill wins, and $s_i='1'$ means lower skill wins.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$s_0='1'$: lower skill wins. ($X < \\text{opponent}$)\n$s_1='0'$: higher skill wins. ($X > \\text{opponent}$)\n$s_2='1'$: lower skill wins. ($X < \\text{opponent}$)\nSo $X$ needs 2 opponents with skill $>X$, and 1 opponent with skill $<X$.\nSo $c_0=2, c_1=1$.\nMy formula: $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0] = [1+1, 8-2] = [2, 6]$.\nThis is $[2, 6]$. Example output is $[4, 7]$. This doesn't match either.\n\nLet's go back to the original interpretation:\n$c_0 = s.count('0')$ (games where $X < \\text{opponent}$)\n$c_1 = s.count('1')$ (games where $X > \\text{opponent}$)\n\nThe range of winning skills is $[c_1 + 1, 2^n - c_0]$.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$: $c_0=1, c_1=2$. Range is $[3, 7]$.\nOutput: $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\nThis implies that the lower bound should be $c_1+2$ instead of $c_1+1$.\nWhy would this be the case?\n$X \\ge c_1 + 1$: $X$ needs $c_1$ distinct skill values smaller than $X$. The smallest $c_1$ values are $1, \\dots, c_1$. So $X$ must be at least $c_1+1$. This logic seems solid.\n\nCould it be that the $s_i$ in the problem description refers to the $i$-th character *from the end* of the string $s$?\nSo $s_{n-1}$ (last char) is for phase 1, $s_{n-2}$ for phase 2, ..., $s_0$ (first char) for phase $n$.\nLet's try this. Let $s'$ be $s$ reversed.\n$n=3, s=\"101\" \\implies s'=\"101\"$. This doesn't change anything for this palindrome string.\n$n=2, s=\"01\" \\implies s'=\"10\"$.\nThen for $s'=\"10\"$:\n$s'_0='1'$ (phase 1): higher skill wins ($X > \\text{opponent}$)\n$s'_1='0'$ (phase 2): lower skill wins ($X < \\text{opponent}$)\nSo $c_1=1, c_0=1$. The counts are the same.\n\nWhat if the '0' and '1' values are indices into some structure?\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\nThis phrasing is unambiguous. $s_i$ means the character at index $i$ in the string $s$.\nThe phases are 1-indexed. So $s[0]$ for phase 1, $s[1]$ for phase 2, etc.\n\nLet's try to simulate the tournament from the perspective of a specific skill $X$.\nSuppose $X=3$ for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$2^n=8$.\nPhases:\n1. $s_0='1'$ (higher wins)\n2. $s_1='0'$ (lower wins)\n3. $s_2='1'$ (higher wins)\n\nTo win, $X=3$ needs to defeat:\n- 2 opponents with skill $<3$ (i.e., $1, 2$)\n- 1 opponent with skill $>3$ (e.g., $4$)\n\nCan we assign $p$ such that $X=3$ wins?\nLet $p_1=3$.\nPhase 1: $p_1$ vs $p_2$. $s_0='1'$, higher wins. So $p_2$ must be $<3$. Let $p_2=1$. $3$ wins.\nPhase 2: Winner(1 vs 2) vs Winner(3 vs 4). $s_1='0'$, lower wins. $3$ is the winner of (1 vs 2). It needs to play against Winner(3 vs 4). For $3$ to win, Winner(3 vs 4) must be $>3$. Let $p_3=5, p_4=6$. Winner(3 vs 4) is $5$ (since $s_0='1'$). $3$ vs $5$. $s_1='0'$, lower wins. $3$ wins.\nPhase 3: Winner(1-4) vs Winner(5-8). $s_2='1'$, higher wins. $3$ is Winner(1-4). It needs to play against Winner(5-8). For $3$ to win, Winner(5-8) must be $<3$.\nThis is the issue. Winner(5-8) must be $<3$.\nBut $1, 2$ are already used. $p_2=1$. What if $p_2$ was $2$?\n$p_1=3$.\nPhase 1: $p_1$ vs $p_2$. $s_0='1'$, higher wins. So $p_2<3$. Let $p_2=1$. $3$ wins.\nPhase 2: $3$ vs $W_{3-4}$. $s_1='0'$, lower wins. $W_{3-4}>3$. Let $p_3=4, p_4=5$. $s_0='1'$, $W_{3-4}=5$. $3$ vs $5$. $s_1='0'$, $3$ wins.\nPhase 3: $3$ vs $W_{5-8}$. $s_2='1'$, higher wins. $W_{5-8}<3$.\nAvailable skills for $W_{5-8}$: $2, 6, 7, 8$.\nIf $W_{5-8}$ is $2$, then $3$ wins.\nTo make $W_{5-8}=2$, we need to assign $p_5, p_6, p_7, p_8$ such that $W_{5-8}=2$.\n$p_5$ vs $p_6$. $s_0='1'$, higher wins.\n$p_7$ vs $p_8$. $s_0='1'$, higher wins.\n$W_{5-6}$ vs $W_{7-8}$. $s_1='0'$, lower wins.\nSo, $W_{5-6}$ and $W_{7-8}$ must be such that one of them is $2$ and the other is $>2$.\nLet $W_{5-6}=2$. This means $p_5$ or $p_6$ is $2$. Let $p_5=2, p_6=6$. $W_{5-6}=6$. This fails.\nIf $s_0='1'$, then $W_{5-6}$ is the max of $p_5, p_6$.\nIf $W_{5-6}=2$, then $p_5, p_6$ must be $\\le 2$. But $p_5, p_6$ must be distinct, and $1,2$ are the only skills $\\le 2$. $1$ is used. So $p_5=2$. Then $p_6$ must be $<2$, but $1$ is used. So $W_{5-6}$ cannot be $2$.\nThis requires $W_{5-6}$ to be $2$. For $s_0='1'$, $W_{5-6} = \\max(p_5,p_6)$. For this to be $2$, $\\{p_5, p_6\\}$ must be $\\{1,2\\}$. But $1$ is used by $p_2$.\nSo $W_{5-6}$ cannot be $2$.\nThis means $X=3$ cannot win.\n\nThe error in my initial reasoning is that the opponents are not arbitrary skills chosen from the available pool. They are *the winners of other sub-tournaments*.\nThis means that the skill values $1, \\dots, 2^n$ are not just available for opponents, they are assigned to fixed positions $p_1, \\dots, p_{2^n}$ and then the tournament unfolds.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what skills are needed for $X$ to win.\nWhen $X$ plays a game, its opponent is the winner of some sub-tournament.\nLet $k$ be the number of games $X$ plays. $k=n$.\nLet $S_X$ be the skill $X$.\nLet $S_O$ be the skill of $X$'s opponent in a particular game.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ wins if $S_X < S_O$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins if $S_X > S_O$.\n\nThe crucial observation from competitive programming problems like this is often about the *range* of skills that can win.\nConsider the $n$ games $X$ plays. Let $X$ be assigned to an arbitrary initial slot, say $p_1$.\nIn phase 1, $X$ plays $p_2$.\nIn phase 2, $X$ plays $W(p_3, p_4)$.\nIn phase 3, $X$ plays $W(p_5, p_6, p_7, p_8)$.\n...\nIn phase $k$, $X$ plays $W(\\text{block of } 2^{k-1} \\text{teams})$.\nThe opponents $X$ faces come from sub-tournaments of size $2^{k-1}$ teams.\n\nLet's count how many teams $X$ must be stronger than, and how many $X$ must be weaker than.\nLet $N=2^n$.\n$c_0 = s.count('0')$ (games where $X$ must be lower skill)\n$c_1 = s.count('1')$ (games where $X$ must be higher skill)\n\nA team $X$ wins if and only if it wins all $n$ of its matches.\nIn $c_1$ matches, $X$ must have higher skill than its opponent.\nIn $c_0$ matches, $X$ must have lower skill than its opponent.\n\nConsider the minimum possible skill $X_{min}$ that can win.\nFor $X$ to win, it needs to defeat $c_1$ teams with skill less than $X$.\nThe smallest $c_1$ skills are $1, 2, \\dots, c_1$.\nSo $X$ must be at least $c_1+1$. This is the lower bound.\n\nConsider the maximum possible skill $X_{max}$ that can win.\nFor $X$ to win, it needs to defeat $c_0$ teams with skill greater than $X$.\nThe largest $c_0$ skills are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-c_0+1$.\nSo $X$ must be at most $2^n-c_0$. This is the upper bound.\n\nSo the range of possible winning skills is $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0]$.\nThis is the range I derived, and it matches two of the three examples. The discrepancy is only for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n\nThe example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nMy formula gives $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe difference is $3$.\nThis suggests that $X=3$ cannot win. Why?\n$X=3$. $c_1=2, c_0=1$.\n$X$ needs two opponents $<3$ (i.e. $1, 2$).\n$X$ needs one opponent $>3$ (e.g. $4$).\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the winners of sub-tournaments.\nConsider a sub-tournament of $2^k$ teams. Let its winner be $W$.\nIf all phases within this sub-tournament are '0' (lower skill wins), then $W$ must be the minimum skill among the $2^k$ teams.\nIf all phases within this sub-tournament are '1' (higher skill wins), then $W$ must be the maximum skill among the $2^k$ teams.\n\nThe string $s$ specifies the rules for phases $1, \\dots, n$.\nThe $i$-th character of $s$, $s[i-1]$, determines the rule for phase $i$.\nLet's define $K$ as the number of '1's in $s$.\nLet's define $M$ as the number of '0's in $s$.\nSo $K = c_1$ and $M = c_0$ in my notation.\nThe range of winning skills is $[K+1, 2^n-M]$.\n\nThis is a very common type of problem in competitive programming where the specific permutation can be constructed to make any valid $X$ win. The constraints on $X$ usually come from the total number of available skills above/below $X$.\n\nLet's think about the structure of the tournament for $X=3, n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$X=3$ needs to beat two smaller values and one larger value.\nThe values $1, \\dots, 2^n$ are skills.\nThe number of teams is $2^n$.\nThe minimum skill value that can win is $1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s)$.\nThe maximum skill value that can win is $2^n - (\\text{number of '0's in } s)$.\n\nThis is exactly what my formula gives.\nThere must be a subtle detail I am missing, or a standard competitive programming trick for these types of problems.\nThe problem statement is pretty clear.\n\nCould it be the other way around?\nThe number of '0's means $X$ must be lower than its opponent. This means $X$ must be able to find $c_0$ skills greater than $X$.\nThe number of '1's means $X$ must be higher than its opponent. This means $X$ must be able to find $c_1$ skills smaller than $X$.\n\nLet's consider the number of '1's in $s$ that are *before* any '0's.\nOr the number of '0's in $s$ that are *after* any '1's.\n\nWhat if the $s_i$ refers to the $i$-th character of the string $s$, but the phases are ordered from $n$ down to $1$?\nSo $s_0$ is for the final phase (phase $n$), $s_1$ is for the semifinal phase (phase $n-1$), ..., $s_{n-1}$ is for the first phase (phase 1).\nLet $s_{rev} = s[::-1]$.\nLet $c'_{0} = s_{rev}.count('0')$ and $c'_{1} = s_{rev}.count('1')$.\nThis is equivalent to $c_0$ and $c_1$. So this doesn't change the bounds.\n\nWhat if the actual rules are:\nIf $s_i = '0'$, then the higher skill wins.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, then the lower skill wins.\nThis is swapping the meaning of '0' and '1'.\nLet $c_0'$ be the number of '0's in $s$ (meaning higher skill wins).\nLet $c_1'$ be the number of '1's in $s$ (meaning lower skill wins).\nThen $X$ needs $c_1'$ opponents with skill $>X$, and $c_0'$ opponents with skill $<X$.\nSo the range would be $[c_0'+1, 2^n-c_1']$.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$: $c_0'=1, c_1'=2$.\nRange: $[1+1, 8-2] = [2, 6]$. This is $[2, 6]$. Example output is $[4, 7]$. Still no match.\n\nThe problem implies $s_i$ is 0-indexed in the string $s$, and $i$-th phase is 1-indexed.\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games)\"\nThis is ambiguous. Is $s_i$ the $i$-th character of $s$ (0-indexed) or the character at index $i$ in $s$ where $i$ is the phase number (1-indexed)?\nGiven standard competitive programming conventions, $s_i$ usually means $s[i]$ (0-indexed).\nSo $s[0]$ for phase 1, $s[1]$ for phase 2, ..., $s[n-1]$ for phase $n$. This is what I used.\n\nLet's consider the number of '1's in $s$ that are *after* the first '0'.\nAnd the number of '0's in $s$ that are *after* the first '1'.\n\nA different way to count $c_0$ and $c_1$:\nLet $s$ be $s_0 s_1 \\dots s_{n-1}$.\nLet $L$ be the count of '0's in $s$. These are games where $X$ must be lower.\nLet $H$ be the count of '1's in $s$. These are games where $X$ must be higher.\nThe number of skills $X$ must be greater than is $H$. So $X \\ge H+1$.\nThe number of skills $X$ must be less than is $L$. So $X \\le 2^n - L$.\nThis gives the range $[H+1, 2^n-L]$.\n\nThis is what I have been using.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$: $H=2, L=1$. Range is $[2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example output is $[4, 7]$.\nThis means $X=3$ is not possible.\n\nWhat if the problem is about the *number of teams* that $X$ needs to be stronger/weaker than in total?\nIn a tournament of $2^n$ teams, $X$ needs to defeat $n$ opponents.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be lower than its opponent.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be higher than its opponent.\n\nThe total number of teams $X$ must be stronger than is $c_1$.\nThe total number of teams $X$ must be weaker than is $c_0$.\nThis is the same as before.\n\nThe problem could be about the *final* game.\nIf $s_{n-1} = '0'$ (final game, lower skill wins), then $X$ must be lower than its final opponent.\nIf $s_{n-1} = '1'$ (final game, higher skill wins), then $X$ must be higher than its final opponent.\n\nLet's check the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s[0]='1'$, $s[1]='0'$, $s[2]='1'$.\n$s[2]='1'$ means in the final game, higher skill wins.\nSo $X$ must be higher than its final opponent.\nThis means $X$ must be higher than at least one team.\n\nConsider the counts of '0's and '1's.\nLet $N_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nLet $N_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum possible winning skill is $1 + N_1$.\nThe maximum possible winning skill is $2^n - N_0$.\n\nThis is the most straightforward interpretation and works for two out of three examples.\nThe only case it fails is $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nMy range: $[3, 7]$. Example range: $[4, 7]$.\nThis means $3$ is not a winning number.\n\nLet's examine $X=3$ and $s=\"101\"$.\nPhase 1 ($s_0='1'$): $X > O_1$. So $O_1 \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\nPhase 2 ($s_1='0'$): $X < O_2$. So $O_2 \\in \\{4, \\dots, 8\\}$.\nPhase 3 ($s_2='1'$): $X > O_3$. So $O_3 \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\nThe opponents $O_1, O_2, O_3$ must be distinct.\nSo $O_1$ and $O_3$ must be distinct and from $\\{1,2\\}$. This is fine, we can pick $O_1=1, O_3=2$ (or vice versa).\n$O_2$ must be from $\\{4, \\dots, 8\\}$. This is fine.\n\nThe problem is that $O_1, O_2, O_3$ are not just arbitrary numbers. They are winners of sub-tournaments.\nLet's consider the final game ($s_{n-1}$). $X$ plays against $O_n$.\nIf $s_{n-1} = '1'$, $X > O_n$. $O_n$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{n-1}$ teams.\nIf $s_{n-1} = '0'$, $X < O_n$. $O_n$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{n-1}$ teams.\n\nLet's denote $K_0$ as the number of '0's in $s$ and $K_1$ as the number of '1's in $s$.\nThe range of possible winning skills for a team is from $2^{K_1}$ to $2^n - 2^{K_0} + 1$.\nThis is a common pattern in similar problems.\nLet's test this formula:\nLower bound: $2^{K_1}$\nUpper bound: $2^n - 2^{K_0} + 1$\n\nFor $n=1, s=\"1\"$: $K_0=0, K_1=1$.\nRange: $[2^1, 2^1 - 2^0 + 1] = [2, 2-1+1] = [2, 2]$. Matches example.\n\nFor $n=2, s=\"01\"$: $K_0=1, K_1=1$.\nRange: $[2^1, 2^2 - 2^1 + 1] = [2, 4-2+1] = [2, 3]$. Matches example.\n\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$: $K_0=1, K_1=2$.\nRange: $[2^2, 2^3 - 2^1 + 1] = [4, 8-2+1] = [4, 7]$. Matches example!\n\nThis formula seems to be correct.\nThe logic behind this formula:\nLet $N_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$. A team with skill $X$ must win $N_1$ games where it is the higher skill. In these games, its opponents must have skills less than $X$. The *lowest* possible skill $X$ can have is $2^{N_1}$. This is because $X$ needs to defeat $N_1$ opponents who are themselves winners of sub-tournaments. The smallest possible winner of a sub-tournament of size $2^k$ is $1$. If $X$ wins $N_1$ games where it is the higher skill, it effectively means $X$ is the highest skill among $N_1+1$ teams (itself plus $N_1$ opponents). This highest skill must be at least $2^{N_1}$ if the other skills can be chosen from the range $[1, 2^{N_1}-1]$.\n\nSimilarly, let $N_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$. A team with skill $X$ must win $N_0$ games where it is the lower skill. In these games, its opponents must have skills greater than $X$. The *highest* possible skill $X$ can have is $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$. This is because $X$ needs to defeat $N_0$ opponents who are winners of sub-tournaments. The largest possible winner of a sub-tournament of size $2^k$ is $2^k$. If $X$ wins $N_0$ games where it is the lower skill, it effectively means $X$ is the lowest skill among $N_0+1$ teams (itself plus $N_0$ opponents). This lowest skill must be at most $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n\nThis is a more sophisticated argument about the *number of distinct skill values* that $X$ needs to be stronger than or weaker than.\nIf $X$ has to be stronger than $N_1$ opponents, it means $X$ must be strictly greater than $N_1$ distinct skill values. The smallest possible set of $N_1$ distinct skill values are $1, 2, \\ldots, N_1$. So $X$ must be at least $N_1+1$. This was my first argument.\nThe $2^{N_1}$ lower bound comes from realizing that $X$ needs to be the highest skill in a sub-tournament of $2^{N_1}$ teams if all $N_1$ games it plays are '1' (higher wins).\nThis is because if all $s_i$ are '1', then $X$ must be the highest skill among all $2^n$ teams.\nThe $N_1$ '1's mean $X$ has to be stronger than $N_1$ opponents. In the worst case, these $N_1$ opponents are all part of $X$'s path to victory, and $X$ is the strongest among $N_1+1$ teams. The smallest possible value for the largest of $N_1+1$ teams is $N_1+1$.\nHowever, the problem is about the *number of teams* that $X$ is stronger/weaker than in total, across *all possible permutations*.\nThe number of teams $X$ will be stronger than is $2^{N_1}$.\nThe number of teams $X$ will be weaker than is $2^{N_0}$.\nThis is because if $s$ had only '1's, $X$ would have to be stronger than all $2^n-1$ other teams.\nIf $s$ had only '0's, $X$ would have to be weaker than all $2^n-1$ other teams.\n\nThe number of teams $X$ must be stronger than is $2^{N_1}$.\nThe number of teams $X$ must be weaker than is $2^{N_0}$.\nThis is the correct logic.\nThe number of teams $X$ is stronger than is $2^{N_1}-1$. (The number of skills $X$ must be greater than)\nThe number of teams $X$ is weaker than is $2^{N_0}-1$. (The number of skills $X$ must be less than)\n\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is $N_1$. These are the games where the higher skill wins.\nThe number of '0's in $s$ is $N_0$. These are the games where the lower skill wins.\nLet $X$ be the skill of the winning team.\n$X$ must be higher than $2^{N_1}-1$ teams (these are the teams in its path that it needs to beat where higher skill wins).\n$X$ must be lower than $2^{N_0}-1$ teams (these are the teams in its path that it needs to beat where lower skill wins).\n\nSo, $X$ must be at least $1 + (2^{N_1}-1) = 2^{N_1}$.\nAnd $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n\nThis is the correct range.\nThe minimum winning skill is $2^{\\text{count of '1's in } s}$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - 2^{\\text{count of '0's in } s} + 1$.\n\nFinal check:\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$. $N_0=1, N_1=2$.\nMin: $2^{N_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\nMax: $2^3 - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 8 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nRange $[4, 7]$.
