Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Crazy Town Dilemma**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. This \"Crazy Town\" problem is all about finding the minimum number of road crossings to get from my home to the university. It seems pretty straightforward on the surface, but I'll need to break it down.\n\nEssentially, I need a Python script to do this. I've got the home and university coordinates, and a list of roads defined by linear equations. The movement rule is simple: one step = crossing a road. The challenge is figuring out which roads *actually* need to be crossed.\n\nThe key insight here is that each road acts as a divider. It splits the plane into regions, or blocks. Crossing a road is like moving from one block to an adjacent one. So, the *minimum* number of steps is the same as the *minimum* number of lines (roads) that separate my home block from the university block.\n\nI can determine if a road is a separator by evaluating the linear equation for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs of the results are different, that road *separates* them. If the signs are the same, it doesn't. Simple as that. The sign basically tells me which side of the line each point lies on.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is going to be incredibly efficient:\n\n1.  Initialize a step counter to zero.\n2.  Get the home and university coordinates.\n3.  Loop through each road.\n4.  For each road, evaluate the linear equation with the home and university coordinates.\n5.  If the results have different signs, increment the step counter.\n6.  That's it! The final step count is the answer.\n\nIt's a clever observation that transforms this \"pathfinding\" problem into a simple counting problem. This should be a quick and elegant solution, and I'm ready to code it up.\n",
