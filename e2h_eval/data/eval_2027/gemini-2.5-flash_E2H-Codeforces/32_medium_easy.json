Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Stabilizing an Array: My Thoughts**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm staring at an array of integers, and my job is to make it as \"stable\" as possible by kicking out just *one* element.  Stability, in this context, is defined as the difference between the biggest and smallest numbers left standing.  My goal is to minimize this difference.\n\nMy gut feeling, and it's usually right, tells me sorting is the key. Once things are ordered, I can easily see the extremes.  Let's call the original array `a` and the sorted version `a_sorted`.  Now, think about it: if I yank out an element in the middle of `a_sorted`, the difference between the highest and lowest in the remaining group is still going to be at least `max(a) - min(a)`. I can't do better than that.\n\nSo, it boils down to two real contenders for removal: the absolute smallest or the absolute largest number in the array.  If I ditch the smallest, the stability becomes the largest number minus the *second* smallest. If I toss the largest, it's the second largest minus the smallest.  The smallest of these two options is my answer.\n\nLet's quickly go over the algorithm:\n\n1.  Read the array, `a`.\n2.  Sort `a`.\n3.  Calculate the instability if I remove the smallest element.\n4.  Calculate the instability if I remove the largest element.\n5.  Print the smaller of these two values.\n\nEdge cases are a no-brainer with `n=2`. In this case, removing any element is the same, and the result is zero.\n\nThe sorting step is my bottleneck, it will take `O(N log N)` time. The rest is essentially `O(1)`. All in all, this should be quick enough, even with large input values.\n\nHere is the final version:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    instability1 = a[n-1] - a[1]\n    instability2 = a[n-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(instability1, instability2))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n```\nLooks good to me. I'm ready to submit.\n",
