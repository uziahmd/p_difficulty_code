            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Python Base Conversion Script - Final Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so I've worked through this base conversion problem, and I'm feeling good about the solution.  The core idea is to break it down into manageable steps: parsing the input (reading base `a`, base `b`, and the number `c`), converting from base `a` to decimal, and then converting the decimal number to the target base `b`.  It seems straightforward.\n\nFirst, the input parsing. Reading `a`, `b`, and `c` is the easiest, just grabbing those values from the input lines. I need to be careful with `b`, as it could be an integer or the character 'R' for Roman numerals. I'm storing `b` and doing the checks when it is called.\n\nThe key is in the base conversion functions themselves. `to_decimal(num_str, base)` is my first function. It takes a string representing a number in a given base and converts it to decimal. I need to handle bases greater than 10, so I'm using `A` for 10, `B` for 11, and so on.  I iterate from right to left, and correctly process leading zeros this way.\n\nNext, I need `from_decimal(num, base)`. This one takes a decimal number and converts it to a string representation in a given base. This one is also straightforward. I just need to be careful with the digits again, using `A` to represent 10 and so on.\n\nThe `to_roman(num)` function is a little more involved. Roman numerals have a specific set of rules (I, V, X, L, C, D, M, plus subtractive notation). I'm using a lookup table to keep the code clean and readable, iterating through and subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral value from the input number until it reaches zero.  I handle numbers up to 3000, as that's the constraint given in the problem statement.\n\nI've made sure to handle edge cases like leading zeros, and the upper bounds on the input value (either 10^15 or 3000 for Roman numerals). The `to_decimal` and `from_decimal` functions are designed to work correctly within the constraints of bases 2 to 25.\n\nFinally, I've put everything together in the `solve()` function. It reads the input, calls the appropriate conversion functions based on whether `b` is an integer or 'R', and prints the result.  I made a `get_digit_value` helper function to keep the core logic simple, and to improve code readability.\n\nI've tested it on several examples and edge cases, and it looks like it's working flawlessly. I'm ready to submit this script.\n",
