He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Validating a String Against the 'abc' Rules**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if a given string, let's call it `S`, conforms to a specific pattern. It's essentially an 'abc' sandwich, with some 'a's, followed by some 'b's, followed by some 'c's. The key is how many of each we have.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure `S` *only* contains 'a', 'b', and 'c'. That's a basic sanity check.\n\nThen, I'll go through `S` and break it into three sections, keeping track of the count of each character.  I can think of it as finding the \"breaks\" in the string where the character changes.\n\nThe rules are pretty clear:\n*   I *must* have at least one 'a', and it has to come first.\n*   I *must* have at least one 'b', and it has to come after the 'a's.\n*   The number of 'c's at the end must equal either the number of 'a's, the number of 'b's, or possibly both. That's the core of the problem.\n\nEssentially, I need to figure out how many 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are in `S` and then check if the 'c' count matches either the 'a' count or the 'b' count. If both 'a' and 'b' counts are different, and if the 'c' count is different from both, then the string is invalid.\n\nI'm thinking I can do this with a simple Python script. I will need to iterate through the string and check that there aren't any character violations. Once I have the correct counts, the check becomes straightforward.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules. Let's break down these rules and derive the necessary conditions:\n\n1.  **A's step**: A starts with a string of one or more 'a's. Let `count_a` be the number of 'a's. So, `count_a >= 1`.\n2.  **B's step**: B appends one or more 'b's to the end of A's string. Let `count_b` be the number of 'b's. So, `count_b >= 1`. At this point, the string has `count_a` 'a's followed by `count_b` 'b's. The problem guarantees that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist, which is covered by `count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step**: C appends some number of 'c's to the end. Let `count_c` be the number of 'c's. The crucial rule is that `count_c` must be equal to `count_a` OR `count_c` must be equal to `count_b`. It's also possible for `count_c` to be equal to both `count_a` and `count_b` simultaneously. Since `count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`, it implies `count_c >= 1`.\n\nFrom these rules, we can deduce the following properties for a valid string `S`:\n\n1.  **Order of characters**: The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by a sequence of 'b's, followed by a sequence of 'c's. There cannot be any 'b's before 'a's, any 'c's before 'b's, or any 'a's after 'b's or 'c's, etc.\n2.  **Minimum counts**:\n    *   There must be at least one 'a' (`count_a >= 1`).\n    *   There must be at least one 'b' (`count_b >= 1`).\n    *   There must be at least one 'c' (`count_c >= 1`, as `count_c` must equal `count_a` or `count_b`, both of which are at least 1).\n3.  **Relationship between counts**: `count_c` must be equal to `count_a` OR `count_c` must be equal to `count_b`.\n\nLet's implement a check based on these conditions:\n\n1.  **Iterate through the string to count characters and verify order**:\n    *   Initialize `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` to 0.\n    *   Use a state variable (e.g., `state = 0` for 'a's, `state = 1` for 'b's, `state = 2` for 'c's) to track the expected character type.\n\n    *   Iterate through each character `char` in `S`:\n        *   If `char` is 'a':\n            *   If `state` is not 0 (meaning we've already seen 'b' or 'c'), the order is incorrect. Return \"NO\".\n            *   Increment `count_a`.\n        *   If `char` is 'b':\n            *   If `state` is 0 (meaning we are still in the 'a' block), change `state` to 1.\n            *   If `state` is 2 (meaning we've already seen 'c'), the order is incorrect. Return \"NO\".\n            *   Increment `count_b`.\n        *   If `char` is 'c':\n            *   If `state` is 0 (meaning we are still in the 'a' block), change `state` to 1, then to 2. This implies no 'b's were found between 'a's and 'c's, which is an error. Return \"NO\".\n            *   If `state` is 1 (meaning we are in the 'b' block), change `state` to 2.\n            *   Increment `count_c`.\n\n2.  **After iterating, check counts and relationships**:\n    *   Check if `count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, and `count_c >= 1`. If any of these is false, return \"NO\".\n    *   Check if `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`. If neither condition is met, return \"NO\".\n    *   If all checks pass, return \"YES\".\n\n**Example walkthroughs:**\n\n*   **`S = \"aaabccc\"`**\n    *   `'a'`: `count_a = 1`, `state = 0`\n    *   `'a'`: `count_a = 2`, `state = 0`\n    *   `'a'`: `count_a = 3`, `state = 0`\n    *   `'b'`: `state` was 0, now `state = 1`. `count_b = 1`\n    *   `'c'`: `state` was 1, now `state = 2`. `count_c = 1`\n    *   `'c'`: `count_c = 2`, `state = 2`\n    *   `'c'`: `count_c = 3`, `state = 2`\n    *   End of string.\n    *   `count_a = 3`, `count_b = 1`, `count_c = 3`. All >= 1.\n    *   `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3) is true.\n    *   Result: \"YES\"\n\n*   **`S = \"bbacc\"`**\n    *   `'b'`: `state` is 0. This means 'b' appeared before any 'a'. Order incorrect.\n    *   Result: \"NO\"\n\n*   **`S = \"aabc\"`**\n    *   `'a'`: `count_a = 1`, `state = 0`\n    *   `'a'`: `count_a = 2`, `state = 0`\n    *   `'b'`: `state` was 0, now `state = 1`. `count_b = 1`\n    *   `'c'`: `state` was 1, now `state = 2`. `count_c = 1`\n    *   End of string.\n    *   `count_a = 2`, `count_b = 1`, `count_c = 1`.
