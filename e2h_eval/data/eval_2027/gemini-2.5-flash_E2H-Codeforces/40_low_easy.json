The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Abnormal Permutation Pairs Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Abnormal Permutation Pairs\" problem, specifically the hard version. The goal is to count pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1` to `n` where `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`, but the number of inversions in `p` is greater than the number of inversions in `q`.  We need to output the result modulo a given `mod`, and `n` can be as large as 500.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are, `n!` permutations, and a total of `(n!)^2` pairs to consider.  I need to find a way to efficiently count the specific pairs that meet the criteria.  Trying to directly calculate the number of inversions for all possible permutations would be computationally infeasible given the size of `n`.\n\nLet's break down the conditions.  We have three possibilities for the lexicographical comparison: `p < q`, `p = q`, and `p > q`.  And similarly, three conditions based on the number of inversions: `inv(p) > inv(q)`, `inv(p) = inv(q)`, and `inv(p) < inv(q)`.  I'm interested in the case where `p < q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)`.\n\nSumming `inv(p) + inv(q)` doesn't seem to be helping me.\n\nI need to leverage symmetry somehow.  If I consider the pair `(p, q)`, where `p < q`, then `(q, p)` would have `q > p`. This suggests a potential for balancing. I should consider a set of equations to model this idea.\n\nLet's use some variables to represent the counts:\n\n*   `N_lex_less_inv_greater`:  Pairs where `p < q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)`. This is what I want.\n*   `N_lex_greater_inv_greater`: Pairs where `p > q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)`.\n*   `N_lex_less_inv_less`: Pairs where `p < q` and `inv(p) < inv(q)`.\n*   `N_lex_greater_inv_less`: Pairs where `p > q` and `inv(p) < inv(q)`.\n*   `N_lex_less_inv_equal`: Pairs where `p < q` and `inv(p) = inv(q)`.\n*   `N_lex_greater_inv_equal`: Pairs where `p > q` and `inv(p) = inv(q)`.\n*   `N_equal_inv_equal`: Pairs where `p = q` (which implies `inv(p) = inv(q)`) = `n!`.\n\nI am aiming to find `N_lex_less_inv_greater`. The idea of using symmetry suggests there may be some relationships between some of these variables.  If I flip `p` and `q`, from `p < q` to `q > p` and `inv(p) > inv(q)` to `inv(q) < inv(p)`, I might find some useful connections.  Let's dig deeper into these relationships.\n",
