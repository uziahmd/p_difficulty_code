The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Calculating Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses Efficiently**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem about a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and I need to figure out how to calculate the losses for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, over a potentially *huge* number of rounds. I can't just simulate it directly, because `n` can be up to 2 billion!\n\nHere's the gist: standard RPS rules, cyclic move sequences for each player, and I need the number of losses for each. The lengths of these sequences (`m` and `k`) are much smaller, though, maxing out at 1000 each.  That's key.\n\nThe trick is to find a repeating pattern.  Since each player's moves are cyclic, the combination of their moves will also repeat.  The cycle length of *that* repetition is the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths, `m` and `k`. I know how to calculate the LCM: `lcm(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)`.  And since `m` and `k` are relatively small, that LCM value is manageable.\n\nMy strategy is this:\n\n1.  Read in the total rounds (`n`) and the two player sequences (`A` and `B`).\n2.  Calculate the lengths of the sequences (`m` and `k`).\n3.  Calculate the LCM of `m` and `k` (`lcm_mk`). This is my cycle length.\n4.  Simulate *one full cycle* of `lcm_mk` rounds.  During this simulation, I'll track Nikephoros's losses (`nike_losses_cycle`) and Polycarpus's losses (`poly_losses_cycle`).  I'll compare `A[i % m]` to `B[i % k]` for each round in the cycle and update the losses accordingly.\n5.  After the simulation, determine the number of full cycles that fit into the total number of rounds. Then handle any remainder separately. Calculate the total losses by multiplying the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nThat should do it. Efficiently calculating the LCM and simulating just the repeating cycle is the key to handling that massive `n` value.\n",
