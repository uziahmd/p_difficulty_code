    "thought": "**Tackling a Challenging Combinatorial Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got a competitive programming problem here, and it's all about binary strings and multisets. Let's break this down. The core is figuring out how to construct these 'beautiful' multisets, given constraints on prefixes. I need a Python solution, naturally.\n\nThe problem defines a \"beautiful\" multiset of binary strings of length `n`. Each string `s` (lengths 1 to `n`) has an associated `c_s` value, which limits how many strings in the multiset can start with `s`. The ultimate goal is to figure out the number of ways to pick these `c_s` values such that the *maximum* size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. That's the key: it's not about *constructing* a multiset, but about counting the possibilities of creating a multiset of size `f`.\n\nMy immediate thought is to represent these strings as a binary tree. This visualizes the prefix relationship clearly. Each node represents a string, and the children represent extending that string with '0' or '1'. The `c_s` values are essentially capacities in this tree; they limit how many \"strings\" can pass through any particular node. String length `n` represents the leaves in the tree.\n\nNow, maximizing the size of this beautiful multiset feels like a classic network flow problem. I can see a source node `S`, a sink node `T`, and each string `s` having a capacity `c_s`. Specifically, I can associate a node for a string, and for a string of length `n`, associate a node as a leaf in the binary tree. A flow in the network would represent selecting a string in the multiset.\n\nGiven `c_s` values, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is essentially the maximum flow in this constructed network. The crux of the problem becomes determining how many combinations of `c_s` values result in the maximum flow being *exactly* `f`. That's the challenge! I think I can use dynamic programming and combinatorial reasoning to get the solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for all binary strings $s$ of length 1 to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. A multiset of binary strings of length $n$ is beautiful if for every string $s$ (length 1 to $n$), the number of strings in the multiset having $s$ as a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\n\nLet's first understand how to determine the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given all $c_s$ values. This is a classic problem that can be modeled as a maximum flow problem, or more simply, as a minimum cut problem on a related graph. However, there's a simpler, greedy approach for this specific tree-like structure.\n\nConsider the constraints $c_s$. For any string $s$ of length $L < n$, the strings of length $n$ that have $s$ as a prefix are precisely those that have $s0$ as a prefix or $s1$ as a prefix. Let $M(s)$ denote the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $M(s) = c_s$. This is the maximum count of string $s$ itself in the multiset.\nFor a string $s$ of length $L < n$, $M(s)$ must satisfy $M(s) \\le c_s$. Additionally, the number of strings with prefix $s$ is the sum of strings with prefix $s0$ and strings with prefix $s1$. To maximize $M(s)$, we would sum the maximum possible counts from its children: $M(s) = M(s0) + M(s1)$.\nCombining these, for any string $s$ of length $L < n$:\n$M(s) = \\min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))$.\nThis recurrence allows us to compute $M(s)$ for all $s$ from length $n-1$ up to length 1, and eventually for the empty string (root of the conceptual binary tree). The total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $M(\\text{empty string})$, which is $\\min(c_{\\text{empty string}}, M('0') + M('1'))$. However, the problem defines $c_s$ for strings of length 1 to $n$. So, the total maximum size is $M('0') + M('1')$.\n\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $i$ to $n$ *under a specific string $p$ of length $i-1$* such that $M(p) = j$.\nMore precisely, let $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length from $i$ to $n$ that are descendants of a *fixed* string $p$ of length $i-1$, such that the maximum number of strings of length $n$ with prefix $p$ is $j$.\nThe base case is for strings of length $n$. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $M(s) = c_s$. We can choose $c_s$ from $0$ to $k$. So, for each $j \\in [0, k]$, there is 1 way to choose $c_s = j$.\nThus, $dp[n][j] = 1$ for $0 \\le j \\le k$.\n\nFor $i < n$:\n$dp[i][j]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of a string $p$ of length $i-1$, such that $M(p)=j$.\n$M(p) = \\min(c_p, M(p0) + M(p1))$.\nLet $M(p0) = x$ and $M(p1) = y$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $M(p0)=x$ is $dp[i+1][x]$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $M(p1)=y$ is $dp[i+1][y]$.\nSo, for fixed $x, y$, there are $dp[i+1][x] \\cdot dp[i+1][y]$ ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of $p0$ and $p1$.\nThen we need to choose $c_p$. The condition is $j = \\min(c_p, x+y)$.\nThis means $c_p \\ge j$ and $x+y \\ge j$.\nIf $j < x+y$, then we need $c_p = j$. There is 1 way to choose $c_p$.\nIf $j = x+y$, then we need $c_p \\ge j$. There are $k-j+1$ ways to choose $c_p$ ($j, j+1, \\dots, k$).\n\nSo, $dp[i][j]$ can be computed by summing over all possible $x, y$:\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{x=0}^{k} \\sum_{y=0}^{k} \\left( dp[i+1][x] \\cdot dp[i+1][y] \\cdot \\text{ways}(c_p) \\right) \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWhere $\\text{ways}(c_p)$ is:\n- $1$ if $j < x+y$ and $j \\le k$. (This implies $c_p=j$)\n- $k-j+1$ if $j = x+y$ and $j \\le k$. (This implies $c_p \\ge j$)\n- $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe maximum possible value for $j$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-i+1}$. For $i=1$, this is $k \\cdot 2^n$. However, $k$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, and $n$ up to 15. $k \\cdot 2^n$ can be $2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2^{15} \\approx 6.5 \\cdot 10^9$, which is too large for the DP state.\nThe maximum value for $j$ is actually limited by $k$ at each step. $M(s) \\le c_s \\le k$. So $j$ can only go up to $k$.\nThus, $dp[i][j]$ is defined for $0 \\le j \\le k$.\n\nLet $S_{i+1} = \\sum_{x=0}^{k} dp[i+1][x]$. This is the total number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of one child, without any constraint on $M(\\text{child})$.\nLet $P_{i+1}[m] = \\sum_{x=0}^{m} dp[i+1][x]$. This is the prefix sum.\n\nThe recurrence for $dp[i][j]$ can be optimized:\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{x=0}^{k} \\sum_{y=0}^{k} \\left( dp[i+1][x] \\cdot dp[i+1][y] \\cdot \\text{ways}(c_p) \\right)$\nWe need $x+y \\ge j$.\nThe case $j < x+y$: $c_p=j$. This means $x+y$ can be $j+1, \\dots, 2k$.\nThe sum for this case is $\\sum_{x=0}^{k} \\sum_{y=\\max(0, j+1-x)}^{k} dp[i+1][x] \\cdot dp[i+1][y]$.\nThe case $j = x+y$: $c_p \\ge j$. This means $x+y=j$.\nThe sum for this case is $(k-j+1) \\cdot \\sum_{x=0}^{k} \\sum_{y=\\max(0, j-x)}^{k} [x+y=j] \\cdot dp[i+1][x] \\cdot dp[i+1][y]$.\n\nLet $A_i[s] = \\sum_{x=0}^{s} dp[i][x]$ be the prefix sum.\nLet $B_i[s] = \\sum_{x=0}^{s} x \\cdot dp[i][x]$ be a weighted prefix sum.\nLet $C_i[s] = \\sum_{x=0}^{s} dp[i][x] \\cdot \\sum_{y=0}^{k} dp[i][y] = A_i[s] \\cdot A_i[k]$. This is not quite useful.\n\nLet $S_i[m] = \\sum_{x=0}^{m} dp[i][x]$ and $T_i[m] = \\sum_{x=0}^{m} x \\cdot dp[i][x]$.\nLet $U_i[m] = \\sum_{x=0}^{m} \\sum_{y=0}^{m-x} dp[i][x] \\cdot dp[i][y]$. This is a convolution.\n\nLet $S_i = \\sum_{x=0}^k dp[i][x]$.\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{x=0}^k dp[i+1][x] \\left( \\sum_{y=\\max(0, j+1-x)}^k dp[i+1][y] + (k-j+1) \\cdot [j-x \\ge 0 \\text{ and } j-x \\le k] \\cdot dp[i+1][j-x] \\right)$\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{x=0}^k dp[i+1][x] \\left( (S_{i+1} - S_{i+1}[\\max(0, j-x)]) + (k-j+1) \\cdot [j-x \\ge 0 \\text{ and } j-x \\le k] \\cdot dp[i+1][j-x] \\right)$\nThis is $O(k^2)$ per $dp[i][j]$ value, leading to $O(n k^3)$ total, too slow.\n\nLet's simplify the sum:\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{x=0}^k \\sum_{y=0}^k dp[i+1][x] dp[i+1][y] \\cdot \\text{coeff}(x,y,j)$\nwhere $\\text{coeff}(x,y,j)$ is $1$ if $j < x+y$ and $j \\le k$, and $k-j+1$ if $j = x+y$ and $j \\le k$, and $0$ otherwise.\nWe can split the sum based on $x+y$:\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{s=j+1}^{2k} \\left( \\sum_{x=0}^k [x \\le s] dp[i+1][x] dp[i+1][s-x] \\right) \\cdot 1 \\quad (\\text{if } j \\le k)$\n$+ \\sum_{s=j}^{j} \\left( \\sum_{x=0}^k [x \\le s] dp[i+1][x] dp[i+1][s-x] \\right) \\cdot (k-j+1) \\quad (\\text{if } j \\le k)$\nThe inner sum $\\sum_{x=0}^k [x \\le s] dp[i+1][x] dp[i+1][s-x]$ is a convolution.\nLet $C_{i+1}[s] = \\sum_{x=0}^s dp[i+1][x] dp[i+1][s-x]$. (This is the coefficient of $z^s$ in $(P(z))^2$ where $P(z) = \\sum dp[i+1][x] z^x$).\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{s=j+1}^{2k} C_{i+1}[s] + (k-j+1) C_{i+1}[j]$\nThis can be computed in $O(k)$ for each $j$ after $C_{i+1}$ is computed. $C_{i+1}$ takes $O(k^2)$ to compute naively, or $O(k \\log k)$ using FFT/NTT.\nSince $n$ is small ($n \\le 15$), $O(n k^2)$ might be acceptable. $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^{10}$ is too slow.\n$N=15$, $K=2 \\cdot 10^5$. $N K \\log K$ is feasible. $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 3 \\cdot 10^6 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$. This is feasible.\n\nLet $P_{i+1}(z) = \\sum_{x=0}^k dp[i+1][x] z^x$.\nThen $P_{i+1}(z)^2 = \\sum_{s=0}^{2k} C_{i+1}[s] z^s$.\nWe need to compute $dp[i][j]$ for $j=0 \\dots k$.\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{s=j+1}^{2k} C_{i+1}[s] + (k-j+1) C_{i+1}[j]$.\nLet $S_C[j] = \\sum_{s=j}^{2k} C_{i+1}[s]$ be the suffix sum of $C_{i+1}$.\nThen $dp[i][j] = S_C[j+1] + (k-j+1) C_{i+1}[j]$.\n$S_C[j]$ can be computed in $O(k)$ after $C_{i+1}$ is computed.\nSo, each layer $i$ takes $O(k \\log k)$ for convolution and $O(k)$ for suffix sums and $dp[i]$ computation. Total $O(n k \\log k)$.\n\nThe final answer is $dp[1][f]$.\n\nModulo is $998244353$, which is a prime suitable for NTT.\n\n**Detailed plan for NTT:**\n1.  Define `MOD = 998244353`.\n2.  Implement NTT (Number Theoretic Transform). This requires functions for `power(base, exp)`, `inverse(n)`, `ntt(a, invert)`.\n    `MOD = 998244353`, primitive root `G = 3`.\n3.  Initialize `dp[n][j] = 1` for $j \\in [0, k]$.\n    All other `dp[n][j]` are 0.\n4.  Iterate `i` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n    a.  Convert `dp[i+1]` to a polynomial representation (list of coefficients). Let this be `poly_dp`. Its length is $k+1$.\n    b.  Find the smallest power of 2, say `len_fft`, greater than or equal to `2*(k+1)-1`.\n    c.  Pad `poly_dp` with zeros to `len_fft`.\n    d.  Compute `ntt(poly_dp, False)`.\n    e.  Compute `poly_conv_ntt[p] = poly_dp_ntt[p] * poly_dp_ntt[p] % MOD` for each `p`.\n    f.  Compute `ntt(poly_conv_ntt, True)` to get `C_i`. This `C_i` is the array of $C_{i+1}[s]$ values. It will have length `len_fft`. We only care about `s` up to $2k$.\n    g.  Compute suffix sums $S_C[j] = \\sum_{s=j}^{2k} C_i[s]$ for $j=0 \\dots 2k$.\n        $S_C[2k] = C_i[2k]$\n        $S_C[j] = (S_C[j+1] + C_i[j]) \\pmod{MOD}$ for $j=2k-1$ down to $0$.\n    h.  Compute `dp[i][j]` for $j=0 \\dots k$:\n        `dp[i][j] = (S_C[j+1] + (k-j+1) * C_i[j]) % MOD`.\n        Note that `S_C[j+1]` is 0 if $j+1 > 2k$.\n        `C_i[j]` is 0 if $j > 2k$.\n        `k-j+1` can be negative if $j > k$. But we only compute for $j \\le k$, so $k-j+1 \\ge 1$.\n        Make sure to handle potential negative results from modulo by adding MOD. E.g., `(S_C[j+1] + (k-j+1) * C_i[j]) % MOD`.\n5.  The final answer is `dp[1][f]`.\n\nEdge cases:\n- $f > k$. In this case, $dp[1][f]$ will be 0. $f$ can be at most $k \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ for $M('0') + M('1')$. But we capped $j$ at $k$. The maximum value for $M(s)$ is $k$. So the maximum for $M('0') + M('1')$ is $2k$. If $f > 2k$, the answer is 0. If $f > k$, but $f \\le 2k$, it's possible. The state $dp[i][j]$ is for $j \\le k$.\nThe problem states $M(p) = \\min(c_p, M(p0) + M(p1))$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $M('0') + M('1')$.\nSo the final answer $f$ is not capped by $k$.\nThe $dp[i][j]$ should store the values for $M(p)$. $M(p)$ can be up to $k$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $M('0') + M('1')$. This is not $M(\\text{root})$.\nSo, $M('0')$ can be up to $k$, $M('1')$ can be up to $k$. Their sum can be up to $2k$.\nThe final calculation for $f$ needs to sum $M('0')$ and $M('1')$.\nLet $dp[i]$ be the current array of counts for $M(\\text{child})$.\nAfter computing $dp[1][j]$ for $j=0 \\dots k$, we need to compute the final answer.\nThe final answer is $\\sum_{x=0}^k \\sum_{y=0}^k [x+y=f] \\cdot dp[1][x] \\cdot dp[1][y]$.\nThis is another convolution, but only for $x+y=f$.\nThis is $C_1[f]$ where $C_1$ is the convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself.\nSo after the loop, we perform one more convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself, and the answer is $C_1[f]$.\n\nThe maximum value for $j$ in $dp[i][j]$ is $k$.\nSo, `poly_dp` has length $k+1$. `C_i` has length $2k+1$.\nThe final convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself to find $C_1[f]$:\n1.  `poly_dp1 = dp[1]` (length $k+1$).\n2.  Pad to `len_fft`.\n3.  `ntt(poly_dp1, False)`.\n4.  `poly_final_conv_ntt[p] = poly_dp1_ntt[p] * poly_dp1_ntt[p] % MOD`.\n5.  `ntt(poly_final_conv_ntt, True)` to get `C_final`.\n6.  The answer is `C_final[f]`. If $f > 2k$, then $C_{final}[f]$ will be 0.\n\nConstants: `n <= 15`, `k, f <= 2e5`.\n`len_fft` will be smallest power of 2 $\\ge 2k+1$. For $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2k+1 = 4 \\cdot 10^5 + 1$.\nSmallest power of 2 $\\ge 400001$ is $2^{19} = 524288$.\nNTT operations take $O(L \\log L)$ where $L$ is `len_fft`.\nTotal time complexity: $O(n \\cdot L \\log L)$.\n$15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot \\log_2(524288) = 15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^8$. This might be acceptable.\n\nLet's check the constraints on $f$. $f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum sum $x+y$ can be $2k = 4 \\cdot 10^5$. So $f$ can be larger than $k$.\nThe $C_{final}[f]$ approach is correct.\n\nExample 1: n=1, k=42, f=2\ndp[1][j] is the count for $M('0')=j$ or $M('1')=j$.\nBase case: $i=n=1$.\n$dp[1][j] = 1$ for $0 \\le j \\le 42$. (For $M('0')=j$ as well as $M('1')=j$).\nThe final answer is $\\sum_{x=0}^{42} \\sum_{y=0}^{42} [x+y=f] \\cdot dp[1][x] \\cdot dp[1][y]$.\nHere $f=2$.\n$dp[1][x]=1$, $dp[1][y]=1$.\nWe need $x+y=2$.\nPossible pairs $(x,y)$: $(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)$.\nEach pair contributes $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nTotal $= 1+1+1 = 3$.\nThis matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nG = 3 # Primitive root modulo 998244353\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef inverse(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        w_len = power(G, (MOD - 1) // (2 * len_half))\n        if invert:\n            w_len = inverse(w_len)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, 2 * len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for k in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + k]\n                v = (a[i + k + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + k] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + k + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_len) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n    \n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inverse(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\ndef multiply_poly(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to len_a + len_b - 1\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials to n\n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n\n    # Transform\n    ntt(a_padded, False)\n    ntt(b_padded, False)\n\n    # Multiply in frequency domain\n    c_padded = [(a_padded[i] * b_padded[i]) % MOD for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Inverse transform\n    ntt(c_padded, True)\n\n    return c_padded[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[j] stores the number of ways to choose c_s for descendants\n    # of a string s of current length, such that M(s) = j.\n    # The maximum value for M(s) is k.
