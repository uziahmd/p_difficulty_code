Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Longest Repeating Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: given a string of lowercase letters, I need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice, even if the occurrences overlap. The string length is small, so an O(N^3) solution is acceptable.\n\nMy strategy is pretty straightforward. I'm going to iterate through all possible substring lengths, starting from the maximum possible length (N-1) down to 1. For each length, I'll generate all substrings of that length. Then, for each substring, I'll count its occurrences in the original string. The first substring length that results in a count of at least 2 is the answer. Since I'm iterating downwards, I'm guaranteed to find the *longest* such substring length first. If I exhaust all lengths down to 1 without finding a repeating substring, then the answer is 0.\n\nLet's walk through an example. For a string like \"ababa\", I'd start by checking substrings of length 4. There are no repeating substrings of length 4. Next, I'd check substrings of length 3: \"aba\" and \"bab\". \"aba\" appears twice. That's it! The answer is 3.\n\nFor a string like \"zzz\", length 2 will work immediately, so I'd have an answer of 2. And for \"abcd\", no substring will be repeated so the final answer will be 0.\n\nThis seems sound. It's an exhaustive search, but for the given input constraints, the computational complexity shouldn't be a problem. I'm confident I can translate this into Python without any major hurdles.\n",
