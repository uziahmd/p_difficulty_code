After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Marks\" Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, I've got this \"Marks\" problem.  It looks like a straightforward competitive programming challenge, and I need to come up with a Python script to solve it.  First, let's break down the input and the goal.\n\nI'll be given the number of students (`n`) and subjects (`m`), followed by a grid of marks for each student in each subject.  Each mark is a single digit from 1 to 9. The challenge is to find the number of \"successful\" students. A student is successful if they are the *best* in at least one subject.  Being best means getting the *maximum* mark in that subject.\n\nMy approach will be this:\n\n1.  **Input Parsing:** I need to read in `n`, `m`, and the `n` lines of marks. I'll store the marks in a 2D list or maybe a list of strings and convert them to integers right away, since the comparisons are easier then.\n\n2.  **Maximum Marks per Subject:**  I'll iterate through each subject (column in the marks grid) and determine the maximum mark achieved in that subject.  I'll keep these in a list called `max_mark_for_subject`.\n\n3.  **Identify Successful Students:**  I'll go through each student and each subject. For each student, I'll compare their mark in a subject with the `max_mark_for_subject` for that subject. If they match, that student is best in that subject, which means they are successful. To avoid counting students multiple times, I'll use a set to store the indices of the successful students.\n\n4.  **Count and Output:** The final answer is simply the size of that `successful_students` set.\n\nLet's do a quick walkthrough using the example they provided.  I can quickly verify my thoughts are correct here. I've got it - this sounds like a pretty standard approach. Now it's time to translate this into a Python script. I should probably focus on making the code efficient, especially with how large the inputs could potentially get.\n",
