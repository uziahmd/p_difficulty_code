The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to write a Python script for the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break this down. We have `n` houses, `m` tasks, and an array `a` where `a_i` is the house number for the i-th task. Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete the tasks in order, moving clockwise. We need to find the minimum total time. The time taken to move between houses is one unit per step.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Logic Formulation**\n\nIt's a straightforward simulation. Initialize `current_house` to 1 and `total_time` to 0. For each task `a_i`, calculate the time to move from `current_house` to `a_i`. If `a_i` is greater than or equal to `current_house`, the time is simply the difference. If `a_i` is less than `current_house`, it means Xenia has to go around the ringroad, so the time is `(n - current_house) + a_i`. Add the calculated time to `total_time` and update `current_house` to `a_i`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough and Verification**\n\nLet's test with `n=4`, `m=3`, and `a=[3, 2, 3]`. Initially, `current_house=1` and `total_time=0`. For the first task (`a_1=3`), the time is `3-1=2`. `total_time` becomes 2, and `current_house` becomes 3. For the second task (`a_2=2`), the time is `(4-3)+2=3`. `total_time` becomes 5, and `current_house` becomes 2. For the third task (`a_3=3`), the time is `3-2=1`. `total_time` becomes 6, and `current_house` becomes 3. This matches the example. Let's also verify another example with `a=[2,3,3]` where the total time should be 2. It appears that the algorithm correctly considers wrap-around movement when a task house is before the current house.\n\n**Addressing Edge Cases and Complexity**\n\nWe need to consider potential edge cases. For `m=1`, it should just be `a_1 - 1`. If all `a_i` values are the same, it's just the initial move, zero for subsequent, like `[3,3,3]`, total time `3 - 1 = 2`. If `a_i` values are strictly increasing, this is a normal step. if decreasing, e.g. `[4,3,2]` and `n=4`, it should be `3+3+3 = 9`. These scenarios seem to be handled correctly. The time complexity is O(m) since we iterate through the `m` tasks once. Input reading is O(m) or O(n+m), which is O(m).\n\n**Code Implementation and Optimization**\n\nThe core logic looks sound. Use a loop to iterate through the tasks. Inside the loop, check if `target_house >= current_house` and calculate time accordingly. Update `total_time` and `current_house`. Output the final `total_time`. For efficiency, we should read the input using `sys.stdin.readline()` instead of the standard `input()` to get faster input reading, which is good practice in competitive programming.\n\n**Final Solution and Refinement**\n\nHere's the Python script: It reads `n` and `m`, then the array of houses `a`, initialises `current_house` and `total_time` and applies the algorithm as designed. This should be correct.\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    current_house = 1\n    total_time = 0\n\n    for target_house in a:\n        if target_house >= current_house:\n            time_taken = target_house - current_house\n        else:\n            time_taken = (n - current_house) + target_house\n        \n        total_time += time_taken\n        current_house = target_house\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_time) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n```\nThe comments are removed and a function is used for organization. The logic is clear and straight-forward.\n",
