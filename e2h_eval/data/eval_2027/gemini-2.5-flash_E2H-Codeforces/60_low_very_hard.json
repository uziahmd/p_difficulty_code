Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Morse Code Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem involving Morse code and substrings. The core of it seems to be about efficiently counting possible sequences of English letters that can be derived from substrings of a dynamically built string `S`.  We're dealing with a string that grows one character at a time, and after each addition, we need the count of valid sequences modulo a large prime.\n\nLet's break down my understanding. First, the Morse code to English letter mapping is key.  We've got the standard representation where dots are '0' and dashes are '1'. The lengths range from 1 to 4, giving us a total of 30 possible Morse code strings. However,  four of these don't correspond to any English letters, leaving us with exactly 26 valid mappings. This directly hints at using a lookup table or a dictionary to perform the conversion.\n\nThe real challenge lies in efficiently generating and counting these sequences as `S` grows. I need to iterate through all possible substrings of `S`. For each substring that represents a valid Morse code string (i.e., corresponds to an English letter), I need to account for all possible ways to combine these valid substrings to form a longer sequence. This is where dynamic programming or a similar recursive approach becomes essential.\n\nThe example walkthrough is a good illustration. The substring \"111\" highlights the need to consider overlapping sequences. \"111\" can be \"O\", but it can also be broken down into \"1\" + \"11\" (\"T\" + \"M\"). This indicates that I have to think about sequences formed with lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4 (the maximum length of a Morse code). This breakdown into overlapping substrings is the core to correctly deriving all the possible sequence combinations.\n\nMy immediate thought is, a dynamic programming approach will likely offer a good solution. I can store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. I think keeping track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in `S` will be crucial. I will likely need an array or dictionary to store these counts. Then, I can build up the solution iteratively as I append characters to `S`. The modulo operation is straightforward to implement at each step to keep the counts manageable. I'll need to remember to handle the edge cases carefully - especially when `S` is empty or when there are no valid substrings.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a growing string `S`. A dot is '0', a dash is '1'. Morse code representations of letters have lengths 1 to 4. There are 26 such valid strings, and 4 invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using the prefix `S[0...i-1]` as a concatenated Morse code string. When we append a new character `c` to `S`, making its length `k`, we need to update our total count.\n\nThe total count is the sum of sequences formed by *all* substrings of `S`. A substring `S[j...k-1]` can represent a sequence of letters.\nLet `total_sequences` be the answer.\nWhen `S` has length `k`, `S = S[0]S[1]...S[k-1]`.\nWe need to consider all substrings `S[j...p]` for `0 <= j <= p < k`.\nFor each substring `sub = S[j...p]`, we want to find how many sequences of letters it can represent.\n\nLet `f(text)` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by `text`.\n`f(text)` can be calculated using dynamic programming. Let `g[i]` be the number of sequences that can be formed using `text[0...i-1]`.\n`g[0] = 1` (empty string, base case for DP, counts as one way to form an empty sequence).\nFor `i` from 1 to `len(text)`:\n  `g[i] = 0`\n  If `text[i-1]` is a valid Morse code for a letter (length 1): `g[i] += g[i-1]`\n  If `text[i-2...i-1]` is valid (length 2): `g[i] += g[i-2]`\n  If `text[i-3...i-1]` is valid (length 3): `g[i] += g[i-3]`\n  If `text[i-4...i-1]` is valid (length 4): `g[i] += g[i-4]`\nAll additions are modulo `10^9 + 7`.\nThen `f(text) = g[len(text)] - 1` (subtract 1 for the empty sequence).\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of `f(sub)` for all substrings `sub` of `S`.\nThis approach would be too slow. `S` can have length up to `3000`. There are `O(M^2)` substrings. For each substring, `f(sub)` takes `O(len(sub))` time. Total `O(M^3)`.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let `S_k` be the string `S` after `k` characters have been appended.\nWhen `S_k` is formed by appending `c` to `S_{k-1}`, the new substrings are those ending at index `k-1`. These are `S[0...k-1]`, `S[1...k-1]`, ..., `S[k-1...k-1]`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of sequences that can be formed by `S[i...k-1]`.\nThe total answer for `S_k` is `sum(dp[i] for i in 0...k-1)`.\n\nLet `dp_val[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences formed by the substring `S[i...current_len-1]`.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended, `current_len` becomes `current_len + 1`.\nThe new character `c` is `S[current_len-1]`.\nThe substrings ending at `current_len-1` are:\n`S[current_len-1]`\n`S[current_len-2...current_len-1]`\n`S[current_len-3...current_len-1]`\n`S[current_len-4...current_len-1]`\n...\n`S[0...current_len-1]`\n\nFor each `j` from `current_len-1` down to `max(0, current_len-4)`:\n  Let `sub = S[j...current_len-1]`.\n  If `sub` is a valid Morse code for a letter, it contributes `1` (for the single letter sequence) plus `dp_val[j]` from the previous step (if `j > 0`) to the total count.\n  This is not quite right because `dp_val[j]` would refer to `S[j...current_len-2]`.\n\nLet's rethink the DP state.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of sequences ending at index `i-1` of the current string `S`.\n`dp[i]` = `f(S[i-1])` + `f(S[i-2...i-1])` + `f(S[i-3...i-1])` + `f(S[i-4...i-1])`\nThis counts sequences where the *last letter's Morse code* ends at `i-1`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by `S[0...i-1]`. This is `f(S[0...i-1])`.\nThis is also not what we want. We want the sum over ALL substrings.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings ending at index `i`.\nWhen `S` has length `k`, `S = S_0 S_1 ... S_{k-1}`.\nWe want to calculate `ans_k = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} dp[i]`.\nTo calculate `dp[k-1]`:\n`dp[k-1]` is the number of sequences represented by `S[k-1]`, `S[k-2...k-1]`, `S[k-3...k-1]`, `S[k-4...k-1]`.\nLet `current_char = S[k-1]`.\n`dp[k-1]` is the sum of `f(S[j...k-1])` for `j` from `max(0, k-4)` to `k-1`.\nNo, this is not correct. `dp[i]` should be the sum of `f(sub)` for all substrings `sub` that end at `i`.\nThis is also not `f(sub)`. It's `f(sub)` where `sub` is `S[j...i]`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences that can be formed by the prefix `S[0...i-1]` (i.e., `f(S[0...i-1])`). This is `g[i]-1` using the `g` definition above.\nLet `total_ans` be the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.\nThis is also not the problem. The problem asks for the sum of `f(sub)` for *all* substrings.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse `S[0...i-1]` into a sequence of Morse code letters.\nWhen we append a character `c` to `S`, `S` becomes `S'`. Let `k` be the new length of `S'`.\nWe are interested in `sum_{0 <= i <= j < k} f(S'[i...j])`.\nThis sum can be written as `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (sum_{i=0}^{j} f(S'[i...j]))`.\nLet `current_sum[j]` be `sum_{i=0}^{j} f(S'[i...j])`.\nThen the answer is `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} current_sum[j]`.\n\nTo compute `current_sum[k-1]` when `S'` has length `k`:\n`current_sum[k-1] = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S'[i...k-1])`.\n`f(S'[i...k-1])` is the number of sequences formed by the substring ending at `k-1` and starting at `i`.\nLet's define `ways[p]` as the number of sequences formed by `S'[p...k-1]`.\n`ways[p]` can be computed using a small DP for `S'[p...k-1]`.\n`ways[p] = (1 if S'[p...k-1] is valid) + (ways[p+1] if S'[p...k-1] is valid and S'[p+1...k-1] is valid) + ...`\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's use the definition from the example:\nFor `S = \"111\"`, `k=3`.\n`S[0...0]` = \"1\". `f(\"1\") = 1`. ('T')\n`S[1...1]` = \"1\". `f(\"1\") = 1`. ('T')\n`S[2...2]` = \"1\". `f(\"1\") = 1`. ('T')\n`S[0...1]` = \"11\". `f(\"11\") = 1 + f(\"1\") + f(\"1\") = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`. ('M', 'TT')\n  `f(\"11\") = g[2]-1`. `g[0]=1`. `g[1]=g[0]+(1 if \"1\" valid)=1+1=2`. `g[2]=g[1]+(1 if \"1\" valid)+g[0]+(1 if \"11\" valid)=2+1+1+1=5`. `f(\"11\")=4`. No, this is wrong.\n  `g[i]` is number of ways to parse `S[0...i-1]`.\n  `g[0] = 1`.\n  `g[1] = g[0]` if `S[0]` is valid. `g[1] = 1` for \"1\".\n  `g[2] = g[1]` if `S[1]` is valid + `g[0]` if `S[0...1]` is valid.\n  For \"11\": `g[0]=1`. `g[1]=g[0]=1` (\"1\" is valid). `g[2]=g[1]` (for \"1\") + `g[0]` (for \"11\"). `g[2]=1+1=2`.\n  So `f(\"11\") = g[2]-1 = 1`. This would mean \"M\" or \"TT\", not both.\n  The problem states \"TT\" is a sequence for \"11\". \"M\" is a sequence for \"11\".\n  This means `f(text)` is the number of distinct sequences of letters.\n  No, \"TT\" and \"M\" are distinct sequences.\n  The problem asks for \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters\".\n  If \"1\" -> 'A', \"11\" -> 'B'.\n  Then for \"11\", sequences are 'B', 'AA'. This is 2.\n  So `f(\"11\")` should be 2. My `g` definition is `g[i]` is the number of ways to parse `text[0...i-1]`.\n  `g[0]=1`.\n  `g[1] = g[0]` if `text[0]` is valid.\n  `g[2] = g[1]` if `text[1]` is valid + `g[0]` if `text[0...1]` is valid.\n  For \"11\": `g[0]=1`. `g[1]=1`. `g[2]=1+1=2`.\n  The number of non-empty sequences for \"11\" should be `g[2]` (if we consider a sequence of letters) or `g[2]-1` (if `g[0]` is for empty sequence).\n  Let's use a slightly different DP. `dp[i]` = number of sequences that can be formed using `S[0...i-1]`.\n  `dp[0] = 0`.\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  If `S[i-1]` is valid: `dp[i] += (dp[i-1] + 1)`\n  If `S[i-2...i-1]` is valid: `dp[i] += (dp[i-2] + 1)`\n  ...\n  This is the standard way to count sequences for a *single string*.\n  For `S=\"111\"`:\n  `dp[0]=0`\n  `i=1, S[0]=\"1\"`: `dp[1] = (dp[0]+1) = 1`. (Sequence \"T\")\n  `i=2, S[1]=\"1\"`:\n    `S[1]=\"1\"` valid: `dp[2] += (dp[1]+1) = 1+1=2`. (Sequences \"T_T\", \"T_M\")\n    `S[0...1]=\"11\"` valid: `dp[2] += (dp[0]+1) = 0+1=1`. (Sequence \"M\")\n    `dp[2] = 2+1 = 3`.\n  `i=3, S[2]=\"1\"`:\n    `S[2]=\"1\"` valid: `dp[3] += (dp[2]+1) = 3+1=4`. (\"T_T_T\", \"T_T_M\", \"T_M_T\", \"T_M_M\")\n    `S[1...2]=\"11\"` valid: `dp[3] += (dp[1]+1) = 1+1=2`. (\"M_T\", \"M_M\")\n    `S[0...2]=\"111\"` valid: `dp[3] += (dp[0]+1) = 0+1=1`. (\"O\")\n    `dp[3] = 4+2+1 = 7`.\n  This `dp[i]` computes `f(S[0...i-1])`. The example output is `1, 3, 7`.\n  This means the problem is asking for `f(S)` for the *entire string* `S`, not the sum over all substrings.\n  \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\"\n  Wait, the example says:\n  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\n  Total 7.\n  These are sequences whose Morse code representation is a substring of \"111\".\n  \"T\" -> \"1\" (substring S[0], S[1], S[2])\n  \"M\" -> \"11\" (substring S[0...1], S[1...2])\n  \"O\" -> \"111\" (substring S[0...2])\n  \"TT\" -> \"11\" (substring S[0...1], S[1...2])\n  \"TM\" -> \"111\" (substring S[0...2])\n  \"MT\" -> \"111\" (substring S[0...2])\n  \"TTT\" -> \"111\" (substring S[0...2])\n\n  This means we need to sum `f(sub)` for all substrings `sub` of `S`.\n  Let `S_k` be the string after `k` characters. `S_k = S_0 S_1 ...

We need `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} dp_sub[j]`.\n  To compute `dp_sub[j]`, we can use the `dp` definition from above:\n  `dp_sub[j] = 0`.\n  For `p` from `j` to `k-1`:\n    If `S[p...k-1]` is valid: `dp_sub[j] += (dp_sub[p+1] + 1)` (with `dp_sub[k]=0` as base case).\n  This is `O(k * 4)` for each `j`. Total `O(k^2)`.\n  This `O(M^2)` approach is acceptable for `M=3000`. `3000^2 = 9 * 10^6`.\n  Each `f(substring)` calculation is `O(length_of_substring)`.\n  `f(S[i...j])` is calculated using `dp_val[x]` for `x` from `i` to `j`.\n  `dp_val[x] = (dp_val[x-1]+1 if S[x-1] is valid) + (dp_val[x-2]+1 if S[x-2...x-1] is valid) + ...`\n  This is `O(4)` for each `x`.\n  For a string of length `L`, `f` takes `O(L)`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string. Its length is `k`.\nWe want to calculate `ans_k = ans_{k-1} + sum_{j=0}^{k-1} f(S[j...k-1])`.\nLet `current_suffix_sums[j]` be `f(S[j...k-1])`.\nTo compute `current_suffix_sums[j]` for `j = k-1` down to `max(0, k-4)`:\nLet `temp_dp` be an array to compute `f(S[j...k-1])`.\n`temp_dp[k] = 0` (base case for empty suffix).\nFor `p` from `k-1` down to `j`:\n  `temp_dp[p] = 0`\n  `s_len_1 = S[p]`\n  `s_len_2 = S[p...p+1]`\n  `s_len_3 = S[p...p+2]`\n  `s_len_4 = S[p...p+3]`\n  If `s_len_1` is valid: `temp_dp[p] = (temp_dp[p] + temp_dp[p+1] + 1) % MOD`\n  If `s_len_2` is valid and `p+1 < k`: `temp_dp[p] = (temp_dp[p] + temp_dp[p+2] + 1) % MOD`\n  If `s_len_3` is valid and `p+2 < k`: `temp_dp[p] = (temp_dp[p] + temp_dp[p+3] + 1) % MOD`\n  If `s_len_4` is valid and `p+3 < k`: `temp_dp[p] = (temp_dp[p] + temp_dp[p+4] + 1) % MOD`\n`f(S[j...k-1])` is `temp_dp[j]`.\n\nThis `temp_dp` is for a single substring `S[j...k-1]`.\nWe need to do this for `j=0` to `k-1`.\n`ans = 0`.\nFor `j` from `0` to `k-1`:\n  Calculate `f(S[j...k-1])` using the `temp_dp` method.\n  `ans = (ans + f(S[j...k-1])) % MOD`.\nThis is still `O(k^2)`.\n`M=3000`, `M^2` is `9 * 10^6`. Each calculation `f(sub)` takes `O(len(sub))` time. So `O(M^3)`.\nNo, `f(S[j...k-1])` for a fixed `j` takes `O(k-j)` time. Summing over `j` is `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (k-j) = O(k^2)`.\nSo the total complexity is `O(M^2)`. This should be fine. `9 * 10^6` operations should pass within 1-2 seconds.\n\nLet's verify the `f(text)` calculation:\n`f(text)`: number of non-empty sequences.\n`g[i]` = number of ways to parse `text[0...i-1]` into a sequence of Morse code letters.\n`g[0] = 1` (empty sequence).\nFor `i` from 1 to `len(text)`:\n  `g[i] = 0`\n  `sub1 = text[i-1]`\n  `sub2 = text[i-2...i-1]`\n  `sub3 = text[i-3...i-1]`\n  `sub4 = text[i-4...i-1]`\n  If `sub1` is valid: `g[i] = (g[i] + g[i-1]) % MOD`\n  If `i >= 2` and `sub2` is valid: `g[i] = (g[i] + g[i-2]) % MOD`\n  If `i >= 3` and `sub3` is valid: `g[i] = (g[i] + g[i-3]) % MOD`\n  If `i >= 4` and `sub4` is valid: `g[i] = (g[i] + g[i-4]) % MOD`\n`f(text) = (g[len(text)] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nLet's check `f(\"11\")` again using this:\n`text = \"11\"`. `len=2`.\n`g[0]=1`.\n`i=1`: `text[0]=\"1\"`.

Substrings: \"1\" (at index 0), \"1\" (at index 1), \"11\" (at index 0).\n  `f(\"1\")=1`.\n  `f(\"11\")=2`.\n  Total distinct sequences: 'A', 'B', 'AA'. (if '1' -> 'A', '11' -> 'B').\n  Total = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n  Example output says 3.\n\nLet's re-read the problem very carefully:\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThis implies we are counting *distinct* sequences of letters.\nExample: `S = \"111\"`\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nThese are 7 distinct sequences listed.\n\nThis means we need to store the actual sequences and count unique ones. This is impossible given the length constraints.\nThe total number of sequences can be huge. \"incredibly tremendous\". This suggests modulo arithmetic on counts, not distinct objects.\n\nWhat if the problem means:\nFor each substring `sub` of `S`, calculate `f(sub)` (number of ways to parse `sub` into letters).\nThen sum up all these `f(sub)` values.\n\nLet's test this interpretation with `S=\"111\"`:\n`f(\"1\")` (at index 0): 1 ('T')\n`f(\"1\")` (at index 1): 1 ('T')\n`f(\"1\")` (at index 2): 1 ('T')\n`f(\"11\")` (at index 0): 2 ('M', 'TT')\n`f(\"11\")` (at index 1): 2 ('M', 'TT')\n`f(\"111\")` (at index 0): 4 ('O', 'TM', 'MT', 'TTT')\nTotal = 1+1+1 + 2+2 + 4 = 11.\nStill not 7.\n\nThe example output for `S=\"11\"` is `3`.\nLet's use the standard Morse code mapping:\n'T' = '1'\n'M' = '11'\n'O' = '111'\nFor `S=\"11\"`:\nSubstrings: \"1\" (at index 0), \"1\" (at index 1), \"11\" (at index 0).\nSequences:\n  From \"1\" at index 0: \"T\"\n  From \"1\" at index 1: \"T\"\n  From \"11\" at index 0: \"M\", \"TT\"\nDistinct sequences: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\". Total 3. This matches the example!\n\nSo, the problem asks for the count of *distinct* sequences of English letters.\nThis means we need to put all generated sequences into a `set` and return its size.\nBut sequences can be arbitrarily long. We can't store them.\n\nThis implies that if two different substrings `sub1` and `sub2` can represent the same sequence of English letters, we count it only once.\nE.g., for `S=\"111\"`, `S[0...1]=\"11\"` can represent \"TT\". `S[1...2]=\"11\"` can also represent \"TT\". We count \"TT\" only once.\nThis is the standard interpretation for \"number of distinct X\".\n\nThis is usually solved with hashing. We hash each sequence string.\nA sequence of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` can be hashed as `(hash(L_1) * P^(k-1) + hash(L_2) * P^(k-2) + ... + hash(L_k)) % MOD_HASH`.\nSince letters are fixed, we can map 'A' to 1, 'B' to 2, etc.\nBut the sequences can be very long. `M=3000`. Max length of a letter's Morse code is 4. So max sequence length is `3000`.\nA sequence of 3000 letters would be `L_1...L_3000`.\n`hash_val = (L_1 * P^(2999) + ... + L_3000) % MOD_HASH`.\nWe need to calculate these hashes for all possible sequences for all substrings.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be a set of hashes of sequences that can be formed by `S[0...i-1]`.\n`dp[i]` = `union (dp[i-len] * P + hash(letter))` for valid `len` and `letter`.\nThis is also `O(M^2)` sets, each containing `O(M)` hashes. Total `O(M^3)` space and time. Too slow.\n\nThe only way this problem makes sense in competitive programming with `M=3000` and modulo arithmetic is if \"number of non-empty sequences\" means \"sum of ways to parse each substring\".\nLet's re-verify the example calculation for `S=\"111\"` with this interpretation:\n`S=\"1\"`: `f(\"1\") = 1`. Total = 1. (Matches output)\n`S=\"11\"`:\n  `f(\"1\")` (from `S[0]`): 1\n  `f(\"1\")` (from `S[1]`): 1\n  `f(\"11\")` (from `S[0...1]`): `g[0]=1, g[1]=1, g[2]=2`. So `f(\"11\") = 2-1 = 1`.\n  Total = `(1+1+1) = 3`. (Matches output)\n  Wait, `f(\"11\") = 1` for \"11\" as a single unit or \"1\" then \"1\".\n  If `f(\"11\")` is 1, then `g[2]-1` is 1. `g[2]` is 2.\n  `g[0]=1` (empty)\n  `g[1]=1` (for \"1\")\n  `g[2]=g[1]` (for \"1\") + `g[0]` (for \"11\") = `1+1=2`.\n  So `f(\"11\") = 1`. This is the number of ways to parse \"11\".\n  If 'T'='1', 'M'='11'.\n  Parsing \"11\" can be: ('T', 'T') or ('M'). Both are valid. So 2 ways.\n  So `f(\"11\")` should be 2.\n  This means my `g` definition is wrong for this problem's interpretation of \"sequences\".\n\nThe example \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"O\", \"TTT\" for `S=\"111\"` clearly shows that the \"sequences\" are distinct strings of letters.\nE.g., \"11\" can be parsed as 'M' (1 letter) or 'TT' (2 letters). Both are distinct.\nSo `f(\"11\")` should be 2.\nMy `g[i]` counts the number of ways to parse `S[0...i-1]`. `g[i]` for \"11\" is 2. This is the correct number of sequences.\nSo `f(text) = g[len(text)]`. We don't subtract 1 for the empty sequence.\n`g[0]` should be 0.\n`g[i]` = number of non-empty sequences for `text[0...i-1]`.\n`g[0] = 0`.\nFor `i` from 1 to `len(text)`:\n  `g[i] = 0`\n  If `sub1 = text[i-1]` is valid: `g[i] = (g[i] + (g[i-1] if i-1 > 0 else 0) + 1) % MOD`.\n  If `i >= 2` and `sub2 = text[i-2...i-1]` is valid: `g[i] = (g[i] + (g[i-2] if i-2 > 0 else 0) + 1) % MOD`.\n  If `i >= 3` and `sub3 = text[i-3...i-1]` is valid: `g[i] = (g[i] + (g[i-3] if i-3 > 0 else 0) + 1) % MOD`.\n  If `i >= 4` and `sub4 = text[i-4...i-1]` is valid: `g[i] = (g[i] + (g[i-4] if i-4 > 0 else 0) + 1) % MOD`.\nThis `g[i]` counts sequences ending at `i-1`.\nLet `dp_val[i]` be the number of sequences that can be formed by `text[0...i-1]`.\n`dp_val[0] = 0`.\n`dp_val[i] = 0`.\nIf `text[i-1]` is valid: `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i-1] + 1) % MOD`.\nIf `i >= 2` and `text[i-2...i-1]` is valid: `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i-2] + 1) % MOD`.\nIf `i >= 3` and `text[i-3...i-1]` is valid: `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i-3] + 1) % MOD`.\nIf `i >= 4` and `text[i-4...i-1]` is valid: `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i-4] + 1) % MOD`.\nThen `f(text) = dp_val[len(text)]`.\n\nLet's test `f(\"11\")` with this:\n`text = \"11\"`. `len=2`.\n`dp_val[0]=0`.\n`i=1`: `text[0]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp_val[1] = (dp_val[0]+1) = 1`. (Sequence \"T\")\n`i=2`: `text[1]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp_val[2] = (dp_val[2] + dp_val[1] + 1) = (0+1+1) = 2`. (Sequence \"TT\" (from \"T\" + \"T\"), \"T\" (from \"T\"))\n        `text[0...1]=\"11\"`. Valid. `dp_val[2] = (dp_val[2] + dp_val[0] + 1) = (2+0+1) = 3`. (Sequence \"M\")\n`f(\"11\") = dp_val[2] = 3`.\nThis matches the example's interpretation of `S=\"11\"` yielding 3 sequences.\nSo this `f(text)` is the correct one.\n\nNow, total answer is `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} sum_{i=0}^{j} f(S[i...j])`.\nThis is `ans_k = ans_{k-1} + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S[i...k-1])`.\nLet `current_total_f = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S[i...k-1])`.\nTo compute `current_total_f`:\n  `current_total_f = 0`.\n  For `j` from `0` to `k-1`:\n    `sub = S[j...k-1]`.\n    `current_total_f = (current_total_f + f(sub)) % MOD`.\nThis is `O(k^2)` calculation for each `k`. Total `O(M^3)`. `3000^3` is too much.\n\nWe need to optimize `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} f(S[j...k-1])`.\nLet `dp_suffix[j]` be `f(S[j...k-1])`.\nWe need `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} dp_suffix[j]`.\nWhen `c = S[k-1]` is appended, the new `k` is `len(S)`.\nWe need to calculate `dp_suffix[j]` for `j` from `k-1` down to `0`.\n`dp_suffix[k-1] = f(S[k-1])`.\n`dp_suffix[k-2] = f(S[k-2...k-1])`.\n...\n`dp_suffix[0] = f(S[0...k-1])`.\nEach `dp_suffix[j]` can be calculated in `O(k-j)` time.\nThe sum `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} dp_suffix[j]` can be computed in `O(k^2)` time.\nTotal `O(M^3)`. Still too slow.\n\nThe crucial part is that `f(text)` depends on `f(suffix)` values.\n`f(S[j...k-1])` depends on `f(S[j+1...k-1])`, `f(S[j+2...k-1])`, etc.\nLet `dp_suffix[j]` be `f(S[j...k-1])`.\n`dp_suffix[k] = 0`. (Base case for empty string)\nFor `j` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_suffix[j] = 0`\n  `sub1 = S[j]`\n  `sub2 = S[j...j+1]`\n  `sub3 = S[j...j+2]`\n  `sub4 = S[j...j+3]`\n  If `sub1` is valid: `dp_suffix[j] = (dp_suffix[j] + dp_suffix[j+1] + 1) % MOD`\n  If `j+1 < k` and `sub2` is valid: `dp_suffix[j] = (dp_suffix[j] + dp_suffix[j+2] + 1) % MOD`\n  If `j+2 < k` and `sub3` is valid: `dp_suffix[j] = (dp_suffix[j] + dp_suffix[j+3] + 1) % MOD`\n  If `j+3 < k` and `sub4` is valid: `dp_suffix[j] = (dp_suffix[j] + dp_suffix[j+4] + 1) % MOD`\nThis calculation for all `j` from `k-1` down to `0` takes `O(k * 4) = O(k)` time.\nThe new sum `sum_{j=0}^{k-1} dp_suffix[j]` is then calculated by summing these `O(k)` values. This takes `O(k)` time.\nSo, for each append, we do `O(k)` work.

Let `k = len(S_list)`.\n  `dp[k] = 0`\n\n  // Check substring of length 1 ending at k-1\n  `sub1 = S_list[k-1]`\n  If `sub1` in `valid_codes`: `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k-1] + 1) % MOD`\n\n  // Check substring of length 2 ending at k-1\n  If `k >= 2`:\n    `sub2 = \"\".join(S_list[k-2:k])`\n    If `sub2` in `valid_codes`: `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k-2] + 1) % MOD`\n\n  // Check substring of length 3 ending at k-1\n  If `k >= 3`:\n    `sub3 = \"\".join(S_list[k-3:k])`\n    If `sub3` in `valid_codes`: `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k-3] + 1) % MOD`\n\n  // Check substring of length 4 ending at k-1\n  If `k >= 4`:\n    `sub4 = \"\".join(S_list[k-4:k])`\n    If `sub4` in `valid_codes`: `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k-4] + 1) % MOD`\n  \n  Print `dp[k]`.\n\nThis is `O(1)` per character append (since string slicing and joining for length 1-4 is constant time), so total `O(M)`. This is very efficient.\n\nLet's list the valid/invalid codes for `valid_codes` set.\nTotal 30 strings of length 1-4.\nLength 1: \"0\", \"1\" (2)\nLength 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" (4)\nLength 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\" (8)\nLength 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0100\", \"0101\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\", \"1110\", \"1111\" (16)\nTotal = 2+4+8+16 = 30.\nInvalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nSo `valid_codes` will contain `30 - 4 = 26` strings.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n5\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\nOutput:\n1\n4\n10\n22\n43\n\n`S=[]`, `dp=[0]*6`, `valid_codes` populated.\n1. Append '1'. `S=['1']`, `k=1`.\n   `sub1='1'`. Valid. `dp[1] = (dp[0]+1) = 1`.\n   Print `dp[1]=1`. (Matches)\n\n2. Append '0'. `S=['1','0']`, `k=2`.\n   `sub1='0'`. Valid. `dp[2] = (dp[1]+1) = (1+1)=2`.\n   `sub2='10'`. Valid. `dp[2] = (dp[2]+dp[0]+1) = (2+0+1)=3`.\n   Print `dp[2]=3`. (Example output is 4)\n   My interpretation is wrong again.\n\nThe example output `1, 4, 10, 22, 43` for `S=\"10101\"` means:\n`S=\"1\"`: 1\n`S=\"10\"`: 4\n`S=\"101\"`: 10\n`S=\"1010\"`: 22\n`S=\"10101\"`: 43\n\nLet's try to match `S=\"10\"`.\nSubstrings of \"10\": \"1\", \"0\", \"10\".\n`f(\"1\")` = 1 (e.g. 'T')\n`f(\"0\")` = 1 (e.g. 'E')\n`f(\"10\")` = `dp_val[2]` for \"10\".\n  `dp_val[0]=0`.\n  `i=1, text[0]=\"1\"`: `dp_val[1] = (dp_val[0]+1) = 1`. ('T')\n  `i=2, text[1]=\"0\"`:\n    `text[1]=\"0\"` valid: `dp_val[2] = (dp_val[1]+1) = (1+1)=2`. ('ET') (from 'E' + 'T')\n    `text[0...1]=\"10\"` valid: `dp_val[2] = (dp_val[2]+dp_val[0]+1) = (2+0+1)=3`. ('N')\n  So `f(\"10\")=3`.\nDistinct sequences from \"1\", \"0\", \"10\":\n  'T' (from \"1\")\n  'E' (from \"0\")\n  'N' (from \"10\")\n  'TE' (from \"10\")\nTotal distinct sequences: 'T', 'E', 'N', 'TE'. Count = 4.\nThis matches the example output for `S=\"10\"`!\n\nSo the problem IS asking for the count of *distinct* sequences of English letters that can be represented by *any* substring of `S`.\nThis is the hardest interpretation.\nSince `M` is `3000`, a hash-based solution with `O(M^2)` states (substrings) and `O(M)` sequences per state is too slow.\nThe only way `O(M^2)` is feasible is if each state (substring) contributes `O(1)` to the set, or if the set operations are very fast.\n\nLet's assume the problem allows for collisions in hashes.\nWe can use polynomial hashing for sequences.\n`hash(L_1 L_2 ... L_k) = (L_1 * P^(k-1) + L_2 * P^(k-2) + ... + L_k) % MOD_HASH`.\nSince letters are not given, we can assign integer values 1-26.\nWe need to use two different hash functions (two different `P` values and `MOD_HASH` values) to reduce collision probability.\nLet `P1 = 31`, `P2 = 37`. `MOD1 = 10^9 + 7`, `MOD2 = 10^9 + 9`.\nStore pairs of hashes `(h1, h2)` in a `set`.\n\nLet `current_hashes` be a set of `(h1, h2)` pairs representing all distinct sequences found so far.\nWhen `S` grows to length `k`:\nWe need to consider all new substrings ending at `k-1`: `S[0...k-1]`, `S[1...k-1]`, ..., `S[k-1...k-1]`.\nFor each `j` from `0` to `k-1`, let `sub = S[j...k-1]`.\nWe need to generate all sequences for `sub` and add their hashes to `current_hashes`.\n\nTo generate sequences for `sub = S[j...k-1]`:\nLet `dp_hashes[p]` be a set of `(h1, h2)` pairs for `S[p...k-1]`.\n`dp_hashes[k] = {(0,0)}` (empty sequence hash)\nFor `p` from `k-1` down to `j`:\n  `dp_hashes[p] = set()`\n  `sub1 = S[p]`. If valid:\n    For each `(h1, h2)` in `dp_hashes[p+1]`:\n      `new_h1 = (h1 * P1 + letter_val(sub1)) % MOD1`\n      `new_h2 = (h2 * P2 + letter_val(sub1)) % MOD2`\n      `dp_hashes[p].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n  `sub2 = S[p...p+1]`. If valid:\n    For each `(h1, h2)` in `dp_hashes[p+2]`:\n      `new_h1 = (h1 * P1 + letter_val(sub2)) % MOD1`\n      `new_h2 = (h2 * P2 + letter_val(sub2)) % MOD2`\n      `dp_hashes[p].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n  ... (for len 3, 4)\nFinally, `current_hashes.update(dp_hashes[j])`.\nThis is still too slow. `dp_hashes[p]` can contain many hashes.\nThe maximum number of sequences for a string of length `L` is exponential (Fibonacci-like).\nFor `L=4`, `f(\"1111\")` would be `f(\"111\") + f(\"11\") + f(\"1\") + f(\"\")` = `4+2+1+1=8`.\nFor `L=3000`, this is too many sequences.\n\nThe problem must be simpler.\nThe example explanation for `S=\"111\"` lists 7 sequences.\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"111\")\nThese are all distinct strings of letters.\nThe Morse code for \"T\" is \"1\". This \"1\" can be `S[0]`, `S[1]`, or `S[2]`.\nThe Morse code for \"M\" is \"11\". This \"11\" can be `S[0...1]` or `S[1...2]`.\nThe Morse code for \"O\" is \"111\". This \"111\" can be `S[0...2]`.\n\nThe problem is \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some* substring of S\".\nThis sounds like we need to take the union of all sequences represented by individual substrings.\nLet `U` be the set of all sequences.\n`U = union_{0 <= i <= j < k} { sequences represented by S[i...j] }`.\nWe need `|U|`.\n\nThis is a standard problem type where a direct hash set is too slow.\nIt usually implies a DP where states store counts, not sets.\nThis means the sequences are not distinct.\nIf \"distinct\" is not implied, then \"number of non-empty sequences\" means \"sum of ways to parse each substring\".\nLet's check this `O(M^2)` interpretation with `S=\"10\"`:\n`S=\"1\"`: `f(\"1\")=1`. Total = 1. (Matches)\n`S=\"10\"`:\n  `f(\"1\")` (from `S[0]`): 1\n  `f(\"0\")` (from `S[1]`): 1\n  `f(\"10\")` (from `S[0...1]`): 3\n  Total = `1+1+3 = 5`. (Example output is 4)\n\nMy `f(text)` definition must be wrong if `S=\"10\"` gives 4.\n`f(\"1\")=1`. `f(\"0\")=1`. `f(\"10\")=3`.\nThe sequences are:\n`S[0]=\"1\"`: 'T'\n`S[1]=\"0\"`: 'E'\n`S[0...1]=\"10\"`: 'N', 'TE', 'EN' (I used 'N', 'TE' above. How is 'EN' formed? It's not.)\n`f(\"10\")` calculation:\n`dp_val[0]=0`.\n`i=1, text[0]=\"1\"`: `dp_val[1] = (dp_val[0]+1) = 1`. ('T')\n`i=2, text[1]=\"0\"`:\n  `text[1]=\"0\"` valid: `dp_val[2] = (dp_val[1]+1) = (1+1)=2`. (Sequences: ('T','E') (from ('T' + 'E')) and ('E') (from ('E')))\n  `text[0...1]=\"10\"` valid: `dp_val[2] = (dp_val[2]+dp_val[0]+1) = (2+0+1)=3`. (Sequences: ('N') (from ('N')))\nSo `f(\"10\")` results in 3 sequences: 'T', 'E', 'N'. No, that is not right.\nThe `dp_val[i]` logic is:\nIf `S[i-L...i-1]` is a valid code for letter `X`:\n  If `i-L == 0`: `dp_val[i] += 1` (for `X`)\n  Else: `dp_val[i] += dp_val[i-L]` (for `seq + X`)\nThis is the standard `f(text)` definition that counts ways to parse.\n`f(\"10\")`:\n  `g[0]=1` (empty)\n  `g[1]` (for \"1\"): `g[0]` for \"1\" = 1.\n  `g[2]` (for \"10\"): `g[1]` for \"0\" + `g[0]` for \"10\" = `1+1=2`.\n  So 2 ways to parse \"10\": \"1\"+\"0\" ('TE'), \"10\" ('N').\n  So `f(\"10\")` should be 2.\n\nIf `f(\"10\")=2`:\n`S=\"10\"`:\n`f(\"1\")` (from `S[0]`): 1\n`f(\"0\")` (from `S[1]`): 1\n`f(\"10\")` (from `S[0...1]`): 2\nTotal = `1+1+2 = 4`. This matches the example for `S=\"10\"`!\n\nSo the `f(text)` function is just the number of ways to parse `text` into Morse code letters.\n`g[0] = 1` (empty sequence)\n`g[i] = sum(g[i-len])` for valid codes of length `len` ending at `i-1`.\n`f(text) = g[len(text)]`. (If we don't subtract 1 for empty, this counts ways to parse.)\n\nLet's re-trace `S=\"111\"` with `f(text) = g[len(text)]`:\n`g[0]=1`.\n`f(\"1\")`: `g[1]=g[0]=1`.\n`f(\"11\")`: `g[2]=g[1]` (for \"1\") + `g[0]` (for \"11\") = `1+1=2`.\n`f(\"111\")`: `g[3]=g[2]` (for \"1\") + `g[1]` (for \"11\") + `g[0]` (for \"111\") = `2+1+1=4`.\n\nNow, the `O(M^2)` solution `ans_k = ans_{k-1} + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S[i...k-1])` using this `f(text)`:\n`S=\"1\"`: `f(\"1\")=1`. Total = 1. (Matches)\n`S=\"11\"`:\n  `f(\"1\")` (from `S[0]`): 1\n  `f(\"1\")` (from `S[1]`): 1\n  `f(\"11\")` (from `S[0...1]`): 2\n  Total = `1+1+2 = 4`. (Example output is 3)\n\nThis is a problem where the example output seems to contradict the natural interpretations.\n\"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\"\nThe example output for `S=\"111\"` is 7. My `f(S)` for `S=\"111\"` is 4.\nMy `sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(S[0...i])` for `S=\"111\"` is `f(\"1\") + f(\"11\") + f(\"111\") = 1+2+4 = 7`.
