Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for \"X\" Grid Validation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to determine if an `n x n` grid of characters forms a specific \"X\" shape. The rules are pretty clear: both diagonals must contain the same character, all other cells must also contain the same character, and these two characters must be different.  Also, `n` is guaranteed to be odd, which simplifies things because there's a unique center cell.\n\nMy initial thought is to represent the grid as a 2D list. I'll need to read in `n` and then the grid itself. The core of the algorithm involves iterating through each cell and checking if its position is on either of the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left).\n\nI need variables to store the characters found on the diagonals (`diag_char`) and off the diagonals (`other_char`).  I'll initialize `diag_char` with the value of the top-left cell, `grid[0][0]`.  I'll initialize `other_char` to `None` since I won't know that yet. I'll use a boolean flag, `is_x_form`, which starts as `True` and gets flipped to `False` if any of the rules are broken.\n\nDuring the iteration, if a cell is on a diagonal, I compare its character to `diag_char`. If they don't match, I set `is_x_form` to `False` and break out of the loops. If the cell is not on a diagonal, I check if `other_char` is still `None`. If it is, this means it's the first non-diagonal character, so I set `other_char` to that value. If `other_char` isn't `None`, I compare the current cell's character to `other_char`; a mismatch means `is_x_form` becomes `False`.\n\nAfter the loops finish, I need one last check: `diag_char` and `other_char` must be different. If they are the same, `is_x_form` goes to `False`. Finally, I'll print \"YES\" if `is_x_form` is still `True`, otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThinking about edge cases, the smallest valid `n` is 3. I've worked through the logic for `n=3` a few times to make sure that the center cell (which is on both diagonals) is handled correctly. I also had to make sure that even the smallest grid size is big enough to have both diagonals *and* non-diagonal cells to correctly validate the `other_char` requirement.\n\nI've refined the initialization so that I can directly read from `grid[0][0]` for the diagonal character and that when checking a cell I check its diagonal location as soon as it's read.\n\nI've traced the logic with the example grids from the problem statement to ensure the code is correct. It seems sound and covers all the rules. It's concise and should perform well within the time constraints. I am fairly confident in the solution. Finally, I replaced the verbose `input` statement with `sys.stdin.readline` to boost performance.\n",
