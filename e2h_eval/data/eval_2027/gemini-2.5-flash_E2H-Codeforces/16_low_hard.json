Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Crazy Town Problem: A Python Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it.  Let's break down my thinking.  First, the input:  I've got the home and university coordinates, the number of roads, and the equation coefficients for each road. I've noted the constraints – coordinate ranges, road count, and those critical non-collinearity conditions.  Crucially, the home and university are *not* on any road.\n\nThe goal is the *minimum* number of steps to get from home to the university.  Each step means crossing a road. Now, I see the core observation: a road line divides the plane into two half-planes. If a line segment connecting two points crosses a road, the points must be on opposite sides of that road. The sign of `ax + by + c` determines which side a point lies on.  If the signs are different for the home and university with respect to a road, the segment crosses that road.\n\nMy brain's whirring now. The problem essentially boils down to: what's the minimum number of road crossings needed? If the straight line segment between home and university crosses *k* roads, that's the *answer*. If they're in the same block, no crossings, result is zero. Otherwise, the segment needs to cross the minimum number of roads to reach the target block. This is the minimum possible number of moves. This is the fundamental insight! This transforms the problem into a simple counting task - counting the roads that separate home and university. I just need to check the sign of the road equation result at the home and university coordinates, and if the signs differ, I increment the crossing count. I am confident I can translate this directly into Python.\n",
