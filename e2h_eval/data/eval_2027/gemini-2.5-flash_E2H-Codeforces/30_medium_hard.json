Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. The core of it seems to be about maximizing the total prize by cleverly assigning digits to Homer and Marge. It looks like we're dealing with a 2n-digit number, and the players have to strategically pick digits to form two numbers, S1 and S2. The catch is, we need to maximize the sum of these two numbers.  Brute force? Forget it!  With n up to 18, the number of combinations explodes. Dynamic programming seems like the way to go, given the overlapping subproblems that are bound to arise when deciding how to distribute the digits.\n\n**Key Observations and Dynamic Programming Formulation:**\n\nThe essential insight here is that when a digit is taken, its contribution is determined by its value and its final position within the number. We can't simply take the largest digits because we need to consider their final place value. I have to think about what data is needed to make a good decision. It doesn't seem like the entire strings are really needed during the decision process. It appears like the number of remaining digits, the number of digits already assigned to each player, and the next digit to consider.\n\nWith that in mind, I define a DP state, `dp[h_moves][m_moves]`, representing the maximum prize from the remaining digits, given that Homer has made `h_moves` moves and Marge `m_moves`. The current digit being considered would then be `A[h_moves + m_moves]`. I can see the base case is `dp[n][n] = 0` (no more digits, no more prize) The choice is either Homer or Marge take the digit, but with some conditions like they must have remaining moves to take it. The digit contributes to the prize depending on the number of other numbers from the concatenation with the digit.\n\n**Refinement and Algorithm Structure:**\n\nI realize I can streamline the DP state further. Instead of keeping track of *how many* moves have been made, I can store how many moves *remain* for each player. It looks like it makes sense that `dp[h][m]` will be more elegant, representing the maximum sum obtainable starting from the current digit, where Homer has `h` moves left and Marge has `m` moves left. From here, I go back and create a recursive approach for calculating this new DP state, defining the base case as before.\n\nThe key recursion is about considering the current digit, let's call it `d = A[h+m]`. There are the two choices (H or M). If Homer takes it (`h < n`), it contributes `d * 10^(n - h - 1)` to S1. If Marge takes it (`m < n`), it contributes `d * 10^(n - m - 1)` to S2. The transition becomes about making the best choice, `dp[h][m] = max(HomerChoice, MargeChoice)`. I can also create a path table (`path[h][m]`) to reconstruct the optimal sequence.\n\n**Implementation Details and Verification:**\n\nImplementing this, the nested loops will be from n down to 0, which makes sense given that the decisions are about what's left. I'll need to handle the base case, the two choices for taking the digit. I plan to handle ties by having Homer take the digit.\n\nOkay, let's look at the Example with `n=2`, and `A=\"1234\"` again, walking through that DP table to ensure everything checks out and to confirm it generates the expected sequence. Tracing it, the approach seems to follow as I would expect. Let's trace another example like `n=2`, and `A = \"9911\"`.\n\n**Complexity and Optimization:**\n\nThe time complexity appears to be O(n^2), which is manageable even for n=18. The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the DP table. Python will handle the large integer calculations, so that's not a concern. The final thing is ensuring the algorithm is correctly implemented and tested across multiple different cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer ('H') and Marge ('M') such that each makes exactly `n` moves, and their total prize (S1 + S2) is maximized. The input `A` is a 2n-digit number. In each turn, a player takes the leftmost digit of `A` and appends it to their number.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\n**State Definition:**\nLet `dp[h][m]` represent the maximum total prize (S1 + S2) that can be obtained from the *remaining* digits of `A`, given that Homer has already made `h` moves and Marge has already made `m` moves.\nThe total number of moves made so far is `h + m`. This means the digits `A[0]` through `A[h+m-1]` have already been assigned. The current digit to consider is `A[h+m]`.\n\n**Base Case:**\n`dp[n][n] = 0`. This is the state where both players have made all `n` of their moves. There are no more digits to take, so no more prize can be added.\n\n**Recurrence Relation:**\nTo calculate `dp[h][m]`, we consider the digit `d = int(A[h+m])`. There are two possible choices:\n\n1.  **Homer takes the digit `d`:**\n    *   This is only possible if Homer still needs to make moves (i.e., `h < n`).\n    *   If Homer takes `d` as his `(h+1)`-th digit (0-indexed, meaning it's the `h`-th digit he's appending to `S1`), it will be placed at position `(n - (h+1))` from the right in `S1`. Its value will be `d * 10^(n - (h+1))`.\n    *   The remaining problem is to maximize the prize from the rest of the digits, with Homer having made `h+1` moves and Marge `m` moves. This value is `dp[h+1][m]`.\n    *   Total prize if Homer takes `d`: `d * 10^(n - h - 1) + dp[h+1][m]`\n\n2.  **Marge takes the digit `d`:**\n    *   This is only possible if Marge still needs to make moves (i.e., `m < n`).\n    *   If Marge takes `d` as her `(m+1)`-th digit, it will be placed at position `(n - (m+1))` from the right in `S2`. Its value will be `d * 10^(n - (m+1))`.\n    *   The remaining problem is `dp[h][m+1]`.\n    *   Total prize if Marge takes `d`: `d * 10^(n - m - 1) + dp[h][m+1]`\n\n`dp[h][m]` is the maximum of these two options. We also need to store the choice made (`'H'` or `'M'`) to reconstruct the optimal sequence later. If both options yield the same maximum prize, we can choose either one (e.g., prefer 'H').\n\n**Iteration Order:**\nThe DP table should be filled by iterating `h` from `n` down to `0`, and `m` from `n` down to `0`. This ensures that `dp[h+1][m]` and `dp[h][m+1]` are already computed when `dp[h][m]` is calculated.\n\n**Path Reconstruction:**\nAfter filling the `dp` table, the maximum total prize is `dp[0][0]`. To find the sequence of moves, we start from `(h, m) = (0, 0)` and follow the choices stored in the `path` table until `h = n` and `m = n`.\n\n**Example:**\nFor `n=2`, `A=\"1234\"`:\n*   `dp[0][0]` will be calculated based on `A[0] = '1'`.\n    *   If Homer takes '1' (as his 1st digit, `h=0`): contributes `1 * 10^(2-0-1) = 10`. Next state `dp[1][0]`.\n    *   If Marge takes '1' (as her 1st digit, `m=0`): contributes `1 * 10^(2-0-1) = 10`. Next state `dp[0][1]`.\n*   And so on. The final path will be `HHMM`, yielding `S1=12, S2=34`, total `46`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** There are `(n+1) * (n+1)` states in the DP table. Each state takes constant time to compute (arithmetic operations and comparisons). So, the total time complexity is `O(n^2)`. Given `n <= 18`, `18^2 = 324` operations, which is very fast.\n*   **Space Complexity:** We need to store two `(n+1) x (n+1)` tables (`dp` for values, `path` for choices). This is `O(n^2)` space. For `n=18`, this is `324` elements, which is also very small. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the potentially large prize values automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # dp[h_moves_made][m_moves_made] stores the maximum total prize\n    # from the remaining digits, given h_moves_made by Homer and m_moves_made by Marge.\n    # The current digit to consider is a_str[h_moves_made + m_moves_made].\n    \n    # Initialize dp table with zeros. dp[n][n] will be 0 as base case.\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    # Initialize path table to store 'H' or 'M' for path reconstruction.\n    path = [[''] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    # Iterate backwards from the state where all moves are made (n, n)\n    # to the initial state (0, 0).\n    for h in range(n, -1, -1):\n        for m in range(n, -1, -1):\n            # Base case: If both players have made all their moves, no more prize.\n            if h == n and m == n:\n                continue\n\n            current_digit_idx = h + m\n            \n            # The current_digit_idx must be less than 2n (total length of A)\n            # This condition is implicitly handled by the loop bounds for h and m,\n            # as h+m will be at most 2n-1 when h or m is less than n.\n            current_digit = int(a_str[current_digit_idx])\n\n            val_if_homer_takes = -1 # Use -1 to represent an invalid choice\n            val_if_marge_takes = -1\n\n            # Option 1: Homer takes the current digit\n            if h < n: # Homer still has moves to make\n                # This digit is Homer's (h+1)-th digit (1-indexed), or h-th (0-indexed).\n                # Its position in S1 from the right (0-indexed) is (n - 1 - h).\n                # Example: n=2.
