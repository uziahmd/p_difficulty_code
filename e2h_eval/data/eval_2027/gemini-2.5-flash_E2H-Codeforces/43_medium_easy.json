He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this string validation problem.**\n\nThe goal is to write a Python script that determines if an input string, `S`, adheres to specific formatting rules.  It needs to be structured as a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. The crucial part is that the number of 'c's has to equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Also, there must be at least one of each character, 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nI'm breaking down the validation into a few key steps. First, the string's character order is important: no 'b's before 'a's, no 'c's before 'b's, and so on. To verify this order, I can use a state machine. I'll define three states: expecting 'a's, expecting 'b's, and expecting 'c's. As I iterate through the string, the state transitions based on the character encountered. If any character violates the current state, the order is invalid.\n\nNext, I need to check the minimum counts.  After verifying the order, I can easily count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string. If any of these counts are zero, the string is invalid.\n\nFinally, the core rule: the number of 'c's must equal the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. I'll check this condition last.\n\nTo make the code efficient, I can combine the order check and the character count in a single loop, minimizing the number of passes through the string.  I've got a state machine that handles the order and a set of counts to track character occurrences.  After the loop, I can validate the minimum counts and the 'c' count against either 'a' or 'b' counts. This feels like a solid, optimized approach to solving this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules involving the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's break down the rules and the conditions the final string must satisfy:\n\n1.  **Initial 'a's (A's step)**: The string starts with some number of 'a's. Let this be `count_a_initial`. `count_a_initial >= 1`.\n2.  **Append 'b's (B's step)**: Some number of 'b's are appended to the end. Let this be `count_b_added`. `count_b_added >= 1`. At this point, the string contains at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3.  **Append 'c's (C's step)**: Some number of 'c's are appended to the end. Let this be `count_c_added`. The crucial condition is that `count_c_added` must be equal to the current total number of 'a's (`count_a_initial`) OR equal to the current total number of 'b's (`count_b_added`).\n\nCombining these rules, the final string `S` must adhere to the following properties:\n\n1.  **Character Order**: The string must consist of zero or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, followed by zero or more 'c's. This means no 'a' can appear after a 'b' or 'c', and no 'b' can appear after a 'c'.\n2.  **Minimum Counts**: Based on the rules, there must be at least one 'a' (`count_a >= 1`), at least one 'b' (`count_b >= 1`), and at least one 'c' (`count_c >= 1`). The `count_c >= 1` is implied because `count_c` must equal `count_a` or `count_b`, both of which are at least 1.\n3.  **C's Rule**: The total number of 'c's in the string (`count_c`) must be equal to the total number of 'a's (`count_a`) OR equal to the total number of 'b's (`count_b`). That is, `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`.\n\nWe can check these conditions in a single pass through the string for efficiency.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialize Counters and State**:\n    *   `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` to 0.\n    *   `state = 0`: This state represents that we are currently expecting 'a's.\n        *   `state = 1`: We have seen at least one 'a' and are now expecting 'b's (or still 'a's if they are consecutive).\n        *   `state = 2`: We have seen at least one 'a' and one 'b' and are now expecting 'c's (or still 'b's if they are consecutive).\n    *   `valid_order = True`: A boolean flag to track if the character order is correct.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through the String**: For each character `char` in `S`:\n    *   **If `char == 'a'`**:\n        *   Increment `count_a`.\n        *   If `state` is 0 (expecting 'a's), continue.\n        *   If `state` is 1 (expecting 'b's) or 2 (expecting 'c's), it means an 'a' appeared after a 'b' or 'c', which violates the order. Set `valid_order = False` and break.\n    *   **If `char == 'b'`**:\n        *   Increment `count_b`.\n        *   If `state` is 0 (expecting 'a's), transition to `state = 1` (now expecting 'b's).\n        *   If `state` is 1 (expecting 'b's), continue.\n        *   If `state` is 2 (expecting 'c's), it means a 'b' appeared after a 'c', which violates the order. Set `valid_order = False` and break.\n    *   **If `char == 'c'`**:\n        *   Increment `count_c`.\n        *   If `state` is 0 (expecting 'a's) or 1 (expecting 'b's), transition to `state = 2` (now expecting 'c's).\n        *   If `state` is 2 (expecting 'c's), continue.\n    *   **Else (unexpected character)**: Although the problem guarantees 'a', 'b', 'c', this case would also set `valid_order = False` and break.\n\n3.  **Post-Iteration Checks**:\n    *   If `valid_order` is `False`, print \"NO\".\n    *   **Minimum Counts Check**: If `count_a == 0` or `count_b == 0` or `count_c == 0`, print \"NO\".\n    *   **C's Rule Check**: If `count_c == count_a` or `count_c == count_b`, print \"YES\".\n    *   Otherwise (none of the above conditions met), print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach processes the string in a single pass, making it efficient for the given string length constraint ($|S| \\le 5000$).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n\n    # State machine for order validation:\n    # 0: Expecting 'a's (or first 'b')\n    # 1: Expecting 'b's (or first 'c')\n    # 2: Expecting 'c's\n    state = 0 \n    valid_order = True\n\n    for char in S:\n        if char == 'a':\n            count_a += 1\n            if state == 0:\n                # Still in 'a' section, or just started 'a' section\n                pass \n            else: # 'a' appeared after 'b' or 'c'\n                valid_order = False\n                break\n        elif char == 'b':\n            count_b += 1\n            if state == 0:\n                # Transition from 'a' section to 'b' section\n                state = 1\n            elif state == 1:\n                # Still in 'b' section\n                pass\n            else: # 'b' appeared after 'c'\n                valid_order = False\n                break\n        elif char == 'c':\n            count_c += 1\n            if state == 0 or state == 1:\n                # Transition from 'a' or 'b' section to 'c' section\n                state = 2\n            elif state == 2:\n                # Still in 'c' section\n                pass\n        else:\n            # Should not happen based on problem constraints (only 'a', 'b', 'c')\n            valid_order = False\n            break\n\n    if not valid_order:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Check minimum counts: at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' must exist.\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Check C's rule: number of 'c's must equal number of 'a's OR number of 'b's.\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
