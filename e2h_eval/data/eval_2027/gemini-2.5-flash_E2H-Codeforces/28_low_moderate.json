String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Algorithm Design**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving \"beautiful strings\".  My goal is to count them, modulo a large prime. The problem is well-defined: I need strings of zeros and ones with a specific number of each, and crucially, they must \"reduce\" to a single character (the target `g`) through a particular modification operation.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding this modification operation.  Essentially, it boils down to repeatedly shrinking the string by replacing the last two characters with a single one, if and only if they were both zeros, otherwise with a zero.  I recognize this as a right-associative reduction. I'm thinking of defining `val(x)` as the integer value of the character and representing the modification function as `f(c1,c2)` where the outcome is `1` only if both `c1` and `c2` are `0` and otherwise `0`.\n\nI can visualize the operation step-by-step.  With enough steps, I'll arrive at a single character result. I'm starting to formalize the recurrence relation in my head: the final result `R` is a series of nested operations - `s_1` combined with the result of `s_2` combined with the result of... and so on.\n\nThe modulo requirement is standard; I'll need to remember to apply it at each calculation step to avoid integer overflow.  I suspect dynamic programming might be a viable approach. I'll need to explore the possible states, but the values of `n` and `m` indicate that complexity is an important consideration.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones that, when reduced by a specific operation, result in a single character `g`. The operation replaces the two last characters `c1c2` with a new character: `1` if `c1c2` is `00`, and `0` otherwise. This is equivalent to `1 - (c1 XOR c2)`.\n\nLet's analyze the reduction operation. If we have a string `s_1 s_2 ... s_k`, the operation replaces `s_{k-1}s_k` with `f(s_{k-1}, s_k)`. Then it applies to `s_{k-2} f(s_{k-1}, s_k)`, and so on. This means the operation is right-associative: the final result `R` is `s_1 \\text{ op } (s_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } s_k)...)`.\n\nLet's track the parity of the number of ones.\n- `f(0, 0) = 1`: `ones_in(00) = 0`, `ones_in(1) = 1`. Parity changes.\n- `f(0, 1) = 0`: `ones_in(01) = 1`, `ones_in(0) = 0`. Parity changes.\n- `f(1, 0) = 0`: `ones_in(10) = 1`, `ones_in(0) = 0`. Parity changes.\n- `f(1, 1) = 0`: `ones_in(11) = 2`, `ones_in(0) = 0`. Parity changes.\n\nIn all cases, the parity of the number of ones changes.\nLet `P(s)` be the parity of the number of ones in string `s`.\n`P(f(c1, c2)) = 1 - P(c1c2)`.\nIf a string `s` has length `L`, it undergoes `L-1` operations. Each operation flips the parity of the number of ones.\nSo, `P(final_char) = (P(initial_string) + (L-1)) % 2`.\nLet `m` be the number of ones in the initial string. `P(initial_string) = m % 2`.\nSo, `P(final_char) = (m + L - 1) % 2`.\nThe length `L = n + m`.\nSo, `P(final_char) = (m + n + m - 1) % 2 = (n + 2m - 1) % 2 = (n - 1) % 2`.\nThe final character `g` has `P(g) = g % 2`.\nTherefore, we must have `g % 2 = (n - 1) % 2`.\n\nThis condition `g % 2 = (n - 1) % 2` is necessary. If it's not met, the answer is 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific values.\nIf `g=1`: We need `1 % 2 = (n - 1) % 2`, which means `1 = n - 1` (modulo 2). This simplifies to `n % 2 = 0`. So, if `g=1`, `n` must be even.\nIf `g=0`: We need `0 % 2 = (n - 1) % 2`, which means `0 = n - 1` (modulo 2). This simplifies to `n % 2 = 1`. So, if `g=0`, `n` must be odd.\n\nThis condition is also sufficient, with one special case:\nWhat if `n=0`?\nIf `n=0`, the string consists only of `m` ones.\n`L = m`.\n`P(final_char) = (m + m - 1) % 2 = (2m - 1) % 2 = 1`.\nSo, if `n=0`, the final character must be `1`.\nIf `n=0` and `g=0`, the answer is `0`.\nIf `n=0` and `g=1`: The condition `n % 2 = 0` is `0 % 2 = 0`, which is true. The formula holds.\nThe string is `11...1` (`m` times).\n`f(1,1)=0`. `f(1,0)=0`. `f(1,0)=0`. ... `f(1,0)=0`.\nSo if `m >= 1`, `11...1` reduces to `0`. This contradicts the requirement that it must reduce to `1`.\nThis means the parity argument is not sufficient for `n=0`.\nLet's re-evaluate `n=0`. The string is `11...1`.\n`s_1 s_2 ... s_m`.\n`f(s_{m-1}, s_m) = f(1,1) = 0`.\n`f(s_{m-2}, 0) = f(1,0) = 0`.\n...\n`f(s_1, 0) = f(1,0) = 0`.\nSo, if `n=0` and `m >= 1`, the string `1...1` always reduces to `0`.\nTherefore, if `n=0`:\n- If `g=0`, the answer is `1` (the string is `1...1`).\n- If `g=1`, the answer is `0`.\n\nThis special handling for `n=0` is crucial. The parity argument `g % 2 = (n-1) % 2` yields `g % 2 = (0-1) % 2 = 1`. So it would say `g=1` is required. But the actual result for `n=0, m>=1` is `0`.\nSo, the parity argument `g % 2 = (n - 1) % 2` is correct for `n >= 1`.\n\nSummary of conditions for a non-zero answer:\n1. If `n=0`:\n   - If `g=0`, answer is `1`. (String is `1...1` (`m` times)).\n   - If `g=1`, answer is `0`.\n2. If `n >= 1`:\n   - If `g=1`, `n` must be even.\n   - If `g=0`, `n` must be odd.\n   - If these parity conditions are not met, answer is `0`.\n   - If these parity conditions are met, the answer is the number of ways to arrange `n` zeros and `m` ones, which is `C(n+m, n)`.\n\nLet's check `n+m >= 1` constraint.\nIf `n=0, m=0`: `L=0`, not allowed.\nIf `n=1, m=0`: string is \"0\". `L=1`, no operations. Result is `0`.\n   - Our condition: `n=1` (odd), `g=0` is required. `C(1+0, 1) = C(1,1) = 1`. Correct.\nIf `n=0, m=1`: string is \"1\". `L=1`, no operations. Result is `1`.\n   - Our `n=0` rule: `g=0` gives `1`, `g=1` gives `0`. This is wrong.\nThe `n=0` rule `1...1` always reduces to `0` applies for `m >= 2`.\nIf `m=1`, string is \"1\", result is \"1\".\n\nLet's refine the `n=0` case:\n- If `n=0, m=1`: String is \"1\". Result is `1`.\n  - If `g=1`, answer is `1`.\n  - If `g=0`, answer is `0`.\n- If `n=0, m >= 2`: String is `1...1` (`m` times). Result is `0`.\n  - If `g=1`, answer is `0`.\n  - If `g=0`, answer is `1`.\n\nThis means the general parity rule `g % 2 = (n-1) % 2` is valid for `n >= 1` OR (`n=0` AND `m=1`).\nIt fails for `n=0, m>=2`.\n\nThe number of strings is `C(n+m, n) = (n+m)! / (n! * m!)`. We need to compute this modulo 1000000007.\n\nFinal refined logic:\n1. **Handle `n=0` case:**\n   - If `m=0`: `n+m=0`, not allowed by `n+m>=1`.\n   - If `m=1`: String is \"1\". Result is `1`.\n     - If `g=1`, answer is `1`.\n     - If `g=0`, answer is `0`.\n   - If `m >= 2`: String is `1...1` (`m` times). Result is `0`.\n     - If `g=1`, answer is `0`.\n     - If `g=0`, answer is `1`.\n2. **Handle `n >= 1` case:**\n   - Check the parity condition: `g % 2 == (n - 1) % 2`.\n     - If `g=1`, `n` must be even.\n     - If `g=0`, `n` must be odd.\n   - If the parity condition is NOT met, the answer is `0`.\n   - If the parity condition IS met, the answer is `C(n+m, n) % MOD`.\n\nLet's test with examples:\n- `n=1, m=1, g=0`:\n  - `n >= 1`. Parity check: `g=0`, `n=1` (odd). `0 % 2 == (1-1) % 2` -> `0 == 0`. Condition met.\n  - Answer: `C(1+1, 1) = C(2,1) = 2`. Correct. (Strings: \"01\", \"10\")\n- `n=2, m=2, g=0`:\n  - `n >= 1`. Parity check: `g=0`, `n=2` (even). `0 % 2 == (2-1) % 2` -> `0 == 1`. Condition NOT met.\n  - Answer: `0`.\n  - Wait, example output is `4`. My parity argument for `n >= 1` is wrong.\n\nLet's re-re-evaluate the parity.\nThe operation `f(c1, c2) = 1 - (c1 XOR c2)`.\nThis is `NOT (c1 XOR c2)`.\nLet `R(s)` be the result of reducing string `s`.\n`R(s_1 s_2 ... s_k) = R(s_1 R(s_2 ... s_k))`.\nThis is `s_1 \\text{ op } (s_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } s_k)...)`.\nThe actual operation is: `last_char = s_k`. `for i from k-1 down to 1: last_char = f(s_i, last_char)`.\nLet's call `f(a,b)` as `a \\odot b`.\n`s_1 \\odot (s_2 \\odot (s_3 \\odot (... \\odot s_k)...))`.\nThis is not what the problem describes. The problem says \"replace two last characters ... by one other character\". This is `s_1 s_2 ... s_{k-2} f(s_{k-1}, s_k)`.\nThis is `s_1 \\text{ op } s_2 \\text{ op } ... \\text{ op } s_k` where `op` is right-associative.\n\nLet `v(c)` be the integer value of character `c`.\n`v(f(c1, c2)) = 1` if `c1=0, c2=0`. Else `0`.\nConsider the number of `00` pairs in the original string.\nThis is not straightforward.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern for the final character `g`.\n`0 -> 0`\n`1 -> 1`\n`00 -> 1`\n`01 -> 0`\n`10 -> 0`\n`11 -> 0`\n\n`000 -> 0(00) -> 01 -> 0`\n`001 -> 0(01) -> 00 -> 1`\n`010 -> 0(10) -> 00 -> 1`\n`011 -> 0(11) -> 00 -> 1`\n`100 -> 1(00) -> 11 -> 0`\n`101 -> 1(01) -> 10 -> 0`\n`110 -> 1(10) -> 10 -> 0`\n`111 -> 1(11) -> 10 -> 0`\n\nResults for length 1: `0->0, 1->1`\nResults for length 2: `00->1, 01->0, 10->0, 11->0`\nResults for length 3: `000->0, 001->1, 010->1, 011->1, 100->0, 101->0, 110->0, 111->0`\n\nNotice a pattern: If the first character is `1`, the result is always `0` (for length `L >= 2`).\nLet `s = 1X`. `f(1, X_last) = 0` (unless `X_last=0` in `f(1,0)` or `X_last=1` in `f(1,1)`).\n`s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\nIf `s_1 = 1`:\n`1 s_2 ... s_L`\n`s_1 \\text{ op } (s_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } s_L)...)`\nThe first operation is `s_{L-1} \\text{ op } s_L`. Let its result be `R_L`.\nThen `s_{L-2} \\text{ op } R_L`. Let its result be `R_{L-1}`.\n...\nFinally `s_1 \\text{ op } R_2`.\nIf `s_1 = 1`, then the final operation is `1 \\text{ op } R_2`.\n`1 \\text{ op } 0 = 0`\n`1 \\text{ op } 1 = 0`\nSo if `s_1 = 1`, the result is always `0`. This holds for `L >= 2`.\nWhat if `L=1`? If `s=\"1\"`, result is `1`. This is covered by `L >= 2`.\n\nSo, if `n=0`:\n- If `m=1` (string \"1\"), result is `1`.\n- If `m >= 2` (string `1...1`), result is `0`. (Because `s_1=1` and `L>=2`).\nThis matches my refined `n=0` logic.\n\nNow consider `s_1 = 0`.\n`0 s_2 ... s_L`.\nThe final operation is `0 \\text{ op } R_2`.\n`0 \\text{ op } 0 = 1`\n`0 \\text{ op } 1 = 0`\nSo if `s_1 = 0`, the result is `1` if `R_2 = 0`, and `0` if `R_2 = 1`.\n`R_2` is the result of `s_2 ... s_L`. This is a string of length `L-1`.\nLet `s' = s_2 ... s_L`.\nIf `s_1 = 0`, then `R(s) = 1 - R(s')`. (Using `0 \\text{ op } x = 1-x`)\n\nThis means if `s_1 = 0`, the final result `g` depends on `R(s')`.\n`R(s')` is the result of a string `s'` of length `L-1`.\nIf `s_2 = 1`: `R(s') = 0` (because `s_2=1` and `L-1 >= 1`).\n   - If `L-1 = 0` (i.e. `L=1`), this is not possible as `s_1=0` means `s_2` exists.\n   - If `L-1 = 1` (i.e. `L=2`), `s_2` is the whole string `s'`. If `s'=\"1\"`, `R(s')=1`. My rule `s_1=1 => R(s)=0` is for `L>=2`.\n     - `s = \"01\"`. `s'=\"1\"`. `R(s')=1`. `R(\"01\") = 1 - R(\"1\") = 1 - 1 = 0`. Correct.\n   - If `L-1 >= 2`, and `s_2 = 1`, then `R(s') = 0`.\n     - `s = \"010\"`. `s'=\"10\"`. `R(s')=0`. `R(\"010\") = 1 - R(\"10\") = 1 - 0 = 1`. Correct.\n\nSo, for `s_1 = 0`:\n- If `s_2 = 1`:\n  - If `L=2` (i.e., `s=\"01\"`): `s'=\"1\"`, `R(s')=1`. `R(s) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n  - If `L>=3` (i.e., `s=\"01X...\"`): `s'=\"1X...\"`, `R(s')=0` (because `s_2=1` and `L-1>=2`). `R(s) = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n- If `s_2 = 0`:\n  - `s = \"00X...\"`. `R(s) = 1 - R(\"0X...\")`. This is a recursive definition.\n\nLet's use `N_0` for count of zeros, `N_1` for count of ones.\nWe are looking for strings `s` with `n` zeros and `m` ones that reduce to `g`.\n\nCase 1: `s_1 = 1`.\n  - This means `n` zeros, `m-1` ones for `s_2...s_L`.\n  - If `L=1`, `s=\"1\"`. `n=0, m=1`. Result is `1`.\n  - If `L>=2`, result is `0`.\n  - So, if `s_1=1`:\n    - If `n=0, m=1`, result is `1`.\n    - If `n=0, m>=2`, result is `0`.\n    - If `n>=1`, result is `0`.\n  - We want `g`.\n    - If `g=1`: Only `n=0, m=1` works. Count is `1`.\n    - If `g=0`:\n      - If `n=0, m>=2`, count is `1` (string `1...1`).\n      - If `n>=1`, count is `C(n+m-1, n)` (strings starting with `1` and having `n` zeros, `m-1` ones).\n\nCase 2: `s_1 = 0`.\n  - This means `n-1` zeros, `m` ones for `s_2...s_L`.\n  - `s_1=0` implies `n>=1`.\n  - Let `s' = s_2...s_L`. `n_s' = n-1`, `m_s' = m`.\n  - `R(s) = 1 - R(s')`.\n  - We want `R(s) = g`. This means we need `R(s') = 1-g`.\n  - So, we need to count strings `s'` with `n-1` zeros and `m` ones that reduce to `1-g`.\n  - This is a recursive structure. Let `count(N_0, N_1, G)` be the function we want.\n  - `count(n, m, g)`:\n    - If `n=0`:\n      - If `m=1`: return `1` if `g=1`, `0` if `g=0`.\n      - If `m>=2`: return `1` if `g=0`, `0` if `g=1`.\n    - If `n>=1`:\n      - `ans = 0`\n      - For strings starting with `1`:\n        - If `g=0`: `ans += C(n+m-1, n)` (number of strings starting with `1` and having `n` zeros, `m-1` ones).\n        - If `g=1`: No strings starting with `1` (and `L>=2`) can give `1`.\n      - For strings starting with `0`:\n        - `ans += count(n-1, m, 1-g)`\n      - Return `ans`.\n\nThis recursion will eventually hit the `n=0` base case.\nExample: `n=2, m=2, g=0`\n`count(2,2,0)`:\n  `n=2 >= 1`.\n  Strings starting with `1`: `g=0` is desired. So add `C(2+2-1, 2) = C(3,2) = 3`.\n  Strings starting with `0`: add `count(2-1, 2, 1-0) = count(1,2,1)`.\n  `count(1,2,1)`:\n    `n=1 >= 1`.\n    Strings starting with `1`: `g=1` is desired. No strings starting with `1` (and `L>=2`) can give `1`. So add `0`.\n    Strings starting with `0`: add `count(1-1, 2, 1-1) = count(0,2,0)`.\n    `count(0,2,0)`:\n      `n=0, m=2 >= 2`. `g=0` is desired. Return `1`.\n    So `count(1,2,1)` returns `0 + 1 = 1`.\n  Therefore, `count(2,2,0)` returns `3 + 1 = 4`. Correct for `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n\nExample: `n=1, m=1, g=0`\n`count(1,1,0)`:\n  `n=1 >= 1`.\n  Strings starting with `1`: `g=0` is desired. Add `C(1+1-1, 1) = C(1,1) = 1`.\n  Strings starting with `0`: add `count(1-1, 1, 1-0) = count(0,1,1)`.\n  `count(0,1,1)`:\n    `n=0, m=1`. `g=1` is desired. Return `1`.\n  Therefore, `count(1,1,0)` returns `1 + 1 = 2`. Correct for `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\n\nExample: `n=1, m=1, g=1`\n`count(1,1,1)`:\n  `n=1 >= 1`.\n  Strings starting with `1`: `g=1` is desired. Add `0`.\n  Strings starting with `0`: add `count(1-1, 1, 1-1) = count(0,1,0)`.\n  `count(0,1,0)`:\n    `n=0, m=1`. `g=0` is desired. Return `0`.\n  Therefore, `count(1,1,1)` returns `0 + 0 = 0`. Correct for `n=1, m=1, g=1`.\n\nThis recursive definition seems correct.\nThe maximum value of `n` is `10^5`. The recursion depth is `n`.\n`count(N_0, N_1, G)` depends on `count(N_0-1, N_1, 1-G)`.\nWe can compute this iteratively.\nLet `dp[i][g_val]` be the answer for `n=i`. `m` is fixed.\n`dp[i][g]` = (count of strings starting with `1` that result in `g`) + `dp[i-1][1-g]`.\nThe count of strings starting with `1` that result in `g`:\n  - If `g=1`, it's `0` (for `n>=1` or `m>=2`).\n  - If `g=0`: it's `C(i+m-1, i)` (strings starting with `1` with `i` zeros and `m-1` ones).
