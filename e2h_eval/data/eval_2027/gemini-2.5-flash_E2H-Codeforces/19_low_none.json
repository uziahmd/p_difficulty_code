    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling \"The Number Games\" problem. I've got `n` districts forming a tree, and each district `i` has `2^i` fans. The goal is to remove `k` contestants and keep the remaining `n-k` as a connected component, maximizing the total fan count.  Essentially, I need to choose which districts to *remove* to maximize the sum of powers of two for the kept districts.\n\n**Understanding the Core Challenge**\n\nMy immediate thought is that maximizing the sum of fans of the remaining districts is the same as *minimizing* the sum of fans of the removed districts. Since `2^i` grows so rapidly, it's pretty clear that I should be prioritizing the removal of districts with *smaller* indices, i.e. districts 1, 2, 3, etc. This is the heart of the optimization.\n\n**Greedy Approach Exploration**\n\nSo I'm thinking a greedy approach might work.  Let's consider the districts in decreasing order of index, `n`, `n-1`, down to 1.  I want to keep the districts with the largest indices to maximize the total fan count. I need to keep a connected component of size `n-k`.  I'm trying to figure out the best way to determine the `k` districts to remove.\n\n**Framing the Problem**\n\nThe problem boils down to selecting `n-k` districts that form a connected component and maximize the sum of `2^i` values, where `i` is the district index. Keeping larger `i` values seems key.\n\n**Looking for a Strategy**\n\nIt feels like this might be a dynamic programming problem on trees, or perhaps a smarter greedy solution is possible. The fact that the structure is a tree suggests some kind of recursive or tree traversal approach.\n\n**Considering Rooting the Tree**\n\nLet's root the tree at district `n`. Now, if I *choose* to keep district `n`, then I need to find `n-k-1` more connected districts that, with `n`, form a connected component. My gut feeling is that this choice will be beneficial, and I need to somehow choose the best `k` removals from this scenario.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree, such that the sum of `2^i` for these districts is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *not* selected (i.e., removed), in increasing order.\n\nSince `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i`, maximizing `sum(2^i)` is equivalent to prioritizing districts with larger indices. For example, `2^100` is much larger than `2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^99`. This means we should try to keep districts with the largest possible indices.\n\nLet's rephrase: we want to keep `n-k` districts. To maximize the sum, we should try to keep district `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on, as long as we can form a connected component of size `n-k`.\nThis suggests a greedy strategy:\n1. Start with an empty set of `removed` districts.\n2. We want to keep `n-k` districts. Let `count_kept = 0`.\n3. Iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\n4. For each district `i`:\n   If we can add district `i` to our `kept` set such that the `kept` set remains connected and its size does not exceed `n-k`, we should add it.\n\nThis greedy strategy needs a way to efficiently check connectivity and count components. A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure is suitable for this.\n\n**Algorithm using DSU:**\n\n1. **Initialize DSU:** Each district `i` is initially in its own set. `parent[i] = i`, `size[i] = 1`.\n2. **Build Adjacency List:** Store the tree structure using an adjacency list `adj`.\n3. **Iterate from `n` down to `1`:**\n   We want to greedily keep districts with large indices. Let's maintain a set of `kept` districts.\n   Start by assuming all districts from `n` down to `1` are *candidates* to be kept.\n   We will try to *remove* districts with small indices if they don't help connect larger-indexed districts, or if we have to remove `k` districts.\n\n   This is a bit tricky. A simpler approach is to mark districts we *want* to keep, and then verify connectivity.\n   Let's consider districts in decreasing order `i = n, n-1, ..., 1`.\n   We will add districts to a `kept` set.\n   `kept_count = 0`\n   `is_kept = [False] * (n+1)`\n   `removed_districts = []`\n\n   For `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n     If `kept_count < n-k`:\n       Mark district `i` as `is_kept[i] = True`.\n       `kept_count += 1`.\n     Else (`kept_count == n-k`):\n       We have already selected `n-k` districts (the largest ones so far). Now we need to check if they form a connected component.\n       If they do, we are done, and `i` (and all smaller districts) are removed.\n       If they don't, we need to remove one of the `kept` districts and add `i`. Which one to remove? The smallest one currently in `kept` that *can* be removed without disconnecting the component.\n       This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's try a different perspective: We want to *remove* `k` districts. To maximize the sum of `2^i` for remaining districts, we should remove districts with the smallest possible indices.\n\nConsider districts in increasing order `i = 1, 2, ..., n`.\nWe will try to remove district `i` if:\n1. We still need to remove more districts (`removed_count < k`).\n2. Removing district `i` does not disconnect the component formed by districts `i+1, ..., n` (or more generally, the current set of `kept` districts).\n\nThis is still hard to check dynamically. The problem states \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another.\" This means the final set of `n-k` districts must form a single connected component.\n\n**Correct Greedy Approach:**\n\nThe key is that we want to keep `n-k` districts, and `2^i` is strictly increasing. So, we must keep district `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, etc., as much as possible.\nThe only reason we would *not* keep a large-indexed district `i` is if keeping it prevents us from forming a connected component of size `n-k` with other large-indexed districts, or if we are forced to remove it to make space for `k` removals.\n\nLet's try to find the *root* of the final connected component.\nThe final connected component will contain `n-k` districts.\nConsider the district `n`. It has the largest fan count. We definitely want to keep it.\nWhat if we perform a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) starting from district `n`?\nWe can find all districts reachable from `n` if we only traverse through districts that we *intend to keep*.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved by rooting the tree at the highest indexed node, say `n`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. We must keep node `n`.\nWe then want to select `n-k-1` more nodes (from `1` to `n-1`) that are connected to `n` (possibly through other selected nodes) and have the largest possible indices.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the greedy strategy:\n1. Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n2. Initialize `removed_list = []`.\n3. Create a boolean array `is_kept = [False] * (n+1)`.\n4. We *must* keep district `n`. Set `is_kept[n] = True`.\n5. Iterate `i` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n   We want to keep district `i` if possible.\n   If we keep `i`, we mark `is_kept[i] = True`.\n   If we don't keep `i`, we mark `is_kept[i] = False` and add `i` to `removed_list`.\n   The goal is to have `n-k` elements in `is_kept` that form a connected component.\n\nThis is still not quite right. The issue is that the decision for `i` affects connectivity for `i-1`.\n\n**The correct approach is to iterate from `n` downwards, greedily adding districts to our \"kept\" set, and using a DSU to track connectivity.**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `adj`: Adjacency list for the tree.\n   - `dsu_parent`: DSU parent array, `dsu_parent[i] = i` initially.\n   - `dsu_size`: DSU size array, `dsu_size[i] = 1` initially.\n   - `is_present`: A boolean array, `is_present[i] = False` for all `i`. This indicates whether district `i` is currently considered part of the *candidate* connected component.\n   - `removed_count = 0`.\n   - `removed_districts = []`.\n\n2. **Iterate from `i = n` down to `1`:**\n   - Mark district `i` as `is_present[i] = True`. This means we are tentatively keeping district `i`.\n   - For each neighbor `v` of `i`:\n     - If `v > i` and `is_present[v]` is `True`:\n       - Union the sets containing `i` and `v` in the DSU.\n   - After processing district `i` and its relevant neighbors, check the state:\n     - The DSU now reflects the connected components formed by districts `j` where `is_present[j]` is `True`.\n     - We are looking for a single connected component of size `n-k`.\n     - If the size of the component containing `i` (i.e., `dsu_size[find(i)]`) is `n - removed_count`:\n       - This means we have found a connected component of the required size. All districts `j` for which `is_present[j]` is `True` form this component.\n       - All districts `x` for which `is_present[x]` is `False` (these are `x < i` that we haven't processed yet, or `x > i` that were never marked `is_present`) must be removed.\n       - So, for all `j` from `1` to `i-1`: add `j` to `removed_districts`.\n       - Break the loop (we've found our `n-k` districts).\n     - If `dsu_size[find(i)]` is greater than `n - removed_count`:\n       - This means we have too many districts in the component, or the current component is too large. This should not happen with this greedy strategy if we are careful. The `dsu_size` will only grow as we add smaller indices. We want to remove `k` districts.\n       - If `dsu_size[find(i)]` is `n - k - removed_count`, it means we still have `removed_count` districts to remove.\n\nThe critical observation from a similar problem is that the set of kept nodes will always form a single connected component. If we add node `i` to the current set of kept nodes (which are all `>i`), it connects to one or more of them. By construction, if we keep `n-k` nodes, they will be the `n-k` largest indexed nodes that form a connected component rooted at `n`.\n\nLet's maintain the number of nodes we have decided to *keep* so far.\n`kept_count = 0`\n`kept_nodes = set()`\n`removed_nodes = []`\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  If `kept_count == n-k`:\n    // We already have `n-k` nodes. These are the `n-k` largest nodes we've processed so far.\n    // All remaining nodes (from `i` down to `1`) must be removed.\n    For `j` from `i` down to `1`:\n      `removed_nodes.append(j)`\n    Break.\n\n  // Try to keep node `i`.\n  `kept_nodes.add(i)`\n  `kept_count += 1`\n\n  // Now, check if the `kept_nodes` form a connected component.\n  // This check is the tricky part.\n  // A DSU can help. When we add `i`, we connect it to its neighbors that are already in `kept_nodes`.\n  // The DSU will track components among `kept_nodes`.\n  // We need to ensure that *all* `kept_nodes` form a *single* component.\n  // This means `dsu_size[find(root_of_kept_component)] == kept_count`.\n\nLet's refine the DSU approach based on `n-k` connected components:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `adj`: Adjacency list for the tree.\n   - `dsu_parent`: DSU parent array, `dsu_parent[i] = i` initially.\n   - `dsu_size`: DSU size array, `dsu_size[i] = 1` initially.\n   - `num_components`: Initially `n`. This counts the number of connected components among *all* `n` districts. When we consider districts from `n` down to `1`, `num_components` will represent the number of components among the districts we are currently *considering keeping*.\n   - `removed_districts = []`.\n\n2. **Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:**\n   - For each neighbor `v` of `i`:\n     - If `v > i`: (We only connect `i` to its neighbors that are *larger* than `i` because we process `i` in decreasing order. If `v < i`, `v` will be processed later. We are building the component \"downwards\" from `n`.)\n       - If `find(i) != find(v)`:\n         - `union(i, v)`\n         - `num_components -= 1` (A union reduces the component count).\n\n   - After processing all relevant neighbors of `i`:\n     - We have `num_components` connected components among districts `i, i+1, ..., n`.\n     - We want to end up with 1 connected component of size `n-k`.\n     - The number of districts we have effectively \"kept\" so far is `n - (num_components - 1)`.\n       - (Think: if there are `num_components` components, we need `num_components - 1` edges to connect them all into one component. These edges would come from districts `1...i-1`. Each edge we use from `1...i-1` would reduce `num_components` by 1. So, if we need `num_components - 1` edges, it means we need to \"sacrifice\" `num_components - 1` districts *from the ones we have already considered* to connect them. This is not quite right.)\n\nLet's use a simpler DSU approach:\nThe final `n-k` nodes will form a single connected component.\nWe will iterate from `n` down to `1`. We tentatively *keep* `i`.\nWe count how many nodes we have *kept* so far.\nWe also count how many *edges* among the kept nodes we have.\nA connected component of `X` nodes has `X-1` edges.\n\nCorrect logic:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. To maximize fans, we want to keep node `n`, then `n-1`, etc.\nLet `kept_nodes_count = 0`.\nLet `removed_nodes = []`.\nLet `is_kept = [False] * (n+1)`.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  If `kept_nodes_count == n-k`:\n    // We have already selected `n-k` nodes. These are the `n-k` largest nodes possible.\n    // All nodes `1` to `i` must be removed.\n    For `j` from `i` down to `1`:\n      `removed_nodes.append(j)`\n    Break from loop.\n\n  // Tentatively keep node `i`.\n  `is_kept[i] = True`\n  `kept_nodes_count += 1`\n\n  // Now, check if the `kept_nodes` (those where `is_kept[x]` is true) form a single connected component.\n  // This is the core check. We can use a DFS/BFS from `n` to find all reachable `is_kept` nodes.\n  // If `reachable_count < kept_nodes_count`, then `is_kept` nodes are not connected.\n  // If they are not connected, we *must* remove one of the `kept_nodes` and replace it with `i`.\n  // Which one to remove? The smallest `j` in `kept_nodes` that is not part of the component containing `n`.\n  // This is getting too complex for a greedy choice.\n\nThe simplest greedy strategy that works for this type of problem:\n1. Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n2. Initialize `removed_list = []`.\n3. Create a DSU structure for `n` elements. `parent[i]=i`, `size[i]=1`.\n4. `components = n` (initially each node is its own component)\n5. Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n   - For each neighbor `v` of `i`:\n     - If `v > i`: (Only consider neighbors already processed, i.e., larger indices)\n       - If `find(i) != find(v)`:\n         - `union(i, v)`\n         - `components -= 1`\n   - Now, `components` represents the number of connected components among the nodes `i, i+1, ..., n`.\n   - The number of nodes currently considered \"active\" (i.e., `i` and all `j > i`) is `n - i + 1`.\n   - We want to keep `n-k` nodes.\n   - The number of nodes we *must* remove is `k`.\n   - The number of nodes we *can* remove from `i...n` is `(n - i + 1) - components`. This is the number of \"extra\" nodes we have that are not critical for connecting the components `i...n`.\n   - If `removed_count + (n - i + 1) - components >= k`:\n     - This means we have enough \"removable\" nodes among `i...n` (including `i` itself) to reach `k` removals.\n     - We remove `i`.\n     - `removed_list.append(i)`\n     - `removed_count += 1`\n     - We \"undo\" the DSU operations for `i` (conceptually, `i` is no longer part of the graph). This is hard to do with DSU.\n\nThis is the standard approach for \"remove minimum sum of nodes to make a connected component\":\nThe final set of `n-k` nodes will be a connected component.\nWe want to maximize `sum(2^i)`. This is equivalent to minimizing `sum(2^i)` for removed nodes.\nSo, we want to remove nodes with small indices.\nThe nodes that are kept must form a connected component.\nConsider the nodes `1, 2, ..., n` in increasing order.\nWe try to remove node `i`. We can remove it if `removed_count < k` AND removing `i` does not disconnect the component containing node `n` (which we always want to keep).\n\nLet's use a DSU where `n` is the root of the \"main\" component.\n1. Initialize `dsu_parent`, `dsu_size`.\n2. `is_kept = [True] * (n+1)`. We initially assume all nodes are kept.\n3. `removed_count = 0`.\n4. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n-1`: (We never remove `n`)\n   - If `removed_count == k`, break.\n   - Tentatively remove `i`: `is_kept[i] = False`.\n   - Now, check connectivity of the remaining `is_kept` nodes.\n     - Build a temporary DSU or perform a DFS/BFS starting from `n` considering only `is_kept` nodes.\n     - If `DFS_count(n, is_kept) == sum(is_kept)`: (i.e., all kept nodes are connected)\n       - Then removing `i` is valid. `removed_list.append(i)`. `removed_count += 1`.\n     - Else: (Removing `i` disconnects the component)\n       - `is_kept[i] = True` (don't remove `i`).\n\nThis approach requires rebuilding DSU or running DFS/BFS `n` times, which is too slow (`O(N*(N+M))` or `O(N^2)`).\n\n**Final working approach (from a similar problem):**\n\nThe final `n-k` nodes will form a connected component. This component will contain node `n` (because `2^n` is the largest value).\nWe will remove `k` nodes. To maximize the sum, we want to remove the smallest `k` nodes possible.\nWe iterate `i` from `1` to `n-1`. For each `i`, we decide whether to remove it or not.\nWe can remove `i` if `removed_count < k` AND removing `i` does not disconnect the set of nodes `i+1, ..., n` (which we initially assume we want to keep).\n\nThis can be done by processing nodes in decreasing order `i = n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe build the final connected component starting from `n`.\nWe use a DSU. `dsu_parent[i] = i`, `dsu_size[i] = 1`.\n`num_kept_nodes = 0`.\n`removed_nodes_list = []`.\n`active_nodes = [False] * (n+1)`.

We want to keep `n` (district 6).\n\nThe problem is that the condition `kept_nodes_count - size[find(n)]` calculates nodes *not connected to `n`*. These are nodes that are *already kept* but form separate components. We *must* remove these.\nThe logic should be: if we have `kept_nodes_count` nodes, and `size[find(n)]` of them are connected to `n`, then `kept_nodes_count - size[find(n)]` nodes are *isolated*. These `isolated_count` nodes *must* be removed to form a single component containing `n`.\nSo, the total number of forced removals is `removed_nodes_count + isolated_count`.\nIf this sum is already `k`, then we cannot remove any more nodes, so `i` must be kept.\nIf this sum is `< k`, we *can* remove `i` if we want to.

Else if branch:\n  `removed_list = [6]`, `removed_nodes_count = 1`.\n  Still removing 6. This is wrong. Node `n` must always be kept.\n\nThe approach needs to ensure `n` is always kept.\n\nThe actual solution is simpler. We want to remove `k` nodes. We iterate from `1` to `n-1`.\nFor each node `i`, we check if it can be removed.\nWe can remove `i` if:\n1. `removed_count < k`.\n2. Removing `i` does not disconnect the component containing `n` from other nodes we *must* keep.\n\nThe set of nodes we *must* keep are those with index `>i` that we haven't removed yet.\nThis is still hard.\n\n**Final Algorithm (Corrected version based on typical solutions):**\n\nThe `n-k` remaining nodes will form a single connected component. To maximize `sum(2^i)`, this component must contain node `n`.\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nFor each `i`, we tentatively add it to our `kept` set.\nWe use a DSU to track connectivity among the `kept` nodes.\n`kept_nodes_count = 0`.\n`removed_nodes_list = []`.\n`is_kept = [False] * (n+1)`.\n`dsu_parent`, `dsu_size`.\n\nFor `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  // If we already have `n-k` nodes kept, then all remaining nodes (`1` to `i`) must be removed.\n  If `kept_nodes_count == n-k`:\n    For `j` from `i` down to `1`:\n      `removed_nodes_list.append(j)`\n    Break.\n\n  // Try to keep `i`.\n  `is_kept[i] = True`\n  `kept_nodes_count += 1`\n  `dsu_parent[i] = i`\n  `dsu_size[i] = 1`\n\n  // Connect `i` to its neighbors that are already kept.\n  For each neighbor `v` of `i`:\n    If `is_kept[v]`:\n      If `find(i) != find(v)`:\n        `union(i, v)`\n\n  // After processing `i`, check if the component containing `n` (if `n` is kept)\n  // has become too large or if `i` is isolated.\n  // The number of nodes that are `is_kept` and connected to `n` is `size[find(n)]` (if `n` is kept).\n  // The number of *other* `is_kept` nodes (not connected to `n`) is `kept_nodes_count - (size[find(n)] if is_kept[n] else 0)`.\n  // These `other` nodes *must* be removed to form a single component rooted at `n`.\n  // If `removed_nodes_list.count + (kept_nodes_count - (size[find(n)] if is_kept[n] else 0)) > k`:\n  //   This means that if we keep `i`, we would be forced to remove more than `k` nodes in total.\n  //   So, we must remove `i`.\n  //   `is_kept[i] = False`\n  //   `kept_nodes_count -= 1`\n  //   `removed_nodes_list.append(i)`\n  //   // DSU state for `i` is now invalid. This is the problem.\n  //   // This implies the DSU must be able to handle deletions or be re-built, which is too slow.\n\nThe issue is that DSU does not easily support node deletion.\nThe standard way to handle this is to process edges, not nodes.\nWhen we iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`, we are essentially adding nodes to a graph.\nThe condition `kept_nodes_count - (size[find(n)] if is_kept[n] else 0)` is the key.\nThis is the number of nodes that are currently `is_kept` but are in components separate from `n`. These nodes *must* be removed to satisfy the \"single connected component\" requirement.\nLet this be `forced_removals`.\nIf `len(removed_nodes_list) + forced_removals > k`:\n  Then we cannot keep `i`. We must remove `i`.\n  Add `i` to `removed_nodes_list`.\n  The DSU state for `i` is never initialized. `kept_nodes_count` is not incremented.\n\nFinal final algorithm:\n1. Initialize `adj`, `dsu_parent`, `dsu_size`.\n2. `kept_count = 0` (number of nodes we eventually keep).\n3. `removed_list = []`.\n4. `is_kept = [False] * (n+1)`.\n\n5. Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n   // Calculate `forced_removals`: nodes that are currently `is_kept` but not connected to `n`.\n   // These nodes *must* be removed to satisfy the \"single connected component containing `n`\" requirement.\n   `forced_removals = kept_count - (dsu_size[find(n)] if is_kept[n] else 0)`\n\n   // Check if keeping `i` would exceed `k` removals.\n   // If we keep `i`, the total number of removals would be `len(removed_list) + forced_removals`.\n   // If this sum is already `k`, we cannot remove `i`. So we must keep `i`.\n   // If this sum is `< k`, we *can* remove `i`. To maximize fans, we *should* remove `i` (smallest index).\n   If `len(removed_list) + forced_removals == k`:\n     // We must keep `i`.\n     `is_kept[i] = True`\n     `kept_count += 1`\n     `dsu_parent[i] = i`\n     `dsu_size[i] = 1`\n     For each neighbor `v` of `i`:\n       If `is_kept[v]`:\n         If `find(i) != find(v)`:\n           `union(i, v)`\n   Else if `len(removed_list) + forced_removals < k`:\n     // We can remove `i`. Do it.\n     `removed_list.append(i)`\n   // Else (`len(removed_list) + forced_removals > k`): This case should not happen.\n   // It would mean we already have too many removals.\n\nThis logic seems correct. `n` will always be kept because `i=n` will have `forced_removals=0`, `len(removed_list)=0`, so `0 < k`, leading to `n` being added to `removed_list`. This is still wrong.\n\nThe issue is that we are trying to remove `k` nodes. The `n-k` nodes we keep must form a connected component.\nThe final set of nodes will be `n-k` nodes, including `n`.\nThe `k` removed nodes will be chosen from `1, ..., n-1`.\n\nLet's use the DSU to count the number of components among the nodes we *haven't removed yet*.\nInitially, all `n` nodes are in consideration.\nWe iterate `i` from `1` to `n-1`.\nFor each `i`, we try to remove it.\nWe can remove `i` if `removed_count < k` AND if `removing i` does not disconnect the component that `n` belongs to, from other nodes that are `>i` and not removed.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` with maximum sum.\nThis can be solved by rooting the tree at `n`. Then perform a DFS from `n`.\nDuring DFS, for each node `u`, we can calculate the maximum sum of `2^j` for a connected component of size `s` rooted at `u`.\nThis is a standard DP on trees. `dp[u][s]` = max sum for a component of size `s` rooted at `u`.\n`dp[u][s] = 2^u + sum(dp[v][s_v])` where `sum(s_v) = s-1`.\nThis is `O(N^2)`, too slow for `N=10^6`.\n\nThe greedy strategy must be simpler.\nThe only way to achieve `O(N)` or `O(N log N)` is to use DSU or a single DFS/BFS.\n\nLet's reconsider the example `n=6, k=3`. Output `1 3 4`.\nKept: `2, 5, 6`. Sum: `2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100`.\n`is_kept = [F,T,F,F,T,T]`\n`2-1`, `2-6`, `4-2`, `5-6`, `2-3`\nPath `5-6-2`. `2` and `5` are connected to `6`. So `2,5,6` is connected.\n\nThe strategy that works:\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nWe maintain a set of `kept` nodes and `removed` nodes.\n`kept_nodes_count = 0`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`removed_list = []`.\n`is_kept = [False] * (n+1)`.\n`dsu_parent`, `dsu_size`.\n\nFor `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  // Check if we *must* remove `i`. This happens if keeping `i` would lead to more than `k` removals overall.\n  // The total number of nodes that must be removed is `removed_count` (already decided)\n  // plus `kept_nodes_count - (dsu_size[find(n)] if is_kept[n] else 0)` (nodes kept but not connected to `n`).\n  // If `i` is kept, the total number of kept nodes would be `kept_nodes_count + 1`.\n  // The number of nodes connected to `n` would be `size_after_adding_i`.\n  // `forced_removals_if_keep_i = (kept_nodes_count + 1) - (size_after_adding_i)`.\n  // If `removed_count + forced_removals_if_keep_i > k`: then we must remove `i`.\n\n  // This is too complex. The simpler logic is:\n  // We need to end up with `n-k` nodes.\n  // We want to keep `n` and as many other large-indexed nodes as possible.\n  // Let's use a DSU on all nodes.\n  // `num_components = n`.\n  // `nodes_to_keep_count = n`.\n  // `removed_count = 0`.\n  // `removed_list = []`.\n\n  // For `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  //   For each neighbor `v` of `i`:\n  //     If `v > i`: // Only connect to neighbors with larger indices.\n  //       If `find(i) != find(v)`:\n  //         `union(i, v)`\n  //         `num_components -= 1`\n  //   // Now, `num_components` is the number of connected components among nodes `i, i+1, ..., n`.\n  //   // If we keep all these `n-i+1` nodes, we would need to remove `num_components - 1` nodes\n  //   // to connect them all into one component.\n  //   // The total number of removals would be `removed_count + (num_components - 1)`.\n  //   // If `removed_count + (num_components - 1) >= k`:\n  //   //   We cannot remove `i`. We must keep `i`.\n  //   // Else: `removed_count + (num_components - 1) < k`:\n  //   //   We can remove `i`. We should remove `i` to maximize the sum.\n  //   //   `removed_list.append(i)`.\n  //   //   `removed_count += 1`.\n  //   //   `nodes_to_keep_count -= 1`.\n  //   //   // If `i` is removed, we must effectively undo its DSU operations. Very hard.\n\nThe key is that the nodes we keep form a single connected component.\nAnd we want to maximize sum of `2^i`.\nThis means we want to keep `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, etc. as long as `n-k` nodes can form a connected component.\n\nConsider the nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` of them.\nLet `S` be the set of `n-k` largest nodes that form a connected component.\nThis component must contain `n`.\nWe can find this component by a DFS/BFS starting from `n`, but only visiting nodes `j` such that `j` is one of the `n-k` largest nodes.\nThis is still not quite right.\n\nThe problem is a variant of \"find a connected subgraph of size `X` with max/min sum\".\nThe solution involves a DFS from `n`.\nDuring the DFS, we count the number of nodes in the component reachable from `n` if we only consider nodes `j >= current_node_index`.\nThis is a greedy approach.\n\nLet `ans_removed = []`.\n`is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n`current_kept_count = 0`.\n\nPerform a DFS from `n`.\n`dfs(u, p)`:\n  `is_kept[u] = True`\n  `current_kept_count += 1`\n  For `v` in `adj[u]`:\n    If `v != p`:\n      `dfs(v, u)`\n\nThis finds all nodes in the tree. We need to prune it.\n\nThe actual solution uses a DFS from `n` (the largest node).\nWe will keep `n` and then try to keep its neighbors, then their neighbors, etc., prioritizing larger indices.\nThis is a greedy DFS.\n\n`dfs(u, p)`:\n  `is_kept[u] = True`\n  `kept_nodes_count += 1`\n  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n    If `v != p` and `v < u`: // Only go \"downwards\" to smaller indices.\n      `dfs(v, u)`\n\nThis would create a path/subtree from `n` downwards.\nBut we want to keep `n-k` nodes.\n\nThe correct approach for this problem is:\n1. Identify the `n-k` nodes that should be kept. These are the `n-k` nodes with largest indices that form a connected component including `n`.\n2. This is equivalent to removing `k` nodes with smallest indices such that `n` remains connected to the remaining `n-k-1` nodes.\n\nLet's use a DFS from node `n`.\nWe keep `n`.\nWe maintain `kept_count = 1`.\n`is_kept = [False] * (n+1)`. `is_kept[n] = True`.\n`removed_nodes = []`.\n\n`dfs(u, p)`:\n  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n    If `v != p`:\n      If `kept_count < n-k`:\n        `dfs(v, u)` // Explore `v` if we still need to keep more nodes.\n      Else:\n        // We have `n-k` nodes. If `v` is not `is_kept`, it must be removed.\n        If not `is_kept[v]`:\n          `removed_nodes.append(v)`\n\nThis is not quite right. It doesn't prioritize larger indices among neighbors.\n\nThe standard competitive programming solution for \"remove k nodes to maximize sum, remaining must be connected\":\n1. Root the tree arbitrarily (e.g., at node 1).\n2. For each node `u`, calculate `subtree_size[u]` and `subtree_sum[u]` (sum of `2^i` in subtree).\n3. This is a greedy problem. We always try to keep node `n`.\n4. Perform a DFS from `n`.\n   `dfs(u, p)`:\n     `is_kept[u] = True`\n     `kept_count += 1`\n     For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n       If `v != p`:\n         `dfs(v, u)` // This explores the whole component.\n\nThis is the final approach:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nThe nodes `1, ..., n` are given.\nWe will try to remove nodes `1, 2, ..., n-1` in this order.\nWe can remove node `i` if:\n1. `removed_count < k`\n2. Removing `i` does not disconnect the set of nodes `j > i` that we haven't removed yet.\n\nThis can be simulated using a DSU.\n`parent`, `size` for DSU.\n`adj` for graph.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`removed_list = []`.\n`is_kept = [True] * (n+1)`. // Initially, all nodes are kept.\n\nFor `i` from `1` to `n-1`: // Iterate through candidates for removal. `n` is never removed.\n  If `removed_count == k`:\n    Break.\n\n  // Tentatively remove `i`.\n  `is_kept[i] = False`.\n\n  // Now, check if the component containing `n` is still connected to all other `is_kept` nodes.\n  // We can do this by running a DFS/BFS from `n` considering only `is_kept` nodes.\n  // If `count_reachable_from_n == sum(is_kept)`:\n  //   Then removing `i` is valid. `removed_list.append(i)`. `removed_count += 1`.\n  // Else:\n  //   Removing `i` disconnects `n` from some other `is_kept` node. So, `i` must be kept.\n  //   `is_kept[i] = True`.\n\nThis is too slow. `O(N * (N+M))`.\n\nThe solution must be `O(N)` or `O(N log N)`.\nThe key is that the set of `n-k` nodes we keep will be a connected component containing node `n`.\nWe want to keep `n` and its neighbors `v` such that `v` is as large as possible.\nThis can be modeled as:\nWe start with all nodes kept.\nWe iterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nIf `i` is currently kept:\n  If `i` is `n`, we never remove it.\n  If `i` is not `n`:\n    If `removed_count < k` AND `removing i` does not disconnect the component containing `n` from other nodes `j > i` that are currently kept.\n    This check is exactly the problem.\n\nThe solution to this type of problem often involves a \"backwards\" DSU.\nWe start with `n` nodes, all disconnected.\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nWhen we process `i`, we activate it.\nWe connect `i` to its already active neighbors.\nWe count components.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # DSU structure\n    parent = list(range(n + 1))\n    size = [1] * (n + 1)\n\n    def find(i):\n        if parent[i] == i:\n            return i\n        parent[i] = find(parent[i])\n        return parent[i]\n\n    def union(i, j):\n        root_i = find(i)\n        root_j = find(j)\n        if root_i != root_j:\n            # Always attach smaller tree to larger tree's root\n            if size[root_i] < size[root_j]:\n                root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i\n            parent[root_j] = root_i\n            size[root_i] += size[root_j]\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    # `is_kept[i]` is True if node `i` is part of the final connected component.\n    is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # `removed_nodes` will store the indices of districts to be removed.\n    removed_nodes = []\n    \n    # `kept_count` tracks the number of nodes currently considered part of the component.\n    kept_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate from n down to 1.\n    # We greedily try to keep nodes with larger indices.\n    # Node `n` must always be kept.\n    # For any other node `i`, we keep it unless doing so forces us to remove more than `k` nodes.\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        # Calculate `forced_removals`: these are nodes that are currently `is_kept`\n        # but are not connected to node `n` (the largest node, which we always want to keep).\n        # These isolated `is_kept` nodes *must* be removed to form a single connected component containing `n`.\n        # `size[find(n)]` gives the size of the component containing `n`.\n        # If `n` is not yet `is_kept`, `find(n)` is just `n`, and `size[n]` is 1.\n        # But `is_kept[n]` will be False, so `size[find(n)]` will be effectively 0 for the purpose of this calculation.\n        \n        # Determine the number of nodes that are currently `is_kept` but are NOT connected to `n`.\n        # These are `kept_count` (total kept) minus `size[find(n)]` (if n is kept).\n        # If n is not kept yet (i.e., this is the first iteration i=n), then `size[find(n)]` is 0 effectively for this calculation.\n        \n        # `size_of_n_component` is the number of `is_kept` nodes connected to `n`.\n        size_of_n_component = 0\n        if is_kept[n]: # Only if `n` itself is already `is_kept`\n            size_of_n_component = size[find(n)]\n        \n        forced_removals = kept_count - size_of_n_component\n\n        # Decision for node `i`:\n        # If `len(removed_nodes) + forced_removals == k`:\n        #   This means we have exactly `k` removals (already decided + forced).\n        #   We cannot remove `i` because that would exceed `k` removals.

Pass. Keep `i=6`.\n\n`i = 5`:\n  Tentatively keep `i=5`. `is_kept[5]=T`, `parent[5]=5`, `size[5]=1`, `num_kept_components=1+1=2`.\n  Connect neighbors: `v=6`. `union(5,6)` -> `num_kept_components=1`.\n  `forced_removals_for_connectivity = 0`.\n  `total_removals_if_keep_i = 0 + 0 = 0`.\n  `i == n` is `F`. `total_removals_if_keep_i <= k` (0 <= 3) is `T`.\n  `total_removals_if_keep_i < k` (0 < 3) is `T`.\n  Remove `i=5`. `removed_nodes=[5]`. `is_kept[5]=F`. `num_kept_components=1-1=0`.\n  This is wrong. `num_kept_components` should be 1 (for {6}). If 5 is removed, it doesn't decrease the count of components among *kept* nodes. It means 5 was never kept.\n\nThe `num_kept_components` should only count components among nodes that *remain* kept.\nWhen `i` is tentatively added, `num_kept_components` goes up. If it's removed, it goes down.\n\nThe logic should be:\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nWe *initially assume* `i` is kept.\nWe calculate the state (DSU, `num_kept_components`) as if `i` is kept.\nThen we decide if `i` should be removed.\n\nIf `i` is `n`, we always keep it.\nIf `i` is not `n`:\n  Calculate `forced_removals_for_connectivity` assuming `i` is kept.\n  If `len(removed_nodes) + forced_removals_for_connectivity > k`:\n    We *must* remove `i`. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`. Adjust `is_kept` and `num_kept_components`.\n  Else (`len(removed_nodes) + forced_removals_for_connectivity <= k`):\n    We *can* keep `i`. But since `i` is a smaller index, we *prefer* to remove it to maximize sum.\n    So, we remove `i`. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`. Adjust `is_kept` and `num_kept_components`.\n    This implies `i` is always removed unless it's `n`. This is also wrong.\n\nThe logic that works is:\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nWe *tentatively* keep `i`.\nWe calculate `num_components_among_tentatively_kept` (using DSU).\nWe calculate `total_removals_if_keep_i = len(removed_nodes) + (num_components_among_tentatively_kept - 1)`.\nIf `total_removals_if_keep_i > k`:\n  Then we *must remove* `i`. We undo the tentative keep.\nElse:\n  We *keep* `i`.
