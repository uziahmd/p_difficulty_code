He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got for this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem.  The goal is to maximize the total \"profit\" from solving a set of programming problems over a number of days, where profit for a day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. We need to split the problems into contiguous sequences for each day.\n\nThe core idea is to realize that to maximize the total profit (the sum of daily maximum difficulties), we should try to make those daily maximums as large as possible.  My intuition tells me that the absolute *largest* problems in the input list should be the daily maximums.\n\nSo, the first step is to identify the *k* largest difficulty problems.  I can do this by sorting the difficulties and grabbing the top *k*. Their sum will be the maximum possible profit.\n\nThe tricky part is how to *distribute* these *k* largest problems to the *k* days to realize this maximum profit. I've realized these k problems must be the maximum value in each day's segment to achieve the optimal sum.\n\nTo ensure that, I need to make the segment include a problem from the largest problems so that it would be the max. Then, I decided I will place cut points at k-1 indices, one after each chosen maximum difficulty, and assign these indices to define the segments to keep the value as the maximum. This makes sure that the total length of the segments sums up to *n*.\n\nSo, my strategy is:\n1.  Find the *k* largest difficulty problems and their *original* indices.\n2.  Sort these indices.\n3.  Each segment must include one problem from the k largest and those sorted indices should be placed at the right of the segment\n4.  Calculate segment lengths based on these indices: ( p\\_0 + 1, p\\_1 - p\\_0, .... n - p\\_{k-1})\n\nThis is a valid distribution, as each largest problem is in one of the segments, and each value is the max.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to distribute `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous sequences (days). Each day must solve at least one problem, and all `n` problems must be solved. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We want to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of daily profits. We need to output the maximum total profit and the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**1. Maximizing Total Profit**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` maximums, we should choose the largest possible values for these maximums. The absolute maximum profit we can achieve for any single day is the largest problem difficulty in the entire list `a`. If we select `k` problems from the list `a` to be the \"pivot\" problems that determine the profit for each day, these `k` problems should be the `k` largest difficulties overall.\n\nLet `M_1 >= M_2 >= ... >= M_k` be the `k` largest difficulties in the list `a`.\nAny valid distribution of problems into `k` days will result in `k` daily profits, say `P_1, P_2, ..., P_k`. Each `P_j` must be some `a_i` from the original list. The sum `sum(P_j)` cannot exceed the sum `sum(M_j)`. This is because the set `{P_1, ..., P_k}` contains `k` problem difficulties, and the sum of any `k` problem difficulties cannot be greater than the sum of the `k` largest difficulties.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible total profit is the sum of the `k` largest difficulties in the list `a`.\n\n**2. Determining Problem Distribution**\n\nOnce we have identified the `k` largest difficulties, say `a[p_0], a[p_1], ..., a[p_{k-1}]` where `p_0 < p_1 < ... < p_{k-1}` are their original indices in the list `a`, we need to partition the `n` problems into `k` segments such that each of these `k` problems falls into a different segment, and it becomes the maximum for its segment.\n\nA simple strategy to achieve this is to make `k-1` cuts in the problem list. These cuts will define the boundaries between the `k` days. To ensure that each of the `k` chosen problems `a[p_i]` becomes the maximum of its respective day's segment, we can define the segments such that:\n*   `a[p_0]` is in the first segment.\n*   `a[p_1]` is in the second segment.\n*   ...\n*   `a[p_{k-1}]` is in the `k`-th segment.\n\nWe can achieve this by placing the `k-1` cuts immediately after `p_0`, `p_1`, ..., `p_{k-2}`. The last segment will then naturally extend from `p_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`. However, this is not quite right as it doesn't ensure *all* problems are covered.\n\nA more robust approach for determining the segment lengths:\n1.  Identify the `k` largest difficulties and their original indices. Let these indices be `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}` after sorting them in ascending order.\n2.  These `k` indices `p_0, ..., p_{k-1}` represent the locations of the \"pivot\" problems. Each `p_i` must belong to a different day's segment.\n3.  We need to make `k-1` cuts. The most straightforward way to ensure all problems are covered and each `p_i` is in its own segment is to make cuts *after* `k-1` of these `p_i` indices. Specifically, we can make cuts after `p_0`, `p_1`, ..., `p_{k-2}`. The last segment will then automatically encompass `p_{k-1}` and all subsequent problems up to `n-1`.\n\nLet `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}` be the sorted original indices of the `k` largest problems.\nThe `k-1` cut points (end indices of segments) will be `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}`.\nThe lengths `t_j` for each day `j` will be:\n*   Day 1: Problems from index `0` to `p_0`. Length `t_1 = p_0 + 1`.\n*   Day 2: Problems from index `p_0 + 1` to `p_1`. Length `t_2 = p_1 - p_0`.\n*   ...\n*   Day `k-1`: Problems from index `p_{k-3} + 1` to `p_{k-2}`. Length `t_{k-1} = p_{k-2} - p_{k-3}`.\n*   Day `k`: Problems from index `p_{k-2} + 1` to `n-1`. Length `t_k = n - (p_{k-2} + 1)`.\n\nLet's re-verify the example: `n = 8, k = 3`, `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n1.  The `k=3` largest difficulties are `9` (index 6), `6` (index 3), `5` (index 0).\n2.  Maximum total profit: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n3.  Sorted original indices of these problems: `p = [0, 3, 6]`. So `p_0 = 0, p_1 = 3, p_2 = 6`.\n4.  We need `k-1 = 2` cuts. These cuts will be after `p_0` and `p_1`.\n    *   `t_1 = p_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. (Problems `a[0]`)\n    *   `t_2 = p_1 - p_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`. (Problems `a[1], a[2], a[3]`)\n    *   `t_3 = n - (p_1 + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`. (Problems `a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]`)\n5.  The segment lengths are `[1, 3, 4]`.\n    *   Day 1: `[5]`. Max = 5.\n    *   Day 2: `[4, 2, 6]`. Max = 6.\n    *   Day 3: `[5, 1, 9, 2]`. Max = 9.\n    *   Total profit: `5 + 6 + 9 = 20`.\n    *   Total problems: `1 + 3 + 4 = 8`. All conditions met.\n\nThis strategy works and guarantees that `a[p_i]` will be the maximum in its segment, because all other problems `a_x` not among the `k` largest values are smaller than or equal to at least one of the `a[p_j]` values. Since each `a[p_i]` is placed in a distinct segment, and the segments are formed by making cuts at the `p_i`s, no `a_x` that is larger than `a[p_i]` can be in the same segment as `a[p_i]` without also being one of the `k` largest values, which would contradict the distinct segment assignment.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the list `a` of difficulties.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems: `indexed_a = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`.\n4.  Sort `indexed_a` in descending order based on difficulty.\n5.  Calculate `max_profit` by summing the difficulties of the first `k` elements in the sorted `indexed_a`.\n6.  Extract the original indices of these `k` problems: `chosen_indices = [indexed_a[i][1] for i in range(k)]`.\n7.  Sort `chosen_indices` in ascending order.\n8.  Initialize `segment_lengths = []`.\n9.  Initialize `last_cut_index = -1`.\n10. Iterate `i` from `0` to `k-2`:\n    *   The current segment ends at `chosen_indices[i]`.\n    *   The length of this segment is `chosen_indices[i] - last_cut_index`.\n    *   Add this length to `segment_lengths`.\n    *   Update `last_cut_index = chosen_indices[i]`.\n11. The last segment covers problems from `last_cut_index + 1` to `n-1`.\n    *   Its length is `n - (last_cut_index + 1)`.\n    *   Add this length to `segment_lengths`.\n12. Print `max_profit`.\n13. Print `segment_lengths` joined by spaces.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (using the refined algorithm steps):**\n`n = 8, k = 3`, `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  `indexed_a = [(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  Sorted `indexed_a` (descending by difficulty): `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3.  `max_profit = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n4.  `chosen_indices = [6, 3, 0]` (from `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`)\n5.  Sorted `chosen_indices = [0, 3, 6]`. Let's call these `p_0=0, p_1=3, p_2=6`.\n6.  `segment_lengths = []`\n7.  `last_cut_index = -1`\n\n8.  Loop `i` from `0` to `k-2=1`:\n    *   `i = 0`:\n        *   `current_segment_end_index = chosen_indices[0] = 0`.\n        *   `length = current_segment_end_index - last_cut_index = 0 - (-1) = 1`.\n        *   `segment_lengths = [1]`.\n        *   `last_cut_index = 0`.\n    *   `i = 1`:\n        *   `current_segment_end_index = chosen_indices[1] = 3`.\n        *   `length = current_segment_end_index - last_cut_index = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n        *   `segment_lengths = [1, 3]`.\n        *   `last_cut_index = 3`.\n\n9.  After loop (for the last segment):\n    *   `length = n - (last_cut_index + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 8 - 4 = 4`.\n    *   `segment_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\n10. Print `20`.\n11. Print `1 3 4`.
