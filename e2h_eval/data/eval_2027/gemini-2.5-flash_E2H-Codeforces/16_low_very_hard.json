Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Crazy Town Problem: A Graph Traversal in Disguise**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. They want a Python script for this \"Crazy Town\" problem. It's essentially a graph traversal problem masked as a geometric one. I'm given home and university coordinates, the equations of `n` roads, and I need to figure out the *minimum* number of road crossings to get from home to the university.\n\n**Initial Thoughts and Constraints:**\n\nThe input's clear: home, university, and the roads. The key here is that the roads are lines, not line *segments* explicitly, which is crucial.  The constraints are fairly standard for these competitive problems: `n` up to 300, and coordinate/coefficient ranges are within `[-10^6, 10^6]`.\n\n**Geometric Insight and Algorithm Strategy:**\n\nThe core concept is that these roads are dividers.  They split the plane into regions, and moving between regions means crossing a road. The problem boils down to determining which roads form a \"barrier\" between the home and university regions.\n\nA line `ax + by + c = 0` splits the plane into two half-planes.  I can evaluate `ax + by + c` for any point: a positive value means one side, a negative value means the other, and zero means it's on the line itself (which is impossible, by the problem's guarantee).  Since home and university can't lie on a road, I can check the sign of the expression for each road.\n\nHere's the key: if the signs of `ax + by + c` are *different* for the home and university points *for a given road*, it means they're on opposite sides, and that road *must* be crossed. If the signs are the *same*, the road doesn't separate them, and that's the insight! So, computing the product of the two evaluations and checking the sign is essential to determine road crossings.\n\nI can simplify this further: if the product is negative, that road contributes to a crossing; if the product is positive, it doesn't.\n\n**Algorithm Design:**\n\nThis directly suggests an algorithm.  For each of the `n` roads, I calculate the product of the two point's evaluations with respect to that road:\n1.  Evaluate `a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i` and `a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i` for each road.\n2.  If their product is negative, increment a counter.\n3.  The final counter represents the minimum number of road crossings.\n\nThere's no need for graph traversal algorithms (like BFS or DFS) since each road crossing is independent of another. This can be solved in O(n) time and O(1) space, since I can just keep track of the count. The implementation should be straightforward.\n",
