They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The \"Playoff\" Problem: Deconstructing and Solving**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem called \"Playoff,\" and it's a doozy. It's all about a tournament with 2^n teams, each with a unique skill level. My goal is to find all the possible starting skill levels that can lead a team to victory, given a specific sequence of game outcomes (represented by the string 's').\n\nHere's how I'm thinking about it: the tournament structure dictates that a team needs to win 'n' games in a row. Now, the string 's' is the key here. It tells me whether a game favors the lower skill or the higher skill. For example, if s[i] is '0', the team with the lower skill wins. If s[i] is '1', the higher skill wins. To win, a team with skill 'X' has to win 'n' games.\n\nThe challenge is to find those values of 'X' for which a winning scenario *exists*. My intuition is that this is related to how the '0' and '1' outcomes in 's' affect which teams can advance. If there are many '0's, a low-skill team can still win. If there are many '1's, a high-skill team is more likely.\n\nI figured that any winning skill 'X' needs to outplay teams with skills that are smaller and larger than 'X'. Each game has a \"bracket\" of teams.  The key is that for a team with skill 'X' to win it needs to have enough possible skills below 'X' to beat in the rounds with '1' and above 'X' to beat in rounds with '0'.\n\nLet's assume there are 'k0' zeros and 'k1' ones in the string 's'. For a team to win, it will need to win at least 'k1' rounds where higher skill wins, and at least 'k0' rounds where the lower skill wins.\n\nMy first thought was that a winning skill 'X' has to be at least 'k1+1'. I was convinced that for the minimum skill I just need enough skills below to lose to and for the maximum skill, enough above to win with. And then the winning interval should be $[k_1 + 1, 2^n - k_0]$. However, after reviewing, this is clearly flawed. This means that teams' sub-tournaments also matter. I have to assign not only valid skill values to the opponents, but also make sure that the opponents win enough previous sub-tournaments to reach the game where the team with skill 'X' plays against it.\n\nMy new insight is that the opponents of 'X' can win in sub-tournaments, and these opponents' skills determine the win condition for team 'X'. I figured that for all possible starting values to win I can build a permutation to satisfy the constraints. The key is in arranging the skills within the brackets of the games that skill 'X' has to play, so I just need to find all possible starting values such that I can assign the opponents to win the games the correct skill.\n\nFrom this, the condition becomes: the number of values lower than 'X' (used by opponents in stages where '1' is in 's'), must be at least 'k1', and the number of values larger than 'X' (used by opponents where '0' is in 's') must be at least 'k0'.\nThis suggests the winning skills form a contiguous range. I think I'm on the right track now. So, I need to come up with a Python script to iterate through the possible ranges and check them, as this means to try permutations. But, I am pretty sure I will get to the right solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) such that it's possible for a team with skill $x$ to win a playoff tournament. We are given $n$, the number of phases, and a string $s$ of length $n$ describing the rules for each phase. If $s_i = '0'$, the lower-skilled team wins in phase $i$. If $s_i = '1'$, the higher-skilled team wins in phase $i$.\n\nLet $k_0$ be the count of '0's in the string $s$, and $k_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$. Note that $k_0 + k_1 = n$.\n\nA team must win $n$ games to become the champion. Let's consider a team with skill $X$ that wins the tournament.\nIn each of the $n$ games it plays, it faces an opponent. Let $O_j$ be the skill of the opponent in the $j$-th game.\n- For the $k_0$ games where $s_j = '0'$, $X$ must win by having a lower skill. This means $X < O_j$.\n- For the $k_1$ games where $s_j = '1'$, $X$ must win by having a higher skill. This means $X > O_j$.\n\nThe key insight is that we can choose the permutation $p$ of skill levels. This gives us maximum flexibility to assign skills to teams to make $X$ win. The opponents $O_j$ must have skill values that are distinct from $X$ and from each other.\n\nConsider the skills needed for $X$ to win:\n1. $X$ itself.\n2. $k_1$ distinct skills $P_{low,1}, \\dots, P_{low,k_1}$ such that $P_{low,j} < X$. These are the skills of opponents $X$ beats in '1'-phases.\n3. $k_0$ distinct skills $P_{high,1}, \\dots, P_{high,k_0}$ such that $P_{high,j} > X$. These are the skills of opponents $X$ beats in '0'-phases.\n\nThese $k_1$ low skills, $k_0$ high skills, and $X$ itself must all be distinct.\nThe total number of skills involved is $1 + k_1 + k_0 = 1 + n$.\n\nTo minimize $X$, we want $X$ to be as small as possible.\nFor the $k_1$ opponents $P_{low,j}$, we need $k_1$ skills smaller than $X$. To make $X$ minimal, we should pick the largest possible skills for these opponents, i.e., $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-k_1$. This means we need $X-k_1 \\ge 1$, or $X \\ge k_1+1$.\nFor the $k_0$ opponents $P_{high,j}$, we need $k_0$ skills greater than $X$. To make $X$ minimal, these opponents should be as large as possible. The smallest available skill greater than $X$ that is not among $P_{low,j}$ is $X+1$. But we can use any skills from $X+1, \\dots, 2^n$. The critical observation is that the maximum skill value available for any team is $2^n$. We need $k_0$ skills greater than $X$. The highest $k_0$ skills are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$. $X$ must be less than all of them. So $X \\le 2^n-k_0$.\n\nCombining these, the range of possible winning skills $X$ is initially $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\nLet $L = k_1+1$ and $R = 2^n-k_0$.\n\nLet's test this with the examples:\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$: $k_0=1, k_1=2$.\n   $L = 2+1 = 3$.\n   $R = 2^3 - 1 = 8-1 = 7$.\n   Predicted range: $[3, 7]$. Output: $4, 5, 6, 7$. (My $L$ is too small by 1)\n\n2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$: $k_0=0, k_1=1$.\n   $L = 1+1 = 2$.\n   $R = 2^1 - 0 = 2$.\n   Predicted range: $[2, 2]$. Output: $2$. (Matches)\n\n3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$: $k_0=1, k_1=1$.\n   $L = 1+1 = 2$.\n   $R = 2^2 - 1 = 4-1 = 3$.\n   Predicted range: $[2, 3]$. Output: $2, 3$. (Matches)\n\nThe discrepancy in example 1 suggests that my initial reasoning for $L$ might be missing something.\nThe crucial detail is that the opponents are not just *any* skills; they are *winners* of sub-tournaments. However, since we can choose the entire permutation $p$, we can assign skills to teams in the sub-tournaments such that the required opponent skill wins its way to the match against $X$.\n\nThe key is to realize that the values $1, \\dots, k_1$ can be assigned to teams that will eventually be beaten by $X$ in '1'-phases. For any $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k_1\\}$, we can assign skill $j$ to one of the teams that $X$ will face in a '1'-phase. If $j$ is assigned to an opponent $O$, we can construct $O$'s sub-tournament such that $O$ wins with skill $j$. For example, if all rules for $O$'s sub-tournament are '0', then skill $j$ can win its sub-tournament if its initial opponent has skill $>j$, and its next opponent has skill $>j$, etc. This is always possible since there are $2^n$ skills in total.\nSimilarly, for the $k_0$ opponents $P_{high,j}$, we can assign skills $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$ to them. A skill $j$ in this range can win its sub-tournament if all rules in its path are '1', and its initial opponent has skill $<j$, etc. This is also always possible.\n\nTherefore, the condition $X \\ge k_1+1$ implies that there are at least $k_1$ skills available below $X$ (namely $1, \\dots, k_1$) to be used as opponents for $X$ in '1'-phases.\nThe condition $X \\le 2^n-k_0$ implies that there are at least $k_0$ skills available above $X$ (namely $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$) to be used as opponents for $X$ in '0'-phases.\n\nSo the minimum winning skill is $k_1+1$ and the maximum winning skill is $2^n-k_0$.\nThe problem asks for $X$ to be a winning integer if it's possible to find *a* permutation $p$.\nWith the flexibility of choosing $p$, we can ensure that the $k_1$ skills $1, \\dots, k_1$ are assigned to teams that become the opponents of $X$ in '1'-phases. Similarly for $k_0$ skills $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$. The remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skills are assigned to other teams arbitrarily.\n\nThe range of winning skills is $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\nThe example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is $4, 5, 6, 7$. This corresponds to $[k_1+2, 2^n-k_0]$.\nThis means $L$ should be $k_1+2$. Why?\n\nLet's re-examine $n=3, s=\"101\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=2$.\n$X$ must beat 2 opponents $O_1, O_3$ with $X > O_1, X > O_3$.\n$X$ must beat 1 opponent $O_2$ with $X < O_2$.\nThe skills $O_1, O_2, O_3$ must be distinct from $X$ and from each other.\nConsider $X=3$.\nWe need $O_1, O_3 \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. Let $O_1=1, O_3=2$.\nWe need $O_2 \\in \\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$. Let $O_2=4$.\nSkills used: $X=3, O_1=1, O_2=4, O_3=2$. Set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\nRemaining skills: $\\{5,6,7,8\\}$.\n\nNow we must ensure these opponents can actually win their sub-tournaments.\n- $O_1=1$: This is an opponent in phase 1. Team $T_X$ (skill $3$) plays Team $T_{O_1}$ (skill $1$). $s_1='1'$, $3>1$, $3$ wins. This is fine.\n- $O_3=2$: This is an opponent in phase 3. Team $T_X$ (skill $3$) plays $T_{O_3}$ (skill $2$). $s_3='1'$, $3>2$, $3$ wins. This is fine.\n- $O_2=4$: This is an opponent in phase 2. $T_X$ (skill $3$) plays $T_{O_2}$ (skill $4$). $s_2='0'$, $3<4$, $3$ wins. This is fine.\n\nThe catch is that $O_2$ and $O_3$ are winners of sub-tournaments.\n$O_2$ is the winner of a phase 1 game. Let's say $T_{O_2}$ played $T_A$. $s_1='1'$. $O_2$ wins means $O_2 > P_A$. So $4 > P_A$. $P_A$ must be an unused skill. The unused skills are $\\{5,6,7,8\\}$. But $4$ cannot be greater than any of these. This means $P_A$ cannot be chosen from the unused skills. It must be chosen from $\\{1,2,3\\}$ which are already taken by $X, O_1, O_3$. This implies $X=3$ cannot win.\n\nThe actual skills that can be beaten by $X$ in '1'-phases must be skills that can win their way to meet $X$.\nA skill $P_{low}$ that is an opponent in phase $i$ (for $s_i='1'$) must have won $i-1$ games.\nA skill $P_{high}$ that is an opponent in phase $i$ (for $s_i='0'$) must have won $i-1$ games.\n\nThe total number of teams that $X$ needs to eliminate is $n$.\nThe total number of teams in the tournament is $2^n$.\nThe $k_1$ opponents $P_{low,j}$ must have skills chosen from $\\{1, \\dots, X-1\\}$.\nThe $k_0$ opponents $P_{high,j}$ must have skills chosen from $\\{X+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\n\nThe crucial observation is that if $X$ wins by being greater than its opponent $O$ (i.e., $s_i='1'$), then $O$ must be some skill $p < X$. To make $X$ win, we need to assign $p$ to a team that can win its sub-tournament. If we assign $p$ to be one of the smallest skills, say $1$, then for $1$ to win its sub-tournament, all games in that sub-tournament must be $s_j='0'$ (lower skill wins).\nIf $X$ wins by being smaller than its opponent $O$ (i.e., $s_i='0'$), then $O$ must be some skill $p > X$. If we assign $p$ to be one of the largest skills, say $2^n$, then for $2^n$ to win its sub-tournament, all games in that sub-tournament must be $s_j='1'$ (higher skill wins).\n\nThis means the number of skills that are *forced* to be smaller than $X$ is $k_1$. These $k_1$ skills are $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nThe number of skills that are *forced* to be larger than $X$ is $k_0$. These $k_0$ skills are $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$.\n\nThe smallest $k_1$ skills are $\\{1, \\dots, k_1\\}$. If $X$ is to beat any of these in a '1'-phase, then $X$ must be strictly greater than them. So $X$ must be at least $k_1+1$.\nThe largest $k_0$ skills are $\\{2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$. If $X$ is to beat any of these in a '0'-phase, then $X$ must be strictly smaller than them. So $X$ must be at most $2^n-k_0$.\n\nThis logic is correct for the bounds. The examples match this for $n=1,2$.\nThe example $n=3, s=\"101\"$ still suggests $L=k_1+2$.\nMy range is $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\nThe example's range is $[k_1+2, 2^n-k_0]$.\nThis means $X=k_1+1$ is not a winning skill. Why?\n\nConsider $X=k_1+1$. It needs to beat $k_1$ opponents with skills less than $X$. The only skills available are $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nAnd it needs to beat $k_0$ opponents with skills greater than $X$. The skills available are $X+1, \\dots, 2^n$.\nThe issue is that $X$ itself must be available. The $k_1$ skills $1, \\dots, k_1$ are \"used up\" by the opponents that $X$ needs to beat.\nSo if $X=k_1+1$, then $X$ is the $(k_1+1)$-th smallest skill.\nThe skills $1, \\dots, k_1$ are used as opponents.\nThe skills $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$ are used as opponents.\nThe skill $X$ itself is $k_1+1$.\nThe skills $1, \\dots, k_1$ are $k_1$ values.\nThe skills $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$ are $k_0$ values.\nThese two sets of skills are disjoint if $k_1 < 2^n-k_0+1$.\n$k_1+k_0 \\le 2^n$. Since $k_1+k_0=n$, this is $n \\le 2^n$. This is true for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe crucial part is that the $k_1$ smaller skills and $k_0$ larger skills are the *extreme* values.\nIf $X$ has skill $k_1+1$, it needs to beat skills $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nIf $X$ has skill $2^n-k_0$, it needs to beat skills $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$.\n\nThe minimum winning skill is $2^{k_1}$. No, this is not right.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\n\nThe problem statement describes the rules for *each match* in phase $i$. This implies that the rule $s_i$ applies to *all* games in phase $i$, regardless of which sub-tournament they belong to.\n\nThis means that if $X$ is to win, it must satisfy $X < O_j$ for $k_0$ phases and $X > O_j$ for $k_1$ phases.\nThis implies $X$ must be greater than $k_1$ distinct values and less than $k_0$ distinct values.\nThe smallest possible value for $X$ is $k_1+1$. This would mean $X$ is greater than $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nThe largest possible value for $X$ is $2^n-k_0$. This would mean $X$ is less than $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$.\n\nThe number of skills that are *not* $X$ and are smaller than $X$ is $X-1$.\nThe number of skills that are *not* $X$ and are larger than $X$ is $2^n-X$.\nTo make $X$ win, we need to assign $k_1$ distinct values from $\\{1, \\dots, X-1\\}$ to be opponents in '1'-phases.\nWe need to assign $k_0$ distinct values from $\\{X+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$ to be opponents in '0'-phases.\nThis implies $X-1 \\ge k_1$ and $2^n-X \\ge k_0$.\nSo $X \\ge k_1+1$ and $X \\le 2^n-k_0$.\n\nThis logic seems sound and simple. Why does it fail for $n=3, s=\"101\"$?\n$n=3, s=\"101\" \\implies k_0=1, k_1=2$.\nMy range: $[2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nExample output: $[4, 7]$.\n\nThe only way $X=3$ could be excluded is if the values $1, \\dots, k_1$ (which are $1,2$) and $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$ (which is $8$) are not enough to construct a valid tournament.\nThe set of skills needed for $X=3$ to win is $\\{3\\}$, plus $k_1=2$ skills from $\\{1,2\\}$ (e.g., $1,2$), plus $k_0=1$ skill from $\\{4,5,6,7,8\\}$ (e.g., $4$).\nTotal skills used: $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Remaining: $\\{5,6,7,8\\}$.\nThe problem is not about the *number* of skills available, but about the *relative positions* of skills to ensure that opponents can win their sub-tournaments.\n\nIf all $s_i='0'$, then $k_0=n, k_1=0$. Range: $[1, 2^n-n]$.\nIf all $s_i='1'$, then $k_0=0, k_1=n$. Range: $[n+1, 2^n]$.\n\nThe number of '1's ($k_1$) determines the minimum possible skill $X_{min}$.\nThe number of '0's ($k_0$) determines the maximum possible skill $X_{max}$.\nThe minimum skill $X$ must be larger than $k_1$ opponents. The smallest $k_1$ skills are $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nSo $X$ must be at least $k_1+1$.\nThe maximum skill $X$ must be smaller than $k_0$ opponents. The largest $k_0$ skills are $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$.\nSo $X$ must be at most $2^n-k_0$.\n\nThe range of winning skills is $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$. This is the correct range.\nThe example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nMy calculation: $k_1=2, k_0=1$. $X_{min}=2+1=3$, $X_{max}=2^3-1=7$. Range $[3,7]$.\nThe problem statement's example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThis implies $X_{min}$ is $k_1+2$.\n\nThis is a known pattern for these types of problems.\nThe minimum skill that can win is $1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s)$.\nThe maximum skill that can win is $2^n - (\\text{number of '0's in } s)$.\nThis is what I have. But the example suggests a different minimum.\n\nCould it be that the *smallest* skill values $1, \\dots, k_1$ cannot be guaranteed to win their sub-tournaments in a way that makes them opponents for $X$?\nIf $s_i='1'$ for some phase $i$, and $X$ needs to beat $O_i$ in that phase ($X > O_i$), then $O_i$ must be a skill $P_{low} < X$.\nIf $s_i='0'$ for some phase $i$, and $X$ needs to beat $O_i$ in that phase ($X < O_i$), then $O_i$ must be a skill $P_{high} > X$.\n\nLet's assume the problem statement implies a specific structure of sub-tournaments that might limit the skills that can win.\nThe description \"winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\" implies a fixed bracket structure.\nHowever, the problem states \"it is possible to find a permutation $p$\". This means we can assign skills $p_1, \\dots, p_{2^n}$ to teams $1, \\dots, 2^n$ as we wish. The bracket structure is fixed, but the teams $1, \\dots, 2^n$ are just labels for initial slots. We can put any skill into any initial slot.\n\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is $k_1$.\nThe number of '0's in $s$ is $k_0$.\nThe problem appears to be simpler than my overthinking.\nThe minimum winning skill is $1 + k_1$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - k_0$.\nThis is the standard interpretation. The example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ might be slightly off, or there is a very subtle detail missed.\n\nGiven $n \\le 18$, $2^n$ can be up to $2^{18} = 262144$. We just need to print a range of numbers.\n\nLet's stick to the simplest interpretation.\nThe minimum skill $X_{min}$ that can win is $1 + k_1$.\nThe maximum skill $X_{max}$ that can win is $2^n - k_0$.\nThe winning integers are all $X$ such that $X_{min} \\le X \\le X_{max}$.\n\nFinal check for $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$s = \"101\"$. $k_1=2$ (for $s_1='1', s_3='1'$), $k_0=1$ (for $s_2='0'$).\n$X_{min} = 1 + k_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - k_0 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nSo the range is $[3, 7]$.\nThe example output for this case is $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThis means $X_{min}$ is actually $1 + k_1 + 1 = k_1+2$.\nWhy would this be the case?\nIt means that $X=k_1+1$ cannot win.\nIf $X=k_1+1$, then $X$ must beat $k_1$ skills smaller than itself. These must be $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nAnd $X$ must beat $k_0$ skills greater than itself. These must be chosen from $k_1+2, \\dots, 2^n$.\nThe only way $X=k_1+1$ cannot win is if the total number of skills available for opponents is not enough, or if the distribution of $k_0$ and $k_1$ somehow interferes with the ability of $X$ to win.\nBut we can choose $P$. So we can set $P_1=X$, and then fill the rest.\n\nThe problem could be related to the number of teams whose *initial position* are in the same branch as $X$.\nA team plays $n$ games. In each game, it eliminates one team. So it eliminates $n$ teams in total.\nThe $2^n$ teams are partitioned into $2^{n-1}$ pairs.\nThe winner of $T_1$ vs $T_2$ plays winner of $T_3$ vs $T_4$.\nThe team $X$ is assigned to some initial slot $P_j$.\n$X$ needs to eliminate $n$ teams.\nThe $k_1$ teams $X$ beats (where $X > O_j$) must have skills $P_j < X$.\nThe $k_0$ teams $X$ beats (where $X < O_j$) must have skills $P_j > X$.\nThe minimum number of skills that are strictly smaller than $X$ that must exist in the tournament is $k_1$.\nThe minimum number of skills that are strictly larger than $X$ that must exist in the tournament is $k_0$.\nThis is the same logic.\n\nIt is possible that the problem means \"the team with skill $p_i$ is team $i$\".\n\"The skill level of the $i$-th team is $p_i$, where $p$ is a permutation of integers $1, \\dots, 2^n$.\"\n\"team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, and so on\".\nThis means the initial pairings are fixed by team ID.\nHowever, we still choose $p$. So we can assign $p_1=X$, $p_2=O_1$, $p_3=O_2$, etc.\nThis interpretation doesn't change the bounds.\n\nCould it be that the number of '1's in $s$ is $k_1$, and the minimum winning skill is $2^{k_1}$?\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$, $k_1=2$. $2^{k_1} = 2^2=4$. This matches the example.\nWhat about $n=1, s=\"1\"$? $k_1=1$. $2^{k_1}=2^1=2$. Matches.\nWhat about $n=2, s=\"01\"$? $k_1=1$. $2^{k_1}=2^1=2$. Matches.\n\nSo it seems the minimum winning skill is $2^{k_1}$.\nAnd the maximum winning skill is $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\nLet's verify max winning skill:\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$: $k_0=1$. $2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$. Matches.\n$n=1, s=\"1\"$: $k_0=0$. $2^1 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$. Matches.\n$n=2, s=\"01\"$: $k_0=1$. $2^2 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$. Matches.\n\nThis pattern seems to hold for all examples.\nMinimum winning skill: $2^{k_1}$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\n\nLet's try to understand why this would be the case.\nConsider $X_{min}$. $X$ wins $k_1$ games by being maximum.\nTo minimize $X$, we'd want $X$ to be $2^{k_1}$.\nThis means $X$ must be greater than $k_1$ opponents. The skills $1, \\dots, 2^{k_1}-1$ are available.\nThere are $2^{k_1}-1$ skills smaller than $X$.\nIf $X$ has to beat $k_1$ opponents, it needs $k_1$ distinct skills smaller than itself.\nThe smallest $k_1$ skills are $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nThe smallest $2^{k_1}$ skills are $1, \\dots, 2^{k_1}$.\nIf $X=2^{k_1}$, it means it can beat any skill from $1, \\dots, 2^{k_1}-1$.\nThis range has $2^{k_1}-1$ values. We need to select $k_1$ distinct values from this set. This is possible if $2^{k_1}-1 \\ge k_1$. This is true for $k_1 \\ge 1$. If $k_1=0$, $X_{min}=1$. $2^0=1$. So it holds for $k_1=0$ too.\n\nConsider $X_{max}$. $X$ wins $k_0$ games by being minimum.\nTo maximize $X$, we'd want $X$ to be $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\nThis means $X$ must be smaller than $k_0$ opponents. The skills $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 2, \\dots, 2^n$ are available.\nThere are $2^n - (2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1) = 2^{k_0}-1$ skills larger than $X$.\nWe need to select $k_0$ distinct values from this set. This is possible if $2^{k_0}-1 \\ge k_0$. This is true for $k_0 \\ge 1$. If $k_0=0$, $X_{max}=2^n$. $2^n-2^0+1 = 2^n-1+1=2^n$. So it holds for $k_0=0$ too.\n\nSo the range of winning skills is $[2^{k_1}, 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1]$.\nThis range is valid as long as $2^{k_1} \\le 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\n$k_1+k_0 = n$.\n$2^{k_1} + 2^{k_0} - 1 \\le 2^n$.\nThis is always true because $2^x+2^y-1 \\le 2^{x+y}$ is false. Example $x=1, y=1 \\implies 2+2-1=3 \\not\\le 2^2=4$.\nNo, $2^{k_1} + 2^{k_0} - 1 \\le 2^n$ is not the condition.\nThe condition is $2^{k_1} \\le 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$. This means the lower bound is not greater than the upper bound.\nThis is always true. $2^{k_1} \\le 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1 \\iff 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_0} - 1 \\le 2^n$.\nThis inequality is not always true. For $n=1, k_0=1, k_1=0$. $2^0+2^1-1 = 1+2-1=2 \\le 2^1=2$. True.\nFor $n=1, k_0=0, k_1=1$. $2^1+2^0-1 = 2+1-1=2 \\le 2^1=2$. True.\nFor $n=2, k_0=1, k_1=1$. $2^1+2^1-1 = 2+2-1=3 \\le 2^2=4$. True.\nFor $n=3, k_0=1, k_1=2$. $2^2+2^1-1 = 4+2-1=5 \\le 2^3=8$. True.\nThis inequality $2^{k_1} + 2^{k_0} - 1 \\le 2^n$ seems to hold for $k_0+k_1=n$.\nThis is because $2^{k_1} + 2^{k_0} - 1 \\le 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_0} \\le 2^{k_0} \\cdot 2^{k_1} = 2^{k_0+k_1} = 2^n$ is false.\nIt is $2^{k_1} + 2^{k_0} \\le 2 \\cdot \\max(2^{k_1}, 2^{k_0})$.\nThe sum $2^A + 2^B$ is maximized when $A$ and $B$ are $n$ and $0$.\n$2^n + 2^0 - 1 = 2^n$. So $2^n \\le 2^n$. This holds.\nThe range is always valid.\n\nThe solution is to count $k_1$ (number of '1's in $s$) and $k_0$ (number of '0's in $s$).\nThen the winning integers are from $2^{k_1}$ to $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$, inclusive.\n\nExample $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_1 = s.count('1') = 2$.\n$k_0 = s.count('0') = 1$.\n$min\\_win = 2^{k_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n$max\\_win = 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1 = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nOutput: $4, 5, 6, 7$. This perfectly matches the example.\n\nThis formula seems to be the correct one.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    k1 = s.count('1')\n    k0 = s.count('0')\n\n    # The minimum winning skill is 2^k1\n    min_winning_skill = 2**k1\n\n    # The maximum winning skill is 2^n - 2^k0 + 1\n    # 2^n is the total number of skills\n    # 2^k0 is the number of skills that must be strictly greater than X for X to win\n    # The largest 2^k0-1 skills are 2^n, 2^n-1, ..., 2^n - (2^k0-1) + 1\n    # Which means skills from 2^n - 2^k0 + 2 to 2^n\n    # If X is to be smaller than these, X must be at most 2^n - 2^k0 + 1\n    max_total_skill = 2**n\n    max_winning_skill = max_total_skill - (2**k0) + 1\n\n    # Print all winning integers in ascending order\n    result = []\n    for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
