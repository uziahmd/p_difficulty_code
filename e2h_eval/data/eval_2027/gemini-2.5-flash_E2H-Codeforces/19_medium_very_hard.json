The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Goal: A Maximized Sum from a Connected Subgraph**\n\nMy task is to solve a competitive programming problem where I need to choose a connected subset of a tree graph, keeping the sum of 2 raised to the power of each selected district's index as large as possible.  Crucially, I also need to output the *removed* districts, in increasing order. This means I'm essentially finding the smallest indices to exclude to keep things connected.\n\nSince the sum involves powers of 2, higher indices are far more valuable.  My initial thought is to keep nodes with large indices, as many as possible while maintaining a connected structure.  However, this led to a potential issue: I might have to \"sacrifice\" some large-index nodes if their inclusion would require adding a lot of smaller-index nodes to connect them, eating into my total node count. A key observation is that any connected subgraph in a tree must *have* a root, which is helpful.\n\nThis observation made me consider removing nodes rather than selecting them. I decided the most sensible greedy approach is to remove nodes with the smallest indices first, as long as it doesn't disconnect the remaining graph. So, if I can remove `1`, `2`, then `3` and so on, I want to. The strategy became: what are we left with after we remove a node (which still forms a connected subgraph)?\n\nThe best strategy is related to \"peeling off\" leaf nodes. We use a modified \"leaf removal\" algorithm, removing the smallest-index leaf until we have removed `k` nodes, thus ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. We maintain a heap of all the leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1) and repeatedly remove the minimum index element from the heap. Then we check all its neighbors, reducing the degree of each neighbor and adding any new leaves to the queue. After we removed the `k` nodes, we are left with the nodes.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts that form a connected component in a given tree, such that the sum of fans `2^i` for the selected districts `i` is maximized. We need to output the `k` districts that are *removed*, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly. Specifically, `2^i > sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^j = 2^i - 1`. This means that to maximize the total sum of fans, we should always prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. Conversely, to minimize the loss of fans, we should prioritize removing districts with smaller indices.\n\nThe problem can be rephrased as: remove `k` districts such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and the sum of `2^i` for the removed districts is minimized. This is equivalent to maximizing the sum for the kept districts.\n\nA standard approach for finding a connected subgraph of a certain size in a tree, while optimizing for node properties, is the \"leaf removal\" algorithm. We want to remove `k` nodes. To minimize the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes, we should remove nodes with the smallest possible indices.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. **Initialize Degrees and Adjacency List**: Build an adjacency list `adj` for the tree and an array `degrees` storing the current degree of each node.\n2. **Identify Initial Leaves**: Initialize a min-priority queue `heap` with all nodes `i` that have `degrees[i] == 1` (i.e., they are leaves).\n3. **Iterative Removal**:\n   Maintain a set `removed_nodes_set` to store the indices of districts that have been removed.\n   While the number of removed districts (`len(removed_nodes_set)`) is less than `k` and the `heap` is not empty:\n     a. Extract the node `u` with the smallest index from `heap`.\n     b. **Validation**: Check if `u` is still a valid leaf to remove. A node might have been added to the heap when it was a leaf, but later its only neighbor was also removed (making `u` effectively isolated, or `degrees[u]` becoming 0), or its degree changed due to other removals (though in a tree, degrees only decrease).\n        - If `u` is already in `removed_nodes_set`, skip it.\n        - If `degrees[u]` is not `1`, it means `u` is no longer a leaf in the current graph of kept nodes (it might be 0 if isolated, or >1 if it was a leaf but its neighbor was removed making it effectively disconnected from the component, or its degree was reduced but not to 1). In any of these cases, `u` is not a leaf that can be safely removed by this strategy, so skip it.\n     c. **Remove Node**: If `u` is a valid leaf (not in `removed_nodes_set` and `degrees[u] == 1`):\n        - Add `u` to `removed_nodes_set`.\n        - For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n          - Decrement `degrees[v]`.\n          - If `degrees[v]` becomes `1` and `v` has not been removed yet, add `v` to the `heap`.\n4. **Output**: Convert `removed_nodes_set` to a sorted list and print its elements.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because removing a leaf node does not disconnect the remaining graph. By always choosing the leaf with the smallest index, we ensure that we are removing the \"cheapest\" possible node at each step, thus maximizing the sum of `2^i` for the remaining `n-k` nodes. The process guarantees that the remaining `n-k` nodes will form a connected component (unless `n-k` becomes 0, which is not possible since `k < n`).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n=6, k=3`. We need to remove 3 nodes.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   `adj`: `1:[2], 2:[1,3,4,6], 3:[2], 4:[2], 5:[6], 6:[2,5]`\n   `degrees`: `[0, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2]` (index 0 unused)\n   `removed_nodes_set = {}`\n   `heap = []`\n\n2. **Initial Leaves**:\n   Nodes with degree 1: `1, 3, 4, 5`.\n   `heapq.heappush(heap, 1)`\n   `heapq.heappush(heap, 3)`\n   `heapq.heappush(heap, 4)`\n   `heapq.heappush(heap, 5)`\n   `heap` (min-heap): `[1, 3, 4, 5]`\n\n3. **Iterative Removal**: `k=3`\n\n   - **Step 1**: `len(removed_nodes_set) = 0 < 3`. `heap` is not empty.\n     - `u = heapq.heappop(heap)` -> `1`.\n     - `1` not in `removed_nodes_set`, `degrees[1] == 1`. Valid.\n     - Add `1` to `removed_nodes_set`. `removed_nodes_set = {1}`.\n     - Neighbor of `1`: `v = 2`.\n       - `degrees[2]` becomes `4-1=3`. `degrees[2]` is not `1`. Don't add `2` to `heap`.\n     - `heap = [3, 4, 5]`\n\n   - **Step 2**: `len(removed_nodes_set) = 1 < 3`. `heap` is not empty.\n     - `u = heapq.heappop(heap)` -> `3`.\n     - `3` not in `removed_nodes_set`, `degrees[3] == 1`. Valid.\n     - Add `3` to `removed_nodes_set`. `removed_nodes_set = {1, 3}`.\n     - Neighbor of `3`: `v = 2`.\n       - `degrees[2]` becomes `3-1=2`. `degrees[2]` is not `1`. Don't add `2` to `heap`.\n     - `heap = [4, 5]`\n\n   - **Step 3**: `len(removed_nodes_set) = 2 < 3`. `heap` is not empty.\n     - `u = heapq.heappop(heap)` -> `4`.\n     - `4` not in `removed_nodes_set`, `degrees[4] == 1`. Valid.\n     - Add `4` to `removed_nodes_set`. `removed_nodes_set = {1, 3, 4}`.\n     - Neighbor of `4`: `v = 2`.\n       - `degrees[2]` becomes `2-1=1`. `degrees[2]` IS `1`. Add `2` to `heap`.\n     - `heap = [2, 5]` (or `[5, 2]`, but `2` is smaller).\n\n   - Loop terminates because `len(removed_nodes_set) = 3`, which is `k`.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   `removed_nodes_set = {1, 3, 4}`.\n   Sorted list: `[1, 3, 4]`.\n   Print: `1 3 4`. This matches the sample output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Building adjacency list and degrees: `O(N)` since it's a tree (`N-1` edges).\n- Initializing heap: `O(N log N)` in worst case (if all nodes are leaves, like a star graph where center is connected to N-1 leaves), or `O(N)` if using a bucket queue for indices.\n- Each of the `k` removals:\n    - `heapq.heappop`: `O(log N)`.\n    - Iterating neighbors and `heapq.heappush`: `deg(u)` neighbors, each `O(log N)`. Total `sum(deg(u) log N)` over all removed nodes.\n    - Since `sum(deg(u))` over all nodes `u` is `2(N-1)`, the total time for `k` removals is `O(k log N + sum_{u in removed} deg(u) log N)`. In the worst case, `k` can be `N-1`, and `sum(deg(u))` can be `O(N)`, leading to `O(N log N)`.\n\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `O(N log N)` is acceptable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    degrees = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degrees[u] += 1\n        degrees[v] += 1\n\n    # Min-priority queue to store leaves, ordered by node index\n    # (node_id)\n    heap = []\n\n    # Initialize heap with all initial leaf nodes\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if degrees[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, i)\n        # Handle case n=1 (not possible due to k < n) or isolated nodes (not possible in a tree)\n        # If n > 1 and degrees[i] == 0, it's an isolated node, which shouldn't happen in a connected tree.\n        # If n=1, k=0, then degrees[1]=0.
