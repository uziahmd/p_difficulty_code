The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Gilded Cell Calculation - Thinking Through the Solution**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate.  The input is the plate's width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of gilded rings (`k`).  Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle.  Let's break this down.\n\nThe dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring change.  Specifically, the `i`-th ring is built around a rectangle that's `w - 4(i - 1)` wide and `h - 4(i - 1)` tall.  The width of each ring is just one cell, so the number of gilded cells in a ring is simply the perimeter of this inner rectangle.\n\nLet's think through how to calculate this. I can calculate each ring by iterating through the `k` rings.  For each ring `i`, I need to calculate the dimensions: `current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)` and `current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)`. Then, I'll calculate the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n\nBut, wait... there is a corner case. What if `current_w` or `current_h` becomes less than 1? The problem definition implies that the rings cannot overlap or extend beyond the boundaries. The problem states that `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)` which should prevent that situation. That constraint ensures that the inner rectangle always has at least one cell on both sides.\n\nSo, I think I'm good. I can iterate from 1 to `k`, calculating the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, calculating the perimeter, and then summing up these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells. I'll need to double-check my perimeter formula for edge cases, but I think that is it. It seems straightforward. Let's do this.\n",
