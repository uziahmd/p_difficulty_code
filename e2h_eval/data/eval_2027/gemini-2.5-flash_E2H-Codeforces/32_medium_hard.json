    "thought": "**My Problem-Solving Journey**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  First, I've got to understand the core mechanics: we have an array of integers, and the instability is simply the difference between the largest and smallest elements. The goal is to minimize this instability by removing *exactly one* element.  We're looking for the minimum possible instability that can be achieved.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the edge cases immediately, and how the min-max dynamic will change when an element is removed. The constraints tell me the array size can be large, up to 10^5, and the elements can be up to 10^5, so I need an efficient solution, which tells me I need to stay away from naive O(N^2) approaches.\n\nTo start, let me sort the array. When I've done that, the min and max will be at the beginning and end, respectively.  It's clear to me that removing any element *between* the minimum and maximum value won't minimize the instability, because both min and max still will be present after the removal. So, I see the only sensible removals are the minimum element or the maximum element.  If the input array is sorted: Removing the minimum element results in a new minimum, the second smallest value, and the maximum remains. Removing the maximum element results in the original minimum, and a new maximum, the second-largest value.\n\nNow, to make sure it is true for any size of `n`, I've got to consider `n=2`.  If `n=2`, I'll remove either element, and the remaining instability will be 0. So my main logic is always correct.\n\nThus, my approach will be: sort the array, calculate the instability by removing the smallest element, calculate the instability by removing the largest element, and the minimum of these two values is the answer.  This should be efficient because sorting is the main contributor to the time complexity, which is O(N log N).\n\nEdge cases like all the same elements will give 0 instability, and it'll work with the algorithm, it's correct and simple. With all of this, the final code is ready.\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    instability_remove_smallest = a[n-1] - a[1]\n    instability_remove_largest = a[n-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(instability_remove_smallest, instability_remove_largest))\n\nsolve()\n```\n",
