They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Understanding the \"Playoff\" Problem and Winning Integers**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Playoff\" problem. It's a competitive programming challenge. I need a Python script to figure out which teams can *actually* win a tournament.\n\nLet's break it down: we've got $2^n$ teams, each with a unique skill level from 1 to $2^n$. The tournament is structured in rounds, a standard single-elimination setup. The string 's' dictates the rules for each round: '0' means the *lower* skill wins, '1' means the *higher* skill wins. The goal is to identify the \"winning integers\" â€“ the skill levels that *could* lead a team to victory, depending on the initial skill ranking.\n\nI'm thinking, a team must win 'n' consecutive matches to be the champion. In the first phase there are $2^{n-1}$ games, and this value is divided by two each phase. The rule 's[i]' dictates which team wins in that phase.\n\nI need to analyze how the tournament rules, specifically the string 's', affect the possible winning scenarios. It seems that the winning integers are completely defined by the string of $s$ value, where each one represents a phase. I'm imagining a team with skill 'X'. To win, 'X' needs to win all games, obviously.\n\nLet's consider the extreme cases. If 's' is all zeros (meaning the lower skill always wins), the only winning team *must* have the lowest skill. Any other skill value will eventually lose to a lower skilled team. The team with skill '1' is *guaranteed* to win.\n\nIf 's' is all ones (higher skill always wins), the winning integer must be $2^n$. This team always win.\n\nFrom these simple cases, I'm starting to see that my solution will depend on how the bits in 's' influence the 'X' value that can be a winning integer. I'm going to look into how to construct all such numbers, and I'll need a way to build a method that can create any type of integer. I suspect this will involve iterating, potentially using bit manipulation to represent the tournament phases and their rules.\n",
    "response": "The tournament consists of $n$ phases. In each phase $i$ (from 1 to $n$), there are $2^{n-i}$ games. The rule for winning a game in phase $i$ is determined by $s_{i-1}$: if $s_{i-1} = '0'$, the team with lower skill wins; if $s_{i-1} = '1'$, the team with higher skill wins. A team must win $n$ games to become the champion.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament.\nTo win the tournament, a team with skill $X$ must win all $n$ of its matches.\nConsider the $i$-th match a team plays (which occurs in phase $i$ of the tournament).\n- If $s_{i-1} = '0'$ (lower skill wins), the team with skill $X$ must play against an opponent with skill $Y > X$.\n- If $s_{i-1} = '1'$ (higher skill wins), the team with skill $X$ must play against an opponent with skill $Y < X$.\n\nLet $c_0$ be the count of '0's in the string $s$, and $c_1$ be the count of '1's in the string $s$. So $c_0 + c_1 = n$.\nFor a team with skill $X$ to win, it must win $c_0$ games against teams with skill greater than $X$, and $c_1$ games against teams with skill less than $X$.\n\nLet's consider the possible range of skill values $X$ can take.\nSuppose a team with skill $X$ wins.\nIt needs to beat $c_1$ teams with skill less than $X$. The smallest possible skills it could beat are $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$. This implies that $X$ must be greater than $c_1$. So, $X \\ge c_1 + 1$.\nIt needs to beat $c_0$ teams with skill greater than $X$. The largest possible skills it could beat are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\ldots, 2^n - c_0 + 1$. This implies that $X$ must be less than $2^n - c_0 + 1$. So, $X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nCombining these, a winning skill $X$ must satisfy:\n$c_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nNow we need to show that for any $X$ in this range, it is possible to construct a permutation $p$ such that team $X$ wins.\nLet $X$ be an integer such that $c_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\nWe need to assign skill values to $2^n$ teams.\nThe team with skill $X$ needs $c_1$ opponents with skill less than $X$ and $c_0$ opponents with skill greater than $X$.\nWe can dedicate the $c_1$ smallest skills available (from $1$ to $c_1$) to be opponents for $X$ in the games where $X$ needs to be the higher skill.\nWe can dedicate the $c_0$ largest skills available (from $2^n - c_0 + 1$ to $2^n$) to be opponents for $X$ in the games where $X$ needs to be the lower skill.\n\nConsider the set of skills that are *not* $X$, and are *not* used as dedicated opponents for $X$.\nThese are the skills $\\{1, \\ldots, 2^n\\} \\setminus (\\{X\\} \\cup \\{1, \\ldots, c_1\\} \\cup \\{2^n - c_0 + 1, \\ldots, 2^n\\})$.\nThe number of such skills is $2^n - 1 - c_1 - c_0 = 2^n - 1 - n$.\nThese remaining $2^n - 1 - n$ skills can be assigned to the other $2^n - 1 - n$ teams that are not $X$ and are not $X$'s direct opponents.\nThis construction is always possible because $X \\ge c_1+1$ ensures $X$ is not among $1, \\ldots, c_1$, and $X \\le 2^n-c_0$ ensures $X$ is not among $2^n-c_0+1, \\ldots, 2^n$.\n\nSince we can always construct such a permutation for any $X$ in the range $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0]$, all integers in this range are winning integers.\nThe number of '0's in $s$ is `s.count('0')`.\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is `s.count('1')`.\nLet `count0 = s.count('0')` and `count1 = s.count('1')`.\nThe minimum winning integer is `count1 + 1`.\nThe maximum winning integer is `(2**n) - count0`.\n\nThe problem asks for all winning integers in ascending order.\nSo we need to print integers from `count1 + 1` to `(2**n) - count0`, inclusive.\n\nExample 1:\nn = 3, s = \"101\"\ncount0 = 1, count1 = 2\nMinimum winning integer: count1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\nMaximum winning integer: (2**3) - count0 = 8 - 1 = 7\nWinning integers: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\nWait, example output is 4 5 6 7. Why?\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully.\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;\"\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\n\nMy interpretation of $s_i$ was using 0-indexed string $s[i-1]$ for phase $i$. This is standard.\nThe string $s$ has length $n$.\n$s_i$ refers to $s[i]$ in 0-indexed terms.\nSo, $s_0$ for phase 1, $s_1$ for phase 2, ..., $s_{n-1}$ for phase $n$.\n\nLet's use the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nPhase 1 (2^2=4 games): $s_0 = '1'$ (higher skill wins)\nPhase 2 (2^1=2 games): $s_1 = '0'$ (lower skill wins)\nPhase 3 (2^0=1 game): $s_2 = '1'$ (higher skill wins)\n\nA winning team plays $n$ games.\nGame 1 (Phase 1): Higher skill wins. Opponent skill must be $< X$.\nGame 2 (Phase 2): Lower skill wins. Opponent skill must be $> X$.\nGame 3 (Phase 3): Higher skill wins. Opponent skill must be $< X$.\n\nSo for $s=\"101\"$:\n$c_1$ = number of '1's in $s$ = 2.\n$c_0$ = number of '0's in $s$ = 1.\n\nThe winning team $X$ needs to beat $c_1$ teams with skill $< X$.\nThe winning team $X$ needs to beat $c_0$ teams with skill $> X$.\n\nThe range of skills $X$ must be able to \"accommodate\" these opponents.\nThe $c_1$ opponents with skill $<X$ must be chosen from $1, \\ldots, X-1$. To maximize the chance of $X$ winning, we pick the smallest available skills for these $c_1$ opponents. So $1, \\ldots, c_1$ are used. This implies $X > c_1$.\nThe $c_0$ opponents with skill $>X$ must be chosen from $X+1, \\ldots, 2^n$. To maximize the chance of $X$ winning, we pick the largest available skills for these $c_0$ opponents. So $2^n, 2^n-1, \\ldots, 2^n-c_0+1$ are used. This implies $X < 2^n-c_0+1$.\n\nSo the range $c_1+1 \\le X \\le 2^n-c_0$ is correct.\n\nLet's recheck the example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nMy calculation: $c_1=2, c_0=1$. Range is $[2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$. Output: 3 4 5 6 7.\nExample output: 4 5 6 7.\nThere is a discrepancy. My minimum is 3, example minimum is 4.\n\nWhat if the number of '1's in $s$ corresponds to the *minimum* number of higher skill opponents $X$ needs to beat, and the number of '0's in $s$ corresponds to the *maximum* number of lower skill opponents $X$ needs to beat? This is not right.\n\nLet's consider the number of '1's in $s$ as $N_1$ and the number of '0's in $s$ as $N_0$.\nA team with skill $X$ needs to win $N_1$ games where it has higher skill, and $N_0$ games where it has lower skill.\nTo win $N_1$ games with higher skill, $X$ must be greater than $N_1$ opponents. The minimum $X$ could be is $N_1+1$.\nTo win $N_0$ games with lower skill, $X$ must be smaller than $N_0$ opponents. The maximum $X$ could be is $2^n-N_0$.\nSo the range is $[N_1+1, 2^n-N_0]$. This is what I have.\n\nCould it be that the problem uses 1-indexed string $s_i$ and $s_i$ refers to $s[i]$? No, $s_i$ is usually $s[i-1]$ for 1-indexed $i$.\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games)\"\nThis means $s_1$ for phase 1, $s_2$ for phase 2, ..., $s_n$ for phase $n$.\nSo if the string $s$ is 0-indexed, $s[0]$ refers to phase 1, $s[1]$ to phase 2, ..., $s[n-1]$ to phase $n$. My current interpretation is correct.\n\nLet's reconsider the example $N=3, S=\"101\"$.\n$S[0] = '1'$ (Phase 1: Higher skill wins)\n$S[1] = '0'$ (Phase 2: Lower skill wins)\n$S[2] = '1'$ (Phase 3: Higher skill wins)\n\nA team with skill $X$ must win 3 games.\nGame 1 (Phase 1): $X$ must be higher skill. Opponent $Y_1 < X$.\nGame 2 (Phase 2): $X$ must be lower skill. Opponent $Y_2 > X$.\nGame 3 (Phase 3): $X$ must be higher skill. Opponent $Y_3 < X$.\n\nSo $X$ needs two opponents with skill less than $X$, and one opponent with skill greater than $X$.\nThe smallest possible values for $Y_1, Y_3$ are 1, 2. So $X$ must be at least 3. (i.e., $X > \\max(Y_1, Y_3) = 2$).\nThe largest possible value for $Y_2$ is $2^n$. So $X$ must be at most $2^n-1$. (i.e., $X < \\min(Y_2) = 2^n-1+1 = 2^n$).\nSo $X \\ge 3$ and $X \\le 7$. This gives $[3, 7]$.\n\nThe example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe difference is the lower bound. My $c_1+1$ vs example's $c_1+1+1$? Or $c_1+1$ vs $2^{c_1}$?\nMaybe it's related to the number of teams that could potentially reach the final stages.\n\nLet $N_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$, and $N_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nThe minimum skill a champion can have is $2^{N_1}$.\nThe maximum skill a champion can have is $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n\nLet's check this new formula with examples.\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$N_1 = 2$, $N_0 = 1$.\nMinimum skill: $2^{N_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\nMaximum skill: $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nRange: $[4, 7]$. This matches the example output! $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n$N_1 = 1$, $N_0 = 0$.\nMinimum skill: $2^{N_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nMaximum skill: $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 2^1 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\nRange: $[2, 2]$. This matches the example output! $2$.\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n$N_1 = 1$, $N_0 = 1$.\nMinimum skill: $2^{N_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nMaximum skill: $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 2^2 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\nRange: $[2, 3]$. This matches the example output! $2, 3$.\n\nThis new formula seems correct. Let's try to understand why.\nConsider the $N_1$ games where the higher skill wins. In these games, the champion $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nConsider the $N_0$ games where the lower skill wins. In these games, the champion $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\n\nLet's focus on the $N_1$ games where $X$ must win by being higher skilled.\nIn these $N_1$ games, $X$ needs to defeat $N_1$ distinct opponents, all of whom must have skill less than $X$.\nTo minimize $X$, we want to pick the smallest possible skills for these $N_1$ opponents. These would be $1, 2, \\ldots, N_1$.\nHowever, the tournament structure means that the opponents $X$ faces are not arbitrary teams from the initial $2^n$ teams. They are winners of previous matches.\nIf $X$ wins by higher skill, its opponent $Y$ must be less than $X$.\nIf $X$ wins by lower skill, its opponent $Z$ must be greater than $X$.\n\nLet's consider the teams that *cannot* win.\nIf $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins), then any team with skill $1, \\ldots, 2^i-1$ cannot win the tournament if it has to play in phase $i$.\nThis is not quite right. A team with skill 1 can win if $s_i = '0'$.\n\nLet's think about the number of *slots* for teams.\nA team with skill $X$ needs to win $N_1$ games where it's higher skill, and $N_0$ games where it's lower skill.\nTo win a higher skill game, $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nTo win a lower skill game, $X$ must be less than its opponent.\n\nConsider the $N_1$ games where $X$ wins as the higher skill.\nIn these games, $X$ needs to beat $N_1$ distinct teams, all of which have skill $<X$.\nThe smallest possible skills are $1, 2, \\ldots, N_1$.\nThe $N_1$ teams that $X$ beats (by being higher skill) must come from $N_1$ distinct \"subtrees\" in the tournament bracket.\nFor $X$ to win as the higher skill in $N_1$ games, it must be the highest skill among $N_1+1$ teams in total (itself and $N_1$ opponents).\nThese $N_1+1$ teams must occupy $2^{N_1}$ initial slots in the tournament bracket (if all $N_1$ games are in phases where $X$ is higher skill, and $X$ wins all of them).\nThis means $X$ must be the highest among $2^{N_1}$ teams that could potentially reach those $N_1$ games.\nSo $X$ must be at least $2^{N_1}$. If $X$ is $2^{N_1}$, then $1, \\ldots, 2^{N_1}-1$ must be assigned to the other $2^{N_1}-1$ slots in the subtree.\n\nConsider the $N_0$ games where $X$ wins as the lower skill.\nIn these $N_0$ games, $X$ needs to beat $N_0$ distinct teams, all of which have skill $>X$.\nFor $X$ to win as the lower skill in $N_0$ games, it must be the lowest skill among $N_0+1$ teams in total (itself and $N_0$ opponents).\nThese $N_0+1$ teams must occupy $2^{N_0}$ initial slots in the tournament bracket.\nThis means $X$ must be the lowest among $2^{N_0}$ teams that could potentially reach those $N_0$ games.\nSo $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\n\nThis reasoning seems more solid. The number of '1's ($N_1$) determines the minimum possible skill value $X$ can take, and the number of '0's ($N_0$) determines the maximum possible skill value $X$ can take.\nThe actual teams $X$ plays against are not just $N_1$ arbitrary teams from $1, \\ldots, X-1$ and $N_0$ arbitrary teams from $X+1, \\ldots, 2^n$. The teams $X$ plays against must have won previous matches according to the rules.\n\nLet's verify the minimum $2^{N_1}$.\nSuppose $X=2^{N_1}$.\nWe need to assign skill values to $2^n$ teams.\nWe need to ensure $X$ wins $N_1$ games by being higher skilled.\nThis means $X$ must be the highest skill among $2^{N_1}$ teams that are in its \"higher-skill-winning\" path.\nWe can assign skills $1, \\ldots, 2^{N_1}-1$ to the other $2^{N_1}-1$ teams in this group.\nWe need to ensure $X$ wins $N_0$ games by being lower skilled.\nThis means $X$ must be the lowest skill among $2^{N_0}$ teams that are in its \"lower-skill-winning\" path.\nWe can assign skills $2^n, 2^n-1, \\ldots, 2^n-(2^{N_0}-1)$ to the other $2^{N_0}-1$ teams in this group.\nThe remaining $2^n - 2^{N_1} - (2^{N_0}-1)$ teams can be filled with remaining skills.\nThis works as long as the sets of skills don't overlap.\nThe set $\\{1, \\ldots, 2^{N_1}-1\\}$ and $\\{2^n-(2^{N_0}-1), \\ldots, 2^n\\}$ must not contain $X$, and must not overlap.\n$X=2^{N_1}$ is not in $\\{1, \\ldots, 2^{N_1}-1\\}$.\n$X=2^{N_1}$ must be less than $2^n-(2^{N_0}-1)$.\nSo $2^{N_1} < 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\nThis is equivalent to $2^{N_1} + 2^{N_0} - 1 < 2^n$.\nSince $N_1+N_0 = n$, $2^{N_1} + 2^{n-N_1} - 1 < 2^n$.\nThis inequality holds for $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=1, N_1=1, N_0=0$: $2^1 + 2^0 - 1 = 2+1-1=2$. $2^1=2$. It's $2 < 2$, which is false.\nFor $n=1, N_1=0, N_0=1$: $2^0 + 2^1 - 1 = 1+2-1=2$. $2^1=2$. It's $2 < 2$, which is false.\n\nThis means that if $N_1=n$ or $N_0=n$, the formula might need adjustment.\nIf $N_1=n$ (all '1's), then $N_0=0$.\nMin skill: $2^n$. Max skill: $2^n - 2^0 + 1 = 2^n - 1 + 1 = 2^n$.\nRange: $[2^n, 2^n]$. This means only $2^n$ can win.\nExample $n=1, s=\"1\"$: $N_1=1, N_0=0$. Min $2^1=2$. Max $2^1-2^0+1=2$. Range $[2,2]$. Correct.\n\nIf $N_0=n$ (all '0's), then $N_1=0$.\nMin skill: $2^0 = 1$. Max skill: $2^n - 2^n + 1 = 1$.\nRange: $[1, 1]$. This means only $1$ can win.\nExample $n=1, s=\"0\"$: $N_1=0, N_0=1$. Min $2^0=1$. Max $2^1-2^1+1=1$. Range $[1,1]$. Correct.\n\nThe formula $2^{N_1} \\le X \\le 2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$ seems universally correct.\nThe logic behind it:\nTo win $N_1$ games where skill $X$ is higher, $X$ needs to be the highest skill among $2^{N_1}$ teams that could potentially reach these $N_1$ games. The smallest possible value for such an $X$ is $2^{N_1}$ (by assigning $1, \\ldots, 2^{N_1}-1$ to the other $2^{N_1}-1$ teams).\nTo win $N_0$ games where skill $X$ is lower, $X$ needs to be the lowest skill among $2^{N_0}$ teams that could potentially reach these $N_0$ games. The largest possible value for such an $X$ is $2^n - (2^{N_0}-1)$ (by assigning $2^n, \\ldots, 2^n-(2^{N_0}-1)+1$ to the other $2^{N_0}-1$ teams).\n\nThe minimum value for $X$ is $2^{N_1}$.\nThe maximum value for $X$ is $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1$.\nAll integers in this range are winning integers.\n\nFinal check of $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$N_1 = s.count('1') = 2$.\n$N_0 = s.count('0') = 1$.\nMin winning integer: $2^{N_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\nMax winning integer: $2^n - 2^{N_0} + 1 = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\nThis matches all examples.\n\nThe solution strategy is:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Calculate $N_1 = s.count('1')$.\n4. Calculate $N_0 = s.count('0')$.\n5. Calculate `min_x = 2**N_1`.\n6. Calculate `max_x = (2**n) - (2**N_0) + 1`.\n7.
