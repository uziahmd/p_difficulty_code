And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Current Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, here's the problem. I need to figure out the average sleep time over a sliding window of `k` consecutive days within a longer series of `n` sleep records.  It looks like I've got `n` days worth of data, and for each possible \"week\" (which is `k` days long), I've got to sum the sleep hours. Then I need to average those sums.  The number of these \"weeks\" is `n-k+1`.\n\nThe naive way is to, for each of these `n-k+1` weeks, go through and sum the `k` days. That'd be `O((n-k+1)*k)` which could be `O(n^2)` if `k` is roughly `n`. That's no good - too slow for `n` of 200,000.  I need a more efficient way to calculate these sums, to avoid that.\n\nAha! Sliding window! I can use the sliding window technique.  Calculate the first sum, and then each subsequent sum can be calculated in `O(1)` time by just removing the first day of the window and adding the last day of the next week, which slides over.  So, after an initial calculation, each subsequent calculation is just an addition and subtraction. This becomes `O(n)`.  The first sum takes `O(k)` time but is dominated by the linear behavior of the rest.\n\nSo, I'm thinking I can do this in `O(n)`.   To calculate all the week-sums, I'm going to figure out the coefficients. After I calculate the sum of the first `k` days in `O(k)`, I'm going to use a sliding-window technique to efficiently calculate the sums of the remaining windows. This should avoid recomputing values and keep the algorithm linear in time.\n\nNow, let's nail down these coefficients.  Each sleep time, `a_j`, contributes to the sum of a \"week\" if that day is within that range. It looks like it's going to be the minimum of `j` and `n-k+1` to determine how many times each `a_j` appears.  It also needs to take into consideration that any given day won't be part of all the sums. If it's earlier than the first week, it's not. If it's later than the last week, it's not.\n\nLooking at it again, the number of weeks that `a_j` appears in is determined by how many windows include it.  If it's near the beginning of the list, it will appear in multiple windows. If it's near the end, it will appear in fewer. The correct formula is `min(j, n-k+1) - max(1, j-k+1) + 1`. This looks like it works. I need to make sure I get the index correct. I'm going to go with a 0-based indexing which is better for code.\n\nOk, to calculate the final average, I just iterate through each `a_j`, multiply it by its coefficient, sum them up, and divide by the total number of windows, `n-k+1`. This looks like it'll work and be efficient.\n\nI'll use Python for this. Read `n` and `k`, then read the `a` array.  Then, calculate the coefficients using the established formula. Finally, calculate the `TotalSum` and divide by `n-k+1`. I also need to be careful about floating point precision.  I'll ensure the final answer is a float.\n\nOne more quick edge case check before I start to code, if `k` is 1, then the average should just be the average of the individual days. My formula reduces to that - that's good. If `k` is `n`, then the average is just the average of the whole series of numbers, as there is just one window. That also comes out of the math, so I think I'm good. Now to code it.\n",
