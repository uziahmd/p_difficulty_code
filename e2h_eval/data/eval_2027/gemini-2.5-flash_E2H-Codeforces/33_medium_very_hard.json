You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Number by Replacing Digits**\n\nMy goal is to solve the \"Replacing Digits\" problem. I'm given a number 'a' (as a string) and a set of digits 's' (also as a string), and I want to replace digits in 'a' with digits from 's' to create the largest possible number. Each digit in 's' can only be used once.\n\nThe core idea is this: to make a number as large as possible, I need to make the leftmost (most significant) digits as large as possible. This suggests a greedy strategy: starting from the left of 'a', I should replace each digit with the largest available digit from 's' that's larger than the current digit in 'a'.\n\nI'll first convert both 'a' and 's' into lists of characters to make it easier to work with individual digits. I also need to sort 's' in descending order. This ensures I can easily pick the *largest* available digit from 's' for each position in 'a'.\n\nNow, I'll iterate through the digits of 'a' from left to right. For each digit `a[i]`, I'll check if there are any digits remaining in 's'. If there are, I compare the largest remaining digit `s[j]` from 's' with `a[i]`. If `s[j]` is larger than `a[i]`, I replace `a[i]` with `s[j]` and mark `s[j]` as used (by incrementing `s_ptr`). If not, it means I can't improve `a[i]` (using any digit from the sorted list 's'), so I move on to `a[i+1]` without incrementing `s_ptr`, keeping the same digit.\n\nThe key to the solution is carefully tracking the 's' digits I've used. I *only* increment the pointer to 's' when a replacement actually happens. This ensures that I consider the largest available 's' digit for each position in 'a' and make the optimal replacements, from left to right.\n\nIf I run out of digits in 's', I stop; I can't make any further replacements. Once I'm done iterating through 'a', I join the modified list of digits back into a string and that's my answer.\n\nI've carefully considered edge cases such as when 's' runs out before 'a' or if no replacements are possible, and the logic handles those correctly. The algorithm's time complexity is O(N + M log M), which is efficient.\n",
