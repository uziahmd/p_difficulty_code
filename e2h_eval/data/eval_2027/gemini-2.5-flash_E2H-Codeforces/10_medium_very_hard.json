Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The core challenge of this problem is definitively understanding how to interpret and map variables represented by underscores within the \"Golorp\" input string.** Initially, I was struggling with the meaning of the underscored variables, whether the number of underscores defined distinct variables, or whether distinct sequences of underscores mapped to distinct variable. This confusion has plagued my initial attempts to decode the problem's logic.\n\nI first started by understanding the Golorp language's structure: an expression and conditions. I focused on identifying variables (underscores), operators (+, -, *, / and >, <). I considered variable identification based on underscore counts and variable order based on appearance in the Golorp's name.\n\nThen, I focused on parsing and evaluating the expression. I considered a brute-force approach to variable assignment, trying to find variable values that satisfy both the expression and the conditions, and also generate a sequence lexicographically, but the mapping of the variables remained unclear. I was stuck trying to infer a pattern from the sample input and output, hoping to find a clear and simple relationship between the input and output length.\n\nA key challenge was understanding the concept of jaws and what are they. The statement says \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" It did not help at all.\n\nI examined the given examples in detail, looking for clues to unravel the mystery of the variable mapping. I considered the unique underscore lengths, and it looked like the output length related to the unique underscore lengths, but that didn't help. The samples proved counterintuitive to my assumptions, and I realized that my initial interpretations were incorrect, so this made it more challenging.\n\nUltimately, I focused on the output length of the examples, and tried to connect the length with the pattern that I recognized: the length corresponded to the total number of variable groups found in the Golorp's name. This seems to be the most logical way to start this problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that satisfy a given \"golorp name\" (program). If no such sequence exists, we output \"false\".\n\nThe core challenge lies in interpreting the golorp name, specifically:\n1.  **Variable Identification:** How are variables defined and mapped to the output sequence?\n2.  **Expression Evaluation:** How to parse and evaluate the arithmetic expression.\n3.  **Condition Checking:** How to parse and check the relational conditions.\n\nLet's analyze the examples to deduce the variable mapping:\n\n*   **Example 1:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` -> Output: `0010` (4 digits)\n*   **Example 3:** `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` -> Output: `0250341` (7 digits)\n*   **Example 4:** `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` -> Output: `0101` (4 digits)\n\nObservation: The output length is not directly related to the maximum number of underscores or the count of unique underscore lengths. However, the output length *is* consistent with the number of *distinct variable names* that appear in the string.\nA variable name is a sequence of underscores.\nFor example, in `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`:\n*   `_` (one underscore) is a variable name.\n*   `__` (two underscores) is a variable name.\n*   `___` (three underscores) is a variable name.\nThere are 3 distinct variable names (`_`, `__`, `___`). The output `0010` has 4 digits. This is still a mismatch if each distinct name maps to one output digit.\n\nThe most plausible interpretation, given the competitive programming context and the \"order in which they get into the jaws\" phrase, is that variables are defined by their *first appearance* in the string, and *each distinct variable name* (i.e., each unique length of underscore sequence) corresponds to one value in the output. The output order is based on the *lexicographical order of the variable names themselves* (i.e., `_` comes before `__`, `__` before `___`, etc.).\n\nLet's re-test this hypothesis with the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   Distinct variable names (by length): `_`, `__`, `___`.\n    *   Sorted by name (length): `_` (length 1), `__` (length 2), `___` (length 3).\n    *   Let `v_1` be the value for `_`, `v_2` for `__`, `v_3` for `___`.\n    *   Output should be `v_1 v_2 v_3`. Output is `0010` (4 digits). This still doesn't match.\n\nThe only way the output length makes sense is if the variable mapping is *not* simply based on distinct lengths. The problem states \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\" This strongly implies each *slot* for a variable value is a single digit.\n\nLet's consider the structure `? ( <expression> ) : - <conditions>`.\nThe expression and conditions use variable names like `_`, `__`, `___`, etc.\nThe problem statement is notoriously vague on variable definition. This often means the simplest possible interpretation is correct, even if it feels a bit odd.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis based on a common CP pattern for such problems:**\n1.  **Variable Names:** The sequences of underscores (`_`, `__`, `___`, etc.) are *literal variable names*.\n2.  **Variable Values:** Each unique variable name (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`) is assigned a single digit value (0-9).\n3.  **Output Order:** The output sequence consists of the values for all *unique variable names found in the input string*, sorted lexicographically by their names (i.e., `_` first, then `__`, then `___`, etc.).\n4.  **Number of Variables (N):** The total count of *unique* underscore sequences (e.g., if `_`, `__`, `___` appear, N=3). This means the output length should be N.\n\nThis hypothesis is contradicted by the sample outputs. The sample outputs have lengths 4, 7, 4 for N=3, N=7, N=2 respectively (based on unique underscore lengths). The discrepancy is puzzling.\n\nLet's try one more interpretation which is sometimes used in \"esoteric\" languages:\nThe \"variables\" are simply placeholders for digits in the input. Each `_` is a distinct input digit.\n`?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n`_` (1st underscore) -> `d0`\n`_` (2nd underscore) -> `d1`\n`___` (1st three-underscore sequence) -> `d2`\n`__` (1st two-underscore sequence) -> `d3`\n`___` (2nd three-underscore sequence) -> `d4` (if it's a new variable)\n`__` (2nd two-underscore sequence) -> `d5` (if it's a new variable)\n\nThis would mean a variable is identified by its *position* and *length*. This leads to many variables.\nExample 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\nVariables in order of appearance:\n1. `_` (length 1)\n2. `_` (length 1)\n3. `___` (length 3)\n4. `__` (length 2)\n5. `___` (length 3)\n6. `__` (length 2)\nThis gives 6 variables. Output `0010` (4 digits). Still not matching.\n\nThe only way to reconcile the output length is if the problem statement implies a specific set of variables that are *not* directly tied to the distinct underscore sequences, but rather a fixed mapping.\nE.g., `_` is variable `A`, `__` is variable `B`, `___` is variable `C`, `____` is variable `D`, etc.\nAnd the output sequence is `A B C D ...` up to some maximum `D` that appears.\nExample 1: `_`, `__`, `___` appear. So variables `A, B, C`. Output `ABC`. Length 3. Still not `0010`.\n\nThis problem is a riddle about variable mapping. Given the difficulty, it's possible there's an implicit rule.\nWhat if the variables are simply `v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, ...` and the underscore sequences map to these variables based on their *lengths*?\nE.g., `_` maps to `v_1`, `__` maps to `v_2`, `___` maps to `v_3`, `____` maps to `v_4`.\nThe number of variables `N` in the output is *always 4* for the first example, and *always 7* for the third example. This suggests a fixed set of variables.\n\nLet's assume the following interpretation, which is the only one that seems to fit the output lengths for samples 1, 3, 4:\n1.  **Variable Names:** The `_` sequences `_`, `__`, `___`, `____`, `_____`, `______`, `_______`, etc., are variable *types*.\n2.  **Actual Variables:** The problem defines a fixed set of actual variables, let's call them `x0, x1, x2, x3, ...`.\n3.  **Mapping:** Each variable *type* `k` (represented by `k` underscores) maps to a specific `x_j`. The mapping is fixed:\n    *   `_` (1 underscore) maps to `x0`\n    *   `__` (2 underscores) maps to `x1`\n    *   `___` (3 underscores) maps to `x2`\n    *   `____` (4 underscores) maps to `x3`\n    *   `_____` (5 underscores) maps to `x4`\n    *   `______` (6 underscores) maps to `x5`\n    *   `_______` (7 underscores) maps to `x6`\n    *   ...and so on.\n    This means `k` underscores maps to `x_{k-1}`.\n4.  **Total Variables (N):** The total number of variables `N` in the output is determined by the *maximum length of an underscore sequence plus one* (if `k` underscores maps to `x_{k-1}`, then max `k` means `x_{max_k-1}` is the last variable).\n    *   Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` Max underscore length is 3 (`___`). So `x0, x1, x2` are used. Output length should be 3. But it's `0010` (length 4). This interpretation is also not quite right.\n\nThis problem is extremely ambiguous. Given the \"very hard question\" note, it's possible there's a trick.\nThe only way to get `0010` for Sample 1 is if there are 4 variables `x0, x1, x2, x3`.\nAnd `_` maps to `x0`, `__` maps to `x1`, `___` maps to `x2`.\nWhat maps to `x3`? Nothing in the input uses 4 underscores.\n\nLet's assume the problem statement implies that variables are *always* `x0, x1, ..., x(MAX_UNDERSCORE_LENGTH)` *regardless of whether `_` or `____` actually appear in the string*.\nAnd `_` refers to `x0`, `__` refers to `x1`, `___` refers to `x2`, `____` refers to `x3`, etc.\nThen:\n*   Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` Max underscore length is 3. So we need `x0, x1, x2, x3`. Output `x0x1x2x3`. This matches length 4.\n    *   `_` -> `x0`\n    *   `__` -> `x1`\n    *   `___` -> `x2`\n    *   `____` (doesn't appear) -> `x3`\n    Expression: `x0 - x0 / x2 * x1`\n    Condition: `x2 > x1`\n    Try `x0=0, x1=0, x2=1, x3=0`:\n    Expression `0 - 0 / 1 * 0 = 0`.\n    Condition `1 > 0` (True).\n    This works! And `0010` is lexicographically smallest.\n\n*   Example 3: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n    *   Max underscore length is 22. So we need `x0, ..., x21`. Output length 22. But output is `0250341` (length 7). This interpretation is wrong.\n\nThe only remaining interpretation that fits Example 3's output length 7 for max underscore length 22 (and many other lengths present) is:\n**Final Hypothesis (the one that seems to work for all samples):**\n1.  **Variable Names:** `_` (1 underscore) maps to variable `v_0`, `__` (2 underscores) maps to `v_1`, `___` maps to `v_2`, `____` maps to `v_3`, `_____` maps to `v_4`, `______` maps to `v_5`, `_______` maps to `v_6`.\n2.  **Maximum Number of Variables:** The problem implies there are *at most 7 variables* (`v_0` through `v_6`). If an underscore sequence longer than `_______` appears (e.g., `______________________` in Sample 3, length 22), it *also maps to `v_6`*. This is a very unusual mapping, but it's the only one that explains the output lengths.\n    *   `k` underscores maps to `v_{k-1}` for `k <= 7`.\n    *   `k` underscores maps to `v_6` for `k > 7`.\n    *   The output sequence is `v_0v_1v_2v_3v_4v_5v_6`. (Always 7 digits).\n    *   This is consistent with Sample 3 having 7 digits.\n    *   This is consistent with Sample 1 having 4 digits *if the max index used is 3*.\n        *   `_` -> `v_0`\n        *   `__` -> `v_1`\n        *   `___` -> `v_2`\n        *   `____` -> `v_3`\n        *   Output `v_0v_1v_2v_3`. Length 4. This fits Sample 1!\n    *   This is consistent with Sample 4: `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\n        *   `__` -> `v_1`\n        *   `___` -> `v_2`\n        *   Max index is 2. So variables `v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3` are needed. Output `v_0v_1v_2v_3`. Length 4. This fits Sample 4!\n\n**This hypothesis is the strongest candidate.**\nLet `max_k` be the maximum length of an underscore sequence found in the input.\nThe number of variables `N` will be `max_k` (if `k` maps to `v_{k-1}`).\nThe variables are `v_0, v_1, ..., v_{N-1}`.\nThe output is `v_0v_1...v_{N-1}`.\nA sequence of `k` underscores refers to variable `v_{k-1}`.\n\nLet's re-verify this final hypothesis with all examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   Underscore lengths: 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2. Max length `max_k = 3`.\n    *   Variables are `v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3`. Output length 4. Matches `0010`.\n    *   Mapping: `_` -> `v_0`, `__` -> `v_1`, `___` -> `v_2`. `v_3` is unused.\n    *   Expression: `v_0 - v_0 / v_2 * v_1`\n    *   Condition: `v_2 > v_1`\n    *   Test `v_0=0, v_1=0, v_2=1, v_3=0`:\n        *   Expr: `0 - 0 / 1 * 0 = 0`.\n        *   Cond: `1 > 0` (True).\n        *   This is a valid solution. Since we try digits 0-9 lexicographically, `0010` is the smallest.\n\n*   **Example 2:** `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\n    *   Underscore lengths: 2, 1, 5, 2, 5. Max length `max_k = 5`.\n    *   Variables are `v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5`. Output length 6. Output is `false`.\n    *   Mapping: `_` -> `v_0`, `__` -> `v_1`, `___` -> `v_2`, `____` -> `v_3`, `_____` -> `v_4`. `v_5` is unused.\n    *   Expression: `v_1 - v_0 + v_4`\n    *   Conditions: `v_1 > v_0`, `v_4 < v_1`\n    *   Test `v_0=0, v_1=0, v_2=0, v_3=0, v_4=0, v_5=0`:\n        *   Cond 1: `0 > 0` (False). Invalid.\n    *   Test `v_0=0, v_1=1, v_2=0, v_3=0, v_4=0, v_5=0`:\n        *   Cond 1: `1 > 0` (True).\n        *   Cond 2: `0 < 1` (True).\n        *   Expr: `1 - 0 + 0 = 1`.\n        *   This is a valid solution: `010000`. So output should not be `false`.\n        *   Wait, the example output is `false`. This means there's something wrong with my understanding of the expression.\n\n**Crucial detail: What does the expression evaluate to?**\nThe problem states: \"For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name.\"\n\"Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all.\"\n\"all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible.\"\n\nThis implies the *expression itself* must evaluate to a specific value, or satisfy some condition.\nIf the expression *must* evaluate to 0, then:\n*   Example 1: `v_0 - v_0 / v_2 * v_1 = 0`. With `v_0=0, v_1=0, v_2=1`, this is `0 - 0/1*0 = 0`. Works.\n*   Example 2: `v_1 - v_0 + v_4 = 0`.\n    *   Conditions: `v_1 > v_0` and `v_4 < v_1`.\n    *   Try `v_0=0, v_1=1, v_4=0`. Then `1 - 0 + 0 = 1 != 0`. So `010000` is not a solution if expr must be 0.\n    *   Let's try to find `v_0, v_1, v_4` such that `v_1 - v_0 + v_4 = 0`, `v_1 > v_0`, `v_4 < v_1`.\n        *   `v_1 - v_0 + v_4 = 0` implies `v_0 = v_1 + v_4`.\n        *   Since `v_1 > v_0`, we have `v_1 > v_1 + v_4`. This implies `0 > v_4`.\n        *   But variables are 0-9. So `v_4` cannot be negative.\n        *   This means there is no solution if the expression must be 0. This explains `false` for example 2!\n\n**This is the missing piece! The expression must evaluate to 0.**\n\n**Final Confirmed Hypothesis:**\n1.  **Variable Mapping:** A sequence of `k` underscores (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`) maps to variable `v_{k-1}`.\n2.  **Number of Variables (N):** Let `max_k` be the maximum number of underscores in any sequence in the input string. The total number of variables is `N = max_k`. The output sequence will be `v_0v_1...v_{N-1}`. If `k` underscores are not present, its corresponding `v_{k-1}` is still part of the output sequence and can take any value 0-9.\n3.  **Diet Conditions:**\n    *   The arithmetic expression must evaluate to 0. Integer division `/` is used.\n    *   All relational conditions (`>`, `<`) must be true.\n4.  **Search Strategy:** Iterate through all possible variable assignments for `v_0` to `v_{N-1}` from `00...0` to `99...9` (lexicographically). The first assignment that satisfies all conditions is the answer. If no such assignment is found, output \"false\".\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Parsing:**\n    *   Use regular expressions to extract the expression and conditions.\n    *   Use regular expressions to find all underscore sequences and determine `max_k`.\n    *   Tokenize the expression and conditions.\n    *   Map underscore sequences to variable indices (e.g., `_` to `0`, `__` to `1`, etc.).\n*   **Expression Evaluation:**\n    *   Convert infix expression to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) using the Shunting-Yard algorithm.\n    *   Evaluate RPN using a stack. Handle operator precedence (`*`, `/` before `+`, `-`).\n    *   Division by zero: If `v_j` is 0 and it's a divisor, the expression is invalid.\n*   **Backtracking/Iterative Search:**\n    *   Since `N` can be up to 1024 (string length) / 2 (min `_` + op), it could be around 500. `10^500` is too large for brute force.\n    *   However, the maximum `k` (number of underscores) is limited by the string length. `k` cannot be more than ~1000. But typical competitive programming problems limit `N` for brute force to around 10-15.\n    *   Let's check `max_k` from samples:\n        *   Ex1: `max_k = 3`. `N=4`. (Output `0010`)\n        *   Ex2: `max_k = 5`. `N=6`. (Output `false`)\n        *   Ex3: `max_k = 22`. `N=22`. (Output `0250341`). Output length 7. This contradicts `N = max_k`.\n\nThis `N = max_k` hypothesis is problematic for Example 3. The output `0250341` has length 7, but `max_k` is 22. This implies there are *always* 7 variables `v_0` to `v_6`, and any `k` underscores greater than 7 also map to `v_6`. This is the only way to get length 7.\n\n**Final, Final Hypothesis (must be this one to match all samples):**\n1.  **Variable Mapping:** A sequence of `k` underscores maps to variable `v_{k-1}` for `k <= 7`. If `k > 7`, it maps to `v_6`.\n    *   `_` -> `v_0`\n    *   `__` -> `v_1`\n    *   `___` -> `v_2`\n    *   `____` -> `v_3`\n    *   `_____` -> `v_4`\n    *   `______` -> `v_5`\n    *   `_______` -> `v_6`\n    *   `________` (8 underscores) -> `v_6`\n    *   `______________________` (22 underscores) -> `v_6`\n2.  **Number of Variables (N):** There are always 7 variables (`v_0` to `v_6`). The output sequence is always `v_0v_1v_2v_3v_4v_5v_6`.\n3.  **Diet Conditions:**\n    *   The arithmetic expression must evaluate to 0. Integer division `/` is used.\n    *   All relational conditions (`>`, `<`) must be true.\n4.  **Search Strategy:** Brute force all `10^7` combinations for `v_0` to `v_6`. This is `10,000,000` which is feasible within typical time limits (a few seconds).\n\nLet's check this hypothesis against examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   Variables `v_0, ..., v_6`. Output length 7. Example output `0010` (length 4).\n    *   This still doesn't match! The output length varies.\n\nThis is extremely frustrating. The problem implies a varying number of variables, but the mapping is not obvious.\nThe only way to get varying output lengths is if `N` is determined by `max_k` *but only for `k` up to 7*.\nIf `max_k` is 3, then `N=4` (for `v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3`).\nIf `max_k` is 5, then `N=6` (for `v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5`).\nIf `max_k` is 22, then `N=7` (for `v_0, ..., v_6`). This is the only way Example 3 makes sense.\n\n**Final, Final, Final Hypothesis:**\n1.  **Variable Mapping:** A sequence of `k` underscores maps to variable `v_{k-1}`.\n2.  **Number of Variables (N):** `N = min(max_k + 1, 7)`. Where `max_k` is the maximum number of underscores in any sequence in the input string. The output sequence will be `v_0v_1...v_{N-1}`.\n    *   If `max_k` is 0 (no underscores), `N=1`.\n    *   If `max_k` is 1 (`_`), `N=2`.\n    *   If `max_k` is 2 (`__`), `N=3`.\n    *   If `max_k` is 3 (`___`), `N=4`. (Matches Ex1, Ex4)\n    *   If `max_k` is 4 (`____`), `N=5`.\n    *   If `max_k` is 5 (`_____`), `N=6`.
