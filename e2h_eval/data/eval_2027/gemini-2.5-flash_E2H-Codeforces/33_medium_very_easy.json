You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving the \"Replacing Digits\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal here is to maximize a number `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence `s`, using each digit from `s` at most once.  My first instinct is to go greedy. To maximize a number, the most impactful change will be at the leftmost (most significant) digits.\n\n1.  **Sorting `s`:** The key is to have the largest digits readily available. So, I need to sort the digits in `s` in descending order. That gives me `s_sorted`, where `s_sorted[0]` is the biggest digit.\n\n2.  **Iterating Through `a`:** I'll go through `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I want to see if I can replace it with a larger digit from my pool (`s_sorted`).\n\n3.  **The Comparison:**  If I find a digit in `s_sorted` that *is* bigger than the current digit in `a`, I *must* make the replacement. This clearly increases the value. I'll replace the digit and move on to the next digit in `a`. If there's no larger digit in `s`, or the current digit of `s` is not larger, I'll keep the `a` digit as is. I need to keep track of my `s_sorted` index carefully. This index (`s_ptr`) points to the *largest available* digit from `s_sorted`.\n\n4.  **Important detail**:  If a digit in `s` cannot improve the current digit of `a`, I need to keep the digit from `s` for later. This is where my initial thinking was flawed. If the largest available digit in `s` (i.e. `s_sorted[s_ptr]`) is *not* greater than `a[i]`,  I do *not* increase `s_ptr`. `s_ptr` points to the *largest digit not yet used from `s`*. It is always available, and the digits smaller than it will also be available for later. I might still be able to use the same digit later on!\nFor example, if the current s digit is '1' and I cannot change `a[i]` using it, I don't \"throw it away.\" It can be helpful for later.\n\n5.  **Edge Case**: I also need to make sure I don't run out of digits from `s`. I check `s_ptr < m` within my loop's main condition to keep this in mind.\n\n6.  **Code structure**\nI will use a list to make a copy of `a` and make changes to this list, this can be done efficiently in Python. After all replacement, the new `a` value is formed using the list with `\"\".join(a_list)`\n\nThe complexity is O(n + m log m) for time (sorting `s` dominates). The space complexity is O(n + m). Should be fast enough for the problem's limits. I feel confident about the solution now. The trace of examples confirmed the greedy strategy.\n",
