For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to write a program that can take three musical notes as input and tell me if they form a major triad, a minor triad, or something else entirely (\"strange\"). I'm thinking I'll need to break this down into a few steps.\n\nFirst, I need a way to represent the notes numerically. The problem gives us the names of the notes, but it's going to be much easier to work with them if I map them to numbers. I'll make a dictionary where \"C\" is 0, \"C#\" is 1, and so on up to \"H\" as 11. This way I can calculate the distance between notes simply by doing arithmetic. And I need to remember that the notes are cyclic, so I'll need to use the modulo operator (%) to ensure the distances wrap around correctly (like H to C).\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to calculate the distance between any two notes in semitones. I'm going to have a formula for this, which is `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. Here, `n1` and `n2` are the numerical values of the two notes, and the \"+ 12\" ensures that the distance is always positive. This will give me the number of semitones from one note *upwards* to another.\n\nThe core of the problem is in identifying the triads. Major and minor triads have very specific patterns of semitone distances between the notes. For a major triad, if the notes are ordered, the first distance is 4 semitones and the second is 3 semitones. For a minor triad, it's the reverse: 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones. The order is crucial here, as the problem clearly states it's possible to reorder the input notes to create the pattern, so I'll need to account for this fact by checking every possible ordering of the three input notes.\n\nTo handle these orderings, the first step is to read the three input notes, convert them to their numerical values using my mapping, and store them in a list. Then, I will iterate through all possible permutations of these numerical values. For each permutation, I'll calculate the semitone distances between the notes and see if it fits the major or minor pattern. If I find a match, I can immediately print the classification (\"major\" or \"minor\") and stop. The problem guarantees the input will only be one or the other, or a \"strange\" triad, so I don't need to worry about ambiguities or edge cases that would require extra checking.\n\nIf after checking all possible orderings, I don't find a major or minor pattern, then it must be a \"strange\" triad. That will be the default output.\n\nI think using `itertools.permutations` will be a clean way to generate all possible orderings of the notes, and the rest of the logic should be straightforward. I'm confident in the approach. Let's start coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given triad (a set of three notes) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". We are given 12 notes (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H) which repeat cyclically. Distances between notes are measured in semitones.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Note to Numerical Mapping:** To easily calculate semitone distances, we first map each note to an integer value from 0 to 11. We can assign C=0, C#=1, D=2, ..., H=11.\n\n    ```python\n    note_map = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n    ```\n\n2.  **Semitone Distance Calculation:** The distance between two notes `n1` and `n2` (their numerical values) moving upwards along the scale is `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. The `+ 12` ensures the result is non-negative before applying the modulo, handling cases where `n2 < n1` (e.g., H to C).\n\n3.  **Triad Classification Logic:**\n    *   A triad consists of three notes, say X, Y, and Z. The problem states it's an *unordered set*, meaning we need to check if *any* ordering of the given three notes satisfies the major or minor triad definition.\n    *   **Major Triad:** If we can order the notes as (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and the distance from Y to Z is 3 semitones.\n    *   **Minor Triad:** If we can order the notes as (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones, and the distance from Y to Z is 4 semitones.\n    *   **Strange Triad:** If no such ordering satisfies either the major or minor triad conditions.\n\n4.  **Implementation Steps:**\n    *   Read the three input notes as strings.\n    *   Convert these three notes into their numerical semitone values using the `note_map`.\n    *   Since the triad is an \"unordered set\", we need to check all possible orderings (permutations) of these three numerical values. There are 3! = 6 permutations, which is a very small number. The `itertools.permutations` function is perfect for this.\n    *   For each permutation `(X, Y, Z)`:\n        *   Calculate `d1 = (Y - X + 12) % 12`.\n        *   Calculate `d2 = (Z - Y + 12) % 12`.\n        *   If `d1 == 4` and `d2 == 3`, the triad is \"major\". Print \"major\" and terminate.\n        *   If `d1 == 3` and `d2 == 4`, the triad is \"minor\". Print \"minor\" and terminate.\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding a match (i.e., no permutation satisfied major or minor conditions), then the triad is \"strange\". Print \"strange\".\n    *   The problem guarantees that the answer will always be unambiguous, so we can return immediately after finding the first match.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef solve():\n    # Map notes to numerical values (0-11 semitones)\n    # C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11\n    note_map = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n\n    # Read the three space-separated notes from standard input\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Convert string notes to their numerical semitone values\n    notes_val = [note_map[note] for note in notes_str]\n\n    # Check all possible orderings (permutations) of the three notes.\n    # A triad is defined by an \"unordered set\", meaning if *any* ordering\n    # fits the major/minor pattern, that's its classification.\n    for p in permutations(notes_val):\n        # Assign the notes in the current permutation as X, Y, Z\n        X, Y, Z = p[0], p[1], p[2]\n\n        # Calculate the distance in semitones between X and Y\n        # The +12 and %12 handle cyclic nature (e.g., H to C is 1 semitone)\n        d1 = (Y - X + 12) % 12\n        # Calculate the distance in semitones between Y and Z\n        d2 = (Z - Y + 12) % 12\n\n        # Check for a major triad: X --4 semitones--> Y --3 semitones--> Z\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return # Found a match, and problem guarantees unambiguous answer\n        # Check for a minor triad: X --3 semitones--> Y --4 semitones--> Z\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return # Found a match, and problem guarantees unambiguous answer\n    \n    # If no permutation matched either major or minor patterns, it's a strange chord\n    print(\"strange\")\n\n# Execute the solve function\nsolve()\n\n```",
