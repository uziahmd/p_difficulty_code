And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to calculate the average sleep time, considering `k`-day \"weeks\" within a sequence of `n` days. This sounds straightforward, but let's make sure I'm precise.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs: I'll have `n` (total days), `k` (week duration), and a list `a` containing the sleep time for each day.\n\nThe core of the problem is figuring out how to define and then iterate through these \"weeks.\" A week, in this context, is simply `k` consecutive days. So, if I have `n` days and a week of `k` days, I can form `n - k + 1` such weeks. That's good to keep in mind.\n\nNow, for each week, I need to calculate the average sleep time. That's just the sum of the sleep times in the week, divided by `k`.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the *overall average*. That means I need to calculate the average for each week, then take the average of those averages. Or, I can just sum all the sleep times across all weeks, and divide by the total number of days across all weeks. Because the average per week will be `(S_j / k)`, where `S_j` is the sum of sleep in the `j`-th week, the total average can be computed as  `(S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (k * (n-k+1))`. This is more efficient.\n\nLet's look at the example again, to be sure I understand. `k=2, n=3, a=[3, 4, 7]`.  I have two weeks: `[3, 4]` and `[4, 7]`.\n\n*   Week 1 sum: 7, average: 3.5\n*   Week 2 sum: 11, average: 5.5.\nThe number of weeks is `3 - 2 + 1 = 2`. The average is `(7+11) / (2*2) = 18/4 = 4.5`. The problem states the output should be `9.0000000000`. This disagrees with my calculation. I am going to double-check the problem statement again, because it's possible my definition of the overall average is incorrect. Okay, the statement indicates that the average of the sums needs to be averaged, so it is `(7/2 + 11/2) / 2 = 9`. This is the issue.\n\nIt looks like the key is summing up the averages, and then averaging the average of the sums. I need to make sure I implement this logic in my script.  The final result should be `9`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible `k`-day consecutive periods within a sequence of `n` days. There are `n - k + 1` such periods (weeks). Let `S_j` be the sum of sleep times for the `j`-th week. The problem implies we need to sum up all `S_j` and divide by the total number of days considered across all weeks, which is `k * (n - k + 1)`.\n\nLet's verify this interpretation with the given example: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`.\nThe weeks are:\n1.  Days 1-2: `[3, 4]`. Sum `S_1 = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n2.  Days 2-3: `[4, 7]`. Sum `S_2 = 4 + 7 = 11`.\n\nTotal number of weeks = `n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\nThe sum of sleep times for all weeks is `S_1 + S_2 = 7 + 11 = 18`.\nThe total number of days across all weeks is `k * (n - k + 1) = 2 * 2 = 4`.\nThe overall average is `18 / 4 = 4.5`.\n\nHowever, the example output for `3 2\\n3 4 7` is `9.0000000000`. This suggests a different interpretation. The most likely interpretation that yields 9 is that the example output is the *sum* of sleep times for all weeks, not the average. This seems like a mistake in the problem description or example.\nLet's consider the phrase \"average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks\". If it means the average of the *weekly averages*, then for `[3, 4, 7]` and `k=2`:\nWeek 1 average: `(3+4)/2 = 3.5`\nWeek 2 average: `(4+7)/2 = 5.5`\nAverage of these weekly averages: `(3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5`.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"average sleep times over all weeks\" and the common understanding in competitive programming of \"average of all subarrays/subsegments\", it usually means `(sum of all subarray sums) / (total number of elements in all subarrays)`. This is the `18 / 4 = 4.5` approach.\n\nHowever, the problem statement provides an example output of `9.0000000000` for `3 2\\n3 4 7`. This value `9` is exactly `S_1 + S_2` from our calculation above. This implies that the problem is asking for the sum of sleep times for all weeks, `(S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1})`, and then to divide by `n - k + 1` (the number of weeks), *not* `k * (n - k + 1)`.\nSo, the formula becomes `(S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (n - k + 1)`.\nFor `[3, 4, 7]` and `k=2`: `(7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9`. This matches the example output.\nThis interpretation means we are calculating the average of the *total sleep times* for each `k`-day period, not the average of the *daily average sleep times* for each `k`-day period. This is unusual but consistent with the example.\n\nLet's proceed with this interpretation: calculate `(sum of all S_j) / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nTo efficiently calculate the sum of all `S_j`:\nA naive approach would be to iterate `n - k + 1` times, and for each week, sum `k` elements. This would be `O((n-k+1) * k)`, which is `O(n*k)`. Given `n, k <= 2 * 10^5`, `n*k` could be up to `4 * 10^{10}`, too slow.\n\nWe can use a sliding window approach with prefix sums.\nFirst, calculate prefix sums: `P[i] = a_1 + ... + a_i`. `P[0] = 0`.\nThe sum of elements `a_i, ..., a_{i+k-1}` (which is `S_i` in 1-based indexing) can be found as `P[i+k-1] - P[i-1]`.\n\nLet's use 0-based indexing for `a`: `a_0, ..., a_{n-1}`.\nThe weeks are:\n*   `a_0, ..., a_{k-1}`. Sum `S_0`.\n*   `a_1, ..., a_k`. Sum `S_1`.\n*   ...\n*   `a_{n-k}, ..., a_{n-1}`. Sum `S_{n-k}`.\n\nThe total sum `T = S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{n-k}`.\nThe final answer is `T / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nConsider the contribution of each `a_i` to the total sum `T`.\n*   `a_0` is part of `S_0`.\n*   `a_1` is part of `S_0, S_1`.\n*   ...\n*   `a_j` is part of `S_p, S_{p+1}, ..., S_q`.\nSpecifically, `a_j` is part of any window `[i, i+k-1]` such that `i <= j <= i+k-1`. This means `j-k+1 <= i <= j`.\nThe valid `i` values for the start of a window are `0, ..., n-k`.\nSo, `a_j` is included in windows starting at `max(0, j-k+1)` up to `min(j, n-k)`.\nThe number of times `a_j` is included in a sum is `min(j, n-k) - max(0, j-k+1) + 1`.\n\nLet's analyze this more closely:\nThe first `k` elements `a_0, ..., a_{k-1}`:\n`a_0` is in `S_0`. (1 window)\n`a_1` is in `S_0, S_1`. (2 windows)\n...\n`a_{k-1}` is in `S_0, S_1, ..., S_{k-1}`. (`k` windows)\n\nThe middle elements `a_k, ..., a_{n-k-1}` (if `n-k-1 >= k`):\n`a_k` is in `S_1, ..., S_k`. (`k` windows)\n...\nEach `a_j` for `k-1 <= j <= n-k` is part of exactly `k` windows.\nThe elements `a_j` for `j` from `k-1` to `n-k` are included in `k` sums.\nThe elements `a_j` for `j < k-1` (i.e., `0 <= j <= k-2`) are included in `j+1` sums.\nThe elements `a_j` for `j > n-k` (i.e., `n-k+1 <= j <= n-1`) are included in `n-j` sums.\n\nThis means `a_j` is counted `min(j+1, k, n-j)` times.\nFor example, `a_0` is counted `min(1, k, n-0)` times.\n`a_j` is counted `min(j+1, k)` times if `j < n-k`.\n`a_j` is counted `min(n-j, k)` times if `j > k-1`.\nAnd `k` times if `k-1 <= j <= n-k`.\n\nSo, `T = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (a_j * count_j)`, where `count_j` is the number of times `a_j` appears in any `S_i`.\n`count_j = min(j+1, k, n-j)`.\n\nExample: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`\n`a_0 = 3`: `count_0 = min(0+1, 2, 3-0) = min(1, 2, 3) = 1`. Contribution: `3 * 1 = 3`.\n`a_1 = 4`: `count_1 = min(1+1, 2, 3-1) = min(2, 2, 2) = 2`. Contribution: `4 * 2 = 8`.\n`a_2 = 7`: `count_2 = min(2+1, 2, 3-2) = min(3, 2, 1) = 1`. Contribution: `7 * 1 = 7`.\nTotal sum `T = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18`.\nAverage = `18 / (3 - 2 + 1) = 18 / 2 = 9`. This works!\n\nThis calculation of `T` is `O(n)`. The total complexity will be `O(n)`, which is efficient enough.\n\nLet's implement this `O(n)` approach.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    total_sum_of_all_weeks = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of all S_j using the O(N) approach\n    # Each a[j] contributes to total_sum_of_all_weeks min(j+1, k, n-j) times.\n    for j in range(n):\n        # Number of times a[j] is included in a k-length window sum\n        # A window [start, start+k-1] includes a[j] if start <= j <= start+k-1.\n        # This implies j-k+1 <= start <= j.\n        # Also, start must be a valid starting index: 0 <= start <= n-k.\n        # So, start_min = max(0, j-k+1)\n        # And start_max = min(j, n-k)\n        # Number of windows = start_max - start_min + 1\n        \n        start_min = max(0, j - k + 1)\n        start_max = min(j, n - k)\n        \n        count_j = start_max - start_min + 1\n        total_sum_of_all_weeks += a[j] * count_j\n    \n    # The number of weeks is n - k + 1\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    # Calculate the average\n    # The problem example implies we divide the sum of all week sums by the number of weeks.\n    average = total_sum_of_all_weeks / num_weeks\n    \n    # Output with required precision\n    print(f\"{average:.10f}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
