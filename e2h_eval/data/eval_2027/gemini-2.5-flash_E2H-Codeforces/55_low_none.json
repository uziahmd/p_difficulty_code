    "thought": "**Analyzing Lexicographical Ordering with Allowed Swaps**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string given these specific swap rules. My first thought is to break down how the characters actually move and interact. It's clear that '0's and '1's can freely change places, and so can '1's and '2's, as long as they're next to each other. However, '0's and '2's are locked in place relative to each other. The forbidden '02' and '20' swap is the key here.\n\nThis tells me that any group of '0's and '1's can essentially be reordered among themselves, and the same goes for groups of '1's and '2's. We can treat those groups as interchangeable internally. For example, \"0110\" effectively becomes \"0011\" within its group and \"1221\" can effectively become \"1122\" within its group.\n\nBut the kicker is that the order of '0's and '2's is *fixed*. If a '0' comes before a '2' in the original string, it has to stay before that '2' in the final string, and vice-versa. We cannot change their relative order unless a '1' is involved, which would allow them to swap if they were adjacent to the '1'.\n\nThis is a pretty strong constraint. It implies that if we have a string with '0's, '1's, and '2's, we really have three segments: a group of '0's, a group of '1's, and a group of '2's. The '0's and '2's segments are anchored in their relative positions. So, essentially, '0's and '2's can only change order *globally*, not relative to one another. So, we either end up with all '0's before all '2's or vice-versa, with the '1's potentially distributed between, among, or alongside the other segments.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by repeatedly applying two types of swaps: '01' $\\leftrightarrow$ '10' and '12' $\\leftrightarrow$ '21'. Swaps of '02' $\\leftrightarrow$ '20' are not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '01' $\\leftrightarrow$ '10': This means a '0' can move past a '1' and vice versa. Effectively, '0's and '1's can be reordered freely among themselves. If we only had '0's and '1's in a string, we could sort them to put all '0's first, then all '1's (e.g., \"1010\" can become \"0011\").\n2. '12' $\\leftrightarrow$ '21': Similarly, a '1' can move past a '2' and vice versa. '1's and '2's can be reordered freely among themselves. If we only had '1's and '2's, we could sort them to put all '1's first, then all '2's (e.g., \"2121\" can become \"1122\").\n\nNow consider '0's and '2's. Since '02' $\\leftrightarrow$ '20' swaps are not allowed, a '0' cannot directly move past a '2', nor can a '2' directly move past a '0'. This means their relative order is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that '2' in the final string. If a '2' appears before a '0' in the original string, it must appear before that '0' in the final string.\n\nThis fixed relative order of '0's and '2's is the key constraint. It implies that any '0' that appears before any '2' in the original string must also appear before that '2' in the final string. This effectively partitions the string: all '0's must appear before all '2's, or all '2's must appear before all '0's, if they were to be sorted. But since they cannot cross, their original relative order is preserved.\n\nLet's consider the '1's. A '1' can move past any '0' and any '2'. This means '1's are very \"mobile\". They can move to any position in the string, as long as they don't violate the '0'-'2' relative order.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nSince '0's cannot move past '2's, any '0' must stay to the left of any '2' that was originally to its right.\nThe optimal strategy for lexicographical minimality is to put all '0's first, then all '1's, then all '2's.\nHowever, the '0'-'2' constraint prevents a full sort.\nThe '1's are the only characters that can cross both '0's and '2's. This means all '1's can effectively be collected and moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's.\n\nConsider the '0's and '2's. Their relative order is fixed. So, if we remove all '1's from the string, the remaining '0's and '2's will form a subsequence. This subsequence's relative order must be preserved in the final string.\nExample: \"100210\"\nRemove '1's: \"0020\". This is the subsequence of '0's and '2's.\nThe '1's can move anywhere. To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place '0's as early as possible.\n\nAll '0's can move to the left past '1's.\nAll '2's can move to the right past '1's.\nAll '1's can move past '0's and '2's.\n\nThis implies that all '0's can be grouped together, and all '2's can be grouped together. The '1's can be inserted anywhere.\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. Collect all '0's. These should come first.\n2. Collect all '2's. These should come last.\n3. What about the '1's? They can move past '0's and '2's. However, they cannot move past the \"fixed barrier\" formed by '0's and '2's that cannot cross each other.\n\nLet's count the number of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the input string.\n`count0`: number of '0's\n`count1`: number of '1's\n`count2`: number of '2's\n\nSince '0's and '2's cannot swap, the relative order of the block of '0's and the block of '2's is determined by their first appearance.\nConsider the first '2' in the string. All '0's that appear before this first '2' can be moved to the very beginning of the string (because they only need to move past '1's).\nAll '2's that appear after the last '0' can be moved to the very end of the string (because they only need to move past '1's).\n\nThe crucial insight is that all '1's can be moved past all '0's and all '2's. This means all '1's can be effectively grouped together.\nWhere should this group of '1's be placed to make the string lexicographically smallest?\nWe want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nThe '0's and '2's cannot cross. So, any '0' that appears before any '2' in the original string will always appear before that '2' in the final string.\nThe '1's don't have this restriction. They can move freely.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is:\n1. Collect all '0's from the original string.\n2. Collect all '2's from the original string.\n3. All '1's can be moved. To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first. Then, after all '0's, we should put all '1's. Finally, all '2's.\n\nLet's check this against the '0'-'2' constraint.\nIf we have a string like \"021\", the '0' cannot move past the '2'. So \"012\" is not possible. The '1' can move past '0' and '2'.\n\"021\" -> \"012\" is NOT possible because '0' and '2' cannot swap.\n\"021\" -> \"012\" is possible: '21' -> '12' gives \"012\".\nAh, my reasoning about '0' and '2' relative order was slightly off. The constraint is that '02' cannot become '20' and vice versa. This means a '0' cannot *directly* swap with a '2'. However, a '0' can move past a '2' if there is a '1' in between: '012' -> '102' -> '120'. This is a sequence of allowed swaps.\nSo, a '0' can effectively move past a '2' if there's a '1' to facilitate it.\n'012' -> '021' (swap 12->21)\n'012' -> '102' (swap 01->10)\nThis implies that '0's and '2's CAN cross each other, but only with the help of a '1'.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the mobility:\n- '0's can move past '1's.\n- '1's can move past '0's.\n- '1's can move past '2's.\n- '2's can move past '1's.\n\nThis means that a '0' can move past a '2' if there is a '1' available.\nExample: \"012\"\n'012' -> '102' (01 -> 10)\n'102' -> '120' (02 not allowed directly)\n'012' -> '021' (12 -> 21)\n'021' -> '201' (02 not allowed directly)\n\nThis is more like a sorting network.\nThe fact that '0's can move past '1's, and '1's can move past '2's, means that '0's can effectively move past '2's using '1's as intermediaries.\nConsider '0 X 2'. If X is '1', then '012' can become '102' or '021'.\n'012' -> '102' -> '120' (This sequence of moves is not directly possible. '102' cannot become '120' directly because '02' is not allowed.)\nLet's try: '012' -> '021' (12->21). Now we have '021'. Can '0' move past '2'? No.\nThis means my initial interpretation of '0' and '2' not crossing was correct. The swaps '01' $\\leftrightarrow$ '10' and '12' $\\leftrightarrow$ '21' define a partial order.\n'0' < '1' in terms of moving left. '1' < '2' in terms of moving left.\nThis means '0's are \"lighter\" than '1's, and '1's are \"lighter\" than '2's.\nSo, '0's are the lightest, '2's are the heaviest.\nThis implies that '0's can bubble left past '1's, and '1's can bubble left past '2's.\nBut '0's cannot bubble left past '2's.\n\nThis means the relative order of any '0' and any '2' IS fixed.\nIf we have \"0...2\" in the original string, it must remain \"0...2\" in the final string.\nIf we have \"2...0\" in the original string, it must remain \"2...0\" in the final string.\n\nExample: \"100210\"\n'0's: two at index 1, 2. one at index 5.\n'1's: two at index 0, 4.\n'2's: one at index 3.\n\nThe subsequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\".\nThis subsequence must maintain its relative order.\nSo, the final string must have the '0' at original index 1 before the '2' at original index 3.\nThe '0' at original index 2 before the '2' at original index 3.\nThe '2' at original index 3 before the '0' at original index 5.\n\nThis means that the '0's and '2's effectively form a \"skeleton\" whose relative order cannot change.\nThe '1's are the only characters that can move freely past '0's and '2's.\nSince '1's can move past '0's and '2's, all '1's can be grouped together.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nThen, where should the block of '1's go?\nThen, '2's last.\n\nConsider the string `s`.\nExtract all '0's and '2's in their original order. Let this be `s_02`.\nCount the number of '1's, let it be `num_ones`.\nThe final string will consist of `s_02` with `num_ones` '1's inserted somewhere.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's as early as possible.\nSo, we should put all '0's from `s_02` first, then all `num_ones` '1's, then all '2's from `s_02`.\nExample: \"100210\"\n'0's: 3, '1's: 2, '2's: 1.\n`s_02` = \"0020\"\nThis `s_02` has to maintain its relative order.\nThe '1's can move anywhere relative to '0's and '2's.\nTo be lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nSo, we iterate through `s_02`. We output '0's.\nWhen do we output '1's?\nWe should output all '1's *after* all '0's and *before* all '2's.\nThis is because '0' < '1' < '2'.\nSo, the structure should be: `(all 0s) (all 1s) (all 2s)`.\nBut the '0'-'2' relative order constraint breaks this simple sorting.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n1. All '0's can move to the left past '1's.\n2. All '2's can move to the right past '1's.\n3. The relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n4. All '1's can move freely past '0's and '2's. This means all '1's can be collected into a contiguous block.\n\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place '0's as far left as possible.\nThen '1's.\nThen '2's.\n\nLet's count the total number of '1's in the string. Let this be `count_ones`.\nNow, construct the result string.\nIterate through the input string `s`.\nIf `s[i]` is '0', append '0' to the result.\nIf `s[i]` is '2', append '2' to the result.\nIf `s[i]` is '1', ignore it for now. We will insert all '1's later.\n\nAfter this, we have a string `s_prime` which contains all '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n`s_prime` = \"0020\"\n`count_ones` = 2\n\nNow, we need to insert `count_ones` '1's into `s_prime`.\nTo make the final string lexicographically smallest, we want to place '0's before '1's, and '1's before '2's.\nSo, all `count_ones` '1's should be placed *after* any '0's in `s_prime` and *before* any '2's in `s_prime`.\nThe ideal place for the block of '1's is right after all '0's and right before all '2's.\nSo, find the first '2' in `s_prime`. All '0's before this '2' will come first. Then all '1's. Then the '2's and any '0's after them.\n\nLet's find the index of the first '2' in the original string `s`. If there are no '2's, then all '0's and '1's can be sorted: all '0's, then all '1's.\nIf there are no '0's, then all '1's and '2's can be sorted: all '1's, then all '2's.\n\nIf there is at least one '2':\nAll '0's that appear *before* the first '2' in the original string `s` can be moved to the very beginning of the string.\nThe '1's can be moved anywhere.\nThe '2's cannot move left past '0's.\n\nConsider the string `s`.\nCount all '1's: `num_ones`.\nFind the index of the first '2'. Let it be `first_two_idx`. If no '2' exists, `first_two_idx` can be considered `len(s)`.\nThe resulting string will be constructed as follows:\n1. Append all '0's that appear in `s` before `first_two_idx`.\n2. Append `num_ones` '1's.\n3. Append all '2's, and all '0's that appear in `s` at or after `first_two_idx`.\n\nLet's test this strategy with examples:\n\nExample 1: `s = \"100210\"`\n`num_ones = 2` (from `s[0]` and `s[4]`)\n`first_two_idx = 3` (character '2' at index 3)\n\n1. '0's before `first_two_idx=3`: `s[1]`='0', `s[2]`='0'. So, \"00\".\n2. `num_ones` '1's: \"11\".\n3. '2's and '0's at or after `first_two_idx=3`: `s[3]`='2', `s[5]`='0'. So, \"20\".\n\nConcatenating these: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\".\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 2: `s = \"11222121\"`\n`num_ones = 4` (from `s[0], s[1], s[5], s[7]`)\n`first_two_idx = 2` (character '2' at index 2)\n\n1. '0's before `first_two_idx=2`: None. So, \"\".\n2. `num_ones` '1's: \"1111\".\n3. '2's and '0's at or after `first_two_idx=2`: `s[2]`='2', `s[3]`='2', `s[4]`='2', `s[6]`='2'. No '0's. So, \"2222\".\n\nConcatenating these: \"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\".\nThis matches the example output.\n\nExample 3: `s = \"20\"`\n`num_ones = 0`\n`first_two_idx = 0` (character '2' at index 0)\n\n1. '0's before `first_two_idx=0`: None. So, \"\".\n2. `num_ones` '1's: \"\".\n3. '2's and '0's at or after `first_two_idx=0`: `s[0]`='2', `s[1]`='0'. So, \"20\".\n\nConcatenating these: \"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\".\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy seems correct. The logic is that '0's and '2's cannot directly swap, so their relative order is fixed. However, '1's can swap with both '0's and '2's, effectively allowing all '1's to be grouped together. To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's. The fixed relative order of '0's and '2's means we can't always put all '0's before all '2's. The compromise is to put all '0's that *can* come first (i.e., those before the first '2'), then all '1's, then the remaining '2's and '0's (which must come after those '2's due to fixed relative order).\n\nImplementation details:\n- Read the input string `s`.\n- Initialize `result_parts = []` to store parts of the final string.\n- Initialize `count_ones = 0`.\n- Find `first_two_idx = -1`. Iterate through `s` to find the index of the first '2' and count '1's.\n- Construct the final string:\n    - Iterate `i` from `0` to `len(s)-1`.\n    - If `s[i]` is '0' and `i < first_two_idx` (or `first_two_idx == -1` if no '2's exist), append '0' to `result_parts`.\n    - If `s[i]` is '1', increment `count_ones`.\n    - If `s[i]` is '2', or `s[i]` is '0' and `i >= first_two_idx`, append `s[i]` to a temporary list `remaining_02_chars`.\n- Join `result_parts`, append `count_ones` '1's, then join `remaining_02_chars`.\n\nLet's refine the construction:\n1. Initialize `ans = []`.\n2. Initialize `ones_count = 0`.\n3. Iterate through `s`. If `char == '1'`, increment `ones_count`.\n4. Find `first_two_encountered = False`.\n5. Iterate through `s` again.\n   - If `char == '0'`:\n     - If `first_two_encountered` is `False`, append '0' to `ans`.\n     - Else (`first_two_encountered` is `True`), append '0' to a temporary list `trailing_chars`.\n   - If `char == '2'`:\n     - If `first_two_encountered` is `False`, set `first_two_encountered = True`.\n     - Append '2' to `trailing_chars`.\n   - If `char == '1'`: (already counted, skip for now)\n6. After the loop, `ans` contains all '0's that appeared before any '2'. `trailing_chars` contains all '2's and any '0's that appeared after the first '2'.\n7. The final string is `\"\".join(ans) + \"1\" * ones_count + \"\".join(trailing_chars)`.\n\nThis looks robust.\n\nConsider edge cases:\n- String with only '0's: \"000\". `ones_count=0`. `first_two_encountered=False`. Loop 1: `ans`=\"000\". Loop 2: `trailing_chars`=\"\". Result: \"000\". Correct.\n- String with only '1's: \"111\". `ones_count=3`. `first_two_encountered=False`. Loop 1: `ans`=\"\". Loop 2: `trailing_chars`=\"\". Result: \"111\". Correct.\n- String with only '2's: \"222\". `ones_count=0`. `first_two_encountered=False`. Loop 1: `char='2'`, `first_two_encountered=True`, `trailing_chars`=\"2\". Loop 2: `char='2'`, `trailing_chars`=\"22\". Loop 3: `char='2'`, `trailing_chars`=\"222\". Result: \"222\". Correct.\n- String like \"2001\": `ones_count=1`. `first_two_encountered=False`.\n  - `s[0]='2'`: `first_two_encountered=True`, `trailing_chars`=\"2\".\n  - `s[1]='0'`: `first_two_encountered=True`, `trailing_chars`=\"20\".\n  - `s[2]='0'`: `first_two_encountered=True`, `trailing_chars`=\"200\".\n  - `s[3]='1'`: skip.\n  Result: \"\" + \"1\" * 1 + \"200\" = \"1200\". Correct.\n\nThis approach is efficient. It iterates through the string a fixed number of times (conceptually two passes, or one pass with conditional logic). String concatenation can be slow in Python if done repeatedly, but building a list of characters and then `\"\".join()` is efficient. The length of the string is up to $10^5$, so $O(N)$ is required. This solution is $O(N)$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    ans_prefix_zeros = []\n    trailing_chars = []\n    ones_count = 0\n    \n    first_two_encountered = False\n    \n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '0':\n            if not first_two_encountered:\n                ans_prefix_zeros.append('0')\n            else:\n                trailing_chars.append('0')\n        elif char_s == '1':\n            ones_count += 1\n        elif char_s == '2':\n            first_two_encountered = True\n            trailing_chars.append('2')\n            \n    result = \"\".join(ans_prefix_zeros) + \"1\" * ones_count + \"\".join(trailing_chars)\n    sys.stdout.write(result + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
