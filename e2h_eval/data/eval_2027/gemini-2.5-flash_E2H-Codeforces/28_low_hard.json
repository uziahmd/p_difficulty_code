String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings.

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown: Beautiful Strings**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. They want me to count \"beautiful strings\".  A string is beautiful if it's only '0's and '1's, has exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, and can be reduced to a single character `g` through a specific modification operation. This modification is the key: replace the last two characters with a new one based on these rules: '00' becomes '1', anything else becomes '0'.\n\nMy initial thought is that this right-to-left reduction process screams \"stack\" or \"recursion.\" The operation consistently focuses on the end of the string, which implies a natural order of processing. I started by representing the '0's and '1's as the integers 0 and 1. The operation can be defined as f(x, y), where f(0, 0) = 1, and f(0,1), f(1,0), and f(1,1) all equal 0.\n\nAfter a bit of mental math, I realized this f(x, y) can be expressed as `1 - (x | y)` using bitwise OR. However, I corrected myself. Instead, f(x, y) equals 1 if and only if x=0 and y=0. This makes the recursive reduction `R(s)` pretty easy to define: Reduce string `s` using `f`, from the right. `R(c_1 c_2 ... c_k) = R(c_1 c_2 ... c_{k-2} f(c_{k-1}, c_k))` until the base case, where the result `R(c) = c`.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many strings actually reduce to `g`. The function is critical - it only produces a '1' when the two previous characters are both '0'.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that, when repeatedly reduced using a specific operation, result in a single character `g`. The operation replaces the two last characters `c_1 c_2` with a new character: `1` if `c_1 c_2` is `00`, and `0` otherwise. This operation is applied until only one character remains.\n\nLet's analyze the reduction operation:\n- `00` -> `1`\n- `01` -> `0`\n- `10` -> `0`\n- `11` -> `0`\n\nThis operation effectively computes `1 - (x | y)` where `x` and `y` are the binary values of the characters, and `|` is the bitwise OR operator.\n\nConsider the parity of the number of ones.\nLet `N_1` be the count of ones in the string.\nLet `N_0` be the count of zeros in the string.\nInitially, `N_1 = m` and `N_0 = n`.\n\nWhen we replace `c_1 c_2` with `c'`:\n1. If `c_1 c_2 = 00`: `N_0` decreases by 2, `N_1` increases by 1. `N_0` changes parity, `N_1` changes parity. Total string length decreases by 1.\n2. If `c_1 c_2 = 01`: `N_0` decreases by 1, `N_1` decreases by 1. `N_0` changes parity, `N_1` changes parity.\n3. If `c_1 c_2 = 10`: `N_0` decreases by 1, `N_1` decreases by 1. `N_0` changes parity, `N_1` changes parity.\n4. If `c_1 c_2 = 11`: `N_1` decreases by 2. `N_1` does not change parity. `N_0` does not change parity.\n\nThis observation about parity is not immediately helpful because the parity of `N_0` and `N_1` changes.\n\nLet's look at the result `R(s)` of reducing a string `s` to a single character.\nThe operations are applied right-to-left. `R(c_1 ... c_k) = R(c_1 ... c_{k-2} f(c_{k-1}, c_k))`.\nThis is equivalent to `c_1` being the first character, and `c_2, ..., c_k` being reduced to a single character `R(c_2 ... c_k)`. Then `R(c_1, R(c_2 ... c_k))` is the final result.\nLet `s = s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\n`R(s_1 ... s_L) = s_1` if `L=1`.\n`R(s_1 ... s_L) = f(s_1, R(s_2 ... s_L))` if `L > 1`.\n\nConsider the effect of the first character `s_1`.\nIf `s_1 = 1`:\n`f(1, X) = 0` for any `X` (0 or 1).\nSo, if `s_1 = 1`, the final result `R(s)` will always be `0`.\nThis means if `g=1`, no string starting with `1` can be a beautiful string.\nIf `g=0`, any string starting with `1` will result in `0`.\n\nIf `s_1 = 0`:\n`f(0, X) = 1` if `X=0`, `0` if `X=1`.\nSo, `R(0 s_2 ... s_L) = 1` if `R(s_2 ... s_L) = 0`.\n`R(0 s_2 ... s_L) = 0` if `R(s_2 ... s_L) = 1`.\nThis means `R(0 s_2 ... s_L) = 1 - R(s_2 ... s_L)`.\n\nLet `R(s)` be the final character.\n- If `s_1 = 1`, then `R(s) = 0`.\n- If `s_1 = 0`, then `R(s) = 1 - R(s_2 ... s_L)`.\n\nWe can generalize this:\n`R(s_1 s_2 ... s_L) = s_1` if `L=1`.\n`R(s_1 s_2 ... s_L) = (s_1 == 0 ? (1 - R(s_2 ... s_L)) : 0)`.\n\nThis is equivalent to: `R(s) = (s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k) mod 2` where `s_i` is the *value* of the i-th character, if the operation was `XOR`. But it's not XOR.\nThe rule `R(0X) = 1-R(X)` and `R(1X) = 0` is crucial.\n\nLet `k` be the count of leading zeros in the string `s`.\nIf `s = 00...01...` (k zeros, then a 1) or `s = 00...0` (k zeros, `L=k`):\n`R(0...0 s_k s_{k+1} ... s_L)`\n`R(0X) = 1 - R(X)`\n`R(00X) = 1 - R(0X) = 1 - (1 - R(X)) = R(X)`\n`R(000X) = 1 - R(00X) = 1 - R(X)`\nIn general, `R(0^k X) = R(X)` if `k` is even, and `R(0^k X) = 1 - R(X)` if `k` is odd.\n\nCase 1: `g=1`.\nFor `R(s)` to be `1`:\n- `s` must start with `0`. (If `s_1=1`, `R(s)=0`).\n- If `s = 0^k X` where `X` is either empty or starts with `1`:\n    - If `k` is even: `R(s) = R(X)`. For `R(s)=1`, we need `R(X)=1`. But `X` starts with `1`, so `R(X)=0`. This path yields `0`.\n    - If `k` is odd: `R(s) = 1 - R(X)`. For `R(s)=1`, we need `R(X)=0`. If `X` starts with `1`, then `R(X)=0` is true.\nSo, for `g=1`, the string must start with an odd number of zeros, followed by a `1`.\n`s = 0...01...` (odd number of leading zeros).\nThis means `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`.\nIf `n=0`, `s` must start with `1` (unless `m=0, n=0` which is `n+m >= 1`). If `n=0`, `m` ones, string is `1...1`. `R(1...1)=0`. So `g=1` is impossible if `n=0`.\nIf `m=0`, `s` is `0...0`. `R(0^n) = 0` if `n` is even, `1` if `n` is odd. So if `m=0`, `g=1` only if `n` is odd.\n\nSummary for `g=1`:\n- If `n=0`: `R(1^m) = 0`. So `g=1` is impossible. Count = 0.\n- If `m=0`: `R(0^n) = 1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even. So `g=1` is possible only if `n` is odd. Count = 1 (the string `0^n`).\n- If `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`:\n    The string must be `0^k 1 ...` where `k` is odd.\n    The remaining `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones can be arranged in any way after the initial `0^k 1`.\n    The number of such strings is the sum of `C( (n-k) + (m-1), (n-k) )` for all odd `k` from `1` to `n`.\n    This is `sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\n    Let `j = n-k`. As `k` goes `1, 3, 5, ...`, `j` goes `n-1, n-3, n-5, ...`.\n    So we sum `C(j+m-1, j)` for `j = n-1, n-3, ...` (non-negative `j`).\n    This is `C(n-1+m-1, n-1) + C(n-3+m-1, n-3) + ...`.\n    This sum is `C(n+m-1, n)` if `n` is odd, and `C(n+m-1, n-1)` if `n` is even.\n    This is a known identity: `sum_{k=0 to X} C(A+k, k)` for `k` of same parity.\n    `sum_{i=0 to floor((N-1)/2)} C(N-2i-1+M, N-2i-1)` where `N=n, M=m-1`.\n    The sum `C(X, 0) + C(X+1, 1) + ... + C(X+K, K)` is `C(X+K+1, K)`. This is not quite it.\n    The identity `sum_{i=0 to k} C(R+i, i)` is `C(R+k+1, k)`.\n    The identity `sum_{i=0 to k} C(R+i, R)` is `C(R+k+1, R+1)`.\n    Our sum is `C(m-1+j, j)` for `j = n-1, n-3, ...`.\n    This is equivalent to `C(m-1+j, m-1)`.\n    Let `A = m-1`. We are summing `C(A+j, A)` for `j = n-1, n-3, ...`.\n    This is `C(A+n-1, A) + C(A+n-3, A) + ...`.\n    This sum is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd, and `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\n    This is `C(n+m-1, n)` if `n` is odd, and `C(n+m-1, n-1)` if `n` is even.\n    This sum is `C(n+m-1, n)` if `n` is odd, and `C(n+m-1, n-1)` if `n` is even.\n    No, this is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd, and `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\n    The correct identity is `sum_{k=0 to N} C(R+k, R)` is `C(R+N+1, R+1)`.\n    Our sum is `sum_{j \\text{ odd}} C(m-1+j, m-1)`.\n    If `n` is odd: `C(m-1+n-1, m-1) + C(m-1+n-3, m-1) + ... + C(m-1+0, m-1)`.\n    This is `C(m+n-2, m-1) + C(m+n-4, m-1) + ... + C(m-1, m-1)`.\n    This sum is `C(n+m-1, m)`.\n    If `n` is even: `C(m-1+n-1, m-1) + C(m-1+n-3, m-1) + ... + C(m-1+1, m-1)`.\n    This sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\n    So for `n>=1, m>=1, g=1`:\n    If `n` is odd, answer is `C(n+m-1, m)`.\n    If `n` is even, answer is `C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\n    Note that `C(N, K) = C(N, N-K)`. So `C(n+m-1, m)` is `C(n+m-1, n-1)`.\n    And `C(n+m-1, m-1)` is `C(n+m-1, n)`.\n    This can be compactly written as `C(n+m-1, n-1)` if `n` is odd, and `C(n+m-1, n)` if `n` is even.\n    This is exactly the number of strings of length `n+m-1` with `n-1` zeros and `m` ones (if `n` odd), or `n` zeros and `m-1` ones (if `n` even). This logic is getting complicated.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sum for `g=1`, `n>=1, m>=1`:\nWe need `s = 0^k 1 X` where `k` is odd. `X` is a string with `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones.\nThe number of such strings `X` is `C((n-k)+(m-1), n-k)`.\nWe sum this for `k=1, 3, ..., n'` where `n'` is the largest odd number less than or equal to `n`.\nLet `N_0 = n-k` and `N_1 = m-1`. We sum `C(N_0+N_1, N_0)` for `N_0 = n-1, n-3, ..., 0 \\text{ or } 1`.\nThis is `sum_{i=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} C(n-1-2i + m-1, n-1-2i)`.\nThis sum is `C(n+m-1, m) = C(n+m-1, n-1)` if `n` is odd.\nThis sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m-1, n)` if `n` is even.\nThis is a standard combinatorial identity related to paths on a grid.\nConsider paths from `(0,0)` to `(x,y)` using only right (R) and up (U) steps. The number of paths is `C(x+y, x)`.\nIf we want to sum paths that pass through `(k, ?)`, etc.\nThis identity is `sum_{i=0}^{k} C(n-i, m)` is `C(n+1, m+1) - C(n-k, m+1)`. (Not this one).\nAnother identity: `sum_{k=0}^{n} C(r+k, k) = C(r+n+1, n)`.\nAnother identity: `sum_{k=0}^{n} C(k, r) = C(n+1, r+1)`.\nThe sum `C(A, B) + C(A+1, B) + ... + C(A+X, B)` is `C(A+X+1, B+1)`.\nOur sum is `C(m-1, m-1) + C(m-1+2, m-1) + ...` (if `n` is odd).\nOr `C(m-1+1, m-1) + C(m-1+3, m-1) + ...` (if `n` is even).\nThis is tricky. Let's use the known result directly.\nThe number of strings with `N_0` zeros and `N_1` ones such that the first `k` zeros are odd and the string starts with `0^k 1` is exactly `C(N_0+N_1-1, N_1-1)` if `N_0` is odd, and `C(N_0+N_1-1, N_1)` if `N_0` is even.\nHere `N_0 = n`, `N_1 = m`.\nSo if `n` is odd, `C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\nIf `n` is even, `C(n+m-1, m)`.\nThis matches the previous result.\n\nCase 2: `g=0`.\nFor `R(s)` to be `0`:\n- If `s_1 = 1`: `R(s) = 0`. Any string starting with `1` works.\n    Number of such strings: `C(n+(m-1), n)` (place `n` zeros in `n+m-1` positions).\n    This is `C(n+m-1, n)`. This is valid if `m >= 1`.\n- If `s_1 = 0`: `R(s) = 1 - R(s_2 ... s_L)`.\n    For `R(s)=0`, we need `R(s_2 ... s_L) = 1`.\n    This means the suffix `s_2 ... s_L` must reduce to `1`.\n    The suffix `s_2 ... s_L` has `n-1` zeros and `m` ones.\n    Using the logic for `g=1` on `(n-1, m)`:\n    - If `n-1=0` (i.e. `n=1`): `R(1^m) = 0`. This path yields `0`. So `R(0 1^m) = 1`. This case contributes `1` string.\n    - If `m=0`: `R(0^{n-1}) = 1` if `n-1` is odd (i.e. `n` is even), `0` if `n-1` is even (i.e. `n` is odd).\n        So if `n` is even and `m=0`, `R(0 0^{n-1}) = R(0^n) = 0`. This path contributes `1` string.\n    - If `n-1 >= 1` and `m >= 1`:\n        If `n-1` is odd (i.e. `n` is even), count is `C((n-1)+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m-2, m-1)`.\n        If `n-1` is even (i.e. `n` is odd), count is `C((n-1)+m-1, m) = C(n+m-2, m)`.\n\nTotal count for `g=0`:\nSum of (strings starting with `1`) + (strings starting with `0` that reduce to `0`).\nIf `m=0`: string is `0^n`. `R(0^n)=0` if `n` is even, `1` if `n` is odd.\n    So if `n` is even, `g=0` is possible. Count = 1.\n    If `n` is odd, `g=0` is impossible. Count = 0.\nIf `n=0`: string is `1^m`. `R(1^m)=0`. So `g=0` is possible. Count = 1.\n\nIf `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`:\nStrings starting with `1`: `C(n+m-1, n)`.\nStrings starting with `0` that reduce to `0`:\n    This means `0` followed by a string `X` (with `n-1` zeros, `m` ones) that reduces to `1`.\n    - If `n-1` is odd (i.e. `n` is even): `C((n-1)+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m-2, m-1)`.\n    - If `n-1` is even (i.e. `n` is odd): `C((n-1)+m-1, m) = C(n+m-2, m)`.\n\nTotal for `g=0`, `n>=1, m>=1`:\nIf `n` is odd: `C(n+m-1, n) + C(n+m-2, m)`.\n    Using Pascal's identity `C(N, K) + C(N, K+1) = C(N+1, K+1)`.\n    `C(n+m-1, n) = C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\n    `C(n+m-2, m)`.\n    No simple identity here.\nIf `n` is even: `C(n+m-1, n) + C(n+m-2, m-1)`.\n    `C(n+m-1, n) = C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\n    `C(n+m-2, m-1)`.\n    No simple identity here.\n\nLet's check the edge cases `n=0` or `m=0` with the formulas.\nIf `m=0`:\n    `g=1`: needs `n` odd. Formula: `C(n-1, 0)` if `n` odd, `C(n-1, -1)` if `n` even. `C(n-1, 0)=1`. Correct.\n    `g=0`: needs `n` even. Formula: `C(n-1, n)` if `n` odd, `C(n-1, n-1)` if `n` even.\n        If `n` odd: `C(n-1, n)` is 0. Correct.\n        If `n` even: `C(n-1, n-1)` is 1.

Expected 0.\n        The general formulas for `n>=1, m>=1` do not apply directly when `n=0` or `m=0`.\n        Special handling for `n=0` or `m=0` is required.\n\nFinal breakdown of cases:\nTotal length `L = n+m`.\nModulo `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\n**1. `g=1`**\n   - If `n=0`: String is `1^m`. `R(1^m) = 0`.

What's wrong?\n\nThe identity for `g=1` for `n>=1, m>=1`:\nIf `n` is odd, `C(n+m-1, m)`.\nIf `n` is even, `C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\nThis counts strings `S` such that `R(S)=1` and `S` contains at least one `0` and at least one `1`.\nLet's check this for `n=1, m=1, g=1`. `n` is odd. `C(1+1-1, 1) = C(1,1) = 1`.\nThis means `01` or `10` would be `1`.\n`R(\"01\") = 0`. `R(\"10\") = 0`.\nSo for `n=1, m=1, g=1`, the answer should be 0. My formula gives 1. This is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-derive `R(0^k X)`.\n`R(0) = 0`\n`R(00) = f(0,0) = 1`\n`R(000) = f(0, R(00)) = f(0,1) = 0`\n`R(0000) = f(0, R(000)) = f(0,0) = 1`\nSo `R(0^k) = 0` if `k` is odd, `1` if `k` is even and `k>=2`. `R(0)=0`.\nThis means `R(0^k) = (k+1)%2` (for `k>=1`).\n\nNow, `R(0^k X)` where `X` is non-empty and starts with `1`.\n`R(0^k 1Y) = R(0^k f(1, R(Y))) = R(0^k 0)` (since `f(1, Z)=0`).\n`R(0^k 0) = R(0^{k+1})`.\nSo `R(0^k 1Y) = (k+1+1)%2 = (k+2)%2 = k%2`.\nSo if `s` starts with `0^k 1`:\n`R(s) = 0` if `k` is even.\n`R(s) = 1` if `k` is odd.\n\nThis simplifies things a lot!\nFor `g=1`:\n  - String must start with `0^k 1` where `k` is odd.\n  - Remaining `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n  - Count: `sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\n  - This sum is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd.\n  - This sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\n  - This is for `n>=1, m>=1`.\n\nFor `g=0`:\n  - String starts with `1`: `R(1X) = 0`.\n    Count: `C(n+m-1, n)` (for `m>=1`).\n  - String starts with `0^k 1` where `k` is even (and `k>=0`): `R(0^k 1X) = 0`.\n    Count: `sum_{k=0, k \\text{ even}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\n    This sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is odd.\n    This sum is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is even.\n    (for `n>=0, m>=1`).\n  - String is `0^n` (i.e., `m=0`): `R(0^n)=0` if `n` is odd.\n    Count: `1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the edge cases `n=0` or `m=0` with these revised rules.\n\n**Revised `g=1` logic:**\n- If `n=0`: String is `1^m`. `R(1^m)=0`. Result 0.\n- If `m=0`: String is `0^n`. `R(0^n) = (n+1)%2`. Result is 1 if `n` is odd, 0 if `n` is even.\n- If `n>=1` and `m>=1`:\n  The string must start with `0^k 1` where `k` is odd.\n  This is `sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\n  This sum is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd.\n  This sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\n  Let's test `n=1, m=1, g=1`. `n` is odd. Formula gives `C(1+1-1, 1) = C(1,1) = 1`.\n  `R(\"01\") = 0`. `R(\"10\") = 0`. So the answer should be 0. My formula gives 1. Still wrong.\n\nThe issue is that `R(0^k 1Y) = k%2` only applies if `Y` is non-empty.\nIf `Y` is empty, i.e., string is `0^k 1`.\n`R(0^k 1) = R(0^{k+1}) = (k+1+1)%2 = k%2`. This rule holds for `Y` empty too.\nSo `R(0^k 1 Suffix) = k%2`.\nThis means:\nIf `g=1`, string must start with `0^k 1` where `k` is odd.\nIf `g=0`, string must start with `1` OR `0^k 1` where `k` is even.\n\nLet's check `n=1, m=1, g=1`.\n`n` is odd. Formula gives `C(1+1-1, 1) = C(1,1) = 1`.\nThis means one string `01` or `10` should satisfy `g=1`.\nBut `R(\"01\")=0` and `R(\"10\")=0`. So for `n=1, m=1, g=1`, the answer is 0. My formula is wrong.\n\nWhat if the string is `0^n` (only zeros)?\n`R(0^n) = (n+1)%2`. So `0^n` results in `1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even.\nWhat if the string is `1^m` (only ones)?\n`R(1^m) = 0`.\n\nLet's use the property that the result is `0` if there is any `1` in the string, AND the first `0` (if any) is followed by `1`.\nNo, that's not it.\n\nLet's trace the values:\n`s_1 s_2 ... s_L`\n`v_L = s_L`\n`v_{L-1} = f(s_{L-1}, v_L)`\n`v_{L-2} = f(s_{L-2}, v_{L-1})`\n...\n`v_1 = f(s_1, v_2)`\nThe final result is `v_1`.\n\nConsider the effect of `1`s.\nIf `s_i = 1`, then `v_{i-1} = f(s_{i-1}, v_i)`.\nIf `s_i = 1`, then `v_{i-1} = f(s_{i-1}, v_i)` is `0` if `s_{i-1}=1`.\nIf `s_i = 1`, then `v_{i-1} = f(s_{i-1}, v_i)` is `0` if `s_{i-1}=0`.\nSo if `s_i = 1`, then `v_{i-1}` becomes `0` regardless of `s_{i-1}` and `v_i`.\nThis means if there is any `1` in the string, say at index `i`, then `v_{i-1}` becomes `0`.\nAnd then `v_{i-2} = f(s_{i-2}, v_{i-1}) = f(s_{i-2}, 0)`.\n`f(0,0)=1`, `f(1,0)=0`.\nSo `v_{i-2}` becomes `1` if `s_{i-2}=0`, `0` if `s_{i-2}=1`.\nThis is `1 - s_{i-2}`.\nThen `v_{i-3} = f(s_{i-3}, v_{i-2}) = f(s_{i-3}, 1-s_{i-2})`.\nIf `s_{i-3}=0`: `f(0, 1-s_{i-2})`. If `1-s_{i-2}=0`, result is `1`. If `1-s_{i-2}=1`, result is `0`. So `s_{i-2}`.\nIf `s_{i-3}=1`: `f(1, 1-s_{i-2}) = 0`.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's use a simpler observation.\nThe value `g` depends only on the parity of `n` and `m` and the first character.\nNo, that's not true.\nThe problem is well known and related to Nim-sum in some variants.\n\nLet's use the property: `R(s_1 ... s_k) = s_1` if `k=1`.\n`R(s_1 ... s_k) = f(s_1, R(s_2 ... s_k))`.\nThis is actually `R(s_1 ... s_k) = f(R(s_1), R(s_2 ... s_k))` if `s_1` is seen as a single-char string.\nThis is not `f(s_1, R(s_2...s_k))`. It's `f(s_{k-1}, s_k)` then `f(s_{k-2}, result)`.\nThe operations are right-associative. `f(s_1, f(s_2, f(..., f(s_{k-1}, s_k)...)))`.\n\nLet's define `val(c)` as the integer value of character `c`.\n`f(x,y) = (x==0 && y==0) ? 1 : 0`.\nLet `s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\n`res = s_L`\nFor `i = L-1` down to `1`:\n  `res = f(s_i, res)`\nThe final `res` is `g`.\n\nLet's look at `f(x, res)`:\n`f(0, 0) = 1`\n`f(0, 1) = 0`\n`f(1, 0) = 0`\n`f(1, 1) = 0`\n\nIf `s_i = 1`, then `f(1, res)` is always `0`.\nSo if there is a `1` at `s_i`, then `res` becomes `0` after processing `s_i`.\nLet `s_j` be the rightmost `1` in the string.\nThen `res` will be `0` after processing `s_j`.\nSo for `s_1 ... s_j ... s_L`, where `s_j` is the rightmost `1`.\n`res` will be `f(s_j, f(s_{j+1}, ... f(s_{L-1}, s_L) ...))`.\nSince `s_j=1`, `res` becomes `0`.\nThen for `i = j-1` down to `1`:\n  `res = f(s_i, res)`\n  `res` starts at `0` (from `s_j`).\n  `f(s_i, 0)`:\n  `f(0,0)=1`\n  `f(1,0)=0`\nSo, if `s_j` is the rightmost `1`, then the final result is determined by `s_1 ... s_{j-1}`.\nLet `s'` be `s_1 ... s_{j-1}`.\n`R(s)` is `R_0(s')` if `s'` is reduced starting with `0`.\n`R_0(s')` means `res` starts at `0`.\n`R_0(s_1 ... s_k) = f(s_1, f(s_2, ... f(s_k, 0) ...))`.\nThis is `1` if `s_k=0`, `0` if `s_k=1`.\n`f(s_i, 0)` is `1` if `s_i=0`, `0` if `s_i=1`. This is `1-s_i`.\nSo `R_0(s_1 ... s_k)` is `f(s_1, f(s_2, ..., f(s_k, 0)))`.\n`f(s_k, 0)` is `1-s_k`.\n`f(s_{k-1}, 1-s_k)` is `1` if `s_{k-1}=0` and `1-s_k=0` (i.e. `s_k=1`).\nThis is `s_k`.\n`f(s_{k-1}, 1-s_k)` is `0` if `s_{k-1}=0` and `1-s_k=1` (i.e. `s_k=0`).\nThis is `s_k`.\n`f(s_{k-1}, 1-s_k)` is `0` if `s_{k-1}=1`. This is `s_k`.\n\nThis means `f(s_{k-1}, 1-s_k) = s_k`.\nLet `A_k = f(s_k, 0) = 1-s_k`.\n`A_{k-1} = f(s_{k-1}, A_k) = f(s_{k-1}, 1-s_k)`.\nIf `s_{k-1}=0`: `f(0, 1-s_k)`. This is `1` if `1-s_k=0` (`s_k=1`), `0` if `1-s_k=1` (`s_k=0`). So `s_k`.\nIf `s_{k-1}=1`: `f(1, 1-s_k) = 0`. So `s_k` if `s_k=0`, `0` if `s_k=1`. This is `s_k` only if `s_k=0`.\nThis `s_k` logic is wrong.\n\nLet `h(x, y)` be the operation.\n`h(0,0)=1`, `h(0,1)=0`, `h(1,0)=0`, `h(1,1)=0`.\nIf string `S` contains at least one `1`:\nLet `j` be the index of the rightmost `1`. `S = S_prefix 1 0^k`.\n`R(S_prefix 1 0^k) = h(S_prefix, h(1, h(0, ... h(0,0)...)))`.\n`h(0,0)=1`.\n`h(0,1)=0`.\n`h(0,0)=1`.\nSo `h(0^k)` value is `(k+1)%2`.\n`h(1, h(0^k))` is `h(1, (k+1)%2)`. This is `0`.\nSo `R(S_prefix 1 0^k)` is `h(S_prefix, 0)`.\nLet `S_prefix = s_1 ... s_{j-1}`.\n`h(s_1, h(s_2, ... h(s_{j-1}, 0) ...))`.\nLet `f_k(val)` be `h(s_k, h(s_{k+1}, ... h(s_{j-1}, val) ...))`.\nWe need `f_1(0)`.\n`f_k(0)`:\n`h(s_k, 0)` is `1` if `s_k=0`, `0` if `s_k=1`. This is `1-s_k`.\nSo `f_{j-1}(0) = 1-s_{j-1}`.\n`f_{j-2}(0) = h(s_{j-2}, f_{j-1}(0)) = h(s_{j-2}, 1-s_{j-1})`.\nIf `s_{j-2}=0`: `h(0, 1-s_{j-1})`. This is `1` if `1-s_{j-1}=0` (i.e. `s_{j-1}=1`), `0` if `1-s_{j-1}=1` (i.e. `s_{j-1}=0`). So `s_{j-1}`.\nIf `s_{j-2}=1`: `h(1, 1-s_{j-1}) = 0`.\nSo `f_{j-2}(0)` is `s_{j-1}` if `s_{j-2}=0`, `0` if `s_{j-2}=1`.\n\nThis pattern is `s_{j-1}` if `s_{j-2}=0`, `0` if `s_{j-2}=1`.\n`f_k(0)`:\nIf `s_k=1`, then `f_k(0)=0`.\nIf `s_k=0`: `f_k(0) = 1 - f_{k+1}(0)`.\nSo if `s_1 ... s_{j-1}` has `k` leading zeros before the first `1` (or end of string).\n`s_1 ... s_{j-1} = 0^k 1 ...` or `0^k`.\nIf `s_1 ... s_{j-1}` ends with `1` (say `s_p=1` is the leftmost `1` in `s_1...s_{j-1}`):\nThen `f_p(0) = 0`.\nThen `f_{p-1}(0) = h(s_{p-1}, 0) = 1-s_{p-1}`.\n`f_{p-2}(0) = h(s_{p-2}, 1-s_{p-1})`.\nThis is exactly the behavior of `R(s_1 ... s_p)` starting with `val=0`.\n\nThe final result `g` is `1` if:\n1. `m=0` (string is `0^n`), and `n` is odd. (e.g. `0`, `000` -> `0`, `00` -> `1`). `R(0^n) = (n+1)%2`. So `g=1` if `n` is odd.\n2. `m>=1` (string contains at least one `1`).\n   Let `s_j` be the rightmost `1`. The result of `h(s_j, h(s_{j+1}, ...))` is `0`.\n   So we are evaluating `h(s_1, h(s_2, ... h(s_{j-1}, 0) ...))`.\n   Let `s' = s_1 ... s_{j-1}`. We want `R_0(s')`.\n   `R_0(s')` is `1` if `s'` has an odd number of zeros, and no `1`s.\n   `R_0(s')` is `0` if `s'` has an even number of zeros, and no `1`s.\n   `R_0(s')` is `0` if `s'` contains any `1`.\n   So, if `m>=1`, `g=1` requires `s_1 ... s_{j-1}` to contain only zeros, and an odd number of them.\n   `s_1 ... s_j ... s_L = 0^k 1 0^{m_0}`.\n   `k` is the number of zeros before the first `1`. `m_0` is the number of zeros after the last `1`.\n   `R(S) = R_0(0^k)`. This is `1` if `k` is odd, `0` if `k` is even.\n   So for `g=1` and `m>=1`:\n   String must be `0^k 1 ...` where `k` is odd.\n   All characters `s_1 ... s_{j-1}` must be `0`. So `j-1 = k`.\n   This means the string must be `0^k 1` followed by any `0`s and `1`s.\n   The total number of zeros before the rightmost `1` must be odd.\n   Let `N_0_prefix` be the number of zeros in `s_1 ... s_{j-1}`.\n   Let `N_1_prefix` be the number of ones in `s_1 ... s_{j-1}`.\n   If `N_1_prefix > 0`, then `R_0(s') = 0`.\n   So `s'` must contain only zeros. `s' = 0^k`. `N_1_prefix=0`.\n   Then `R_0(0^k) = 1` if `k` is odd, `0` if `k` is even.\n   So for `g=1` and `m>=1`: the string must be `0^k 1 X` where `k` is odd.\n   The `X` part contains `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n   The number of such strings is `sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\n   This sum is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd.\n   This sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\n   This is the same formula as before. Let's recheck `n=1, m=1, g=1`. `n` is odd. `C(1,1)=1`. Still 1. But should be 0.\n   What did I miss? The `R_0(s') = 0` if `s'` contains any `1`.\n   If `s_1 ... s_{j-1}` contains a `1`, then `R_0(s_1 ... s_{j-1}) = 0`.\n   Example `n=1, m=1, g=1`.\n   Strings are `01`, `10`.\n   `01`: rightmost `1` is `s_2`. `s' = s_1 = 0`. `R_0(0) = 1`. So `R(\"01\")=1`.\n   This is WRONG. `R(\"01\") = f(0,1) = 0`.\n   My definition `R_0(s_1 ... s_k) = f(s_1, f(s_2, ... f(s_k, 0) ...))` is correct.\n   `R_0(0) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n   `R_0(1) = f(1,0) = 0`.\n   `R_0(00) = f(0, R_0(0)) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n   `R_0(01) = f(0, R_0(1)) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n   `R_0(10) = f(1, R_0(0)) = f(1,1) = 0`.\n   `R_0(11) = f(1, R_0(1)) = f(1,0) = 0`.\n\nThis is the correct `R_0` function.\nSo for `m>=1`, `g` is `R_0(s_1 ... s_{j-1})`.\nWhere `s_j` is the rightmost `1`.\nLet `n_p` be the count of zeros in `s_1 ... s_{j-1}`.\nLet `m_p` be the count of ones in `s_1 ... s_{j-1}`.\n`R_0(s_1 ... s_{j-1})` is `1` if `m_p=0` and `n_p` is odd.\n`R_0(s_1 ... s_{j-1})` is `0` otherwise.\n\nSo for `g=1` and `m>=1`:\n  The string `s_1 ... s_{j-1}` must consist only of zeros, and an odd number of them.\n  This means the string must be `0^k 1 ...` where `k` is odd.\n  The remaining `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones can be anywhere in `...`.\n  The `...` part can contain `1`s.\n  The crucial part is `s_j` is the RIGHTMOST `1`.\n  This means the string must be `0^k 1 0^q` where `k` is odd.\n  `n = k+q`. `m=1`.\n  So for `m=1`, `g=1`: string is `0^k 1 0^q`. `k` is odd.\n  This means `n` must be odd.\n  If `n` is odd, `m=1`: `k` is odd. `q` can be anything.\n  Number of such strings: `n+1` (for `k=0, q=n`; `k=1, q=n-1` ... `k=n, q=0`).\n  `k` must be odd. `k=1, 3, ..., n`.\n  Number of such strings is `(n+1)/2`.\n  Example `n=1, m=1, g=1`. `n` is odd. Result `(1+1)/2 = 1`.\n  Strings: `01`, `10`. `R(\"01\")=0`, `R(\"10\")=0`. This is still incorrect. Answer should be 0.\n\nThe rule: `R(S) = R_0(S_prefix)` where `S_prefix` is the part before the rightmost `1`.\nThis rule only applies if `S` contains at least one `1`.\nIf `S = 0^n`, `R(0^n) = (n+1)%2`.\n\nLet's summarize the conditions for `g`:\n**Case `g=1`:**\n1. String is `0^n` (i.e. `m=0`). Requires `n` to be odd. Count = 1 (if `n` odd, else 0).\n2. String contains at least one `1` (i.e. `m>=1`).\n   Let `s_j` be the rightmost `1`. The string is `s_1...s_{j-1} 1 s_{j+1}...s_L`.\n   All `s_{j+1}...s_L` must be `0`s. Let `q` be the count of these zeros.\n   The value `g` is `R_0(s_1...s_{j-1})`.\n   For `g=1`, `R_0(s_1...s_{j-1})` must be `1`.\n   This means `s_1...s_{j-1}` must be `0^k` (no `1`s), and `k` must be odd.\n   So string must be `0^k 1 0^q` where `k` is odd.\n   This means `m=1`. `n=k+q`.\n   If `m=1`: `n` must be odd. Count = `(n+1)/2`.\n   If `m>1`: Then `s_1...s_{j-1}` must contain at least one `1`. This means `R_0(s_1...s_{j-1}) = 0`. So 0 strings.\n   So if `m>1`, `g=1` is impossible. Count = 0.\n\nLet's test `n=1, m=1, g=1`.\n`m=1`. `n=1` is odd. Count is `(1+1)/2 = 1`.\nThe strings are `01` (`k=1, q=0`) and `10` (`k=0, q=1`).\nMy logic says for `01`: `k=1` is odd. `R_0(0)=1`. So `R(\"01\")=1`. This is wrong. `R(\"01\")=0`.\nThe definition of `R_0(s)` is `f(s_1, f(s_2, ..., f(s_k, 0)...))`.\n`R_0(0) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n`R_0(00) = f(0, R_0(0)) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n`R_0(000) = f(0, R_0(00)) = f(0,0) = 1`.\nSo `R_0(0^k) = (k+1)%2`.\n\nThe final result of `S = s_1 ... s_L` is `g = f(s_1, f(s_2, ..., f(s_L, ?)...))` where `?` is not applicable.\nThe function is `f(x,y) = 1` if `x=0,y=0`, else `0`.\nLet `res` be the final value.\n`res = s_L`\n`res = f(s_{L-1}, res)`\n`res = f(s_{L-2}, res)`\n...\n`res = f(s_1, res)`\n\nIf there is any `1` in the string:\nLet `j` be the largest index such that `s_j=1`.\nThen `res` becomes `f(s_j, f(s_{j+1}, ... f(s_L, s_L) ...))`.\n`f(s_{j+1}, ... f(s_L, s_L) ...)` is `R(s_{j+1} ... s_L)`.\nSince `s_j=1`, `res` becomes `f(1, R(s_{j+1} ... s_L)) = 0`.\nSo after `s_j`, the current result is `0`.\nThen we continue `f(s_{j-1}, 0)`, `f(s_{j-2}, result_of_f(s_{j-1},0))`, etc.\nLet `g_prefix(s_1...s_k)` be the result of `f(s_1, f(s_2, ..., f(s_k, 0) ...))`.\nThis is `R_0(s_1...s_k)` from my previous notation.\nSo if `m>=1`, `g = R_0(s_1...s_{j-1})`.\n`g=1` requires `R_0(s_1...s_{j-1}) = 1`.\nThis means `s_1...s_{j-1}` must be `0^k` and `k` must be odd.\nSo the string must be `0^k 1 ...` where `k` is odd.\nAnd `s_1...s_{j-1}` having no `1`s means `j` is the first `1`.\nThis means string is `0^k 1 X` where `k` is odd.\nThis `X` can contain `1`s.\nBut `j` is the *rightmost* `1`.\nSo `s_1...s_j` contains all `1`s. `s_{j+1}...s_L` must be all `0`s.\nSo string is `0^k 1 0^q` where `k` is odd.\nThis implies `m=1`. `n=k+q`.\nIf `m=1`:\n  `g=1` requires `n` to be odd.\n  The number of strings `0^k 1 0^q` with `k` odd: `(n+1)/2`.\n  Example `n=1, m=1, g=1`. Result `(1+1)/2=1`.\n  Strings: `01` (`k=1, q=0`), `10` (`k=0, q=1`).\n  `R(\"01\") = f(0,1) = 0`.\n  `R(\"10\") = f(1,0) = 0`.\n  Still `0` for both. My result `1` is wrong.\n\nThe `R_0` derivation is correct. So `g=R_0(s_1...s_{j-1})` is correct.\nThe problem is `s_j` is the rightmost `1`.\nIf `s_1...s_{j-1}` contains a `1`, say `s_p=1` for `p<j`.\nThen `R_0(s_1...s_{j-1}) = R_0(s_1...s_{p-1})` (as `s_p=1` makes `f(s_p, X)=0`).\nThis implies `R_0(s_1...s_{j-1}) = 0` if `s_1...s_{j-1}` contains any `1`.\nSo for `g=1` and `m>=1`:\n  The string must be `0^k 1 0^q` where `k` is odd.\n  This means `m=1`. `n=k+q`.\n  If `m=1`: `n` must be odd. Count `(n+1)/2`.\n  If `m>1`: Count `0`.\n\nThis means for `n=1, m=1, g=1`, the answer is 1. But example says 0.\nThis whole interpretation of `g = R_0(s_1...s_{j-1})` is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully. \"replace two last characters ... by exactly one other character\".\n`01010` -> `0100` (replaces `10` with `0`)\n`0100` -> `011` (replaces `00` with `1`)\n`011` -> `00` (replaces `11` with `0`)\n`00` -> `1`\nSo `01010` -> `1`.\nThe example `1 1 0` -> `2`.

My initial interpretation was correct.\n`f(x,y) = (x==0 && y==0) ? 1 : 0`.\nLet `A_i` be the result of reducing `s_i ... s_L`.\n`A_L = s_L`.\n`A_{L-1} = f(s_{L-1}, A_L) = f(s_{L-1}, s_L)`.\n`A_{L-2} = f(s_{L-2}, A_{L-1}) = f(s_{L-2}, f(s_{L-1}, s_L))`.\nThe final result is `A_1`.\n\nLet's analyze `A_i` based on `s_i`.\nIf `s_i = 1`: `A_i = f(1, A_{i+1}) = 0`.\nSo if `s_i = 1`, then `A_i = 0`.\nIf `s_i = 0`: `A_i = f(0, A_{i+1})`.\n  If `A_{i+1}=0`: `A_i = 1`.\n  If `A_{i+1}=1`: `A_i = 0`.\nSo `A_i = 1 - A_{i+1}` if `s_i = 0`.\n\nThis means:\nIf there is any `1` in the string, let `j` be the largest index such that `s_j=1`.\nThen `A_j = 0`.\nFor `i < j`:\n  If `s_i = 1`, then `A_i = 0`.\n  If `s_i = 0`, then `A_i = 1 - A_{i+1}`.\nSo if there is any `1` at `s_k` for `k <= j`, then `A_k = 0`.\nThis implies that if any `s_k = 1` for `k <= j`, then `A_k = 0`.\nSo if `s_1 = 1`, then `A_1 = 0`.\nIf `s_1 = 0`: `A_1 = 1 - A_2`.\n  If `s_2 = 1`: `A_2 = 0`. So `A_1 = 1`.\n  If `s_2 = 0`: `A_2 = 1 - A_3`. So `A_1 = 1 - (1 - A_3) = A_3`.\nThis implies `A_1 = A_k` if `s_1, ..., s_{k-1}` are all `0`s.\nSo if `s = 0^k X ...`\n`A_1 = A_k` if `k` is even.\n`A_1 = 1 - A_k` if `k` is odd.\nThis is `R(0^k X) = R(X)` if `k` even, `1-R(X)` if `k` odd. This is the first rule I had.\n\nLet `R(s)` be the final character.\n- If `s_1 = 1`: `R(s) = 0`.\n- If `s_1 = 0`: `R(s) = 1 - R(s_2 ... s_L)`.\n\n**Summary of `R(s)`:**\n- If `s` contains no `0`s (`s = 1^m`): `R(1^m) = 0`. (since `s_1=1`).\n- If `s` contains no `1`s (`s = 0^n`): `R(0^n) = (n+1)%2`. (since `R(0)=0, R(00)=1, R(000)=0`).\n- If `s` contains both `0`s and `1`s:\n  Let `k` be the number of leading zeros. `s = 0^k 1 X`.\n  `R(s) = R(0^k 1 X)`.\n  If `k` is even: `R(s) = R(1 X)`. Since `1 X` starts with `1`, `R(1 X) = 0`. So `R(s)=0`.\n  If `k` is odd: `R(s) = 1 - R(1 X)`. Since `1 X` starts with `1`, `R(1 X) = 0`.

This is wrong.\n\nThe operations are applied `s_1 s_2 ... s_{L-2} f(s_{L-1}, s_L)`.\nThis is `A_1 = f(s_1, f(s_2, ..., f(s_{L-1}, s_L) ...))`.\nThis is the standard right-associative reduction.\n\nThe `n=2, m=2, g=0` output 4 is the key.\nStrings: `0011`, `0101`, `0110`, `1001`, `1010`, `1100`.\n`R(\"0011\") = f(0, f(0, f(1,1))) = f(0, f(0,0)) = f(0,1) = 0`. (k=2, even. My rule: g=0).\n`R(\"0101\") = f(0, f(1, f(0,1))) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,0) = 1`. (k=1, odd. My rule: g=1).\n`R(\"0110\") = f(0, f(1, f(1,0))) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,0) = 1`. (k=1, odd. My rule: g=1).\n`R(\"1001\") = f(1, f(0, f(0,1))) = f(1, f(0,0)) = f(1,1) = 0`. (Starts with 1. My rule: g=0).\n`R(\"1010\") = f(1, f(0, f(1,0))) = f(1, f(0,0)) = f(1,1) = 0`. (Starts with 1. My rule: g=0).\n`R(\"1100\") = f(1, f(1, f(0,0))) = f(1, f(1,1)) = f(1,0) = 0`. (Starts with 1. My rule: g=0).\n\nSo for `n=2, m=2`:\n`0011` -> `0`\n`0101` -> `1`\n`0110` -> `1`\n`1001` -> `0`\n`1010` -> `0`\n`1100` -> `0`\nTotal `g=0`: 4 strings. Matches example.\nTotal `g=1`: 2 strings.\n\nMy rule for `R(s)` was:\n- If `s=0^n`: `R(s)=(n+1)%2`.\n- If `s` starts with `1`: `R(s)=0`.\n- If `s=0^k 1 Y`: `R(s)=0` if `k` is even, `R(s)=1` if `k` is odd.\nThis rule is consistent with the `f(x,y)` operations.\n\nSo `g=1` means:\n1. `s=0^n` and `n` is odd. (1 string). This implies `m=0`.\n2. `s=0^k 1 Y` and `k` is odd. This implies `m>=1`.\n\n`g=0` means:\n1. `s=0^n` and `n` is even. (1 string). This implies `m=0`.\n2. `s` starts with `1`. This implies `m>=1`.\n3. `s=0^k 1 Y` and `k` is even. This implies `m>=1`.\n\nNow the counting:\n**Total count of strings where `g=1`:**\n- If `m=0`:\n  If `n` is odd: 1 string (`0^n`).\n  If `n` is even: 0 strings.\n- If `m>=1`:\n  We need strings `0^k 1 Y` where `k` is odd.\n  `k` can be `1, 3, 5, ..., n'` where `n'` is largest odd `k <= n`.\n  For each such `k`, the remaining `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones can be arranged in `C(n-k+m-1, n-k)` ways.\n  So sum `C(n-k+m-1, n-k)` for `k=1, 3, ..., n'`.\n  This is the sum `C(m-1+j, j)` for `j = n-1, n-3, ..., 0 \\text{ or } 1`.\n  This sum is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd.\n  This sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\n  Let's check `n=2, m=2, g=1`. `n` is even. Formula: `C(2+2-1, 2-1) = C(3,1) = 3`.\n  My manual trace gave 2 strings (`0101`, `0110`).\n  What is wrong with the sum formula?\n  `k=1` (odd): `C(2-1+2-1, 2-1) = C(2,1)=2`. Strings `0101`, `0110`.\n  `k=3` (odd): `n=2`, so `k` cannot be 3.\n  So for `n=2, m=2, g=1`, the count is 2. This matches my manual trace.\n  The sum `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd, `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even is for `sum_{k=0 to n} C(n-k+m-1, n-k)` for `k` of certain parity.\n\nLet `S_n^m` be the number of strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that result in `1`.\nIf `m=0`: `S_n^0 = 1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even.\nIf `m>=1`: `S_n^m = sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\nThis sum can be computed efficiently.\nLet `j = n-k`. `k` is odd, `j` is `n-1, n-3, ..., 0 \\text{ or } 1`.\nWe sum `C(m-1+j, j)` for `j` from `(n-1)` down to `0` or `1` stepping by 2.\nThis is `C(m-1+n-1, n-1) + C(m-1+n-3, n-3) + ...`.\nThis is `C(m+n-2, n-1) + C(m+n-4, n-3) + ...`.\nThis sum is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd. (This is `C(n+m-1, n-1)`).\nThis sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even. (This is `C(n+m-1, n)`).\nThis is the identity: `sum_{i=0}^{floor((N-1)/2)} C(N-2i-1+M, M)` for `N` zeros, `M` ones.\nThe sum is `C(N+M, M)` if `N` is odd, `C(N+M, M-1)` if `N` is even.\nHere `N` is `n` and `M` is `m-1`.\nSo `S_n^m = C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is odd.\n`S_n^m = C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is even.\nThis is for `m>=1`.\n\nLet's re-check `n=2, m=2, g=1`. `n` is even. `S_2^2 = C(2+2-1, 2) = C(3,2) = 3`.\nMy manual trace got 2.\n`k=1` is odd. `C(n-k+m-1, n-k) = C(2-1+2-1, 2-1) = C(2,1)=2`.\nThe sum only has `k=1`. So `S_2^2=2`.\nThe formula `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is even is wrong.\n\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} C(m-1 + n-1-2i, m-1)`\nLet `N = n-1`.\n`sum_{i=0}^{floor(N/2)} C(m-1+N-2i, m-1)`.\nThis is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd.\nThis is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\nThis identity is correct.\nThe identity comes from paths on a grid.\nNumber of paths from `(0,0)` to `(x,y)` is `C(x+y, x)`.\nIf we require the path to have `k` steps right, `l` steps up.\nThe sum `C(R,R) + C(R+1,R) + ... + C(N,R)` is `C(N+1, R+1)`. (Hockey-stick identity)\nOur sum is `C(m-1 + n-1, m-1) + C(m-1 + n-3, m-1) + ...`.\nLet `R = m-1`.\nSum `C(R+j, R)` for `j = n-1, n-3, ...`.\nIf `n` is odd: `j` goes `n-1, n-3, ..., 0`.\n`C(R+0, R) + C(R+2, R) + ... + C(R+n-1, R)`.\nThis sum is `C(R+n, R+1) = C(m-1+n, m)`.\nIf `n` is even: `j` goes `n-1, n-3, ..., 1`.\n`C(R+1, R) + C(R+3, R) + ... + C(R+n-1, R)`.\nThis sum is `C(R+n, R) = C(m-1+n, m-1)`.\nThis is the correct combinatorial identity.\n\nSo, `S_n^m` (count of strings for `g=1`):\n- If `m=0`: `1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even.\n- If `m>=1`:\n  If `n` is odd: `C(n+m-1, m)`.\n  If `n` is even: `C(n+m-1, m-1)`.\n\nLet's re-check `n=2, m=2, g=1`. `n` is even. `C(2+2-1, 2-1) = C(3,1) = 3`.\nStill 3. But it should be 2.\nThe identity `sum_{i=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} C(m-1 + n-1-2i, m-1)` is for `n` zeros.\n`k` is the count of leading zeros. `s = 0^k 1 Y`.\n`k` can be `0, 1, ..., n`.\nThe number of zeros in `Y` is `n-k`. The number of ones in `Y` is `m-1`.\nSo `Y` has length `n-k+m-1`.\nThe sum `sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\nLet `N_0 = n-k` and `N_1 = m-1`.\nWe sum `C(N_0+N_1, N_0)` for `N_0 = n-1, n-3, ..., 0 \\text{ or } 1`.\nThis is `sum_{i=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} C(m-1 + n-1-2i, n-1-2i)`.\nThis is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd.\nThis is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\nThis is the number of paths from `(0,0)` to `(n+m-1, m)` (or `n+m-1, n-1`) using only `R` and `U` steps, where the number of `R` steps (zeros) is `n-1`, `n-3`, etc.\nThis identity is `sum_{k=0 to X} C(A+k, A)` is `C(A+X+1, A+1)`.\nThe sum is `sum_{j=0}^{J} C(m-1+j, m-1)` where `j` are `n-1, n-3, ...`.\nThis is not a direct application of the hockey stick identity.\nThis sum `C(A, B) + C(A+2, B) + C(A+4, B) + ...` is `C(A+X+1, B+1)` or `C(A+X+1, B)`.\nThis identity is given by `sum_{k=0 to N} C(R+k, R)` is `C(R+N+1, R+1)`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{k} C(n-i, m)` is `C(n+1, m+1) - C(n-k, m+1)`.\nThe specific identity for alternating sums `sum_{k=0, k \\text{ even or odd}}^N C(A+k, B)` is complicated.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sum `sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\nThis is `C(m-1+n-1, n-1) + C(m-1+n-3, n-3) + ...`.\nThis is `C(m+n-2, n-1) + C(m+n-4, n-3) + ...`.\nThis sum can be written as `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd and `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even. This is a known identity.\nThe identity is `sum_{k=0, k \\text{ has same parity as n-1}}^{n-1} C(m-1+k, k) = C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd, and `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\nThis is exactly what I derived.\n\nLet's check `n=2, m=2, g=1`. `n` is even. `C(2+2-1, 2-1) = C(3,1) = 3`.\nThe strings are `0101`, `0110`. These give `g=1`.\n`0101`: `k=1` (odd). `n-k=1, m-1=1`. `C(1+1,1)=C(2,1)=2`.\n`0110`: `k=1` (odd). `n-k=1, m-1=1`. `C(1+1,1)=C(2,1)=2`.\nThe `C(n-k+m-1, n-k)` counts the ways to arrange `Y`.\nFor `n=2, m=2, k=1`: `Y` has `n-k=1` zero and `m-1=1` one.\n`C(1+1,1) = C(2,1) = 2`.\nThe two strings are `010` and `001`.\nSo `0101` (from `0` and `10`) and `0110` (from `0` and `01`).\nThis means my sum for `k=1` gives 2.\nThe sum is only for `k=1` since `n=2`. Max odd `k<=n` is `1`.\nSo `S_2^2 = C(2-1+2-1, 2-1) = C(2,1) = 2`.\nThis matches the manual trace. The identity `C(n+m-1, m-1)` for `n` even is wrong.\n\nThe identity `sum_{i=0 to k} C(R+i, R)` is `C(R+k+1, R+1)`.\nThe sum `C(A,B) + C(A+1,B) + ... + C(X,B)` is `C(X+1, B+1)`.\nLet `R = m-1`.\nThe terms are `C(R+j, R)` where `j` is `n-1, n-3, ...`.\nIf `n` is odd, `j` takes values `n-1, n-3, ..., 0`.\nThe sum is `C(R, R) + C(R+2, R) + ... + C(R+n-1, R)`.\nThis is NOT `C(R+n, R+1)`.\nThis is `C(m-1, m-1) + C(m+1, m-1) + ... + C(m+n-2, m-1)`.\nThis sum is `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd. This is `C(n+m-1, n-1)`.\nIf `n` is even, `j` takes values `n-1, n-3, ..., 1`.\nThe sum is `C(R+1, R) + C(R+3, R) + ... + C(R+n-1, R)`.\nThis sum is `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.

(Count 1)\n2. `m>=1`: `s=0^k 1 Y` and `k` is even.\n   Count is `sum_{k=0, k \\text{ even}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\n\nThis is the exact plan I just tested for `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\nIt gave 1. Example output 2.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that `n=0` or `m=0` are special.\n`n+m>=1`.\n\nIf `n=0`: string is `1^m`. `R(1^m) = 0`.\n  So if `g=1`, count is 0.\n  If `g=0`, count is 1.\n\nIf `m=0`: string is `0^n`. `R(0^n) = (n+1)%2`.\n  So if `g=1`, count is 1 if `n` odd, 0 if `n` even.\n  If `g=0`, count is 1 if `n` even, 0 if `n` odd.\n\nLet's apply these special rules first.\nIf `n=0`:\n  If `g=1`: ans=0.\n  If `g=0`: ans=1.\nIf `m=0`:\n  If `g=1`: ans=1 if `n%2==1` else 0.\n  If `g=0`: ans=1 if `n%2==0` else 0.\n\nNow for `n>=1` and `m>=1`:\n`ans_g1 = 0`.\nFor `k` from `0` to `n` (step by 2, `k` is even):\n  `ans_g1 = (ans_g1 + nCr(n-k+m-1, n-k)) % MOD`.\n\n`ans_g0 = (nCr(n+m, n) - ans_g1 + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nTest with `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\n`n>=1, m>=1`.\n`ans_g1`: `k=0`. `nCr(1-0+1-1, 1-0) = nCr(1,1) = 1`.\n`ans_g0 = (nCr(2,1) - 1 + MOD) % MOD = (2-1+MOD)%MOD = 1`.\nExpected 2.\n\nThe strings are `01`, `10`.\n`R(\"01\")=0`. `k=0` (even). My rule for `0^k X` says `g=1`. This is wrong.\n`R(\"10\")=0`. Starts with `1`. My rule says `g=0`. This is correct.\n\nThe rule `R(0^k X) = 1` if `k` is even, `0` if `k` is odd, is for `X` starting with `1`.\nThis trace is the correct one.\n`R(01) = 0`. `k=0` (even). Rule says `1`.\nThis implies my rule `R(0^k X) = 1` if `k` is even, `0` if `k` is odd, is for `X` not starting with `1`.\n\nThis problem is harder than it looks. The exact interpretation of the operations is key.\n\"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character.\"\nThis is `s_1 s_2 ... s_k s_{k+1}` -> `s_1 s_2 ... f(s_k, s_{k+1})`.\nThis is `s_1 ... s_{L-2} f(s_{L-1}, s_L)`.\nThis is exactly the right-associative reduction `A_1 = f(s_1, f(s_2, ..., f(s_{L-1}, s_L)...))`.\nAnd my traces for `01`, `001`, `0001` are correct.\n`R(01)=0`. `R(001)=1`. `R(0001)=0`.\nThis is `R(0^k 1) = 0` if `k` is odd, `1` if `k` is even.\n\nMy rule for `0^k X` where `X` starts with `1` is `R(0^k 1 Y)`.\n`R(0^k 1 Y) = R(0^k R(1Y))`.\n`R(1Y) = 0`.\nSo `R(0^k 1 Y) = R(0^k 0) = R(0^{k+1})`.\n`R(0^{k+1}) = 1` if `k+1` is odd (i.e., `k` is even).\n`R(0^{k+1}) = 0` if `k+1` is even (i.e., `k` is odd).\n\nThis is the rule!\n`R(s)=1` if and only if:\n1. `s=0^n` and `n` is odd.\n2. `s=0^k 1 Y` and `k` is even.\n\nLet's re-check `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\n`ans_g1`: `m=1`. `k=0` (even). `nCr(1-0+1-1, 1-0) = nCr(1,1) = 1`.\n`ans_g0 = (nCr(2,1) - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 1`.\nExample output 2. This is the problem.\nThis means `01` reduces to `0`. `10` reduces to `0`.\nMy rule says `01` reduces to `1`. This is where the discrepancy is.\n\nThe definition of operations: \"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character\".\n`01010` -> `0100` (replaces `10` with `0`). `f(1,0)=0`. This is `s_4 s_5`.\n`0100` -> `011` (replaces `00` with `1`). `f(0,0)=1`. This is `s_3 s_4`.\n`011` -> `00` (replaces `11` with `0`). `f(1,1)=0`. This is `s_2 s_3`.\n`00` -> `1`. `f(0,0)=1`. This is `s_1 s_2`.\nThe final result is `1`.\n\nThis is the process: `s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\n`temp = s_1`.\nFor `i = 2` to `L`: `temp = f(temp, s_i)`.\nThis is left-associative reduction.\n`R(c_1 c_2 ... c_k) = f(R(c_1 ... c_{k-1}), c_k)`.\n\nLet's use this rule.\n`f(x,y) = 1` if `x=0,y=0`, else `0`.\n`R(01) = f(R(0), 1) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n`R(10) = f(R(1), 0) = f(1,0) = 0`.\nThis matches `n=1, m=1, g=0` -> 2. This is it!\n\nNew rule: `R(s) = 1` iff `s` is `0^n` and `n` is odd.\nAND `s` is `1^m` and `m` is odd. No.\n`R(s) = 1` iff `s` is `0^n` and `n` is odd.\nOR `R(s) = 1` iff `s` contains `1`s and `0`s, and `s` is of the form `X 00` where `R(X)=0`. No.\n\nLet's analyze `f(X,Y)` for left-associative.\n`R(s_1 ... s_L)`.\nIf `s_L = 1`: `R(s_1 ... s_L) = f(R(s_1 ... s_{L-1}), 1) = 0`.\nSo if string ends with `1`, result is `0`.\nIf `s_L = 0`: `R(s_1 ... s_L) = f(R(s_1 ... s_{L-1}), 0)`.\n  If `R(s_1 ... s_{L-1})=0`: `R(s_1 ... s_L) = 1`.\n  If `R(s_1 ... s_{L-1})=1`: `R(s_1 ... s_L) = 0`.\nSo if string ends with `0`, `R(s) = 1 - R(s_1 ... s_{L-1})`.\n\nThis means:\n`R(s) = 0` if `s` ends with `1`.\n`R(s) = 1` if `s` ends with `0` AND `R(s_1 ... s_{L-1}) = 0`.\n`R(s) = 0` if `s` ends with `0` AND `R(s_1 ... s_{L-1}) = 1`.\n\nLet `N_0_trail` be the number of trailing zeros. `s = X 0^k`.\n`R(X 0^k) = R(X)` if `k` is even.\n`R(X 0^k) = 1 - R(X)` if `k` is odd.\n\nSo `g=1` if:\n1. `s` ends with `1`. (Impossible, `R(s)=0`).\n2. `s` ends with `0`. `s = X 0^k`.\n   If `k` is even: `R(X)=1`.\n   If `k` is odd: `R(X)=0`.\n\nThis is for `g=1`.\nIf `m=0`: `s=0^n`. `k=n, X` is empty. `R(\"\")` is not defined.\nBase case: `R(c)=c`.\n`R(0) = 0`.\n`R(00) = f(R(0),0) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n`R(000) = f(R(00),0) = f(1,0) = 0`.\n`R(0000) = f(R(000),0) = f(0,0) = 1`.\nSo `R(0^n) = 0` if `n` is odd, `1` if `n` is even. (This is `n%2` for `n>=1`).\nMy first derivation for `R(0^n)` was `(n+1)%2`. This is `1-n%2`.\n`R(0)=0`, `R(00)=1`, `R(000)=0`. This matches `n%2`.\nSo `R(0^n) = n%2`.\n\nSo for `g=1`:\n1. `m=0`: `s=0^n`. `n` must be even. (Count 1).\n2. `m>=1`: `s` must end with `0`. `s = X 0^k`.\n   `R(s) = R(X)` if `k` is even.\n   `R(s) = 1 - R(X)` if `k` is odd.\n   `X` must end with `1` (since `s` ends with `0`, `X` can't end with `0`).\n   If `X` ends with `1`, then `R(X)=0`.\n   So:\n   If `k` is even: `R(s) = R(X) = 0`. (Impossible for `g=1`).\n   If `k` is odd: `R(s) = 1 - R(X) = 1 - 0 = 1`. (Possible for `g=1`).\n   So `g=1` requires `s` to end with an odd number of zeros.\n   And `s_L=0, s_{L-1}=0, ..., s_{L-k+1}=0`, and `s_{L-k}=1`.\n   String is `Y 1 0^k` where `k` is odd.\n   `Y` has `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n   Count is `sum_{k=1, k \\text{ odd}}^n C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\n   This is the same sum as before.\n   `C(n+m-1, m)` if `n` is odd.\n   `C(n+m-1, m-1)` if `n` is even.\n   This is the identity that needs `m-1` to be `R`.\n\nLet `ans_g1` be the count for `g=1`.\n1. If `m=0`: `ans_g1 = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd.\n2. If `m>=1`:\n   `ans_g1 = 0`.\n   For `k` from `1` to `n` (step by 2, `k` is odd):\n     `ans_g1 = (ans_g1 + nCr(n-k+m-1, n-k)) % MOD`.\n\nLet's check `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\n`n>=1, m>=1`.\n`ans_g1`: `k=1`. `nCr(1-1+1-1, 1-1) = nCr(0,0) = 1`.\n`ans_g0 = (nCr(2,1) - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 1`.\nExpected 2.\n\nThe strings are `01`, `10`.\n`R(\"01\") = 0`. Ends with `1`. Rule: `g=0`.\n`R(\"10\") = 0`. Ends with `0`. `k=1` (odd). `X` is `1`. `R(X)=1`.\n   My rule `R(X 0^k) = 1 - R(X)` if `k` is odd.\n   So `R(\"10\") = 1 - R(\"1\") = 1 - 1 = 0`. Rule: `g=0`.\nSo for `n=1, m=1`: `01` gives `g=0`. `10` gives `g=0`.\nBoth give `g=0`. Total 2. This matches example output!\n\nLet's check `n=2, m=2, g=0`.\n`n>=1, m>=1`.\n`ans_g1`: `k=1`. `nCr(2-1+2-1, 2-1) = nCr(2,1) = 2`.\n`ans_g0 = (nCr(4,2) - 2 + MOD) % MOD = (6 - 2 + MOD) % MOD = 4`.\nThis matches example output!\n\nThis means the left-associative reduction and derived rules are correct.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Handle `n=0` or `m=0` cases first as they are simple and edge cases for general formulas.\n   - If `n=0` (string `1^m`): `R(1^m)=1` (if `m=0` only, but `n+m>=1` implies `m>=1`).\n     `R(1^m)=1` if `m=0` (this is `R(\"\")`, not well defined).\n     `R(1)=1`. `R(11)=f(1,1)=0`. `R(111)=f(0,1)=0`.\n     So `R(1^m)=1` if `m=1`, `0` if `m>=2`.\n     If `n=0`:\n       If `m=1`: `R(\"1\")=1`.\n         If `g=1`: ans=1.\n         If `g=0`: ans=0.\n       If `m>=2`: `R(\"1^m\")=0`.\n         If `g=1`: ans=0.\n         If `g=0`: ans=1.\n   - If `m=0` (string `0^n`): `R(0^n)=n%2`.\n     If `g=1`: ans=1 if `n%2==1` else 0.\n     If `g=0`: ans=1 if `n%2==0` else 0.\n     (Note: `n=0, m=0` is impossible as `n+m>=1`).\n\n2.
