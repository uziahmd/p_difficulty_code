Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Strategy for Counting Non-Degenerate Triangles**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to count the valid triangles given ranges for the sides.  We're looking for integer triples (x, y, z) where `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D` and `x + y > z`. The triangle inequality is key here, but given the ordered ranges, most of it simplifies.  `y + z > x` and `x + z > y` are automatically satisfied, leaving us to focus on `x + y > z`.\n\nMy initial thought was a nested loop, iterating over x and y, and then finding the range of valid z values.  But the constraints on `A, B, C, D` (up to 5e5) make this too slow, resulting in O(N^2) time complexity. We need to be more efficient.\n\nThe core idea is to realize that for fixed `x` and `y`, the valid `z` values form a contiguous range:  `C <= z < x + y`, up to a maximum of `D`. The count of such `z` would be `max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)`.\n\nIterating directly over `x` and `y` remains slow though. The ranges can be large.\n\nA smarter approach emerged. Let's fix `k = x + y`.  Then `k` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`.  For each `k`, we count the valid pairs of `(x, y)` whose sum is `k`.  The condition `B <= y` implies `x <= B`, so `num_pairs(k)` would count pairs `(x, y)` satisfying the constraints. Calculating  `num_pairs(k)` efficiently became another task.\n`B <= y <= C` and `A <= x <= B` and `x+y=k` so `B <= k -x <= C` or `k-C <=x <=k -B`. and `x` should also meet `A<= x<=B` therefore `max(A,k-C)<=x<=min(B,k-B)` or `num_pairs(k) = max(0, min(B, k - B) - max(A, k - C) + 1)` which is O(1) time.\nAnd the number of valid values for `z`, can be precomputed as a function of `k`.\nFor each k in the valid range  `count_z(k) = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)` where `count_z(k)` gives the number of `z`s where `z< k` and `C <= z <= D`.\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum of these products over all valid `k` values.\n\nThis approach gives an overall time complexity of O(C-A), which is perfectly within the time limit. This will count valid pairs for a specific sum, and within the constraints which can then efficiently calculate the possible range for z.\n\nThe range of `k` is from `A + B` to `B + C`. The key insight is efficiently computing `num_pairs(k)` and the simple range calculations for `count_z(k)`.   The maximum possible value for `k = 10^6` which is fine. The code is just a simple for loop with constant time calculations per loop, giving total complexity, O(C-A).\n\nThe final count will be calculated with the formula: `total_triangles = sum_{k=A+B to B+C} num_pairs(k) * count_z(k)`.\n\nEdge cases like `A=B=C=D` are handled correctly as well, because `num_pairs(k)` will be 1 and `count_z(k)` will be calculated accordingly, correctly yielding 1 valid triangle in the special case where  `x=y=z`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` that satisfy the conditions `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x`, `y`, `z`, the triangle inequality must hold:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nWe are given the ordering `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`. From this, we can deduce `x <= y` and `y <= z`, which implies `x <= z`.\nLet's check the triangle inequalities with these ordering constraints:\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= B >= A >= 1` and `z >= C >= B >= A >= 1`, and `y >= x`, `z >= x`, then `y + z >= x + x = 2x`. Since `x >= 1`, `2x > x`. So `y + z > x` is always satisfied.\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, then `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. So `x + z > y` is always satisfied.\n- `x + y > z`: This is the only condition that is not automatically satisfied by the given ranges and ordering.\n\nSo, we need to count integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (or equivalently, `z <= x + y - 1`)\n\nCombining conditions 3 and 4, for fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy:\n`C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`\n\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate `x`, `y`, and then calculate `z`, which would be `O((B-A)(C-B)(D-C))`, too slow given `D` up to `5 * 10^5`. A double loop over `x` and `y` would be `O((B-A)(C-B))`, which is also too slow if `B-A` and `C-B` are large (e.g., `2.5e5 * 2.5e5`).\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let `k = x + y`.\nThe minimum possible value for `k` is `A + B`.\nThe maximum possible value for `k` is `B + C`.\nThe range of `k` is `[A+B, B+C]`. The maximum value for `B+C` is `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`. This range is manageable.\n\nLet's iterate `k` from `A + B` to `B + C`. For each `k`:\n1. Calculate `num_pairs(k)`: the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = k`, `A <= x <= B`, and `B <= y <= C`.\n2. Calculate `count_z(k)`: the number of valid `z` values for this sum `k`. This is `max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe total number of triangles will be the sum of `num_pairs(k) * count_z(k)` for all valid `k`.\n\nLet's detail `num_pairs(k)`:\nGiven `x + y = k`, we have `y = k - x`.\nThe constraints on `x` are `A <= x <= B`.\nThe constraints on `y` are `B <= y <= C`. Substituting `y = k - x`:\n`B <= k - x <= C`\nThis implies:\n`k - C <= x <= k - B`\n\nCombining all constraints on `x`:\n`x` must be in the range `[max(A, k - C), min(B, k - B)]`.\nLet `lower_x = max(A, k - C)` and `upper_x = min(B, k - B)`.\nThen `num_pairs(k) = max(0, upper_x - lower_x + 1)`.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Loop `k` from `A + B` to `B + C` (inclusive):\n   a. Calculate `lower_x = max(A, k - C)`.\n   b. Calculate `upper_x = min(B, k - B)`.\n   c. Calculate `num_pairs_k = max(0, upper_x - lower_x + 1)`.\n   d. Calculate `lower_z = C`.\n   e. Calculate `upper_z = min(D, k - 1)`.\n   f. Calculate `count_z_k = max(0, upper_z - lower_z + 1)`.\n   g. Add `num_pairs_k * count_z_k` to `total_triangles`.\n3. Print `total_triangles`.\n\nTime Complexity:\nThe loop for `k` runs from `A+B` to `B+C`. The number of iterations is `(B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1`.\nSince `A >= 1` and `C <= 5 * 10^5`, the maximum number of iterations is approximately `5 * 10^5`.\nInside the loop, all calculations are `O(1)`.\nTherefore, the total time complexity is `O(C - A)`, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\nMaximum value of `total_triangles`:\nThe maximum value of `num_pairs_k` is roughly `B-A+1` (or `C-B+1`), which can be up to `5*10^5`.\nThe maximum value of `count_z_k` is roughly `D-C+1`, which can be up to `5*10^5`.\nThe number of iterations is up to `5*10^5`.\nIn the worst case, `num_pairs_k` might be small, and `count_z_k` might be large.\nFor example, if `A=1, B=1, C=5e5, D=5e5`. `k` goes from `2` to `5e5+1`. `num_pairs_k` would be 1. `count_z_k` could be `5e5`. Summing `5e5` times, `5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5 * 10^11`. This fits in a 64-bit integer type (like Python's arbitrary-precision integers or C++ `long long`).\n\nLet's test with the provided examples:\n1. `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n   `k` ranges from `1+2=3` to `2+3=5`.\n   - `k=3`: `lower_x = max(1, 3-3) = 1`, `upper_x = min(2, 3-2) = 1`. `num_pairs_k = 1-1+1 = 1`.\n     `lower_z = 3`, `upper_z = min(4, 3-1) = 2`. `count_z_k = max(0, 2-3+1) = 0`.\n     Contribution: `1 * 0 = 0`.\n   - `k=4`: `lower_x = max(1, 4-3) = 1`, `upper_x = min(2, 4-2) = 2`. `num_pairs_k = 2-1+1 = 2`.\n     `lower_z = 3`, `upper_z = min(4, 4-1) = 3`. `count_z_k = max(0, 3-3+1) = 1`.\n     Contribution: `2 * 1 = 2`.
