He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing String Formation: My Pythonic Pursuit**\n\nAlright, so I've got this string, `S`, and the task is to determine if it aligns with these specific formation rules. Let's break down how I'm thinking about this, focusing on the core logic and constraints.\n\nFirst off, I visualize the process. It's essentially a three-step string construction: starting with some 'a's (`count_a`), then appending 'b's (`count_b`), and finally, adding 'c's (`count_c`). The crucial part is that `count_a` and `count_b` must be at least 1, and `count_c` has to equal either `count_a` or `count_b`, or potentially both.\n\nNow, my mind shifts to analyzing the structure. The resulting string has a rigid form: `a...ab...bc...c`. This immediately implies a need for a linear check: all 'a's, followed by all 'b's, and ending with all 'c's. No mixing allowed!\n\nTo formalize this, I'm thinking about counting. I'll need to determine `num_a`, `num_b`, and `num_c` â€“ the total occurrences of each character in `S`. This naturally leads me to define some core conditions.\n\nThe first, and arguably the most important, is the **order of characters**. The string *must* be strictly `a...ab...bc...c`. How do I verify that? I can iterate through the string, enforcing this sequential pattern:\n\n1.  **Start in a state expecting 'a's.** If I see anything else, it's immediately invalid.\n2.  Once I encounter a 'b', I transition to a state where I'm expecting 'b's.  From this point, I shouldn't see 'a's anymore.\n3.  Upon finding a 'c', I move to a state where only 'c's are expected.  Neither 'a' nor 'b' should appear after the first 'c'.\n\nEffectively, I'll need a way to track the state of this scan as I iterate through `S`, using a state variable (`0` expecting 'a', `1` expecting 'b', `2` expecting 'c') seems like a good path.\n\nThis ordered structure is essential, but I also need to ensure that the counts follow the `count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b` rule. This will be the second major check after confirming the order of the characters. This condition means I'll need to keep track of the counts of each of the characters and then check to see if those characters satisfy the relationship.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed by a specific three-step process involving characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nLet's break down the rules:\n\n1.  **A's step:** Starts with some number of 'a's. Let `num_a` be this count. `num_a >= 1`.\n2.  **B's step:** Appends some number of 'b's to the end. Let `num_b` be this count. `num_b >= 1`.\n    At this point, the string is `a...ab...b`. It's guaranteed `num_a >= 1` and `num_b >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step:** Appends some number of 'c's to the end. Let `num_c` be this count.\n    The rule for `num_c` is: `num_c == num_a` OR `num_c == num_b`.\n\nFrom these rules, we can deduce the following necessary conditions for a string `S` to be valid:\n\n1.  **Character Order:** The string must consist of a block of 'a's, followed by a block of 'b's, followed by a block of 'c's. Any deviation from this order (e.g., 'acb', 'ba', 'abcab') makes the string invalid.\n    *   This means all 'a's must appear first.\n    *   All 'b's must appear after all 'a's and before all 'c's.\n    *   All 'c's must appear after all 'b's.\n\n2.  **Minimum Counts:**\n    *   Since A starts with at least one 'a', `num_a` must be at least 1.\n    *   Since B appends at least one 'b', `num_b` must be at least 1.\n    *   Since C appends 'c's based on `num_a` or `num_b`, and both `num_a` and `num_b` are at least 1, `num_c` must also be at least 1.\n    *   Therefore, the string `S` must contain at least one 'a', at least one 'b', and at least one 'c'.\n\n3.  **C's Rule:** The total count of 'c's in the string (`num_c`) must be equal to the total count of 'a's (`num_a`) OR equal to the total count of 'b's (`num_b`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialize counts and state:**\n    *   `count_a = 0`, `count_b = 0`, `count_c = 0`\n    *   `state = 0` (0: expecting 'a', 1: expecting 'b', 2: expecting 'c')\n\n2.  **Iterate through the string `S`:**\n    *   For each character `char` in `S`:\n        *   If `state == 0` (expecting 'a'):\n            *   If `char == 'a'`, increment `count_a`.\n            *   If `char == 'b'`, transition to `state = 1` and increment `count_b`.\n            *   If `char == 'c'`, the order is incorrect (cannot have 'c' before 'a' or 'b'). Print \"NO\" and exit.\n        *   If `state == 1` (expecting 'b'):\n            *   If `char == 'a'`, the order is incorrect (cannot have 'a' after 'b'). Print \"NO\" and exit.\n            *   If `char == 'b'`, increment `count_b`.\n            *   If `char == 'c'`, transition to `state = 2` and increment `count_c`.\n        *   If `state == 2` (expecting 'c'):\n            *   If `char == 'a'` or `char == 'b'`, the order is incorrect (cannot have 'a' or 'b' after 'c'). Print \"NO\" and exit.\n            *   If `char == 'c'`, increment `count_c`.\n\n3.  **After iterating through the entire string, check final conditions:**\n    *   **Minimum counts:**\n        *   If `count_a == 0` (no 'a's), print \"NO\".\n        *   If `count_b == 0` (no 'b's), print \"NO\".\n        *   If `count_c == 0` (no 'c's), print \"NO\".\n        *   (Note: The state transitions ensure that if `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` are all > 0, they appear in the correct order `a...ab...bc...c`. For example, `count_a` becomes non-zero only in state 0, `count_b` becomes non-zero only in state 0 or 1, and `count_c` only in state 1 or 2. If `count_b` is 0, it implies we never transitioned to state 1. If `count_c` is 0, we never transitioned to state 2. So if `count_a > 0` and `count_b > 0` and `count_c > 0`, the order is guaranteed.)\n\n    *   **C's rule:**\n        *   If `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`, then all conditions are met. Print \"YES\".\n        *   Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Walkthroughs:**\n\n*   **`S = \"aaabccc\"`**\n    *   `a`: `count_a=1`, `state=0`\n    *   `a`: `count_a=2`, `state=0`\n    *   `a`: `count_a=3`, `state=0`\n    *   `b`: `count_b=1`, `state=1`\n    *   `c`: `count_c=1`, `state=2`\n    *   `c`: `count_c=2`, `state=2`\n    *   `c`: `count_c=3`, `state=2`\n    *   End of string.\n    *   `count_a=3`, `count_b=1`, `count_c=3`. All > 0.\n    *   Is `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3)? Yes.\n    *   Print \"YES\".\n\n*   **`S = \"bbacc\"`**\n    *   `b`: `count_b=1`, `state=1` (transition from state 0 to 1 immediately as first char is 'b')\n    *   `b`: `count_b=2`, `state=1`\n    *   `a`: Order incorrect (`a` after `b`). Print \"NO\".\n\n*   **`S = \"aabc\"`**\n    *   `a`: `count_a=1`, `state=0`\n    *   `a`: `count_a=2`, `state=0`\n    *   `b`: `count_b=1`, `state=1`\n    *   `c`: `count_c=1`, `state=2`\n    *   End of string.\n    *   `count_a=2`, `count_b=1`, `count_c=1`. All > 0.\n    *   Is `count_c == count_a` (1 == 2)? No.\n    *   Is `count_c == count_b` (1 == 1)? Yes.\n    *   Print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach covers all conditions efficiently. The time complexity will be O(|S|) because we iterate through the string once. The space complexity will be O(1) as we only use a few variables for counts and state.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n\n    # State machine:\n    # 0: Expecting 'a'\n    # 1: Expecting 'b' (after 'a's)\n    # 2: Expecting 'c' (after 'b's)\n    state = 0 \n\n    for char in s:\n        if state == 0: # Expecting 'a'\n            if char == 'a':\n                count_a += 1\n            elif char == 'b':\n                state = 1\n                count_b += 1\n            else: # char == 'c'\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        elif state == 1: # Expecting 'b'\n            if char == 'b':\n                count_b += 1\n            elif char == 'c':\n                state = 2\n                count_c += 1\n            else: # char == 'a'\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        else: # state == 2, Expecting 'c'\n            if char == 'c':\n                count_c += 1\n            else: # char == 'a' or char == 'b'\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n    \n    # After iterating through the string, check final conditions:\n    # 1.
