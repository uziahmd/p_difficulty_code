    "thought": "**Gluttony Problem - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Gluttony\" problem, and the goal is to permute an array `a` into an array `b` such that the sums of elements in any proper subset of `a` and the corresponding elements in `b` are always different.  The constraint `n <= 22` is the key. It screams \"exponential complexity might be acceptable,\" so I'm thinking something along the lines of `O(n * 2^n)` or maybe even `O(2^n)`. But wait, generating a `b` *and* checking all the subset sums against the original seems like it could easily blow up to `O(4^n)`, which is a no-go. I have to be careful here.\n\nLet me rephrase this condition: I'm essentially searching for a permutation `p` such that if `b[i] = a[p[i]]`, then the sum of any subset of `a`'s elements isn't equal to the sum of the corresponding permuted elements in `b`.\n\nLet's look at some small cases to see if there's a pattern. For `n=1`, the problem's criteria are vacuously true, since the problem statement says we should be considering *proper* subsets, and there are none when n=1. So, `b` is just `a` in this case.\n\nFor `n=2`, with `a = [a0, a1]`, the proper subsets are `{0}` and `{1}`.  I need to ensure that `a[0] != b[0]` and `a[1] != b[1]`.  The only possible permutation is `b = [a1, a0]`. Simple enough.\n\nI think I need to figure out an efficient way to check this condition, maybe some kind of clever pruning to reduce checking every single subset. Let's start with the brute force approach first.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements in `a` at these indices is different from the sum of elements in `b` at these indices. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`. The constraints are `n <= 22` and `0 <= a_i <= 10^9`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition. We need to find a permutation `b` of `a`. This means `b` is `a` with its elements reordered. If we sort `a` first, say `a_sorted`, then any permutation `b` of `a_sorted` will still be a permutation of the original `a`. The specific values `a_i` matter, not their original positions. So, without loss of generality, we can sort the input array `a` in ascending order. Let the sorted array be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n\nConsider the simplest possible non-identity permutation: a cyclic shift.\nIf `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}` for all `i`, then `b` is `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\nLet's check if this permutation satisfies the condition.\n\nSuppose `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} b_i` for some subset `S`.\nWith `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}`, this means `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} a_{(i+1) % n}`.\n\nConsider the sorted array `a = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`.\nIf we construct `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\nThis is a permutation of `a`.\n\nLet's test this strategy with the examples:\n1. `n=2`, `a = [1, 2]`.\n   Sorted `a = [1, 2]`.\n   Construct `b = [a_1, a_0] = [2, 1]`.\n   Subsets `S`:\n   * `S = {0}`: `a[0] = 1`, `b[0] = 2`. `1 != 2`. OK.\n   * `S = {1}`: `a[1] = 2`, `b[1] = 1`. `2 != 1`. OK.\n   The output is `2 1`. This matches the example.\n\n2. `n=4`, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n   Sorted `a = [1, 10, 100, 1000]`. Let's call this `a_s`.\n   Construct `b = [a_s[1], a_s[2], a_s[3], a_s[0]] = [10, 100, 1000, 1]`.\n   The output for this example is `100 1 1000 10`. This is a different permutation.\n   The example output `100 1 1000 10` is a permutation of `[1, 10, 100, 1000]`.\n   Let's check the example output `b_e = [100, 1, 1000, 10]` against the original input `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n   The problem states `b` must be a permutation of `a`. The example output is a permutation of `a`.\n   The problem asks us to print `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n`. This implies `b` should be printed in that order.\n\nThe key observation for this problem is that if `a` contains distinct integers, and we sort `a` and then apply a cyclic shift to get `b`, it is highly unlikely that `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} b_i` for any proper non-empty subset `S`. This is because the values `a_i` are distinct and potentially spread out. By shifting, we are replacing `a_i` with `a_{(i+1)%n}`. If `a_i` is replaced by a significantly different value, the sum is likely to change.\n\nConsider the sum `sum_{i in S} a_i` and `sum_{i in S} a_{(i+1)%n}`.\nIf `S` does not include `n-1` (the last index), then `(i+1)%n` is just `i+1` for all `i` in `S`.\nIn this case, `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} a_{i+1}`.\nLet `S = {x_1, ..., x_k}`. Then `sum_{j=1}^k a_{x_j} = sum_{j=1}^k a_{x_j+1}`.\nSince `a` is sorted and distinct, `a_i < a_{i+1}` for all `i`.\nIf all `x_j+1` are distinct from all `x_j`, and `x_j+1` is not `x_j` for any `j`, then this equality would imply `a_{x_j} = a_{x_j+1}` for some `j` (if `k=1`), or more generally, it would imply that the set of values `{a_{x_j}}` is the same as `{a_{x_j+1}}`. This is impossible because `a_{x_j} < a_{x_j+1}` for all `j`.\nFor example, if `S = {0, 1}`, then `a_0 + a_1 = a_1 + a_2`. This implies `a_0 = a_2`, which is false since `a_0 < a_1 < a_2`.\nThis argument holds if the indices `x_j` and `x_j+1` are all within the bounds of `a` and there are no overlaps.\n\nThe only case where `(i+1)%n` differs from `i+1` is when `i = n-1`.\nSo, if `n-1` is not in `S`, then `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} a_{i+1}`.\nSince `a_i` are distinct and sorted, `a_i < a_{i+1}`.\nFor any `i \\in S`, `a_i < a_{i+1}`. Therefore, `sum_{i \\in S} a_i < sum_{i \\in S} a_{i+1}`.\nThis means `sum_{i \\in S} a_i != sum_{i \\in S} a_{i+1}` is always true if `n-1` is not in `S`.\n\nWhat if `n-1` *is* in `S`?\nLet `S = S' \\cup \\{n-1\\}`, where `n-1 \\notin S'`.\nThen `sum_{i \\in S} a_i = sum_{i \\in S'} a_i + a_{n-1}`.\nAnd `sum_{i \\in S} b_i = sum_{i \\in S'} a_{i+1} + a_{(n-1+1)%n} = sum_{i \\in S'} a_{i+1} + a_0`.\nWe need to check if `sum_{i \\in S'} a_i + a_{n-1} = sum_{i \\in S'} a_{i+1} + a_0`.\nRearranging, `a_{n-1} - a_0 = sum_{i \\in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)`.\nSince `a_i` are distinct and sorted, `a_{i+1} - a_i > 0` for all `i`.\nThus, `sum_{i \\in S'} (a_{i+1} - a_i)` is always positive.\nThe left side `a_{n-1} - a_0` is also positive (since `a_0` is the smallest and `a_{n-1}` is the largest).\nHowever, it's very specific for these two sums to be exactly equal.\nFor `n <= 22`, the number of subsets is `2^n`. Trying to find a counterexample by brute force would be too slow.\nThe problem statement implies that such a construction always exists, or is very easy to find. The \"very easy question\" note strongly suggests this simple cyclic shift strategy.\n\nLet's prove that `sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} a_{(i+1)%n}` cannot hold for `0 < k < n` if `a` is sorted and distinct.\nAssume for contradiction that `sum_{i \\in S} a_i = sum_{i \\in S} a_{(i+1)%n}` for some `S`.\nLet `S_0 = \\{i \\in S \\mid i < n-1\\}` and `S_1 = \\{i \\in S \\mid i = n-1\\}`.\nIf `S_1` is empty, then `n-1 \\notin S`. For all `i \\in S`, `(i+1)%n = i+1`.\nThen `sum_{i \\in S} a_i = sum_{i \\in S} a_{i+1}`.\nSince `a_i < a_{i+1}` for all `i`, `sum_{i \\in S} a_i < sum_{i \\in S} a_{i+1}`.\nThis is a contradiction. So `S_1` cannot be empty, meaning `n-1 \\in S`.\n\nNow assume `n-1 \\in S`.\nLet `S_0 = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`.\nThe equality becomes `sum_{i \\in S_0} a_i + a_{n-1} = sum_{i \\in S_0} a_{i+1} + a_0`.\nRearranging, `a_{n-1} - a_0 = sum_{i \\in S_0} (a_{i+1} - a_i)`.\nLet `d_j = a_{j+1} - a_j`. Since `a` is sorted and distinct, `d_j \\ge 1` for all `j`.\nThe equation is `sum_{j=0}^{n-2} d_j = sum_{j \\in S_0} d_j`.\nSince `S_0` is a subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`, `sum_{j \\in S_0} d_j` is a sum of some of these `d_j`.\nFor the equality to hold, `S_0` must be equal to `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\nIf `S_0 = \\{0, 1, ..., n-2\\}`, then `S = \\{0, 1, ..., n-2, n-1\\}`, which is the set of all indices.\nHowever, the problem statement explicitly excludes the subset containing all indices (`k < n`).\nTherefore, `S_0` cannot be `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\nSince `d_j \\ge 1`, `sum_{j \\in S_0} d_j < sum_{j=0}^{n-2} d_j` if `S_0` is a proper subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\nThis means `a_{n-1} - a_0 != sum_{j \\in S_0} (a_{j+1} - a_j)`.\nThis shows that the equality can never hold for any `0 < k < n`.\n\nThus, the strategy of sorting `a` and then cyclically shifting it by one position to the left (i.e., `b_i = a_{(i+1)%n}`) always works.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Create pairs `(value, original_index)` for each element in `a`.\n4. Sort these pairs based on `value`. Let the sorted values be `a_sorted[i] = pair[i].value`.\n5. Construct `b_values` by cyclically shifting `a_sorted`: `b_values[i] = a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.\n6. To print `b` in the correct order corresponding to the original `a`'s positions, we need to map the `b_values` back.\n   Let `sorted_pairs = [(a_val_0, original_idx_0), ..., (a_val_{n-1}, original_idx_{n-1})]`.\n   `a_val_i` is `a_sorted[i]`.\n   The element at `a_sorted[i]` (which was originally at `original_idx_i`) should be replaced by `a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.\n   So, `b[original_idx_i] = a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.\n7. Create an empty result array `result_b` of size `n`.\n8. For `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   Let `original_index = sorted_pairs[i][1]`.\n   Let `shifted_value = sorted_pairs[(i+1)%n][0]`.\n   Set `result_b[original_index] = shifted_value`.\n9. Print `result_b`.\n\n**Example 2 walkthrough with the algorithm:**\n`n=4`, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n\n1. `n=4`.\n2. `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n3. Pairs `(value, original_index)`:\n   `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n4. Sort pairs by value:\n   `sorted_pairs = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   `a_sorted` values are `[1, 10, 100, 1000]`.\n5. `b_values` (shifted `a_sorted`):\n   `b_values[0] = a_sorted[1] = 10`\n   `b_values[1] = a_sorted[2] = 100`\n   `b_values[2] = a_sorted[3] = 1000`\n   `b_values[3] = a_sorted[0] = 1`\n   So `b_values = [10, 100, 1000, 1]`.\n6. Initialize `result_b = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (or any placeholder).\n7. Iterate `i` from `0` to `3`:\n   * `i=0`: `sorted_pairs[0] = (1, 3)`. `original_index = 3`.\n     `shifted_value = sorted_pairs[(0+1)%4][0] = sorted_pairs[1][0] = 10`.\n     `result_b[3] = 10`. `result_b` is `[0, 0, 0, 10]`.\n   * `i=1`: `sorted_pairs[1] = (10, 2)`. `original_index = 2`.\n     `shifted_value = sorted_pairs[(1+1)%4][0] = sorted_pairs[2][0] = 100`.\n     `result_b[2] = 100`. `result_b` is `[0, 0, 100, 10]`.\n   * `i=2`: `sorted_pairs[2] = (100, 1)`. `original_index = 1`.\n     `shifted_value = sorted_pairs[(2+1)%4][0] = sorted_pairs[3][0] = 1000`.\n     `result_b[1] = 1000`. `result_b` is `[0, 1000, 100, 10]`.\n   * `i=3`: `sorted_pairs[3] = (1000, 0)`. `original_index = 0`.\n     `shifted_value = sorted_pairs[(3+1)%4][0] = sorted_pairs[0][0] = 1`.\n     `result_b[0] = 1`. `result_b` is `[1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\n8. Print `result_b`: `1 1000 100 10`.\n\nThis output `1 1000 100 10` is different from the example output `100 1 1000 10`. However, the problem states \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\" Our derived solution is valid based on the proof.\n\nFinal check for `n=1`:\n`n=1`, `a = [5]`.\nPairs: `[(5, 0)]`.\nSorted pairs: `[(5, 0)]`.\n`result_b` initialized.\n`i=0`: `sorted_pairs[0] = (5, 0)`. `original_index = 0`.\n   `shifted_value = sorted_pairs[(0+1)%1][0] = sorted_pairs[0][0] = 5`.\n   `result_b[0] = 5`. `result_b` is `[5]`.\nPrint `5`. This is correct, as for `n=1` there are no non-empty proper subsets, so `b` must be `a`.\n\nThis strategy is efficient: `O(N log N)` for sorting, `O(N)` for construction. `N=22` is very small, so this is well within limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Edge case for n=1: no proper non-empty subsets exist.\n    # The only permutation is a itself.\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Create pairs of (value, original_index) to preserve original positions\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort these pairs based on their values\n    indexed_a.sort()\n\n    # Construct the result array b\n    # b_result[original_index] will store the new value for that position\n    b_result = [0] * n\n\n    # The strategy is to cyclically shift the sorted values.\n    # If a_sorted[i] is the i-th smallest element (at indexed_a[i][0]),\n    # it will take the value of the (i+1)%n-th smallest element.\n    # The element that was originally at indexed_a[i][1] (which is indexed_a[i][0])\n    # will now receive the value indexed_a[(i+1)%n][0].\n    for i in range(n):\n        original_index = indexed_a[i][1]\n        shifted_value = indexed_a[(i + 1) % n][0]\n        b_result[original_index] = shifted_value\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b_result))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
