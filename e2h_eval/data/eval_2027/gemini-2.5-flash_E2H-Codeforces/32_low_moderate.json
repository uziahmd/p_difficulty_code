Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I've got an array problem: minimize the *instability* (max - min) after removing a single element. Straightforward input: an array `a` of integers, and its size `n`. The constraints are reasonable, within 10^5, so no insane memory or time issues. The goal is to find the minimum instability possible after a single removal.\n\nThe examples are helpful. They confirm the straightforward interpretation of the problem. Removing the smallest element and the largest element are the key things to consider, and the cases with duplicate numbers and corner values look like they're going to be important to get correct.\n\nThinking it through, the key insight is to look at the sorted version of the array. Let's call it `a_sorted`. After sorting, I can easily see how removing different elements will change the min and max values.  If I remove the smallest element, the new minimum will be the second smallest and the maximum will be unchanged (the original max). Similarly, if I remove the largest element, the new maximum is the second largest, and the minimum is unchanged.  In any other case where a middle element is removed, the max and min will stay the same.\n\nTherefore, the only interesting cases are removing the minimum and removing the maximum. I just need to calculate the instability for those two scenarios ( `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[1]` and `a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[0]`) and take the smaller result.\n\nThe core of the solution is: sort the array, calculate the instability for the two critical removals, and return the minimum of the two instability values. This approach should be efficient enough given the constraints.\n",
