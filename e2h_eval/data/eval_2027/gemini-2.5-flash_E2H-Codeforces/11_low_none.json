A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Soft Drinking Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Soft Drinking\" problem. Let's break this down systematically. The objective is to maximize the number of toasts *per friend*.  This is crucial: all friends need to make the *same* number of toasts.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the resources and how much each resource is needed for a single toast. Drink, lime, and salt are the constraints. For the drink, I've got `k` bottles, `l` ml per bottle, and each friend needs `nl` ml for a toast. Similarly for lime (`c` limes, `d` slices/lime, and 1 slice needed) and salt (`p` grams, `np` grams per toast per friend). The wording threw me off a bit initially; it's easy to misinterpret the constraints. It's about finding the maximum number of *individual* toasts across all friends.\n\nSo, for the drink, I have a total of `k * l` ml.  Each individual toast requires `nl` ml. Thus, the maximum possible individual toasts from drink is `(k * l) // nl`. The integer division is important here.\n\nFor limes, I have `c * d` total slices, and each toast needs one slice, so the maximum toasts from limes is simply `c * d`.\n\nFor salt, I have `p` grams, and each toast requires `np` grams. The maximum toasts from salt is `p // np`.\n\nThe overall limiting factor is the minimum of these three. `total_individual_toasts = min((k * l) // nl, c * d, p // np)`. This gives me the maximum number of individual toasts possible, given all the resource constraints.\n\nSince there are `n` friends and they all need to make the same number of toasts, I have to divide this total by `n`. So, `toasts_per_friend = total_individual_toasts // n`. That gives me the final answer.\n\nThe input is just a line of space-separated integers, which makes the parsing easy. The output is a single integer, the number of toasts per friend.\n\nNow, let's look at the sample input and apply our understanding. The sample input `3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1` confirms the solution's logic: I'll need to calculate the limits for each resource, find the minimum, and divide by the number of friends. I'm ready to write the script now.\n",
