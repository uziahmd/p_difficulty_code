The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$.

The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle this competitive programming problem involving radio towers. The goal is to figure out the probability of a valid configuration of signal powers existing, given that towers are randomly placed in towns. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, we have this setup: towns numbered from 0 to n+1.  Towers can be built in towns 1 through n with equal probability (50/50). Each tower, if built, has a signal power we need to determine, which can range from 1 to n.  A tower's signal reaches towns within a certain range, determined by its power.  Specifically, a tower at town *i* with power *p* reaches towns from *i-p+1* to *i+p-1*.\n\nThere are some hard constraints. Towns 0 and n+1 *never* receive any signal.  Also, each town from 1 to *n* *must* be covered by *exactly one* tower.  This is key.\n\nNow, let's analyze those constraints.  For town 0 not to be covered, any tower at town *i* must have a power *p_i* such that *i - p_i + 1 > 0*. This tells me *p_i* has to be less than or equal to *i*.  Similarly, for town *n+1* not to be covered, *i + p_i - 1 < n+1*, so *p_i* is less than or equal to *n+1 - i*. Combining these, for any tower at town *i*, the power *p_i* must be between 1 and the minimum of *i* and *n+1-i*.\n\nThe \"one tower per town\" constraint is the real puzzle.  Let's say *S* is the set of towns where towers *are* built.  So, *S* is a subset of the towns 1 to *n*. For each town *i* in *S*, we need to find a power *p_i* that meets those power restrictions. The coverage interval of a tower at *i* is everything from *i - p_i + 1* to *i + p_i -1*.  The covering condition means two things: the union of all the intervals from the built towers must cover *all* towns from 1 to *n*. And, importantly, *no* two intervals can overlap. So, the covered towns must be completely disjoint.\n\nSo, I need to figure out the possible configurations of towers and their powers that will satisfy all of these constraints.  This seems to boil down to finding the number of valid configurations and dividing by the total number of configurations, which I'll probably get from the probabilities... Let's see how this all pans out.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a given configuration of radio towers (built in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each) allows for a valid assignment of signal powers. A valid assignment must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2.  Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\nA tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$. This means it covers towns $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\nThe first condition implies:\n*   For any tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$, $i-p_i+1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n*   For any tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$, $i+p_i-1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nCombining these, for any tower at $i$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\nThe second condition means that the set of covered towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ must be partitioned by the coverage regions of the active towers. That is, if $S$ is the set of towns with active towers, then for each $i \\in S$, we choose $p_i \\in [1, \\min(i, n+1-i)]$ such that:\n1.  $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} \\{j \\mid i-p_i+1 \\le j \\le i+p_i-1\\} = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n2.  For any $i, k \\in S, i \\ne k$, the sets $\\{j \\mid i-p_i+1 \\le j \\le i+p_i-1\\}$ and $\\{j \\mid k-p_k+1 \\le j \\le k+p_k-1\\}$ are disjoint.\n\nLet $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$. The interval covered is $[L_i, R_i]$.\nThe length of this interval is $R_i - L_i + 1 = (i+p_i-1) - (i-p_i+1) + 1 = 2p_i-1$.\nSince $p_i \\ge 1$, the length is at least $1$.\nThe midpoints of these intervals are integers. For an interval $[L, R]$, its midpoint is $(L+R)/2$.\nFor $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$, the midpoint is $((i-p_i+1) + (i+p_i-1))/2 = 2i/2 = i$.\nThis means each tower $i$ covers an interval of towns centered at $i$.\n\nConsider the structure of these non-overlapping, contiguous intervals that cover $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nFor a town $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ to be covered by a tower at $i$, $j$ must be in $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThis means $i-p_i < j < i+p_i$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le i$ implies $i-p_i \\ge 0$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le n+1-i$ implies $i+p_i \\le n+1$.\nSo, the intervals are always contained within $[1, n]$.\n\nLet's look at the boundaries of these intervals. The towns $1, \\dots, n$ must be covered.\nThis implies that $L_i$ must be $1$ for some tower $i$, and $R_k$ must be $n$ for some tower $k$.\nIf $L_i=1$, then $i-p_i+1=1 \\implies p_i=i$.\nIf $R_k=n$, then $k+p_k-1=n \\implies p_k=n+1-k$.\nSo, the towers covering $1$ and $n$ must use their maximum possible power in one direction.\n\nConsider the \"gaps\" between towers. If towers are built at $i$ and $k$ ($i<k$), and they cover $[L_i, R_i]$ and $[L_k, R_k]$ respectively, then for disjointness and full coverage, we must have $R_i+1 = L_k$.\nThis implies that $i+p_i-1+1 = k-p_k+1$, or $i+p_i = k-p_k+1$.\nRearranging, $p_i+p_k = k-i+1$.\n\nThis structure implies that the towns where towers are built form a \"chain\" of covering intervals.\nThis is similar to a known problem related to Dyck paths or Catalan numbers.\nConsider $n=1$. Tower at $1$. $p_1 \\le \\min(1, 1+1-1)=1$. So $p_1=1$. Covers town $1$. Valid.\nConsider $n=2$.\n*   Towers at $1, 2$: $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Covers $[1,1]$ and $[2,2]$. Valid.\n*   Tower at $1$ only: $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Town $2$ not covered. Invalid.\n*   Tower at $2$ only: $p_2=1$. Covers $[2,2]$. Town $1$ not covered. Invalid.\n*   No towers: Invalid.\nSo for $n=2$, only $(1,1)$ is valid. Probability $1/4$.\nConsider $n=3$.\n*   Towers at $1,2,3$: $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$. Covers $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]$. Valid.\n*   Tower at $2$ only: $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$. Valid.\n*   No other configurations work. For example, if towers at $1,3$: $p_1=1, p_3=1$. Covers $[1,1],[3,3]$. Town $2$ not covered.\nSo for $n=3$, configurations $(1,1,1)$ and $(0,1,0)$ are valid. Probability $2/8 = 1/4$.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the active towers.\nA tower $i$ with power $p_i$ covers $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le i$ means $i-p_i+1 \\ge 1$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le n+1-i$ means $i+p_i-1 \\le n$.\nSo all covered towns are within $[1,n]$.\n\nThe crucial observation is that if we have towers at $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, and they partition $[1,n]$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\nThen $L_1=1, R_k=n$, and $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nFrom $p_j+p_{j+1} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$, we have $p_j = i_j-L_j+1$ and $p_{j+1} = R_{j+1}-i_{j+1}+1$.\nSubstituting these into $p_j+p_{j+1} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$:\n$(i_j-L_j+1) + (R_{j+1}-i_{j+1}+1) = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$\n$i_j-L_j+R_{j+1}-i_{j+1}+2 = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$\n$2i_j - 2i_{j+1} - L_j + R_{j+1} + 1 = 0$\n$L_j = R_{j+1}+1 - 2(i_{j+1}-i_j)$.\nThis relationship is not immediately helpful.\n\nLet's re-examine the example $n=5$, towers at $2,4,5$.\n$i_1=2, i_2=4, i_3=5$.\n$p_1=2$. Covers $[2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1,3]$.\n$p_2=1$. Covers $[4-1+1, 4+1-1] = [4,4]$.\n$p_3=1$. Covers $[5-1+1, 5+1-1] = [5,5]$.\nThis is a valid configuration.\n\nNotice that for any $i \\in S$, $p_i$ must be chosen such that $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nIf $p_i = 1$, it covers only town $i$. This is only possible if $i$ is not part of a larger interval.\nIf $p_i > 1$, it covers towns $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$.\n\nConsider the structure of the sequence of active towers.\nIf town $i$ has an active tower, and $i-1$ does not, then the interval $[L_i, R_i]$ must start at $L_i=1$. This means $p_i=i$.\nIf town $i$ has an active tower, and $i+1$ does not, then the interval $[L_i, R_i]$ must end at $R_i=n$. This means $p_i=n+1-i$.\nIf town $i$ has an active tower, and $i-1$ has an active tower, then $p_{i-1}+p_i = i-(i-1)+1 = 2$. Since $p_x \\ge 1$, this forces $p_{i-1}=1$ and $p_i=1$.\nThis means if there's a block of consecutive active towers $k, k+1, \\dots, m$, then for all $j \\in [k, m]$, $p_j=1$. This covers towns $k, k+1, \\dots, m$.\nThis implies that a block of consecutive towers $k, \\dots, m$ can only cover towns $k, \\dots, m$ if $p_j=1$ for all $j \\in [k,m]$.\nThis also implies that if $k>1$ and $k-1$ is not active, then $p_k$ must be $k$.\nAnd if $m<n$ and $m+1$ is not active, then $p_m$ must be $n+1-m$.\nThese are contradictory conditions if $k, \\dots, m$ is a block of towers.\nFor example, if $k=1$, $m=n$, then all $p_j=1$. This covers $[1,n]$. This is a valid configuration.\nIf $k=1$, $m<n$, and $m+1$ is not active, then $p_m$ must be $n+1-m$. But $p_m=1$. So $n+1-m=1 \\implies m=n$. This contradicts $m<n$.\nThis means if there's a block of consecutive towers, it must either be $1, \\dots, n$ (all towers built), or it must be an internal block $k, \\dots, m$ where $k-1$ and $m+1$ are also active. But then it's not a block of \"consecutive active towers\" in the maximal sense.\n\nThis line of reasoning suggests that if $i$ and $i+1$ are both active, then $p_i=1$ and $p_{i+1}=1$.\nThis means the interval covered by tower $i$ is $[i,i]$ and by tower $i+1$ is $[i+1,i+1]$.\nThis is true if $R_i+1=L_{i+1}$ and $p_i=1, p_{i+1}=1$.\n$i+1 = (i+1)-1+1 \\implies i+1=i+1$. This is consistent.\n\nSo, if towns $i$ and $i+1$ both have towers, they must both use power $1$.\nThis means they cover towns $i$ and $i+1$ respectively.\nThis implies that if we have a sequence of active towers $i, i+1, \\dots, k$, then $p_j=1$ for all $j$ in this sequence.\nThis means they cover towns $i, i+1, \\dots, k$.\nBut what about towns $i-1$ or $k+1$?\nIf $i-1$ is not active, then the tower at $i$ must cover town $i-1$. This means $p_i > 1$.\nBut if $i+1$ is active, $p_i$ must be $1$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, it's impossible to have consecutive towers $i, i+1$ if $i-1$ is not active.\nThis means that if $i$ has a tower, and $i-1$ does not, then $i+1$ cannot have a tower.\nBy symmetry, if $i$ has a tower, and $i+1$ does not, then $i-1$ cannot have a tower.\n\nThis implies that if a town $i$ has a tower, then either:\n1.  Both $i-1$ and $i+1$ have towers. In this case, $p_i=1$.\n2.  Neither $i-1$ nor $i+1$ have towers. In this case, $p_i$ must be chosen to cover the \"gap\" $i-1$ and $i+1$.\n    This is the case where $i$ is an isolated tower. Example $n=3$, tower at $2$. $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$. Valid.\n3.  $i-1$ has a tower, but $i+1$ does not. This is impossible.\n4.  $i+1$ has a tower, but $i-1$ does not. This is impossible.\n\nSo, the only possible configurations of active towers are:\n1.  All towers are active ($1, \\dots, n$). In this case, $p_j=1$ for all $j$. This covers $[1,n]$ disjointly. This is always a valid configuration.\n2.  No two active towers are adjacent. That is, if town $i$ has a tower, then $i-1$ and $i+1$ do not.\n    In this case, each active tower $i$ must cover an interval $[L_i, R_i]$ such that $R_i+1 = L_{i'}$ for the next active tower $i'$.\n    For an active tower at $i$, we must have $p_i = \\min(i-L_i+1, R_i-i+1)$.\n    The conditions $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$ must hold.\n    If $i$ is an isolated tower, $i-1$ and $i+1$ are not active.\n    Then the tower at $i$ must cover $i-1$ and $i+1$.\n    This is incorrect. The tower at $i$ must cover some interval $[L_i, R_i]$ such that $L_i$ is either $1$ or $R_{prev}+1$, and $R_i$ is either $n$ or $L_{next}-1$.\n    \nLet's consider the structure of the *gaps* between active towers.\nIf $i$ and $j$ are two consecutive active towers ($i < j$), and there are no active towers between $i$ and $j$.\nThen the interval covered by $i$ must end at $R_i$, and the interval covered by $j$ must start at $L_j$.\nAnd $R_i+1 = L_j$.\nThe towns $i+1, \\dots, j-1$ are not active.\nThe tower at $i$ covers $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe tower at $j$ covers $[j-p_j+1, j+p_j-1]$.\nWe need $i+p_i = j-p_j+1$.\nThis means $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$.\nAlso, $p_i \\le i$, $p_i \\le n+1-i$, $p_j \\le j$, $p_j \\le n+1-j$.\nAnd importantly, $p_i$ must be large enough to \"reach\" $j-1$, and $p_j$ must be large enough to \"reach\" $i+1$.\nThe tower at $i$ must cover all towns up to $j-1$ if $j-i$ is large.\nThe maximum power of tower $i$ is $\\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nThe maximum power of tower $j$ is $\\min(j, n+1-j)$.\n\nConsider the \"middle\" of the gap $i, \\dots, j$. It is $(i+j)/2$.\nIf $j-i+1$ is the length of the segment $i \\dots j$, then $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$.\nThe largest $p_i$ can be is $i$. The largest $p_j$ can be is $n+1-j$.\nThis condition $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$ can always be satisfied by choosing $p_i = \\lceil (j-i+1)/2 \\rceil$ and $p_j = \\lfloor (j-i+1)/2 \\rfloor$ (or vice versa), provided these powers are valid.\nThe power $p_i$ must be $\\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. The power $p_j$ must be $\\le \\min(j, n+1-j)$.\nThe smallest $p_i$ can be is $1$. The smallest $p_j$ can be is $1$.\nSo $j-i+1 \\ge 2$. This means $j > i$. This is always true for distinct $i,j$.\nThe problem is that $p_i$ might be too large.\nFor example, if $i=1, j=4$, then $p_1+p_4 = 4-1+1 = 4$.\nPossible $(p_1,p_4)$ are $(1,3), (2,2), (3,1)$.\n$p_1 \\le \\min(1, n)$. So $p_1=1$.\n$p_4 \\le \\min(4, n+1-4)$.\nIf $n=4$, $p_1=1, p_4=1$. Then $p_1+p_4=2 \\ne 4$. So this is impossible.\nThis implies $(1,4)$ cannot be consecutive active towers if $n=4$.\nThe only way $p_1=1$ and $p_4=3$ is if $n \\ge 4+1-3 = 2$.\n$p_1=1$ is only possible if $i=1$.\nThe constraint $p_i \\le i$ means $p_i$ cannot be very large if $i$ is small.\nThe constraint $p_i \\le n+1-i$ means $p_i$ cannot be very large if $i$ is large (close to $n$).\n\nThe problem reduces to finding configurations of active towers $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that:\n1.  For any $i \\in S$, $i-1 \\notin S \\implies p_i=i$ (to cover town $1$).\n2.  For any $i \\in S$, $i+1 \\notin S \\implies p_i=n+1-i$ (to cover town $n$).\n3.  If $i \\in S, i-1 \\in S, i+1 \\in S$, then $p_i=1$.\n4.  If $i \\in S, i-1 \\in S, i+1 \\notin S$, then $p_i=n+1-i$. But $p_i=1$ is required for $i-1, i$. Contradiction unless $n+1-i=1 \\implies i=n$. So $p_n=1$. This is the case where $S$ ends at $n$.\n5.  If $i \\in S, i-1 \\notin S, i+1 \\in S$, then $p_i=i$. But $p_i=1$ is required for $i, i+1$. Contradiction unless $i=1$. So $p_1=1$. This is the case where $S$ starts at $1$.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's simplify.\nA valid configuration of towers must be such that $S$ is either $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ (all towers), or $S$ must consist of a single tower $i$ such that $p_i$ can cover $[1,n]$.\nIf $S=\\{i\\}$, then $p_i$ must cover $[1,n]$. So $i-p_i+1=1 \\implies p_i=i$ and $i+p_i-1=n \\implies p_i=n+1-i$.\nThus $i = n+1-i \\implies 2i=n+1$. This is only possible if $n$ is odd, and $i=(n+1)/2$.\nIn this case, the tower at $(n+1)/2$ must have power $p_{(n+1)/2} = (n+1)/2$.\nThis power must be $\\le \\min((n+1)/2, n+1-(n+1)/2) = (n+1)/2$. This is satisfied.\nSo if $n$ is odd, the configuration with only tower $(n+1)/2$ is valid.\n\nWhat about other configurations?\nThe problem statement gives $n=5$, towers at $2,4,5$.\n$S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. $1 \\notin S, 3 \\notin S$.\n$p_2=2 \\implies [1,3]$. $p_4=1 \\implies [4,4]$. $p_5=1 \\implies [5,5]$.\nThis works.\nHere $2$ is not adjacent to $1$ or $3$. $4$ is adjacent to $5$. $5$ is adjacent to $4$.\nThe rule \"if $i, i+1$ active, then $p_i=p_{i+1}=1$\" implies $p_4=1, p_5=1$.\nThe rule \"if $i-1$ not active, $i$ active, $i+1$ not active\" for $i=2$ implies $p_2$ must cover $1$ and $3$.\n$L_2=1 \\implies p_2=2$. $R_2=3$.\n$L_4=4 \\implies p_4=1$. $R_4=4$.\n$L_5=5 \\implies p_5=1$. $R_5=5$.\nThis works. The intervals are $[1,3], [4,4], [5,5]$.\nThis means my earlier reasoning about contradictions for consecutive towers was flawed.\nThe condition $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$ for consecutive active towers $i,j$ is correct.\nFor $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ active towers, $p_{i_1}=i_1$, $p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\nAnd for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$.\nAlso $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n\nLet $x_j = i_j$.\n$p_1=x_1$. $p_k=n+1-x_k$.\n$p_j+p_{j+1} = x_{j+1}-x_j+1$.\nSumming this from $j=1$ to $k-1$:\n$(p_1+p_2) + (p_2+p_3) + \\dots + (p_{k-1}+p_k) = (x_2-x_1+1) + (x_3-x_2+1) + \\dots + (x_k-x_{k-1}+1)$\n$p_1 + 2(p_2+\\dots+p_{k-1}) + p_k = (x_k-x_1+k-1)$.\nSubstitute $p_1=x_1$ and $p_k=n+1-x_k$:\n$x_1 + 2(p_2+\\dots+p_{k-1}) + n+1-x_k = x_k-x_1+k-1$.\n$2(p_2+\\dots+p_{k-1}) = 2x_k - 2x_1 - n - 1 + k - 1 + 1 = 2x_k - 2x_1 - n + k - 1$.\nThis equation must hold.\nAlso, we need $p_j \\ge 1$ for all $j$.\nAnd $p_j \\le \\min(x_j, n+1-x_j)$.\nThe minimum value for $p_j$ is $1$.\nSo $p_j+p_{j+1} = x_{j+1}-x_j+1 \\ge 2$. This means $x_{j+1}-x_j \\ge 1$. This is true.\nThe maximum value for $p_j$ is $x_j$. So $x_j+p_{j+1} \\ge x_{j+1}-x_j+1$.\nThe maximum value for $p_j$ is $n+1-x_j$. So $n+1-x_j+p_{j+1} \\ge x_{j+1}-x_j+1$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a sequence $x_1, \\dots, x_k$ (active towers) and $p_1, \\dots, p_k$ (powers) such that the conditions hold.\nThis is exactly the problem of partitioning $[1,n]$ into intervals centered at $x_j$.\nThe problem states that such a way must *exist*. We don't need to find the powers.\nIt can be shown that such a set of powers exists if and only if the set of active towers $S$ satisfies:\n1.  Town $1$ must be covered. This means either $1 \\in S$ and $p_1=1$, or $i \\in S$ for some $i > 1$ and $p_i=i$.\n2.  Town $n$ must be covered. This means either $n \\in S$ and $p_n=1$, or $i \\in S$ for some $i < n$ and $p_i=n+1-i$.\n3.  For any $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, $j$ is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nThe problem can be rephrased:\nA set of active towers $S$ is valid if and only if there exist $p_i \\ge 1$ for $i \\in S$ such that:\n(a) $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ for all $i \\in S$.\n(b) The intervals $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ for $i \\in S$ form a partition of $(0, n+1)$.\nThis means $0 \\notin \\bigcup (i-p_i, i+p_i)$ and $n+1 \\notin \\bigcup (i-p_i, i+p_i)$.\nAnd for $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ being the active towers, we must have:\n$i_1-p_{i_1} = 0$\n$i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$\n$i_k+p_{i_k} = n+1$\nThese imply $p_{i_1}=i_1$ and $p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\nAnd for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j$.\nThis is slightly different from $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$. The difference is $1$. The condition $|c-i|<p$ means towns $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\nThe interval is $(i-p, i+p)$.\nSo $i-p_{i_1}=0 \\implies p_{i_1}=i_1$.\n$i_k+p_{i_k}=n+1 \\implies p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\n$i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}} \\implies p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j$.\n\nLet $d_j = i_{j+1}-i_j$. Then $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = d_j$.\nWe need to find $p_j \\ge 1$ satisfying these.\n$p_{i_1}=i_1$.\n$p_{i_2}=d_1-p_{i_1} = d_1-i_1$.\n$p_{i_3}=d_2-p_{i_2} = d_2-(d_1-i_1) = d_2-d_1+i_1$.\nIn general, $p_{i_j} = i_1 + \\sum_{s=1}^{j-1} (-1)^{j-1-s} d_s$.\nAlso $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ and $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\nAnd $p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\nSubstituting $p_{i_k}$ into the general formula:\n$n+1-i_k = i_1 + \\sum_{s=1}^{k-1} (-1)^{k-1-s} d_s$.\n\nThis is a known result. A configuration of towers $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ is valid if and only if $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ are all the towns where towers are built, and for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, $i_j$ is the center of an interval that covers a segment of towns.\nThe condition for existence of such $p_j$ is that the sequence of active towers must be such that no two active towers are adjacent.\nThis is incorrect for $n=2$, towers at $1,2$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. $p_1=i_1$, $p_2=n+1-i_2$. $1=1, 1=2+1-2=1$.\n$p_1+p_2=i_2-i_1 \\implies 1+1=2-1 \\implies 2=1$. This is false.\nSo the condition $p_j+p_{j+1} = i_{j+1}-i_j$ is wrong.\n\nLet's use the definition of signal reach: $|c-i|<p \\iff i-p+1 \\le c \\le i+p-1$.\nThe interval of towns covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i$ is $C_i = [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $C_i \\cap \\{0, n+1\\} = \\emptyset$. This means $i-p_i+1 \\ge 1 \\implies p_i \\le i$ and $i+p_i-1 \\le n \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n2. $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} C_i = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n3. $C_i \\cap C_k = \\emptyset$ for $i \\ne k$.\n\nThese imply that if $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ are the active towers, then:\n$i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1}=i_1$.\n$i_k+p_{i_k}-1 = n \\implies p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\nFor $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $i_j+p_{i_j}-1+1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1 \\implies i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\n$\\implies p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$. This is the relation I had earlier.\n\nLet $S = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_k\\}$ be the set of active towers, $x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_k$.\nWe need to find $p_j$ such that $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(x_j, n+1-x_j)$ and:\n$p_1 = x_1$\n$p_j + p_{j+1} = x_{j+1}-x_j+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$\n$p_k = n+1-x_k$\n\nSubstitute $p_1=x_1$ into the recurrence:\n$x_1 + p_2 = x_2-x_1+1 \\implies p_2 = x_2-2x_1+1$.\n$p_2+p_3 = x_3-x_2+1 \\implies p_3 = x_3-x_2+1 - p_2 = x_3-x_2+1 - (x_2-2x_1+1) = x_3-2x_2+2x_1$.\n$p_j = (-1)^{j-1} x_1 + (-1)^{j-2} (x_2-x_1+1) + \\dots + (x_j-x_{j-1}+1)$.\nThis is not easy.\n\nLet's use a different approach. The problem is equivalent to counting configurations of towers where a specific type of \"partition\" of the segment $[1,n]$ exists. This is a known result from a similar problem (e.g., \"Optimal Subsegment Partition\" or \"Segment Covering\").\nThe condition is that for any $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there exists *exactly one* tower $i$ and power $p_i$ such that $j \\in C_i$.\nThis implies that we can assign a unique tower $i$ to each town $j$.\nLet $f(j)$ be the tower covering town $j$.\nThen $f(j)$ must be $j$ itself if $p_j=1$.\nIf $f(j)=i$, then $j$ is covered by $i$.\n\nThe total number of possible configurations of towers is $2^n$.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of valid tower configurations for a given $n$.\n$n=1$: Only tower at $1$. $S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=1$. Valid. $a_1=1$.\n$n=2$:\n$S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Valid.\n$S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=1$. $2$ not covered. Invalid.\n$S=\\{2\\}$. $p_2=1$. $1$ not covered. Invalid.\n$S=\\emptyset$.

Valid.\n$S=\\{1,4\\}$. $p_1=1, p_4=1$. $p_1+p_2=x_2-x_1+1 \\implies 1+1 = 4-1+1=4 \\implies 2=4$. Impossible.\nThe condition $p_j+p_{j+1}=x_{j+1}-x_j+1$ must hold for $p_j \\ge 1$.\nThis means $x_{j+1}-x_j+1 \\ge 2 \\implies x_{j+1}-x_j \\ge 1$. Which is true.\nFor $S=\\{1,4\\}$, $x_1=1, x_2=4$. $p_1=1, p_2=4+1-4=1$. $p_1+p_2=1+1=2$. $x_2-x_1+1=4-1+1=4$. $2 \\ne 4$. So this is not valid.\n$S=\\{2,3\\}$. $x_1=2, x_2=3$. $p_1=2, p_2=4+1-3=2$. $p_1+p_2=2+2=4$. $x_2-x_1+1=3-2+1=2$. $4 \\ne 2$. Not valid.\n$S=\\{1,3\\}$. $x_1=1, x_2=3$. $p_1=1, p_2=4+1-3=2$. $p_1+p_2=1+2=3$. $x_2-x_1+1=3-1+1=3$. This works!\nSo $S=\\{1,3\\}$ is valid for $n=4$.\n$S=\\{2\\}$. $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$. $4$ not covered. Invalid.\n$a_4=2$.\n$n=5$:\n$S=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. Valid.\n$S=\\{3\\}$. $p_3=3$. Covers $[1,5]$. Valid.\n$S=\\{1,3,5\\}$. $x_1=1, x_2=3, x_3=5$. $p_1=1, p_3=5+1-5=1$.\n$p_1+p_2=x_2-x_1+1 \\implies 1+p_2=3-1+1=3 \\implies p_2=2$.\n$p_2+p_3=x_3-x_2+1 \\implies 2+1=5-3+1=3$. This works.\nThe powers are $p_1=1, p_2=2, p_3=1$.\n$p_1 \\le \\min(1,5)=1$. Yes.\n$p_2 \\le \\min(3,3)=3$. Yes.\n$p_3 \\le \\min(5,1)=1$. Yes.\nSo $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$ is valid.\n$S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.

Result is $F_{k_F} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's check the $n=200000$ example.\n$k_F = 2\\lfloor (200000-1)/2 \\rfloor + 1 = 2\\lfloor 199999/2 \\rfloor + 1 = 2 \\cdot 99999 + 1 = 199998 + 1 = 199999$.\nWe need $F_{199999} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThen $2^{200000} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThen $F_{199999} \\cdot (2^{200000})^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef matrix_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef matrix_pow(A, p):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix\n    A_copy = A\n    while p > 0:\n        if p % 2 == 1:\n            res = matrix_mult(res, A_copy)\n        A_copy = matrix_mult(A_copy, A_copy)\n        p //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef fibonacci(k):\n    if k == 0:\n        return 0\n    if k == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Calculate F_k using matrix exponentiation\n    # [[F_{k+1}], [F_k]] = [[1,1],[1,0]]^k * [[F_1],[F_0]]\n    # [[F_1],[F_0]] = [[1],[0]]\n    \n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    T_pow_k_minus_1 = matrix_pow(T, k - 1)\n    \n    # F_k is the (1,0) element of T_pow_k_minus_1 * [[1],[0]]\n    # Or, F_k is the (0,1) element of T_pow_k.\n    # From [[F_{k+1}, F_k], [F_k, F_{k-1}]] = [[1,1],[1,0]]^k\n    # So F_k is T_pow_k[1][0] or T_pow_k[0][1]\n    \n    # Let's use the definition:\n    # [[F_{k+1}, F_k], [F_k, F_{k-1}]] = [[1,1],[1,0]]^k\n    # So F_k is the element T_pow_k[0][1] or T_pow_k[1][0]\n    \n    # For k=1, F_1=1. matrix_pow(T,0) = I.\n    # F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5\n    # For k=0, return 0.\n    # For k=1, matrix_pow(T,1) = T = [[1,1],[1,0]].
