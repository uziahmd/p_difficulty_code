He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Python String Validation Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I need to devise a Python script to determine if a given string, which I'll call `S`, adheres to a specific set of formation rules. Let's dissect these rules and my approach.\n\nFirst, I need to recognize the structure of this string. It's built in three stages: an initial sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and finally 'c's. Importantly, there must be *at least* one 'a' and one 'b' present.  The number of 'c's is key; it must equal the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's.  Essentially, the string will always be of the form `a...ab...bc...c`.\n\nMy plan is to iterate through `S` and count the occurrences of each character type.  I'll initialize counters for 'a's (`count_a`), 'b's (`count_b`), and 'c's (`count_c`).\n\nNow, I'll analyze the string from left to right. I'll need to confirm the order: all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. This sequential arrangement is critical. A straightforward approach would be to increment the relevant counter based on the character. If there is a break in the sequence, like a 'b' appears before all 'a's, the string is invalid.\n\nOnce I've counted all characters, I'll verify if `count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`, and `count_c >= 1`. Finally, I'll need to check if `count_c` is either equal to `count_a` or `count_b`, to satisfy the third rule.\n\nI believe this robust method will allow me to accurately determine if the input string `S` is valid according to the prescribed rules.\n",
