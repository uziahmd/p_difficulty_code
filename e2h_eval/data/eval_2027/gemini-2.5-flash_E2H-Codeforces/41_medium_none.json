There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Zoning Restrictions Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm tasked with solving this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem. Let's break it down. We have `n` spots for houses, each with a potential height between `0` and `h`. The profit from a house is simply its height squared. The tricky part is the restrictions: `m` of them, each in the form `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, meaning the *tallest* house between spots `l_i` and `r_i` can be no more than `x_i`. The goal? Maximize the total profit.\n\nThe small constraints (`n, h, m <= 50`) jump out at me. This screams polynomial time, maybe even something that's exponential but not in *both* `n` and `h` simultaneously if `h` is large, which feels unlikely given the squaring in the profit function.\n\nLet's focus on those restrictions. The key is to realize that a restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` indirectly affects *every* house within that range. It limits the *maximum* height within that range, but since we want to maximize the individual house profits, that means each house in that range must be at most `x_i`. Also, a house's height is always at most `h` globally.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, for each spot `j`, I need to determine its *maximum* allowed height. This height is the *minimum* of two things: the global maximum height `h`, and all the `x_i` values from the restrictions that cover spot `j`. If no restrictions affect spot `j`, it can have height `h`.\n\nTo formalize this, I'll create an array `allowed_height` of size `n`, where `allowed_height[j]` represents the maximum possible height for spot `j`. Initially, all spots have `allowed_height[j] = h`. Then, I'll go through each restriction and, for all spots within that restriction's range, update their `allowed_height` by taking the minimum of their current value and the restriction's `x_i`. After processing all restrictions, `allowed_height[j]` will hold the final, allowed maximum height for spot `j`.\n\nSince profit is `a^2`, and this is monotonically increasing for non-negative `a`, the best height for each spot `j` is simply `allowed_height[j]`. So, the algorithm is: initialize `allowed_height` to `h` everywhere, process restrictions by taking the `min`, then calculate the total profit as the sum of squares of these allowed heights.\n\nIn terms of complexity, initializing `allowed_height` is `O(n)`. Processing each of the `m` restrictions, in the worst case, touches all `n` spots (if `l_i=1` and `r_i=n`). That's `O(m*n)`. Calculating the total profit is another `O(n)`. So, the dominant part is `O(m*n)`. Given that `n` and `m` are at most 50, `m*n` is at most 2500, which is perfectly fine in terms of time.\n\nI ran through the examples, and everything lines up. The logic appears sound, and the restrictions don't introduce any coupling that prevents individual spot profit maximization.\n\nCoding-wise, I'll use a `allowed_height` list. I will use 0-based indexing for Python lists because this is more natural. When processing the restrictions, remember to adjust the indices since the problem uses 1-based indexing for spots. The algorithm is straightforward: read inputs, process the restrictions using `min` to update `allowed_height`, then compute the sum of squares.\n\nI need to make sure to read `n`, `h`, and `m` first. Then I process the restrictions. The last step is to calculate the total profit and print it. Since standard input is used, I don't have to worry about the example format in the prompt being strange.\n\nThe final code will contain these steps. It will handle the case when `x_i` is 0. All cases will be covered.\n\nLet's implement this!\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    allowed_height = [h] * n\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        l_idx = l - 1\n        r_idx = r - 1\n\n        for i in",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot, we can build a house with an integer height between `0` and `h`. A house of height `a` yields `a^2` dollars. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house within a given range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and the profit function:\n1.  **Constraints**: `n, h, m` are all small (up to 50). This suggests that a solution with polynomial time complexity in `n` and `m` (e.g., `O(n*m)`) will be perfectly fine.\n2.  **Profit Function**: The profit for a house of height `a` is `a^2`. Since `a` must be non-negative, `a^2` is a strictly increasing function for `a >= 0`. This means to maximize the profit for a single house, we should always choose the largest possible height for that house.\n\nNow let's consider the zoning restrictions. A restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` states that the *tallest* house in the range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`. This implies that *every single house* `j` within that range (`l_i <= j <= r_i`) must have a height `height[j] <= x_i`.\n\nCombining this with the global maximum height `h`, for any given spot `j`, its height `height[j]` must satisfy:\n*   `height[j] <= h` (global maximum)\n*   `height[j] <= x_i` for *every* restriction `i` where `l_i <= j <= r_i`.\n\nTherefore, for each spot `j`, its maximum allowed height `max_allowed_height[j]` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_i` values from restrictions that cover spot `j`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialize `max_allowed_height` array**: Create an array, say `allowed_height`, of size `n`. Initialize all elements to `h`. This array will store the maximum permissible height for each spot. We'll use 0-based indexing for convenience in Python, so spots `1` to `n` correspond to indices `0` to `n-1`.\n2.  **Process Restrictions**: Iterate through each of the `m` restrictions:\n    *   Read `l_i`, `r_i`, and `x_i`.\n    *   Adjust `l_i` and `r_i` to 0-based indices: `l_idx = l_i - 1`, `r_idx = r_i - 1`.\n    *   For every spot `j` from `l_idx` to `r_idx` (inclusive):\n        *   Update `allowed_height[j] = min(allowed_height[j], x_i)`. This step ensures that the height at spot `j` respects this current restriction, as well as any previous restrictions (and the global `h`) that might have set `allowed_height[j]` to an even lower value.\n3.  **Calculate Total Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the `allowed_height` array will contain the optimal height for each house. To maximize profit, we choose `height[j] = allowed_height[j]` for each spot `j`.\n    *   Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through the `allowed_height` array:\n        *   For each `height_val` in `allowed_height`, add `height_val * height_val` to `total_profit`.\n4.  **Print `total_profit`**.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nInitial `allowed_height = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 0, 1, 2)\n\nRestrictions:\n1.  `l=1, r=1, x=1`: (0-based: `l_idx=0, r_idx=0`)\n    `allowed_height[0] = min(allowed_height[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n    `allowed_height` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`\n2.  `l=2, r=2, x=3`: (0-based: `l_idx=1, r_idx=1`)\n    `allowed_height[1] = min(allowed_height[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`\n    `allowed_height` remains `[1, 3, 3]`\n3.  `l=3, r=3, x=2`: (0-based: `l_idx=2, r_idx=2`)\n    `allowed_height[2] = min(allowed_height[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`\n    `allowed_height` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`\n\nFinal `allowed_height = [1, 3, 2]`.\nTotal Profit = `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: `O(n)`\n*   Processing restrictions: `m` restrictions, each iterating at most `n` spots.
