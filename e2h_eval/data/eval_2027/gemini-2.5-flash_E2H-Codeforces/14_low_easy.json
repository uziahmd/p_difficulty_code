He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Trailing Zero Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"A Trivial Problem\" to tackle.  The core is finding how many trailing zeroes are in `n!`, right?  That screams Legendre's formula to me.  I know it's all about counting the factors of 5 in the prime factorization, since there'll always be more 2s than 5s.\n\nMy plan is to get `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`  running. I can see this function `Z(n)` is non-decreasing; it either stays the same or goes up as `n` increases.  It only jumps when `n` is a multiple of 5, or 25, or 125, etc. I'm going to start running through values of `n` to look at how `Z(n)` grows.\n\nI'm realizing something important: this `Z(n)` *can skip values*. I need to account for the fact that I might not find an `n` for *every* possible value of `m`. If `Z(24) = 4` and `Z(25) = 6`, there's no solution for `m=5`. That's a key observation.\n\nSo, I'm aiming to find all `n` where `Z(n) = m`.  Given that the problem asks for all values, I can't just find one.  The function is non-decreasing, so maybe I can use binary search to try and find the beginning and end of a range.\n\nBinary search seems like a good call here. Since I have a way to quickly calculate the number of zeroes, I can try to find an `n` such that `Z(n) = m`.  I need to figure out what kind of range for n is appropriate.  Let's see, if I approximate `Z(n) = m` to `n/4`. So `n=4m`. Given m=100000, 400000 is an upper bound on what n could be.\nI'll also keep track of what n have that result in m. The results will be n, n+1, etc.\n",
