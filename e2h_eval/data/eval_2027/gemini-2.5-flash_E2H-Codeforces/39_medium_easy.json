Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Understanding the Rook vs. Queen Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to build an *N* x *N* board filled with numbers from 1 to *N*<sup>2</sup>. The core challenge is to arrange these numbers so that a \"rook\" piece, following specific movement and teleportation rules, pays strictly fewer \"vuns\" (teleportation costs) than a \"queen\" piece, also adhering to its own movement and teleportation rules. If no such arrangement is possible, I need to print -1.\n\nMy initial approach is to meticulously break down the movement rules for both the rook and the queen.  Both start at cell 1, visiting cells sequentially and teleports only when it gets stuck at a visited cell.  The difference is the queen has a much larger set of reachable cells. So my goal is to contrive a situation where the rook gets \"stuck\" (has no reachable unvisited cells) while the queen still has a valid move. If this can be achieved it means that the rook will pay a vun (teleports), while the queen does not. The critical insight here is that when the rook is stuck and the queen is not, the queen's next move must be a diagonal one.\n\nThe smallest board size, *N* = 1, is immediately ruled out because both the rook and queen will visit cell 1, and no vuns are paid, and the problem requires the rook to pay fewer vuns than the queen.\n\nWith the rook and queen's movement understood, I'm thinking about the scenario where the rook gets trapped. The rook moves horizontally and vertically, so to trap it, all cells in its current row and column need to be visited. Conversely, a queen can move diagonally as well, meaning a trapped rook does not imply a trapped queen. I'm imagining a situation where the queen can make a valid diagonal move, preventing her from also being trapped. The board arrangement must force this difference.\n\nI start to experiment with a *N* = 2 board. Placing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 strategically, I find it difficult to force a difference in vuns. Then I look at *N* = 4, there appears to be a solution. The crux is figuring out the number placement.\n\nI trace the rook and queen's movements for this *N* = 4 example and see how, with a carefully crafted arrangement of numbers, the rook *does* get trapped, while the queen *does not* and moves to the next cell. This is my 'a-ha' moment.\n\nFor *N*=4 I have 1 vun for the rook and 2 vuns for the queen. With this proof of concept, the real problem is generalization. How to arrange those numbers from 1 to N*N, in such a way that it creates the \"trap\" situation for the rook and not for the queen. I have a hypothesis now that with a checkerboard pattern, the rook can be made to pay a vun while the queen can continue.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an `N x N` board with numbers from `1` to `N*N` (each used exactly once) such that a rook pays strictly fewer \"vuns\" than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print `-1`.\n\nLet's analyze the rules for movement and paying vuns:\n1. The game starts at the cell containing the number `1`. This cell is marked as visited.\n2. From the current cell, the piece looks for all unvisited cells it can reach in one move.\n3. If there are such cells, it moves to the one with the minimum number among them.\n4. If there are no such reachable unvisited cells:\n   a. If there are still unvisited cells anywhere on the board, the piece is teleported to the unvisited cell with the minimum number. This costs 1 vun.\n   b. If all cells are visited, the process stops.\n\nA rook moves horizontally or vertically. A queen moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This means the set of cells a queen can reach from a given position is always a superset of the cells a rook can reach.\n\nA vun is paid when a piece cannot make a regular move but there are still unvisited cells on the board.\nFor the rook to pay strictly less vuns than the queen, we need `RookVuns < QueenVuns`.\nThe easiest way to satisfy this is to make `RookVuns = 0` and `QueenVuns > 0`, or `RookVuns = 1` and `QueenVuns = 2` (as in the `N=4` example).\n\nConsider the conditions for a piece to pay a vun:\n- Rook pays a vun: All cells in its current row and column are visited.\n- Queen pays a vun: All cells in its current row, column, and diagonals are visited.\n\nIf a rook pays a vun, it means its current row and column are \"blocked\" by visited cells. If a queen does *not* pay a vun at the same point, it means there is an unvisited cell reachable diagonally. This unvisited diagonal cell must have a smaller number than any other unvisited cell on the board (otherwise the queen would teleport to that smaller number and pay a vun).\n\nLet's try to construct a board where the rook pays 0 vuns and the queen pays 1 vun.\nThis requires the queen to get stuck at some point, while the rook never gets stuck.\nThis seems difficult because the queen has more mobility. If the queen gets stuck, the rook is even more likely to get stuck.\n\nThe opposite strategy, making the rook pay more, is what we need.\nWe want `RookVuns > QueenVuns`.\nThis happens if:\n- Rook pays a vun (all cells in its row/column are visited).\n- Queen does *not* pay a vun (there's an unvisited cell reachable diagonally).\n\nThis means we need to arrange numbers such that at some point:\n1. The rook is at cell `(r, c)`.\n2. All cells `(r, j)` for `j != c` and `(i, c)` for `i != r` are already visited.\n3. There exists an unvisited cell `(r', c')` such that `|r-r'| == |c-c'|` (diagonal move) and `(r', c')` is unvisited.\n4. The number in `(r', c')` is the minimum among all unvisited cells reachable by the queen (i.e., this diagonal cell is chosen by the queen).\n5. The number in `(r', c')` is *not* the minimum among all unvisited cells on the board (otherwise, the rook would teleport to it and pay a vun, and the queen would also teleport to it and pay a vun). This implies there must be some other unvisited cell `(x, y)` with `num(x, y) < num(r', c')`. The rook would teleport to `(x, y)`.\n\nThis is a complex condition. The example `N=4` board achieves `RookVuns=1, QueenVuns=2`. This is `RookVuns < QueenVuns`.\n\nLet's look at the `N=4` example board again:\n4  3  6 12\n7  5  9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nThe strategy used in the example seems to be placing numbers in a checkerboard-like pattern.\nCells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is even: `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\nCells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is odd: `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\n\nLet's call the cells with `i+j` even \"Type A\" and cells with `i+j` odd \"Type B\".\nNotice that a rook always moves between cells of different types (e.g., from `(r,c)` to `(r, c+k)`, `r+c` and `r+c+k` have different parities).\nA queen can move between cells of the same type (diagonally, e.g., from `(r,c)` to `(r+k, c+k)`, `r+c` and `r+k+c+k` have the same parity) or different types (horizontally/vertically).\n\nIn the example `N=4` board:\n- Type B cells (odd sum of coordinates) contain: `1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13`. (8 numbers)\n- Type A cells (even sum of coordinates) contain: `4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16`. (8 numbers)\n\nThe example places `1` at `(2,1)`, which is a Type B cell.\nThe numbers `1` to `N*N/2` are mostly in Type B cells, and `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` are mostly in Type A cells.\nSpecifically, `1,2,3,5,7,8,10,13` are small numbers (relative to `N*N/2=8`).\nAnd `4,6,9,11,12,14,15,16` are large numbers.\nThis pattern is not strictly `1..N*N/2` in one type and `N*N/2+1..N*N` in the other. For example, `4` is in Type A, `13` is in Type B.\n\nThe crucial observation from the example is how it creates a scenario where the rook gets stuck and pays a vun, but the queen can still move.\nRook at `(1,3)` (value `15`). All cells in row 1 except `(1,3)` are `(1,0) 7, (1,1) 5, (1,2) 9`. All visited.\nAll cells in col 3 except `(1,3)` are `(0,3) 12, (2,3) 10, (3,3) 2`. All visited.\nSo rook is stuck. Unvisited cells are `14` at `(2,0)` and `16` at `(3,2)`. Rook teleports to `14`, pays 1 vun.\n\nQueen at `(1,3)` (value `15`).\nHorizontal/Vertical reachable: None unvisited.\nDiagonal reachable:\n`(0,2)` (value `6`) - Visited.\n`(2,2)` (value `11`) - Visited.\n`(3,1)` (value `8`) - Visited.\n`(0,4)` (invalid)\n`(2,4)` (invalid)\n`(4,2)` (invalid)\n`(4,0)` (invalid)\nWait, the Queen trace I did earlier was wrong.\nLet's re-evaluate Queen at `(1,3)` (value `15`).\nCurrent `(1,3)`. Visited `{1..13, 15}`. Unvisited: `{14, 16}`.\nQueen reachable from `(1,3)`:\n- Row 1: `(1,0) 7, (1,1) 5, (1,2) 9`. All visited.\n- Col 3: `(0,3) 12, (2,3) 10, (3,3) 2`. All visited.\n- Diagonals:\n    - `(0,2) 6` (visited)\n    - `(2,2) 11` (visited)\n    - `(3,1) 8` (visited)\n    - `(0,4)` (out of bounds)\n    - `(2,4)` (out of bounds)\n    - `(4,2)` (out of bounds)\n    - `(4,0)` (out of bounds)\nIt seems all cells reachable by Queen are also visited.\nSo, Queen also gets stuck at `(1,3)`.\nUnvisited are `14` at `(2,0)` and `16` at `(3,2)`. Queen teleports to `14`, pays 1 vun.\nCurrent `(2,0)` (value `14`). Visited `{1..15}`. Unvisited: `{16}`.\nQueen reachable from `(2,0)`:\n- Row 2: `(2,1) 1, (2,2) 11, (2,3) 10`. All visited.\n- Col 0: `(0,0) 4, (1,0) 7, (3,0) 13`. All visited.\n- Diagonals:\n    - `(0,2) 6` (visited)\n    - `(1,1) 5` (visited)\n    - `(3,1) 8` (visited)\n    - `(4,?)` (out of bounds)\n    - `(?, -1)` (out of bounds)\nQueen is stuck again. Unvisited is `16` at `(3,2)`. Queen teleports to `16`, pays 1 vun.\nQueen vuns = 2.\n\nSo my re-trace of the example board confirms the problem statement's result: Rook pays 1, Queen pays 2.\n\nThe key idea for `RookVuns < QueenVuns` is to make the rook pay a vun, and then immediately after, the queen also pays a vun (or more).\nThis implies that the rook gets stuck, teleports to `min_unvisited`. Then the queen gets stuck, teleports to `min_unvisited`.\nIf the queen also gets stuck, it means the *same* set of cells that blocked the rook also blocked the queen, or the queen got blocked on a subsequent move.\n\nLet's try a construction for `N > 1`:\nPlace numbers `1, 2, ..., N*N/2` in one set of cells (e.g., cells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is even).\nPlace numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` in the other set of cells (e.g., cells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is odd).\nThis is a checkerboard pattern.\n\nLet `S_even = { (i,j) | i+j \\text{ is even} }`\nLet `S_odd = { (i,j) | i+j \\text{ is odd} }`\n\nIf `N*N` is even (i.e., `N` is even), then `|S_even| = |S_odd| = N*N/2`.\nIf `N*N` is odd (i.e., `N` is odd), then `|S_even| = N*N/2 + 1/2`, `|S_odd| = N*N/2 - 1/2`. (e.g., `N=3`, `N*N=9`. `S_even` has 5 cells, `S_odd` has 4 cells. Assuming `(0,0)` is even.)\n\nCase 1: `N` is odd.\n`N*N` is odd. `|S_even| = (N*N+1)/2`, `|S_odd| = (N*N-1)/2`.\nLet's put `1, 2, ..., (N*N-1)/2` into `S_odd`.\nLet's put `(N*N-1)/2 + 1, ..., N*N` into `S_even`.\nThe cell `1` is in `S_odd`.\nA rook moves from `S_odd` to `S_even` or `S_even` to `S_odd`.\nA queen can move from `S_odd` to `S_odd` (diagonally) or `S_even` to `S_even` (diagonally).\nA queen can also move from `S_odd` to `S_even` (horizontally/vertically).\n\nConsider `N=1`. Output is `-1`. (Rook 0, Queen 0).\nConsider `N=2`. `N*N=4`. `|S_even|=2, |S_odd|=2`.\n`S_even = {(0,0), (1,1)}`. `S_odd = {(0,1), (1,0)}`.\nLet's assign `1,2` to `S_odd` and `3,4` to `S_even`.\nBoard:\n3 1\n2 4\nStart at `1` at `(0,1)`. Visited `{1}`.\nRook from `(0,1)`: Reachable `(0,0) 3`, `(1,1) 4`. Min is `3`. Move to `(0,0)`. Path `1->3`. Visited `{1,3}`.\nRook from `(0,0)`: Reachable `(0,1) 1(visited)`, `(1,0) 2`. Min is `2`.

Visited `{1,2}`.\nQueen from `(1,0)`: Reachable `(0,0) 3`, `(0,1) 1(visited)`, `(1,1) 4`. Min is `3`. Move to `(0,0)`. Path `1->2->3`. Visited `{1,2,3}`.\nQueen from `(0,0)`: Reachable `(0,1) 1(visited)`, `(1,0) 2(visited)`, `(1,1) 4`. Min is `4`. Move to `(1,1)`. Path `1->2->3->4`. Visited `{1,2,3,4}`.\nQueen vuns = 0.\nSo for `N=2`, this construction gives 0 vuns for both. This is not `RookVuns < QueenVuns`.\nIt seems `N=2` is also `-1`.\n\nWhat if `N` is odd and `N > 1`?\nExample: `N=3`. `N*N=9`. `|S_even|=5, |S_odd|=4`.\n`S_even = {(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)}`.\n`S_odd = {(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)}`.\nAssign `1,2,3,4` to `S_odd`.\nAssign `5,6,7,8,9` to `S_even`.\nBoard:\n5 1 6\n2 7 3\n8 4 9\nStart at `1` at `(0,1)`.

All visited.\nQueen vuns = 0.\n\nIt seems this checkerboard pattern always leads to 0 vuns for both if numbers are split this way.\nThe reason is that if a piece is on an `S_odd` cell, it moves to the minimum unvisited `S_even` cell if it's a rook. If it's a queen, it can move to `S_even` or `S_odd`. But since all `S_odd` cells contain small numbers, it will try to move to an `S_odd` cell if possible.\n\nThe example `N=4` board clearly does not follow this simple checkerboard assignment of small/large numbers.\nIt has `1` at `(2,1)` (Type B).\n`2` at `(3,3)` (Type A).\n`3` at `(0,1)` (Type B).\n`4` at `(0,0)` (Type A).\nThis means small numbers are spread across both types.\n\nLet's rethink the conditions for `RookVuns < QueenVuns`.\nThis implies the rook gets stuck, but the queen can still move.\nThis means the rook has its row and column blocked, but there's an unvisited diagonal cell for the queen.\nAnd the number in this diagonal cell must be smaller than any other unvisited cell that the rook would teleport to.\nThis is exactly the scenario where `R_reachable` is empty, `Q_reachable` is not empty.\nIf this happens, rook pays 1 vun to teleport to `min_overall_unvisited`.\nQueen moves to `min(Q_reachable)`.\nSo if `min(Q_reachable) < min_overall_unvisited`, then queen makes a normal move, and rook pays.\nThis is the condition we need:\n`min(Q_reachable) < min_overall_unvisited_for_rook_teleport`.\n\nThis is tricky.\nWhat if we place `1` and `2` far apart, and make them hard to reach?\nFor example, `1` at `(0,0)` and `2` at `(N-1, N-1)`.\nThis seems to be a hard problem if `N` is odd.\nThe example output for `N=4` is a specific construction.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern for the `N=4` example.\nThe values are `1..16`.\n`1` is at `(2,1)`.\n`2` is at `(3,3)`.\n`3` is at `(0,1)`.\n`4` is at `(0,0)`.\n\nWhat if we try to fill cells in a specific order?\nLet's try filling the board by alternating small and large numbers.\nFor example, fill `(i,j)` with `i+j` even with `1, 3, 5, ...` and `(i,j)` with `i+j` odd with `2, 4, 6, ...`.\nOr vice-versa.\n\nLet's try placing `1` at `(0,0)`.\nSmall numbers `1, ..., N*N/2`\nLarge numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`\n\nConsider `N=1, 2, 3`. They all seem to be `-1`.\n`N=1`: Rook 0, Queen 0. `0 < 0` is false. So `-1`.\n`N=2`: As shown above, 0 vuns for both in a checkerboard pattern. It's hard to make them pay vuns.\nA piece pays a vun if it's completely surrounded by visited cells.\nFor `N=2`, if `1` is at `(0,0)`, then `(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)` are reachable.\nIf `2` is at `(0,1)`, `3` at `(1,0)`, `4` at `(1,1)`.\nRook: `1->2->3->4`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->4`. 0 vuns.\nThis is true for any permutation of `2,3,4`.\nSo `N=2` is also `-1`.\n\nWhat about `N=3`?\nMy checkerboard example yielded 0 vuns for both.\nCould `N=3` be `-1`?\nA `3x3` board has 9 cells.\nRook: Can reach up to 4 cells.\nQueen: Can reach up to 8 cells.\nIf `N` is odd, `N*N` is odd.\n`S_even` has `(N*N+1)/2` cells. `S_odd` has `(N*N-1)/2` cells.\nLet's put `1, 2, ..., (N*N-1)/2` in `S_odd` cells.\nLet's put `(N*N-1)/2+1, ..., N*N` in `S_even` cells.\nSo, `S_odd` cells get smaller numbers, `S_even` cells get larger numbers.\nStart at `1` (which is in `S_odd`).\nRook moves from `S_odd` to `S_even`. It will pick the smallest available `S_even` number.\nQueen moves from `S_odd` to `S_even` (horizontal/vertical) or `S_odd` to `S_odd` (diagonal).\nSince `S_odd` cells have smaller numbers, the queen will always prioritize moving to an `S_odd` cell if one is available.\nIf the current cell is `(r,c)` (Type B, small number), the queen will look for unvisited `S_odd` cells reachable diagonally. If found, it moves there. If not, it looks for unvisited `S_even` cells (horizontal/vertical).\nThe rook will always move to an `S_even` cell (large number).\nThis means the queen tends to stay in the `S_odd` \"region\" while the rook is forced into the `S_even` \"region\".\n\nLet's try to construct a solution for `N >= 4` that follows the logic of the example.\nThe example board for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)`.\nThe numbers `1` to `N*N` are filled.\nLet's place numbers `1, 2, ..., N*N/2` in a \"main\" region.\nAnd `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` in a \"secondary\" region.\nThe example `N=4` seems to put some small numbers in `S_even` and some large numbers in `S_odd`.\nThis \"mixing\" is what prevents the simple 0-vun outcome.\n\nLet `k = N*N/2`.\nWe need to fill `N*N` cells.\nLet's fill `k` cells with numbers `k+1, ..., 2k`.\nLet's fill the remaining `k` cells with numbers `1, ..., k`.\nThe example for `N=4`:\n`k = 8`.\nCells assigned `1..8`:\n`3` `(0,1)`\n`7` `(1,0)`\n`5` `(1,1)`\n`1` `(2,1)`\n`8` `(3,1)`\n`2` `(3,3)`\n`4` `(0,0)` (missing one `1..8` and has `4` and `6` as large. `6` is a large number here)\nThe example uses `1..16`.\n`1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8` are small.\n`9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16` are large.\nThe example board has:\nSmall numbers: `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`\nLarge numbers: `9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16`\n\n(0,0) 4 (small)  (0,1) 3 (small)  (0,2) 6 (small)  (0,3) 12 (large)\n(1,0) 7 (small)  (1,1) 5 (small)  (1,2) 9 (large)  (1,3) 15 (large)\n(2,0) 14 (large) (2,1) 1 (small)  (2,2) 11 (large) (2,3) 10 (large)\n(3,0) 13 (large) (3,1) 8 (small)  (3,2) 16 (large) (3,3) 2 (small)\n\nLet's count Type A/B for small/large numbers:\nType A (even sum): `(0,0) 4, (0,2) 6, (1,1) 5, (1,3) 15, (2,0) 14, (2,2) 11, (3,1) 8, (3,3) 2`.\n  Small in Type A: `4,6,5,8,2` (5 cells)\n  Large in Type A: `15,14,11` (3 cells)\nType B (odd sum): `(0,1) 3, (0,3) 12, (1,0) 7, (1,2) 9, (2,1) 1, (2,3) 10, (3,0) 13, (3,2) 16`.\n  Small in Type B: `3,7,1` (3 cells)\n  Large in Type B: `12,9,10,13,16` (5 cells)\n\nThis is a specific mix.\nThe key insight might be that for `N=1, 2, 3`, it's impossible.\nFor `N=1`, 0 vuns for both.\nFor `N=2`, 0 vuns for both.\nFor `N=3`, 0 vuns for both in my checkerboard pattern. Can we prove it's always 0 vuns for `N=3`?\nIt is possible that for small `N`, the board is too small to create the necessary \"trap\" for the rook that doesn't also trap the queen.\nIf `N=3`, `N*N=9`. Rook can reach at most 4 cells. Queen can reach at most 8 cells.\nThe maximum number of cells a piece can reach is `2*(N-1)` for rook and `4*(N-1)` for queen (from a corner).\nIf the total number of cells is small, it's likely all cells are reachable before a vun is paid.\nFor `N=3`, `N*N=9`.\nConsider the starting cell `1`.\nIf `1` is in a corner, say `(0,0)`. Rook can reach `(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0)`. 4 cells.\nQueen can reach `(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (1,1), (2,2)`. 6 cells.\nIf `1` is in the center, `(1,1)`. Rook can reach `(0,1), (2,1), (1,0), (1,2)`. 4 cells.\nQueen can reach all 8 other cells.\n\nIt's a common competitive programming pattern that small `N` values are special cases.\nThe example output for `N=4` is a valid solution.\nSo `N=1, 2, 3` are likely `-1`. For `N >= 4`, there is a solution.\n\nLet's try to construct a solution for `N >= 4`.\nThe example solution for `N=4` has a specific structure.\nLet's try to generalize it.\nIt seems like the cells with small numbers `1` to `N*N/2` are filled in a way that allows easy traversal.\nAnd the larger numbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` are used to fill the remaining cells.\nThe example distributes small and large numbers on both `S_even` and `S_odd` cells.\n\nLet's try a simpler construction for `N >= 4`.\nFill the `N x N` board.\nPlace numbers `1, 2, ..., N*N/2` in the top-left `N/2 x N` rectangle.\nPlace numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` in the bottom-right `N/2 x N` rectangle.\nThis is too simple, as it creates a clear boundary.\n\nLet's use the checkerboard pattern, but assign numbers in a different order.\nAssign numbers `1, 2, ..., N*N/2` to cells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is even.\nAssign numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` to cells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is odd.\nThis is exactly the opposite of what I tried for `N=3`.\nStart at `1` which is in an `S_even` cell.\nRook moves from `S_even` to `S_odd` (large numbers).\nQueen moves from `S_even` to `S_odd` (h/v) or `S_even` to `S_even` (diagonal, small numbers).\nQueen will prioritize `S_even` cells. Rook will be forced to `S_odd` cells.\nThis might lead to the queen visiting all small numbers first, then the large numbers.\nAnd the rook visiting small numbers, then large numbers, but with a different path.\n\nLet's try to fill the board with numbers such that the first `N*N/2` numbers are placed on cells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is even (Type A cells).\nAnd the numbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` are placed on cells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is odd (Type B cells).\nThis means `1` is on a Type A cell.\nLet's call `small_nums = {1, ..., N*N/2}` and `large_nums = {N*N/2+1, ..., N*N}`.\nSo, `board[i][j] \\in small_nums` if `i+j` is even.\n`board[i][j] \\in large_nums` if `i+j` is odd.\n\nIf `N` is even, `N*N` is divisible by 4. `N*N/2` is even.\n`|S_even| = N*N/2`, `|S_odd| = N*N/2`.\nThis assignment is perfect. All `S_even` cells get small numbers, all `S_odd` cells get large numbers.\nStart at `1` (Type A cell).\nRook:\n  From Type A cell: Can only move to Type B cells. So rook always picks the minimum available large number.\n  From Type B cell: Can only move to Type A cells. So rook always picks the minimum available small number.\nQueen:\n  From Type A cell: Can move to Type B cells (h/v, large numbers) or Type A cells (diag, small numbers). Queen will prioritize small numbers.\n  From Type B cell: Can move to Type A cells (h/v, small numbers) or Type B cells (diag, large numbers). Queen will prioritize small numbers.\n\nThis means the queen will try to stay on Type A cells as long as possible, visiting small numbers.\nThe rook will visit small numbers, then large numbers, then small, etc.\nConsider `N=4`. `N*N=16`. `N*N/2=8`.\n`S_even` cells get `1..8`. `S_odd` cells get `9..16`.\nBoard:\n1  9  2 10\n11 3 12 4\n5 13 6 14\n15 7 16 8\nLet `1` be at `(0,0)`.\nRook path:\n1. `(0,0)` (val 1).

It's unlikely to get stuck.\n\nIt is possible that `N=1,2,3` are indeed `-1`.\nFor `N >= 4`, we can use the example construction directly.\nThe example board is:\n4  3  6 12\n7  5  9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's try to generalize this for `N`.\nThe example places `1` at `(N-2, 1)`.\nIt places `2` at `(N-1, N-1)`.\nIt places `3` at `(0,1)`.\nIt places `4` at `(0,0)`.\n\nThis looks like a specific pattern for `N=4`.\nWhat if we just fill the cells `(i,j)` such that `i+j` is even with `1, ..., N*N/2` in increasing order (say, row by row).\nAnd fill `(i,j)` such that `i+j` is odd with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` in increasing order (say, row by row).\nThis is the checkerboard pattern I analyzed. It gives 0 vuns for `N=2,3,4`.\nSo, this specific checkerboard pattern doesn't work.\n\nThe example `N=4` board is quite specific.\nLet's look at the coordinates of `1,2,3,4` for `N=4`:\n`1` at `(2,1)`\n`2` at `(3,3)`\n`3` at `(0,1)`\n`4` at `(0,0)`\n\nThe key to the example might be that `1` is placed in a central-ish location.\nAnd `2` is placed far away, but reachable by queen diagonally.\nAnd `3` is placed nearby `1` (rook can reach).\nAnd `4` is placed nearby `3` (rook can reach).\n\nLet's consider the problem statement constraints: `1 <= N <= 500`.\nIf `N` is large, a simple checkerboard pattern might work to differentiate rook and queen behavior.\nPerhaps `N=1,2,3` are the only `-1` cases.\n\nIf `N` is odd, `N*N` is odd.\n`|S_even| = (N*N+1)/2`, `|S_odd| = (N*N-1)/2`.\nIf we assign `1, ..., (N*N-1)/2` to `S_odd` cells, and `(N*N-1)/2+1, ..., N*N` to `S_even` cells.\n`1` is on an `S_odd` cell.\nRook from `S_odd` to `S_even` (large numbers).\nQueen from `S_odd` to `S_odd` (small numbers) or `S_even` (large numbers).\nQueen will prioritize `S_odd` cells.\nThis makes the queen stay on small numbers, and the rook move between small and large.\nThis is the pattern I tested for `N=3` and it gave 0 vuns.\n\nWhat if we try to make the rook visit all `N*N` cells and then the queen visit all `N*N` cells?\nThis is not feasible. The process stops when all cells are visited.\n\nThe problem asks for *any* solution.\nIf `N=1,2,3`, print `-1`.\nFor `N >= 4`, print the example board structure.\nThe example board structure for `N=4` is not easy to generalize.\n\nWhat if we fill the board with numbers `1` to `N*N` in a specific order?\nLet `k = N*N`.\nFill `(i,j)` with `i+j` even, with numbers `1, 3, 5, ...` up to `k`.\nFill `(i,j)` with `i+j` odd, with numbers `2, 4, 6, ...` up to `k`.\nThis ensures `1` is on an even-sum cell, `2` on an odd-sum cell.\nThis is the \"interleaving\" strategy.\nFor `N=4`:\n`S_even` cells: `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\n`S_odd` cells: `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\nFill `S_even` with `1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15`.\nFill `S_odd` with `2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16`.\n\nBoard:\n1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\n(This is just filling row by row. This is not the checkerboard pattern.)\nCheckerboard:\n1 2 3 4\n2 1 4 3\n3 4 1 2\n4 3 2 1\nThis is not correct.\nLet's assign `1,3,5,...` to `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), ...`\nAnd `2,4,6,...` to `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), ...`\nBoard for `N=4`:\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\nThis is the standard row-major order assignment. This will result in 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe example board is very specific.\nIt is possible that the problem expects the exact example for `N=4` and a similar specific construction for other `N >= 4`.\nHowever, constructing such a board for general `N` is non-trivial.\n\nLet's re-read the problem statement carefully. \"Help him to find such N x N numbered board... or tell that it doesn't exist.\"\nIt doesn't say \"for general N\". It implies a single construction for all N or a proof of non-existence.\nThe phrasing \"If there are several solutions, you can output any of them\" suggests there might be multiple ways to achieve it.\n\nThe most common strategy for such problems is to find a simple general construction.\nThe example `N=4` board is not simple.\nThis leads me to believe that `N=1,2,3` are indeed `-1`, and for `N >= 4`, there is a general construction that is not the example, or the example itself is a specific instance of a general construction.\n\nWhat if we fill the top-left quadrant with small numbers, bottom-right with large numbers, and the other two quadrants with alternating small/large numbers?\nThis gets complicated quickly.\n\nLet's consider the problem constraints again. `N <= 500`. This suggests that `O(N^2)` or `O(N^2 log N)` solutions are fine.\nThe solution must be a simple pattern.\n\nA common pattern for `N >= 4` is to fill the first `N/2` rows with small numbers and the last `N/2` rows with large numbers.\nIf `N` is even, `N/2` rows.\nIf `N` is odd, `(N+1)/2` rows for small, `(N-1)/2` for large.\n\nLet's try this simple pattern for `N` even:\nFill rows `0` to `N/2-1` with numbers `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nFill rows `N/2` to `N-1` with numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nLet's put `1` at `(0,0)`.\nRook will visit all cells in the top `N/2` rows.\nThen it will be stuck in the top `N/2` rows, because all cells in its current row and column are visited.\nThen it will teleport to `N*N/2+1` (first cell in the bottom half).\nThen it will visit all cells in the bottom half.\nRook vuns = 1.\n\nQueen will visit all cells in the top `N/2` rows.\nThen it will be stuck in the top `N/2` rows.\nHowever, the queen can move diagonally.\nIf `1` is at `(0,0)`. It will visit all cells in the top `N/2` rows.\nWhen it reaches a cell like `(N/2-1, N/2-1)`, it can move diagonally to `(N/2, N/2)`.\nBut `(N/2, N/2)` contains a large number `N*N/2 + X`.\nThe queen will always prefer a small number.\nSo the queen will visit all numbers `1, ..., N*N/2` in the top half first.\nThen it will be stuck in the top half.\nThen it will teleport to `N*N/2+1`.\nQueen vuns = 1.\nSo this pattern also gives `1 vun` for both. Not `RookVuns < QueenVuns`.\n\nThis suggests the example for `N=4` is not a generic pattern but a specific one.\nThis implies `N=1,2,3` are `-1`. And for `N >= 4` we need a solution.\nWhat if `N` is odd and `N >= 5`?\nThe problem is hard if `N=1,2,3` are special cases, and `N=4` has a specific solution, and `N=5` has another specific solution, etc.\n\nThe only way to achieve `RookVuns < QueenVuns` is if the rook gets stuck and teleports, but the queen can still move normally.\nThis implies that the queen uses a diagonal path to escape, which the rook cannot.\nAnd the number in that diagonal path must be smaller than the minimum unvisited cell on the board (which the rook would teleport to).\n\nLet's consider the example `N=4` board again.\nThe unvisited cells when rook is at `(1,3)` (val 15) are `14` at `(2,0)` and `16` at `(3,2)`.\nRook pays 1 vun and teleports to `14`.\nAt this point, the queen is also at `(1,3)` (val 15).\nThe queen also has no reachable unvisited cells (as shown in my re-trace).\nSo queen also pays 1 vun and teleports to `14`.\nNow both are at `(2,0)` (val 14).\nUnvisited is `16` at `(3,2)`.\nRook is at `(2,0)`. Its row `2` has `14,1,11,10`. `1,11,10` are visited. Row 2 is blocked.\nIts col `0` has `4,7,14,13`. `4,7,13` are visited. Col 0 is blocked.\nRook is stuck. Teleports to `16`. Rook vuns = 2.\nQueen is at `(2,0)`. Its row `2` and col `0` are blocked.\nDiagonals from `(2,0)`:\n`(0,2) 6` (visited)\n`(1,1) 5` (visited)\n`(3,1) 8` (visited)\n`(4,-)` (out of bounds)\nQueen is stuck. Teleports to `16`. Queen vuns = 2.\nThis means for the example `N=4`, Rook pays 2 vuns, Queen pays 2 vuns.\nThis contradicts the problem statement: \"As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\"\nMy trace of the example board is giving `RookVuns=2, QueenVuns=2`.\nThe problem statement says `RookVuns=1, QueenVuns=2`.\nThis means my trace is wrong, or the example's trace is wrong, or I misunderstood something fundamental.\n\nLet's re-read the example trace in the problem:\nRook goes through cells `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`.\nThis path has 15 moves, then 1 vun. So 16 cells visited. Rook vuns = 1.\nQueen goes through `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`.\nThis path has 14 moves, then 1 vun, then 1 move, then 1 vun. So 16 cells visited. Queen vuns = 2.\n\nMy trace for the rook was correct up to `15`.\nAt `(1,3)` (val 15). Visited `{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16}`.\nUnvisited: `14` at `(2,0)`.\nRook is at `(1,3)`.\nRook reachable:\n`Row 1`: `(1,0) 7(V), (1,1) 5(V), (1,2) 9(V)`. All visited.\n`Col 3`: `(0,3) 12(V), (2,3) 10(V), (3,3) 2(V)`. All visited.\nRook is stuck. Unvisited `14` at `(2,0)`. Rook pays 1 vun, teleports to `(2,0)`.\nRook vuns = 1. This matches the example.\n\nMy trace for the queen was:\n... `1 -> ... -> 12 -> 15`. Current `(1,3)` (val 15).\nVisited `{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15}`. Unvisited: `14` at `(2,0)`, `16` at `(3,2)`.\nQueen at `(1,3)`.\nQueen reachable:\n`Row 1`: `(1,0) 7(V), (1,1) 5(V), (1,2) 9(V)`. All visited.\n`Col 3`: `(0,3) 12(V), (2,3) 10(V), (3,3) 2(V)`. All visited.\n`Diagonals`:\n`(0,2) 6(V)`\n`(2,2) 11(V)`\n`(3,1) 8(V)`\nAll reachable cells by Queen are visited.\nQueen is stuck. Unvisited: `14` at `(2,0)`, `16` at `(3,2)`. Min is `14`.\nQueen pays 1 vun, teleports to `(2,0)`. Queen vuns = 1.\nThis still gives `RookVuns=1, QueenVuns=1`.\nThe example output says Queen vuns = 2.\nThis implies that at the point Queen is at `(1,3)`, it is *not* stuck and can make a normal move.\nWhich means there is an unvisited cell reachable diagonally.\nLet's check the board from `(1,3)` again.\nBoard:\n4  3  6 12\n7  5  9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\nCurrent `(1,3)` val `15`. Visited `{1..13, 15}`. Unvisited `{14, 16}`.\nQueen reachable from `(1,3)`:\n` (0,2) val 6` (visited)\n` (2,2) val 11` (visited)\n` (3,1) val 8` (visited)\nAll cells `(0,2), (2,2), (3,1)` are visited. My trace is correct.\nThis means the example trace has a different set of visited cells when the queen is at `(1,3)`.\n\nLet's check the queen's path in the example:\n`1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15`\nLet's list the visited cells after this path:\n`{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15}`. This is the set of visited cells I used.\nThe unvisited cells are `14` at `(2,0)` and `16` at `(3,2)`.\nFrom `(1,3)` (val 15), Queen reachable:\n` (0,2) val 6` (visited)\n` (2,2) val 11` (visited)\n` (3,1) val 8` (visited)\nAll these cells are in the visited set.\nSo the queen *is* stuck at `(1,3)` and pays 1 vun, teleporting to `14`.\n\nThis means the example trace in the problem statement is inconsistent with the rules, or I am consistently misinterpreting something.\n\"Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number.\"\n\"If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number.\"\n\nIf the example trace is correct, then there must be an unvisited cell reachable by the queen from `(1,3)` that is smaller than `14`. But `14` is the smallest unvisited cell. This is impossible.\nIt must be that the queen *does not* get stuck at `(1,3)`, but rather makes a normal move to `14`.\nThis would mean `14` is reachable by the queen from `(1,3)`.\n`14` is at `(2,0)`. `(1,3)` to `(2,0)` is not a rook move (different row and col) and not a queen move (not diagonal, not horizontal, not vertical).\nSo `14` is NOT reachable from `(1,3)`.\n\nThis means the example trace from the problem statement is fundamentally flawed or I'm missing a critical rule.\n\"If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number.\"\nThis rule implies a vun is paid.\nThe trace says `15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`. This means `15` cannot reach `14` by normal move.\nSo my trace and logic are consistent with the rules, but inconsistent with the example's result.\n\nThis is a problem. If the example is wrong, then I can't rely on it.\nWhat if `N=1,2,3` are `-1` and for `N >= 4` we can simply output a board that gives `RookVuns=0, QueenVuns=0`?\nNo, the problem states \"rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen\". So `0 < 0` is false.\n\nIf the problem statement's example trace is correct, then the queen must have been able to make a normal move from `15` to some cell `X` where `X < 14`.\nBut `14` is the minimum unvisited cell overall. So `X` cannot be smaller than `14`.\nThis means the queen must have made a normal move from `15` to `14`. But `14` is not reachable from `15` normally.\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nLet's assume the problem statement's example output (board and final vuns) is correct, and my understanding of the trace is flawed.\nHow can the queen pay 2 vuns if the rook pays 1 vun?\nThis means the queen must have paid a vun, then teleported to `14`. Then paid another vun, teleporting to `16`.\nFor the queen to pay a vun and teleport to `14`, it must be stuck at `15`. This is what my trace showed.\nThen from `14`, it must be stuck again and teleport to `16`. This is also what my trace showed.\nSo Queen vuns = 2. This part of the example result is consistent with my trace.\n\nNow, for the rook.\nRook path: `... -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`. Rook vuns = 1.\nThis means the rook got stuck at `15`, teleported to `14`. This is what my trace showed.\nSo Rook vuns = 1. This part of the example result is also consistent with my trace.\n\nTherefore, my trace actually matches the example's outcome of `RookVuns=1, QueenVuns=2`.\nMy mistake was in concluding my trace led to `RookVuns=2, QueenVuns=2` earlier.\nThe example trace is consistent with the rules and the output.\n\nSo the strategy is:\n1. `N=1,2,3`: print `-1`.\n2. `N >= 4`: print the board structure that achieves `RookVuns < QueenVuns`.\nThe example `N=4` board works.\nHow to generalize this?\nThe example board for `N=4` is:\n4  3  6 12\n7  5  9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's try to find a pattern.\nIt seems like numbers are placed in a spiral or snake-like pattern.\nOr maybe specific cells are selected for small numbers, and the rest filled with large numbers.\nThe cells `(i,j)` with `i+j` even are: `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`.\nThe cells `(i,j)` with `i+j` odd are: `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`.\n\nSmall numbers `1..N*N/2` are `1..8` for `N=4`.\nLarge numbers `N*N/2+1..N*N` are `9..16` for `N=4`.\nSmall numbers: `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`\nLarge numbers: `9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16`\n\nLet's assign numbers `1, ..., N*N` to two groups of cells.\nGroup 1: cells `(i,j)` where `i` is even.\nGroup 2: cells `(i,j)` where `i` is odd.\nOr maybe based on `i % 2` and `j % 2`.\nThe example board for `N=4` seems to place small numbers `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8` in a specific way.\nAnd large numbers `9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16` in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's try to construct a general solution for `N >= 4`.\nFill the `N x N` grid.\nWe need two sets of cells. `S1` and `S2`.\nFill `S1` with numbers `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nFill `S2` with numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThe example `N=4` board seems to use a specific set of cells for small numbers.\nPerhaps `N=1,2,3` are `-1`. For `N >= 4`, we can use a specific pattern.\nThe pattern could be filling cells `(i,j)` in a certain order.\n\nLet's try to fill `N*N` cells using two pointers, `low = 1` and `high = N*N`.\nIterate through the board cells `(i,j)` in some order (e.g., row by row).\nIf `(i,j)` is in the first half of cells (e.g., `i < N/2`), assign `low++`.\nIf `(i,j)` is in the second half of cells (e.g., `i >= N/2`), assign `high--`.\nThis is just the simple top-half small, bottom-half large. This doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we fill the cells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is even with `low++` and cells `(i,j)` where `i+j` is odd with `high--`?\nThis is a checkerboard pattern.\nFor `N=4`:\n`S_even` cells: `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\n`S_odd` cells: `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\nFill `S_even` with `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`.\nFill `S_odd` with `16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9`.\nBoard (row-major order for filling):\n1 16 2 15\n14 3 13 4\n5 12 6 11\n10 7 9 8\n\nLet's trace this for `N=4`:\nStart at `1` at `(0,0)`. Visited `{1}`.\nRook from `(0,0)`: Reachable `(0,1) 16, (1,0) 14`. Min `14`. Move to `(1,0)`. Path `1->14`. Visited `{1,14}`.\nRook from `(1,0)`: Reachable `(0,0) 1(V), (2,0) 5, (3,0) 10`, `(1,1) 3, (1,2) 13, (1,3) 4`. Min `3`. Move to `(1,1)`. Path `1->14->3`. Visited `{1,3,14}`.\nThis looks promising. The rook is forced to jump to a large number (14), then back to a small number (3).\n\nQueen from `(0,0)`: Reachable `(0,1) 16, (1,0) 14`, `(1,1) 3, (2,2) 6, (3,3) 8`. Min `3`. Move to `(1,1)`. Path `1->3`. Visited `{1,3}`.\nQueen from `(1,1)`: Reachable `(1,0) 14, (1,2) 13, (1,3) 4`, `(0,1) 16, (2,1) 12, (3,1) 7`, `(0,0) 1(V), (2,2) 6, (3,3) 8`, `(0,2) 2, (2,0) 5, (3,2) 9`. Min `2`. Move to `(0,2)`. Path `1->3->2`. Visited `{1,2,3}`.\nThis pattern looks like it could work. The queen can always reach small numbers diagonally.\n\nLet's test this checkerboard pattern for `N` even (where `|S_even|=|S_odd|=N*N/2`).\n`S_even` cells get `1, ..., N*N/2`.\n`S_odd` cells get `N*N, N*N-1, ..., N*N/2+1`.\nStart at `1` (an `S_even` cell).\nQueen: From an `S_even` cell, it can move to an `S_even` cell diagonally (small number) or `S_odd` cell H/V (large number). It will prioritize `S_even` (small numbers). So queen will try to visit all `S_even` cells first.\nRook: From an `S_even` cell, it can only move to `S_odd` cells (large numbers).\nSo the rook will be forced to move to large numbers, then back to small numbers.\nThe queen will visit all `N*N/2` small numbers, then it will be stuck in the `S_even` \"region\". All `S_even` cells are visited.\nThen it will have to move to an `S_odd` cell (large number). It will choose `min(S_odd)` which is `N*N/2+1`.\nSo the queen will visit all `N*N/2` small numbers, then `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`. Queen vuns = 0.\n\nThe rook will alternate between small and large numbers.\n`1` (small) -> `N*N` (large) -> `2` (small) -> `N*N-1` (large) ...\nThe rook will always find an unvisited cell. So Rook vuns = 0.\nThis doesn't work.\n\nThe example has `N=4`.\nSmall numbers: `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`.\nLarge numbers: `9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16`.\nThe example board has small numbers scattered.\n`1` at `(2,1)`\n`2` at `(3,3)`\n`3` at `(0,1)`\n`4` at `(0,0)`\n`5` at `(1,1)`\n`6` at `(0,2)`\n`7` at `(1,0)`\n`8` at `(3,1)`\n\nIt seems the solution is simply:\nIf `N <= 3`, print `-1`.\nElse (`N >= 4`), print the `N=4` example board for `N=4`.\nFor `N > 4`, we need a general construction.\n\nLet's try to construct a specific solution for `N >= 4`.\nFill the top-left `(N-2)x(N-2)` subgrid using numbers `1, ..., (N-2)^2`.\nThen fill the border.\n\nThe problem is tagged as \"easy\". This suggests a simple pattern.\nThe problem statement's example for `N=4` is not a simple pattern.\nThis is confusing.\n\nFinal attempt at a general construction for `N >= 4`:\nLet `ans` be the `N x N` board.\nWe fill `N*N/2` cells with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nWe fill the remaining `N*N - N*N/2` cells with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nLet `num_small = 1`.\nLet `num_large = N*N`.\nIterate `i` from `0` to `N-1`, `j` from `0` to `N-1`.\nIf `(i+j)` is even: `ans[i][j] = num_small++`.\nIf `(i+j)` is odd: `ans[i][j] = num_large--`.\n\nThis is the checkerboard pattern where small numbers are on `S_even` cells and large numbers are on `S_odd` cells (in decreasing order).\nLet's re-verify the trace for this board for `N=4`.\nBoard:\n1 16 2 15\n14 3 13 4\n5 12 6 11\n10 7 9 8\n\nRook:\n`1` (0,0) -> `14` (1,0) -> `3` (1,1) -> `12` (2,1) -> `6` (2,2) -> `11` (2,3) -> `4` (1,3) -> `13` (1,2) -> `7` (3,1) -> `10` (3,0) -> `5` (2,0) -> `16` (0,1) -> `2` (0,2) -> `15` (0,3) -> `8` (3,3) -> `9` (3,2).\nRook vuns = 0. (Always found a path).\n\nQueen:\n`1` (0,0) -> `3` (1,1) -> `2` (0,2) -> `4` (1,3) -> `6` (2,2) -> `5` (2,0) -> `7` (3,1) -> `8` (3,3) -> `9` (3,2) -> `10` (3,0) -> `11` (2,3) -> `12` (2,1) -> `13` (1,2) -> `14` (1,0) -> `15` (0,3) -> `16` (0,1).\nQueen vuns = 0. (Always found a path).\n\nThis simple checkerboard pattern does not work.\nThis means the solution for `N >= 4` must be more complex than a simple checkerboard.\nThe problem is marked easy. This strongly suggests that `N=1,2,3` are `-1`, and for `N >= 4` the solution is the specific `N=4` board, extended in a simple way. But how?\n\nMaybe the problem is actually about `N=1,2,3` being `-1`, and for `N=4` we print the example. And for `N > 4`, there is no solution? No, that's not how competitive programming problems work. There must be a general construction for `N >= 4`.\n\nThe only remaining possibility for \"easy\" is that the specific `N=4` example board *is* the general construction, meaning it is applied to a subgrid.\nFor `N >= 4`, construct the `N x N` board.\nFill the `4x4` top-left subgrid with the example `N=4` solution.\nFill the rest of the board with numbers `17, ..., N*N` in some order (e.g., increasing).\nThis would make `1..16` follow the example trace, paying 1 and 2 vuns.\nThen the remaining cells are filled with larger numbers.\nThe rook and queen would finish `1..16` and then proceed to `17, ...`.\nThis would mean `RookVuns=1, QueenVuns=2` for the first `16` numbers.\nAfter `16` is visited, both pieces are at `16`.\nThen they proceed to visit `17, ..., N*N`.\nThis would be `RookVuns=1, QueenVuns=2`. This works!\n\nSo the strategy:\n1. If `N <= 3`, print `-1`.\n2. If `N >= 4`:\n   a. Create an `N x N` board.\n   b. Initialize `board[i][j]` with `0`.\n   c. Fill the `4x4` subgrid at `(0,0)` with the example solution:\n      `board[0][0]=4, board[0][1]=3, board[0][2]=6, board[0][3]=12`\n      `board[1][0]=7, board[1][1]=5, board[1][2]=9, board[1][3]=15`\n      `board[2][0]=14, board[2][1]=1, board[2][2]=11, board[2][3]=10`\n      `board[3][0]=13, board[3][1]=8, board[3][2]=16, board[3][3]=2`\n   d. Fill the remaining cells (those not in the `4x4` subgrid) with numbers `17, 18, ..., N*N` in increasing order.\n      A simple way to do this is to iterate `k` from `17` to `N*N`. Find the first `(i,j)` where `board[i][j] == 0` and set `board[i][j] = k`.\n\nThis seems like a plausible \"easy\" solution. The specific `N=4` case is given, and for larger `N` we embed it and fill the rest.\n\nLet's test this strategy for `N=5`.\nBoard `5x5`.\nTop-left `4x4` filled with the example.\nRemaining cells are:\n`(0,4)`\n`(1,4)`\n`(2,4)`\n`(3,4)`\n`(4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)`\nThese 9 cells will be filled with `17, 18, ..., 25`.\n`board[0][4]=17`\n`board[1][4]=18`\n`board[2][4]=19`\n`board[3][4]=20`\n`board[4][0]=21`\n`board[4][1]=22`\n`board[4][2]=23`\n`board[4][3]=24`\n`board[4][4]=25`\n\nThe rook and queen will follow the exact same path for `1..16` as in the `N=4` example, resulting in `RookVuns=1, QueenVuns=2`.\nAfter `16` is visited, both pieces are at `(3,2)` (cell `16`).\nNow the unvisited numbers are `17, ..., 25`.\nThe smallest unvisited is `17` at `(0,4)`.\nFrom `(3,2)` (val 16):\nRook reachable:\n`Row 3`: `(3,0) 13(V), (3,1) 8(V), (3,3) 2(V)`.\n`Col 2`: `(0,2) 6(V), (1,2) 9(V), (2,2) 11(V)`.\nRook is stuck. Teleports to `17`. Rook vuns = 1.\n\nQueen reachable:\n`Row 3` and `Col 2` are blocked.\n`Diagonals`:\n`(0,4) 17` (unvisited!)\n`(1,3) 15(V)`\n`(2,0) 14(V)`\n`(4,0) 21` (unvisited)\n`(4,4) 25` (unvisited)\nQueen can reach `17` at `(0,4)`. This is the minimum unvisited cell.\nSo the queen moves normally to `17`. Queen vuns = 2.\n\nThis construction works! The rook pays 1 vun, the queen pays 2 vuns.\nThis is a standard competitive programming trick: if a small `N` case is given with a complex solution, embed it for larger `N`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if N <= 3:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"-1\\n\")\n        return\n\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]\n\n    # Fill the 4x4 subgrid with the example solution\n    # Values: 1 to 16\n    example_4x4 = [\n        [4, 3, 6, 12],\n        [7, 5, 9, 15],\n        [14, 1, 11, 10],\n        [13, 8, 16, 2]\n    ]\n\n    for r in range(4):\n        for c in range(4):\n            board[r][c] = example_4x4[r][c]\n\n    # Fill the remaining cells with numbers 17 to N*N in increasing order\n    current_num = 17\n    for r in range(N):\n        for c in range(N):\n            if board[r][c] == 0:\n                board[r][c] = current_num\n                current_num += 1\n\n    for r in range(N):\n        sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, board[r])) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
