Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down Vanya and His Cards: A Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vanya and Cards problem, and it's calling for a Python script. My goal is clear: find the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to reach a sum of zero. I'm focusing on efficiency and a concise solution.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the problem. I have 'n' cards initially, with values within the range of [-x, x]. The challenge is to calculate the 'current_sum' of the existing cards. Then, to reach zero, I must add cards to negate that sum.\n\nThe constraints are manageable: 'n' is up to 1000, and 'x' is also up to 1000. These values won't cause any runtime issues. The plan is straightforward. Calculate the 'current_sum' of the found cards. Find the magnitude or absolute value of the 'current_sum'. Let's call it `target_abs_sum`. To minimize the number of cards, I need to maximize the value of each added card. If `target_abs_sum` is positive, Vanya needs cards with value -x. If negative, then add cards with the value x.\n\nThe key is in the `ceil(target_abs_sum / x)` calculation. This captures the minimum number of cards needed. I am treating the negative number as the positive value, as the sign of the value doesn't change the number of cards to be added. If I need a sum of 5 and the max value is 2, then I know 2, 2, and 1 will do the trick. The `ceil()` function handles the remainder perfectly. In the given example, a sum of 2 can be solved with one card with the value of -2 or 2.\n\nIn essence, I'll calculate the 'current_sum', its absolute value, and then divide by 'x', and finally, I'll use the ceiling function to round it up to the next integer. The resulting integer is the optimal number of cards. That seems like the most elegant way to solve this!\n",
