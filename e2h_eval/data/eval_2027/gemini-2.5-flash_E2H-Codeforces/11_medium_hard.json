A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Let's crack the \"Soft Drinking\" problem!**\n\nOkay, so we've got this problem about making toasts with a bunch of friends and limited resources. The key here is to figure out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that they all need the same amount of everything. First, I have to read the input: a line of eight positive integers representing the number of friends, bottles of soft drink, ml per bottle, number of limes, lime slices per lime, grams of salt, ml of drink per toast, and grams of salt per toast.\n\nMy mind immediately starts calculating! I have to find the total amount of each resource: total drink, lime slices, and salt. Then, and this is crucial, I have to calculate how many *individual* toasts we can make based on each resource individually, as if we weren't splitting the resources between people yet. This means dividing the total amount of drink by the ml each person needs per toast, and the total limes by slices needed per toast (which is 1 per person), and total salt by the grams per person per toast.\n\nThe next critical step is to find the minimum of those three values. This minimum tells me the maximum number of *individual* toasts that are possible, given the most limiting resource. Then, since the problem states that everyone drinks the same amount, I need to divide this minimum value by the number of friends. This is the final step, and that result will be the answer to the problem: the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nI can test this out with the example inputs to make sure I get the right answers. Finally, let's write the code. I need to make sure I use integer division to get the right answers, which is the main trick here. I can write a Python program to read the input, perform all of the calculations, and output the result. The solution should be relatively simple: calculate the total resources, calculate the individual toasts possible for each, find the minimum, and divide by the number of friends. Then output the result. Done!\n",
