You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Problem and My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the *minimum* number of edges ('t') I need to add to a given graph to create a simple odd-length cycle, and also the *number of ways* ('w') I can do this. The graph is undirected, no loops or parallel edges, and can be disconnected. Let's break this down systematically.\n\n**Key Insight: Bipartite Graphs and Odd Cycles**\n\nThe crucial concept here is the relationship between bipartite graphs and odd cycles. A graph *has* an odd-length cycle if and only if it *isn't* bipartite.  If the graph *already* has an odd cycle, then `t` is 0, and there's only one way to \"add\" zero edges (do nothing), so `w` is 1.\n\n**Finding `t` and `w`: A Case-by-Case Analysis**\n\n1.  **Case `t = 0` (Existing Odd Cycle):**  I need to *check* if the graph is bipartite. I'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) with 2-coloring for each connected component. If I ever try to assign a vertex a color that contradicts its neighbor's color (e.g., a neighbor of a red vertex is also red), it means I've found an odd cycle. If so, `t = 0` and `w = 1`.\n\n2.  **Case `t = 1` (Adding One Edge):**  If the graph *is* bipartite, I need to see if adding *one* edge can create an odd cycle. In a bipartite graph, each connected component can be 2-colored. To create an odd cycle, I must add an edge *between* two vertices of the *same* color *within* the *same* component. The number of ways is calculated per component as follows: if a component has 'x' vertices of color '0', the number of possible edges to add is x\\* (x - 1) / 2. Ditto for color '1'. I sum across all components and if the result is greater than zero, I have `t = 1`. The edge must not already exist in the graph. `w` is the calculated sum.\n\n    I need to make sure the added edge is allowed, but since this is a simple graph, it is always the case.\n    Example: 1-2-3-4 with coloring 0,1,0,1, there are 1 way to add edge between 1 & 3 to make a triangle with the original edge 2-3, and one way to add 2-4 and make a cycle length 5\n\n3.  **Case `t = 2` (Adding Two Edges):**  If both `t = 0` and `t = 1` are impossible, the graph *must* be bipartite, and adding one edge can't create an odd cycle. This means each connected component is either an isolated vertex or a single edge.\n    To form a minimum odd cycle, which is a triangle, I need *two* added edges. I'll use the idea to complete a triangle.\n    I need an existing edge, and a third vertex that is not adjacent to either end of that edge.\n    If I have `m` (number of existing edges), and `n` (number of vertices),  I count `n-2` to form a triangle.  If I can form it, then `t = 2` and `w` becomes `m \\* (n - 2)`.\n\n4.  **Edge Cases: No Possible Cycle:**  If after all this, `t` hasn't been found,  and all vertices are isolated. It would be impossible to form any cycle, `w` will be zero. I am told there is always a solution, in the problem, so there are edge cases I need to consider for small graphs.\n\n**My Algorithm: Step-by-Step**\n\n1.  **Bipartiteness Check (t = 0):** Iterate through connected components. Use BFS/DFS for 2-coloring. If a contradiction is found, set `t = 0`, `w = 1`, and stop.\n2.  **t = 1 Check:** If all components are bipartite, then I proceed with counting the ways.\n3.  **t = 2 and Default:** If `w=0`, it would indicate it cannot be formed with t=1 or t=2. I will handle the case and it will return 0 ways, since it requires the user's graph to have 3 vertices to form a cycle.\n4.  Handle the edge case for `",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so. A simple cycle means no vertex appears more than once. An odd length cycle must have at least 3 vertices.\n\nWe can analyze the problem based on the value of `t`.\n\n**Key Concept: Bipartite Graphs and Odd Cycles**\nA graph contains an odd-length cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. If a graph is bipartite, its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets (say, color 0 and color 1) such that all edges connect a vertex from one set to a vertex from the other set. Adding an edge between two vertices of the same color in a bipartite graph creates an odd-length cycle.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Check for existing odd cycle (`t=0`):**\n    We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to attempt a 2-coloring of the graph. We iterate through all connected components. For each unvisited vertex, start a traversal, assigning it color 0. Its neighbors get color 1, their neighbors get color 0, and so on.\n    -   If we encounter an edge `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` have already been assigned the same color, this indicates the presence of an odd-length cycle. In this case, `t=0` and `w=1` (there's one way to add zero edges). We print `0 1` and terminate.\n    -   If the entire graph can be 2-colored without any conflicts, it means the graph is bipartite. We proceed to find `t > 0`.\n\n2.  **If the graph is bipartite, check for `t=1`:**\n    To form an odd cycle by adding a single edge, we must add an edge between two vertices that are in the same connected component and have been assigned the same color during the 2-coloring process.\n    -   For each connected component, count the number of vertices assigned color 0 (`count_0`) and color 1 (`count_1`).\n    -   The number of ways to pick two distinct vertices of color 0 is `count_0 * (count_0 - 1) / 2`.\n    -   The number of ways to pick two distinct vertices of color 1 is `count_1 * (count_1 - 1) / 2`.\n    -   Sum these values over all connected components to get `W1`.\n    -   If `W1 > 0`, then `t=1` and `w=W1`. We print `1 W1` and terminate.\n\n3.  **If `W1 = 0`, check for `t=2`:**\n    `W1 = 0` implies that in every connected component, either `count_0 < 2` or `count_1 < 2` (or both). This means every connected component is either an isolated vertex or a single edge. In such a graph, we cannot form an odd cycle by adding just one edge within a component.\n    To form an odd cycle with two added edges, the simplest is a triangle `A-B-C-A`. If `(B, C)` is an existing edge, we can add edges `(A, B)` and `(A, C)` to form a triangle.\n    -   This strategy requires at least one existing edge (`m > 0`) and at least one other vertex `A` that is not `B` or `C` (`n - 2 > 0`, i.e., `n >= 3`).\n    -   If `m > 0` and `n >= 3`:\n        -   There are `m` choices for the existing edge `(B, C)`.\n        -   There are `n - 2` choices for the third vertex `A` (any vertex not `B` or `C`).\n        -   Since all components are isolated vertices or single edges, `A` must be in a different component than `B` and `C`. Therefore, `(A, B)` and `(A, C)` cannot be existing edges.\n        -   So, `t=2` and `w = m * (n - 2)`. We print `2 w` and terminate.\n\n4.  **If `m = 0` (all vertices are isolated) and `W1 = 0`:**\n    This means the graph consists only of isolated vertices. To form a cycle, we must add edges. The smallest odd cycle is a triangle, which requires 3 vertices and 3 edges.\n    -   This requires `n >= 3`.\n    -   We need to choose 3 distinct vertices `A, B, C` from `n` available vertices and add edges `(A, B)`, `(B, C)`, `(C, A)`.\n    -   The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from `n` is `n C 3 = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\n    -   So, `t=3` and `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. We print `3 w` and terminate.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n-   The problem guarantees that a solution always exists. This implies that `n` will be large enough for one of the cases above to yield `w > 0`. Specifically, `n` must be at least 3 for an odd cycle to be formed.\n-   The graph can be disconnected. The BFS/DFS approach correctly handles this by iterating through all unvisited vertices.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Example 1: `4 4`, edges `(1,2), (1,3), (4,2), (4,3)`):**\n1.  **Check `t=0`:**\n    -   `adj = {1: [2, 3], 2: [1, 4], 3: [1, 4], 4: [2, 3]}`\n    -   Start BFS from 1: `color[1]=0`.\n    -   `color[2]=1`, `color[3]=1`.\n    -   From 2: `color[4]=0`.\n    -   From 3: check neighbor 4. `color[4]=0`, `color[3]=1`. No conflict.\n    -   From 4: check neighbor 2. `color[2]=1`, `color[4]=0`. No conflict. Check neighbor 3. `color[3]=1`, `color[4]=0`. No conflict.\n    -   All vertices visited, no conflicts. The graph is bipartite.\n    -   Component 1: `count_0=2` (vertices 1, 4), `count_1=2` (vertices 2, 3).\n2.  **Check `t=1`:**\n    -   `W1 = (2 * (2-1) // 2) + (2 * (2-1) // 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    -   Since `W1 > 0`, `t=1`, `w=2`.\n    -   Output: `1 2`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        edges.append((u, v))\n\n    # Case 0: Check for existing odd cycle (t=0)\n    colors = {} # 0 or 1\n    visited_nodes = set()\n    is_bipartite = True\n    \n    # Store counts for each component to calculate W1 later\n    component_counts = []\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in visited_nodes:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            colors[i] = 0\n            visited_nodes.add(i)\n            \n            current_component_nodes = []\n            current_component_nodes.append(i)\n\n            component_bipartite = True\n            head = 0\n            \n            while head < len(q):\n                u = q[head]\n                head += 1\n                \n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if v not in colors:\n                        colors[v] = 1 - colors[u]\n                        q.append(v)\n                        visited_nodes.add(v)\n                        current_component_nodes.append(v)\n                    elif colors[v] == colors[u]:\n                        is_bipartite = False\n                        component_bipartite = False\n                        break\n                if not component_bipartite:\n                    break\n            \n            if not component_bipartite:\n                # Odd cycle found, t=0, w=1\n                print(0, 1)\n                return\n            \n            # If component is bipartite, count nodes for W1\n            count0 = 0\n            count1 = 0\n            for node in current_component_nodes:\n                if colors[node] == 0:\n                    count0 += 1\n                else:\n                    count1 += 1\n            component_counts.append((count0, count1))\n\n    # If we reach here, the graph is bipartite.\n    # Case 1: Check for t=1\n    W1 = 0\n    for c0, c1 in component_counts:\n        W1 += c0 * (c0 - 1) // 2\n        W1 += c1 * (c1 - 1) // 2\n    \n    if W1 > 0:\n        print(1, W1)\n        return\n\n    # If W1 == 0, then all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\n    # Case 2: Check for t=2 (add two edges to form a triangle)\n    # This requires an existing edge (m > 0) and at least 3 vertices (n >= 3)\n    if m > 0:\n        # We pick an existing edge (B, C) in m ways.\n        # We pick a third vertex A not B or C in (n - 2) ways.\n        # We add edges (A, B) and (A, C).
