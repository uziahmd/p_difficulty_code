Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition & Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  The core of it is understanding instability, which is simply the range (max - min) of an array. The challenge is to find the *minimum* instability we can achieve after removing *exactly one* element. I need a Python script to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to fully understand the problem. I've got this array 'a' with 'n' integers, and the instability is max(a) - min(a).  We have to remove a single element to create this new instability.  The goal is pretty clear: minimize this instability. The constraints give me an idea of how to approach this, with input sizes up to 10^5 and values up to 10^5.\n\nI've already run through the examples to cement my understanding.  The examples make the logic pretty easy to follow, but I can use them as test cases too.\nIt becomes clear that to minimize instability, you need to bring the maximum and minimum values as close together as possible after the deletion. It's really about minimizing that max - min difference.\n\nThe key insight hits me: since we're removing only *one* element, my best bet is to remove either the absolute minimum or the absolute maximum value. If I remove any other element, both the absolute min and max of the array will still be present, and the instability will stay the same.\n\nLet's break down these scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** If I remove the smallest element, my new minimum becomes the second smallest, and the maximum remains the same.\n*   **Scenario 2:** Removing the largest, I get the new maximum to be the second largest and the minimum remains the same.\n\nThese two scenarios seem to encapsulate all the likely optimal solutions.  I need to calculate the instability for both, `s_n - s_2` (where `s` is the sorted version) and `s_{n-1} - s_1` and take the minimum between them. This approach should give the most stable array possible. Now I just need to translate this into Python and I think I'm set.\n",
