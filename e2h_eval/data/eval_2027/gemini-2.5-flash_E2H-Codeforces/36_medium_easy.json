The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's what I'm thinking:** This problem is all about figuring out the probability of building radio towers in towns so that each town gets a signal from *exactly one* tower. We've got `n+2` towns, and the towers can be built in towns `1` to `n`. Each tower has a power level, and that power determines how far its signal reaches. Importantly, towns `0` and `n+1` can't receive any signal, and the signal from any tower *must* cover towns uniquely.\n\nMy first thought is that the power of a tower at a town `i`, let's call it `p_i`, is limited by `min(i, n+1-i)` to avoid sending signals to cities 0 or n+1. If we have set of locations for these towers `S`, each element of which is denoted by t_k, we will need to find a power for each tower, so that their intervals do not overlap. If there are towers built at towns, t_1<t_2<t_3<..., the intervals covered need to be adjacent. Hence, p_{t_1}=t_1, p_{t_k} + p_{t_{k+1}} = t_{k+1}-t_k+1, p_{t_m}=n-t_m+1. Each of the towers have their powers bounded by `min(t_k, n+1-t_k)`.\n\nSo, the power can be expressed in terms of the set of towns.\nThe problem can then be modeled as finding combinations of towers and their power levels that satisfy these conditions. We must also ensure the power levels are at least 1, and so the constraints can be represented in terms of the distances between the towns. If there is a way to express this as a system of equations, this might be simpler to solve. It seems like the condition that towns are uniquely covered means that the intervals covered by each tower must be non-overlapping.\n\nI start by thinking about how these power constraints must partition the town intervals from 1 to n. The initial and final tower power are easy to determine: the first tower has `p_{t_1} = t_1`, and the last tower `p_{t_m} = n - t_m + 1`.\n\nThe intermediate towers create a recurrence relation, `p_k + p_{k+1} = t_{k+1} - t_k + 1`  which can be used to solve for a specific `t_1, \\dots, t_n`.\n\nIf we build towers at `i`, their coverages need to be `[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]` with no overlaps or gaps.\n\nI then think this leads to finding the valid sets of tower locations. A set of tower powers has to obey the bounds of being non-overlapping and covering everything, for a specific n. Once I have the set, checking if there is a solution with `x_k = p_{t_k}` can be represented by the initial boundary conditions with a series of equations. `x_1 = t_1` and `x_m = n - t_m + 1`.\n\nThe main hurdle appears in checking if we can build a tower at a certain location. I need a way to count the valid ways this occurs, and find the corresponding probability, once the set of locations of the towers is determined. At the moment, I'm not seeing an easy formula; it feels like casework or a dynamic programming approach might be required to exhaustively build the sets and see if their powers satisfy the condition. The condition boils down to the fact the intervals are adjacent: `x_k = t_{k+1}-t_k+1-x_{k-1}`\n\nMy intuition says that I should focus on the intervals covered and how their power needs to meet the unique coverage conditions in a way that is also non-overlapping. Finding a recursive or iterative strategy here seems key. I still have to handle the probability calculation, but that will come after I can effectively decide whether a combination of tower locations works.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a valid configuration of signal powers can be chosen, given a random selection of towns for building towers. There are $n+2$ towns from $0$ to $n+1$. Towers are built in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each, independently.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe constraints are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ do not get any signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n\nA tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c-i| < p_i$. This means towns $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$ are covered.\nConstraint 1 implies that for any $i \\in S$, $p_i$ must satisfy $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$. This means $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This ensures that the covered interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ is entirely contained within $[1, n]$.\n\nConstraint 2 implies that the intervals $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ for $i \\in S$ must be disjoint and their union must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet the towns where towers are built be $t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_m$.\nFor the intervals to partition $[1, n]$:\n- The first interval must start at $1$: $t_1 - p_{t_1} + 1 = 1 \\implies p_{t_1} = t_1$.\n- The last interval must end at $n$: $t_m + p_{t_m} - 1 = n \\implies p_{t_m} = n - t_m + 1$.\n- Adjacent intervals must meet: $t_k + p_{t_k} - 1 = t_{k+1} - p_{t_{k+1}}$ for $1 \\le k < m$. This implies $p_{t_k} + p_{t_{k+1}} = t_{k+1} - t_k + 1$.\n\nSo, a set $S=\\{t_1, \\dots, t_m\\}$ is valid if there exist integers $p_{t_k}$ satisfying:\n(A) $p_{t_1} = t_1$\n(B) $p_{t_k} + p_{t_{k+1}} = t_{k+1} - t_k + 1$ for $1 \\le k < m$\n(C) $p_{t_m} = n - t_m + 1$\n(D) $1 \\le p_{t_k} \\le \\min(t_k, n+1-t_k)$ for all $k$.\n\nFrom (A) and (B), we can express all $p_{t_k}$ in terms of $t_j$:\n$p_{t_1} = t_1$\n$p_{t_2} = t_2 - t_1 + 1 - p_{t_1} = t_2 - 2t_1 + 1$\n$p_{t_3} = t_3 - t_2 + 1 - p_{t_2} = t_3 - 2t_2 + 2t_1$\n...\nIn general, $p_{t_k} = t_k - 2t_{k-1} + 2t_{k-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{k-1} 2t_1 + (-1)^k \\cdot C_k$, where $C_k$ is $1$ if $k$ is even, $0$ if $k$ is odd.\nMore precisely, $p_{t_k} = t_k + \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} (-1)^{k-j} (t_j - t_{j-1} + 1 - 2t_j)$ if $t_0=0$.\nThe recurrence $p_{t_k} = t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}}$ for $k \\ge 2$ with $p_{t_1} = t_1$ leads to:\n$p_{t_k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (-1)^{k-j} (t_j - t_{j-1} + 1) + (-1)^{k-1} t_1$ (if $t_0=0$)\nThis is $p_{t_k} = t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - (t_{k-1} - t_{k-2} + 1 - \\dots - (t_2 - t_1 + 1 - t_1)\\dots)$\n$p_{t_k} = t_k - 2t_{k-1} + 2t_{k-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{k-2} 2t_2 + (-1)^{k-1} 2t_1 + (-1)^k \\cdot 1$.\nThis formula is for $k \\ge 1$, where the last term is $1$ if $k$ is even, and $0$ if $k$ is odd.\nFor example, $p_{t_1} = t_1$. $p_{t_2} = t_2 - 2t_1 + 1$. $p_{t_3} = t_3 - 2t_2 + 2t_1$.\n\nNow, substitute this into (C) for $p_{t_m}$:\n$n - t_m + 1 = t_m - 2t_{m-1} + 2t_{m-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{m-2} 2t_2 + (-1)^{m-1} 2t_1 + (-1)^m \\cdot 1$.\nRearranging this:\n$n = 2t_m - 2t_{m-1} + 2t_{m-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{m-2} 2t_2 + (-1)^{m-1} 2t_1 + (-1)^m \\cdot 1 - 1$.\n$n = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j + ((-1)^m - 1)$.\nIf $m$ is even, $(-1)^m - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$. So $n = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j$.\nIf $m$ is odd, $(-1)^m - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2$. So $n = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j - 2$.\n\nConsider the values $p_{t_k}$ themselves.\n$p_{t_k} \\ge 1$ is required.\n$p_{t_k} \\le t_k$ and $p_{t_k} \\le n+1-t_k$ are required.\nThe condition $p_{t_k} + p_{t_{k+1}} = t_{k+1} - t_k + 1$ implies $p_{t_k} \\le t_{k+1} - t_k$ and $p_{t_{k+1}} \\le t_{k+1} - t_k$.\nThis implies $t_k + p_{t_k} - 1 \\le t_k + (t_{k+1} - t_k) - 1 = t_{k+1} - 1$.\nAnd $t_{k+1} - p_{t_{k+1}} + 1 \\ge t_{k+1} - (t_{k+1} - t_k) + 1 = t_k + 1$.\nThese ensure that the covered intervals $C_{t_k}$ and $C_{t_{k+1}}$ are disjoint and meet at $t_k+p_{t_k}-1 = t_{k+1}-p_{t_{k+1}}$.\nThe conditions $p_{t_k} \\le t_k$ and $p_{t_k} \\le n+1-t_k$ combined with $p_{t_k} \\ge 1$ are sufficient.\n$p_{t_1}=t_1 \\ge 1$. Also $t_1 \\le n+1-t_1 \\implies 2t_1 \\le n+1$.\n$p_{t_m}=n-t_m+1 \\ge 1$. Also $n-t_m+1 \\le t_m \\implies n+1 \\le 2t_m$.\nFor intermediate $p_{t_k}$:\n$p_{t_k} = t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}}$.\n$p_{t_k} \\ge 1 \\implies t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}} \\ge 1 \\implies p_{t_{k-1}} \\le t_k - t_{k-1}$.\nThis is $p_{t_{k-1}} \\le t_k - t_{k-1}$.\nThis is exactly the condition that $C_{t_{k-1}}$ does not extend past $t_k-1$.\nSimilarly, $p_{t_k} \\le t_k$ and $p_{t_k} \\le n+1-t_k$ need to be checked.\nIt turns out that these conditions are automatically satisfied by the $p_{t_k}$ derived from (A), (B), (C) if $t_1, \\dots, t_m$ satisfy a specific parity condition.\nLet $L_k = t_k - p_{t_k} + 1$ and $R_k = t_k + p_{t_k} - 1$.\nThe conditions are $L_1=1$, $R_k = L_{k+1}-1$, $R_m=n$.\nSubstituting $p_{t_k}$ definitions:\n$L_k = t_k - (t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}}) + 1 = t_{k-1} + p_{t_{k-1}}$.\nSo $L_k = R_{k-1}+1$. This is the adjacency condition.\nThe conditions $p_{t_k} \\le t_k$ and $p_{t_k} \\le n+1-t_k$ are equivalent to $L_k \\ge 1$ and $R_k \\le n$.\nSince $L_1=1$ and $R_m=n$ are enforced, and $L_k = R_{k-1}+1$ ensures intervals are adjacent within $[1, n]$, these conditions are met.\nThe only remaining conditions are $p_{t_k} \\ge 1$.\n$p_{t_1} = t_1 \\ge 1$. Always true since $t_1 \\ge 1$.\n$p_{t_m} = n-t_m+1 \\ge 1$. Always true since $t_m \\le n$.\n$p_{t_k} = t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}} \\ge 1$.\nThis means $p_{t_{k-1}} \\le t_k - t_{k-1}$.\nThis must hold for all $k=2, \\dots, m$.\nThis means the interval covered by $t_{k-1}$ does not extend to $t_k$ or beyond.\n$t_{k-1} + p_{t_{k-1}} - 1 < t_k$.\nThis implies $t_{k-1} + (t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_k}) - 1 < t_k \\implies t_k - p_{t_k} < t_k \\implies p_{t_k} > 0$.\nSo $p_{t_k} \\ge 1$ for all $k$ if and only if $p_{t_{k-1}} \\le t_k - t_{k-1}$ for all $k=2, \\dots, m$.\nThis is equivalent to $t_{k-1} + p_{t_{k-1}} - 1 < t_k$.\nBut we need $t_{k-1} + p_{t_{k-1}} - 1 = t_k - p_{t_k}$.\nSo $t_k - p_{t_k} < t_k$. This is $p_{t_k} > 0$.\nSo the only conditions are the values $t_j$ must be chosen such that the $p_{t_k}$ values are positive integers.\nThe specific values for $p_{t_k}$ are determined by $t_j$.\nThe problem reduces to finding valid sequences $t_1, \\dots, t_m$.\n\nLet's look at the conditions derived for $n$:\nIf $m$ is even: $n = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j$.\nIf $m$ is odd: $n = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j - 2$.\nThis implies that $n$ must be even if $m$ is even, and $n$ must be even if $m$ is odd (because $2 \\sum \\dots - 2$ is always even).\nSo if $n$ is odd, there are no valid configurations. This is incorrect based on example $n=3$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sum.\nThe sum $S = \\sum_{k=1}^m (-1)^{m-k} (t_k - t_{k-1} + 1)$ with $t_0=0$.\n$p_{t_m} = S = (t_m - t_{m-1} + 1) - (t_{m-1} - t_{m-2} + 1) + \\dots + (-1)^{m-1}(t_1 - t_0 + 1)$.\n$p_{t_m} = t_m - 2t_{m-1} + 2t_{m-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{m-1} 2t_1 + (-1)^m \\cdot 1$. (This is $p_{t_m}$ if $p_{t_1} = t_1$ is not used as initial condition, but $p_{t_1} = t_1-t_0+1$ is used).\nThe actual $p_{t_k}$ values were derived from $p_{t_1}=t_1$ and $p_{t_k} = t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}}$.\nThis means $p_{t_k} = t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - (t_{k-1} - t_{k-2} + 1 - (\\dots - (t_2 - t_1 + 1 - t_1)\\dots))$.\n$p_{t_k} = t_k - 2t_{k-1} + 2t_{k-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{k-1} 2t_1 + (-1)^k \\cdot 1$ if $k$ is even.\n$p_{t_k} = t_k - 2t_{k-1} + 2t_{k-2} - \\dots - 2t_2 + 2t_1$ if $k$ is odd. (This is $p_{t_k}$ if $p_{t_1}=t_1$ is used as initial condition).\nSo, if $m$ is odd: $p_{t_m} = t_m - 2t_{m-1} + \\dots + 2t_2 - 2t_1$.\nAnd we must have $p_{t_m} = n - t_m + 1$.\nSo $n - t_m + 1 = t_m - 2t_{m-1} + \\dots + 2t_2 - 2t_1$.\n$n + 1 = 2t_m - 2t_{m-1} + \\dots + 2t_2 - 2t_1 = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j$. (This is for odd $m$).\nIf $m$ is even: $p_{t_m} = t_m - 2t_{m-1} + \\dots - 2t_2 + 2t_1 + 1$.\nSo $n - t_m + 1 = t_m - 2t_{m-1} + \\dots - 2t_2 + 2t_1 + 1$.\n$n = 2t_m - 2t_{m-1} + \\dots - 2t_2 + 2t_1 = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j$. (This is for even $m$).\n\nIn both cases, $n$ and $m$ must have the same parity for $n+1 = 2 \\sum \\dots$ or $n = 2 \\sum \\dots$ to hold.\nIf $m$ is odd, $n+1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd.\nIf $m$ is even, $n$ must be even.\nThis condition on parity of $n$ and $m$ is correct.\n\nThe sequence of towns $t_1, \\dots, t_m$ must satisfy:\n1. $1 \\le t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_m \\le n$.\n2. For $k=1, \\dots, m$, $p_{t_k} \\ge 1$.\n   $p_{t_1} = t_1 \\ge 1$.\n   $p_{t_m} = n-t_m+1 \\ge 1$.\n   For $1 < k < m$, $p_{t_k} = t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}} \\ge 1$.\n   This implies $p_{t_{k-1}} \\le t_k - t_{k-1}$.\n   This condition $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1} - t_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, m-1$ is the key.\n   It means $t_j + p_{t_j} - 1 < t_{j+1}$.\n   The covered intervals are $[t_j - p_{t_j} + 1, t_j + p_{t_j} - 1]$.\n   The condition $p_{t_j} + p_{t_{j+1}} = t_{j+1} - t_j + 1$ implies that $t_j + p_{t_j} - 1 = t_{j+1} - p_{t_{j+1}}$.\n   So $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1} - t_j$ ensures $t_j + p_{t_j} - 1 < t_{j+1}$, which is $t_{j+1} - p_{t_{j+1}} < t_{j+1}$, which is $p_{t_{j+1}} > 0$.\n   So all $p_{t_k} \\ge 1$ is equivalent to $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1} - t_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, m-1$.\n\nSummary of conditions for a valid set $S=\\{t_1, \\dots, t_m\\}$:\n1. $1 \\le t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_m \\le n$.\n2. Parity condition: $n \\pmod 2 = m \\pmod 2$.\n   If $m$ is odd: $n+1 = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j$.\n   If $m$ is even: $n = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j$.\n3. $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1} - t_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, m-1$.\n\nLet's check $n=3$, $m=3$. $t_1=1, t_2=2, t_3=3$.\n$m=3$ is odd, $n=3$ is odd. Parity matches.\n$n+1 = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^3 (-1)^{3-j} t_j = 2(t_1 - t_2 + t_3) = 2(1-2+3) = 2(2) = 4$.\n$3+1=4$. This matches.\n$p_{t_1}=1$. $p_{t_2}=2-2(1)+1 = 1$. $p_{t_3}=3-2(2)+2(1)=1$.\nConditions $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1}-t_j$:\n$p_{t_1} \\le t_2-t_1 \\implies 1 \\le 2-1=1$.

Parity mismatch).\n  $S=\\{2\\}$ is not valid ($t_1=2 \\le 1.5$ is false).\n  So only $S=\\{1,2\\}$ is valid. Probability $1/2^2 = 1/4$. Correct for example.\nFor $n=3$: $F_4=3$.\n  $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$. Valid.\n  $S=\\{2\\}$. Valid.\n  Wait, $F_4=3$ but I found 2 ways. What is the third way?\n  The $F_{n+1}$ counts ways to tile an $n \\times 1$ board with $1 \\times 1$ and $2 \\times 1$ tiles.\n  A $1 \\times 1$ tile corresponds to $p_k=1$. A $2 \\times 1$ tile corresponds to $p_k=2$.\n  This is a different problem. The problem is about \"perfect matchings\" on a path graph.\n  The problem is actually equivalent to counting ways to tile a $1 \\times n$ strip using $1 \\times k$ tiles, where each tile corresponds to an interval covered by a tower. Each tile of length $2p_i-1$ is centered at $i$.\n  The number of ways to partition $[1, n]$ into intervals $[L_k, R_k]$ where $L_k \\le t_k \\le R_k$ and $t_k$ is the center is $F_{n+1}$.\n  For each such partition, we need to check if $t_k$ is an integer.\n  If an interval is $[a, b]$, its length is $b-a+1$.\n  The center $t_k$ is $(a+b)/2$. So $a+b$ must be even.\n  $t_1=1, p_{t_1}=t_1 \\implies [1, 2t_1-1]$. $1+(2t_1-1)$ is even.\n  $t_m=n, p_{t_m}=n-t_m+1 \\implies [2t_m-n, n]$. $(2t_m-n)+n$ is even.\n  $t_k, p_{t_k}$ such that $p_{t_k} + p_{t_{k+1}} = t_{k+1}-t_k+1$.\n  The length of interval $k$ is $2p_{t_k}-1$. The length of interval $k+1$ is $2p_{t_{k+1}}-1$.\n  The sum of lengths is $2p_{t_k}-1 + 2p_{t_{k+1}}-1 = 2(t_{k+1}-t_k+1)-2 = 2(t_{k+1}-t_k)$.\n  This means the total length of two adjacent intervals is an even number.\n  This implies that if $t_k$ is integer, $t_{k+1}$ is integer.\n  Specifically, $p_{t_k} = t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}}$.\n  $p_{t_1}=t_1$.\n  $p_{t_k} \\pmod 2 = (t_k - t_{k-1} + 1 - p_{t_{k-1}}) \\pmod 2$.\n  If $t_1$ is integer, then $p_{t_1}$ is integer.\n  If $t_k$ are all integers, then $p_{t_k}$ are all integers.\n  The condition is that $t_k$ must be in $S$.\n  The problem is counting the number of subsets $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ that satisfy the conditions.\n  The number of such subsets $S$ is $F_{n+1}$.\n  For $n=3$, $F_4=3$. My examples $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $S=\\{2\\}$ are two. What is the third?\n  $S=\\{1,3\\}$ for $n=3$? $m=2, n=3$. Parity mismatch. Not valid.\n\nLet's re-verify the conditions.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $t_1, \\dots, t_m$ are distinct integers from $1$ to $n$.\n2. Parity condition: $n \\pmod 2 = m \\pmod 2$.\n3. Equation $E_m$: $n = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j$ if $m$ is even, $n+1 = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m (-1)^{m-j} t_j$ if $m$ is odd.\n4. $p_{t_j} \\ge 1$ for all $j$. This is equivalent to $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1}-t_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, m-1$.\n\nLet $dp[i]$ be the number of valid sequences $t_1, \\dots, t_m$ such that $t_m=i$.\nThis is not quite right.\nThe number of valid sequences is indeed $F_{n+1}$. This is a known result for this type of partitioning.\nThe number of ways to choose $S$ is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_2=1$. $S=\\{1\\}$. Probability $1/2^1 = 1/2$. Example output $748683265 \\equiv 1/2 \\pmod{998244353}$. Correct.\nFor $n=2$, $F_3=2$. $S=\\{1,2\\}$. Prob $1/4$. $S=\\{\\}$? No, $m=0$ is even, $n=2$ is even. $2 = 2 \\sum (\\dots) = 0$. False.\nWhat are the $F_{n+1}$ solutions?\nA solution corresponds to a way to tile a $1 \\times n$ strip with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ tiles.\nA $1 \\times 1$ tile at position $i$ means the segment $[i,i]$ is covered by a tower at $i$ with $p_i=1$.\nA $1 \\times 2$ tile at positions $[i,i+1]$ means the segment $[i,i+1]$ is covered by a tower at some $t_k$.\nThis is usually related to $t_k=i$ and $p_i=1$ or $t_k=i+1$ and $p_{i+1}=1$.\nThe problem describes intervals of length $2p_i-1$.\nA $1 \\times 1$ tile means $2p_i-1 = 1 \\implies p_i=1$. This covers $[i,i]$. The tower is at $i$.\nA $1 \\times 2$ tile means $2p_i-1 = 2$. This is not possible for integer $p_i$.\nSo the $F_{n+1}$ count is for tiling with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ blocks, where $1 \\times 1$ block implies $p_i=1$ and $1 \\times 2$ block implies $p_i=1$ and $p_{i+1}=1$.\nThis is not quite right.\nThis problem is known as \"perfect matchings on a path graph\" or \"counting independent sets on a path graph\".\nIt's about covering $N$ points with segments.\n\nLet's re-read the example for $n=5$.\nIf $n=5$, towers in towns $2,4,5$. $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n$t_1=2, t_2=4, t_3=5$. $m=3, n=5$. Both odd. Parity matches.\n$n+1 = 2(t_1-t_2+t_3) \\implies 5+1 = 2(2-4+5) = 2(3) = 6$. Matches.\n$p_{t_1}=t_1=2$. $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$.\n$p_{t_2}=t_2-2t_1+1 = 4-2(2)+1 = 1$. $p_4=1$. Covers $[4,4]$.\n$p_{t_3}=t_3-2t_2+2t_1 = 5-2(4)+2(2) = 5-8+4=1$. $p_5=1$. Covers $[5,5]$.\nCheck conditions $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1}-t_j$:\n$p_{t_1} \\le t_2-t_1 \\implies 2 \\le 4-2=2$. OK.\n$p_{t_2} \\le t_3-t_2 \\implies 1 \\le 5-4=1$. OK.\nSo $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$ is a valid set. The example output for $n=5$ is $5/32$.\n$F_{5+1}=F_6=8$.\nThe number of valid configurations is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=5$, $F_{5+1}=F_6=8$.\nThe valid sets are:\n1. $m=1$: $t_1=3$. $n=5, m=1$. Odd, odd. $5+1=2(3)=6$. Valid. $p_3=3$. Covers $[1,5]$.\n2. $m=3$:\n   $t_1=1, t_2=3, t_3=5$. $n=5, m=3$. Odd, odd. $5+1=2(1-3+5)=2(3)=6$. Valid. $p_1=1, p_3=1, p_5=1$. Covers $[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4], [5,5]$. No, $p_1=1$ covers $[1,1]$, $p_3=1$ covers $[3,3]$, $p_5=1$ covers $[5,5]$. This is not a partition.\n   My derivation of $p_{t_k}$ is correct. The problem is with $p_{t_k} \\le t_{k+1}-t_k$.\n   For $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$: $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. $p_3=3-2(1)+1=2$. Covers $[2,4]$. $p_5=5-2(3)+2(1)=1$. Covers $[5,5]$.\n   $p_1 \\le t_2-t_1 \\implies 1 \\le 3-1=2$. OK.\n   $p_3 \\le t_3-t_2 \\implies 2 \\le 5-3=2$. OK.\n   So $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$ is valid.\n   $t_1=1, t_2=2, t_3=4$. No, $n=5$. $p_1=1, p_2=2-2(1)+1=1, p_4=4-2(2)+2(1)=2$.\n   $p_1 \\le t_2-t_1 \\implies 1 \\le 2-1=1$. OK.\n   $p_2 \\le t_3-t_2 \\implies 1 \\le 4-2=2$. OK.\n   $n+1 = 2(1-2+4)=2(3)=6$. Valid. $S=\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n   $t_1=2, t_2=4, t_3=5$. (This is the example). Valid.\n   $t_1=1, t_2=3, t_3=4$. $p_1=1, p_3=3-2(1)+1=2, p_4=4-2(3)+2(1)=0$. Not valid. $p_{t_k} \\ge 1$ must hold.\n   $p_4=0$ means $t_3-2t_2+2t_1=0$.\n   $m=5$: $t_1=1, t_2=2, t_3=3, t_4=4, t_5=5$. $n=5, m=5$. Odd, odd. $5+1=2(1-2+3-4+5)=2(3)=6$. Valid. $p_k=1$ for all $k$.\n   $p_k \\le t_{k+1}-t_k \\implies 1 \\le 1$. OK.\n   This is 4 ways for $n=5$.\n3. $m=2$: $n=5, m=2$. Odd, even. Parity mismatch. No solutions.\n4. $m=4$: $n=5, m=4$. Odd, even. Parity mismatch. No solutions.\n\nThe number of valid configurations is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_3=2$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_4=3$. (My examples were $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $S=\\{2\\}$. The third one is $S=\\{1,3\\}$ is not valid because $n=3, m=2$ mismatch parity.\nWhat is the third for $n=3$?\n$S=\\{1,2,3\\}$: $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$. Valid.\n$S=\\{2\\}$: $p_2=2$. Valid.\nThe third one is $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ with $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$.\nWait, the $F_{n+1}$ count is not for subsets $S$, but for the number of ways to partition $[1,n]$ into segments.\nFor $n=3$:\n1. $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]$. $t_1=1, p_1=1; t_2=2, p_2=1; t_3=3, p_3=1$. This is $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n2. $[1,3],[4,4]$? No, $[1,3]$ is $t_1=2, p_2=2$. Remaining is $[4,4]$. $n=3$. So $[1,3]$ and $[4,4]$ is not a partition of $[1,3]$.\n   $[1,3]$ means $t_1=2, p_2=2$. $S=\\{2\\}$.\n3. $[1,1],[2,3]$. $t_1=1, p_1=1$. $t_2=2.5$. Not an integer.\n4. $[1,2],[3,3]$. $t_1=1.5$. Not an integer.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $S$ such that the conditions are met is $F_{n+1}$.\nThe example output for $n=3$ is $1/4$. $F_4=3$. $3/2^3 = 3/8$. Why is it $1/4$?\nThe note for $n=3$:\nWith probability $1/8$, towers in $1,2,3$. Set powers to $1$. Valid.\nWith probability $1/8$, only tower in $2$. Set power to $2$. Valid.\nTotal $2/8 = 1/4$.\nMy analysis is correct that there are 2 valid sets for $n=3$.\nSo the number of ways is not $F_{n+1}$.\n\nLet $dp[i]$ be the number of valid sequences $t_1, \\dots, t_m$ where $t_m=i$.\nThis is hard. Let's simplify the conditions.\nThe conditions $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1}-t_j$ are equivalent to $R_j < L_{j+1}$. But we need $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\nThis means $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1}-t_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, m-1$.\nThis is equivalent to $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1}-t_j$.\n$t_j - 2t_{j-1} + \\dots + (-1)^{j-1} 2t_1 + (-1)^j \\cdot K_j \\le t_{j+1}-t_j$.\nThis is becoming too complex.\n\nThe problem states \"Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\"\nThis means we need to count the number of subsets $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ for which a valid assignment of powers exists.\nLet $N_n$ be this count. The probability is $N_n / 2^n$.\n\nConsider $dp[i]$ as the number of ways to partition $[1, i]$ using towers from $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, i\\}$.\nIf $i$ is covered by a tower $t_m=i$ with $p_i=1$, then $[i,i]$ is covered. We need to partition $[1, i-1]$. $dp[i-1]$ ways.\nIf $i$ is covered by a tower $t_m=i-1$ with $p_{i-1}=2$, then $[i-2,i]$ is covered. We need to partition $[1, i-3]$. $dp[i-3]$ ways.\nThis is not quite right because the tower is at $t_m$, not necessarily $i$ or $i-1$.\n\nLet $f(k)$ be the number of ways to partition the segment $[1, k]$ using towers chosen from $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, such that all conditions are met for this segment.\nBase cases:\n$f(0) = 1$ (empty segment, empty set of towers).\n$f(1)$: $S=\\{1\\}$. $m=1, n=1$.

This is where it goes wrong.\n\nMy $f(n)$ definition is \"number of ways to partition $[1, n]$\".\nThe condition $p_{t_j} \\le t_{j+1}-t_j$ is the one I need to check carefully.\nThis condition is $t_j + p_{t_j} - 1 < t_{j+1}$.\nThis means the interval $C_{t_j}$ ends strictly before $t_{j+1}$.\nBut we need $t_j + p_{t_j} - 1 = t_{j+1} - p_{t_{j+1}}$.\nSo $t_j + p_{t_j} - 1 < t_{j+1}$ is equivalent to $p_{t_{j+1}} > 0$.\nSo the condition $p_{t_k} \\ge 1$ for all $k$ is automatically satisfied if $p_{t_1} \\ge 1$ and $p_{t_m} \\ge 1$.\n$p_{t_1}=t_1 \\ge 1$ is always true.\n$p_{t_m}=n-t_m+1 \\ge 1$ is always true since $t_m \\le n$.\nSo the only conditions are:\n1. $1 \\le t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_m \\le n$.\n2.

The parity of $m$ changes.\n  If $dp[i-1]$ counts based on $m_{prev}$ (number of towers used for $[1,i-1]$), then $m = m_{prev}+1$.\n  The sum $S_m = (-1)^0 t_m + (-1)^1 t_{m-1} + \\dots = t_m - S_{m_{prev}}$.\n  This means we need to consider the value of $S_m$ and $m \\pmod 2$.\n\nLet $dp[i][\\text{parity}]$ be the number of valid ways to partition $[1, i]$ using towers in $\\{1, \\dots, i\\}$, ending with a configuration where the number of towers has `parity`.\n`dp[i][0]` for even $m$. `dp[i][1]` for odd $m$.\nFor $dp[i][0]$: $n=i$, $m$ is even. $i = 2 \\sum (-1)^{m-j} t_j$.\nFor $dp[i][1]$: $n=i$, $m$ is odd. $i+1 = 2 \\sum (-1)^{m-j} t_j$.\n\nConsider the last tower $t_m$. Its interval is $[t_m - p_{t_m} + 1, i]$.\nWe know $p_{t_m} = i - t_m + 1$.\nThe previous interval was $[L_{m-1}, R_{m-1}]$. $R_{m-1} = t_m - p_{t_m}$.\nLet $k = t_m - p_{t_m}$. This is the end of the previous segment.\n$k = t_m - (i - t_m + 1) = 2t_m - i - 1$.\nSo $t_m = (k+i+1)/2$.\nFor $t_m$ to be an integer, $k+i+1$ must be even. So $k$ and $i$ must have different parities.\nThe previous segment ended at $k$. It must be a valid partition of $[1, k]$.\nThe number of towers $m$ for $[1, i]$ is $m_{prev}+1$.\nSo if $m$ is even, $m_{prev}$ must be odd.\nIf $m$ is odd, $m_{prev}$ must be even.\n\nThis is a known recurrence for \"number of ways to tile a $1 \\times N$ strip with tiles of length $1$ and $2$\".\n$dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]$.\n$dp[i]$ is the number of ways to partition $[1,i]$ into segments.\nA segment $[j,i]$ is covered by a tower $t_m=(j+i)/2$.\nIf $j=i$, $t_m=i$. $p_i=1$. This covers $[i,i]$. The previous partition is for $[1, i-1]$.\nIf $j=i-1$, $t_m=(i-1+i)/2$. Not an integer.\nIf $j=i-2$, $t_m=i-1$. $p_{i-1}=2$. This covers $[i-2,i]$. The previous partition is for $[1, i-3]$.\nThis leads to $dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-3]$ if $i$ is even (for $dp[i-1]$) or $i$ is odd (for $dp[i-3]$).\nThis is not $F_{n+1}$.\n\nLet $A_n$ be the number of valid sets $S$.\n$A_0 = 1$ (empty set $S=\\{\\}$, $m=0, n=0$. $0=2 \\sum \\dots$. Valid).\n$A_1 = 1$ ($S=\\{1\\}$).\n$A_2 = 1$ ($S=\\{1,2\\}$).\n$A_3 = 2$ ($S=\\{1,2,3\\}, S=\\{2\\}$).\n$A_4 = 3$ ($S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}, S=\\{1,3\\}, S=\\{2,4\\}$).\n$A_5 = 5$ ($S=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}, S=\\{1,2,4\\}, S=\\{1,3,5\\}, S=\\{2,4,5\\}, S=\\{3\\}$).\nThis is $A_n = F_{n+1}$. (Using $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$).\nThe example output for $n=5$ is $5/32$. This means $A_5=5$.\nMy $f(n)$ calculations for $n=0,1,2,3,4,5$ are: $1,1,1,2,3,5$.\nThis sequence is $F_{n+1}$ (if $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nThis means the number of valid subsets $S$ is indeed $F_{n+1}$.\nThe example $n=2$ output is $1/4$. $F_3/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\nExample $n=2$ output $748683265 \\equiv 1/2 \\pmod{998244353}$. My calculation is correct.\nExample $n=3$ output $1/4$. $F_4/2^3 = 3/8$. Example output $748683265 \\equiv 1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. My calculation is $F_4=2$.\nMy $f(3)=2$ is correct. $F_4=3$. So $f(n)$ is NOT $F_{n+1}$.\nThe Fibonacci sequence for $A_n$ is: $A_0=1, A_1=1, A_2=1, A_3=2, A_4=3, A_5=5$.\nThis is $A_n = F_{n+1}$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$).\nThe example $n=2$ output is $1/4$. My $A_2=1$. $1/4$.\nThe example $n=3$ output is $1/4$. My $A_3=2$. $2/8=1/4$.\nThe example $n=5$ output is $5/32$. My $A_5=5$. $5/32$.\nIt seems $A_n=F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 0$ (using $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\n\nSo the number of valid subsets $S$ is $F_{n+1}$.\nThe probability is $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to compute $F_{n+1} \\pmod{998244353}$ and $2^n \\pmod{998244353}$ and its modular inverse.\nFibonacci numbers can be computed using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n$F_{n+1}$ is the top-left element of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n$.\n$P = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$P^n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_n \\\\ F_n & F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe modulus is $998244353$.\n\nLet's double check the $A_n$ sequence.\n$A_0=1$: $S=\\{\\}$, $m=0, n=0$. $n=0, m=0$ (even, even). $0 = 2 \\sum (\\dots) = 0$. Valid.\n$A_1=1$: $S=\\{1\\}$. $m=1, n=1$ (odd, odd). $1+1 = 2(1) = 2$. Valid.\n$A_2=1$: $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $m=2, n=2$ (even, even). $2 = 2(2-1) = 2$. Valid.\n  $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n  Other options: $S=\\{1\\}$ (parity mismatch), $S=\\{2\\}$ (parity mismatch).\n$A_3=2$:\n  $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$. $m=3, n=3$ (odd, odd). $3+1 = 2(1-2+3) = 4$. Valid.\n    $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$.\n  $S=\\{2\\}$. $m=1, n=3$ (odd, odd). $3+1 = 2(2) = 4$. Valid.\n    $p_2=2$.\n  Other options: $S=\\{1,3\\}$ (parity mismatch).\n$A_4=3$:\n  $m=0$: no ($4=0$)\n  $m=1$: no (parity mismatch)\n  $m=2$: $n=4, m=2$ (even, even). $4=2(t_2-t_1) \\implies t_2-t_1=2$.\n    $S=\\{1,3\\}$. $p_1=1, p_3=2$. Valid.\n    $S=\\{2,4\\}$. $p_2=2, p_4=1$. Valid.\n  $m=3$: no (parity mismatch)\n  $m=4$: $n=4, m=4$ (even, even). $4=2(t_4-t_3+t_2-t_1)$.\n    $S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. $1-2+3-4=-2$. $2(-2)=-4 \\ne 4$. Invalid.\n    Wait, $4=2(4-3+2-1)=2(2)=4$. This is valid. $p_k=1$.\n    So $A_4=2+1=3$.\n$A_5=5$:\n  $m=1$: $t_1=3$. $S=\\{3\\}$. Valid. (1 way)\n  $m=3$: $n=5, m=3$ (odd, odd). $t_1-t_2+t_3=3$.\n    $S=\\{1,2,4\\}$. Valid.\n    $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$. Valid.\n    $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. Valid.\n    $S=\\{2,3,4\\}$ was invalid ($p_3=0$).\n    So 3 ways.\n  $m=5$: $n=5, m=5$ (odd, odd). $t_1-t_2+t_3-t_4+t_5=3$.\n    $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. Valid. (1 way)\n  So $A_5=1+3+1=5$.\n\nThe sequence $A_n$ is $1,1,1,2,3,5, \\dots$. This is indeed $F_{n+1}$ using $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThe probability is $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nFinal check on $n=2$ example:\n$n=2$. $A_2=F_3=2$. Probability $2/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\nExample output for $n=2$ is $748683265$.\n$1/2 \\pmod{998244353}$. $2^{-1} = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\n$1 \\cdot 499122177 = 499122177$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$. This is not $1/2$.\nThis implies my $A_n = F_{n+1}$ is wrong.\nWhat is the difference? The example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$.\nThis is for $n=1$ in the example.\nThe example input is `['2', '3', '5', '200000']`\nThe output is `['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']`\nThis means:\nFor $n=1$: output $748683265$. $1/2$.\nFor $n=2$: output $748683265$. $1/4$.\nFor $n=3$: output $842268673$. $1/4$.\nFor $n=5$: output $202370013$. $5/32$.\n\nMy $A_n$ results:\n$A_1=1$. Prob $1/2^1 = 1/2$. Correct.\n$A_2=1$. Prob $1/2^2 = 1/4$. Correct.\n$A_3=2$. Prob $2/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Correct.\n$A_5=5$. Prob $5/2^5 = 5/32$. Correct.\n\nIt seems my sequence $A_n$ is correct, and it is $F_{n+1}$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nThe example outputs are $1/2, 1/4, 1/4, 5/32$.\nMy sequence $A_n$ is $A_1=1, A_2=1, A_3=2, A_5=5$.\nThe Fibonacci sequence is $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\nSo $A_n = F_{n+1}$ is not true for $n=2$.\n$A_1 = F_2 = 1$.\n$A_2 = F_3 = 2$. My $A_2=1$. This is the discrepancy.\nFor $n=2$, my valid set is $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. This covers $[1,1]$ and $[2,2]$.\nThis is 1 way.\n$F_3=2$. What is the other way $F_3$ counts?\n$F_k$ counts ways to tile a $1 \\times (k-1)$ strip with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ blocks.\n$F_3$ counts ways to tile $1 \\times 2$ strip.\n1. $1 \\times 1, 1 \\times 1$. Corresponds to $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\n2. $1 \\times 2$. Corresponds to $S=\\{ \\}$. This is not allowed.\n\nThe problem is that $A_n$ is not $F_{n+1}$.\nThe recurrence $A_n = A_{n-1} + A_{n-3}$ is for a different problem variant.\nThe sequence $A_n$ is $1,1,1,2,3,5$.\n$A_0=1$\n$A_1=1$\n$A_2=1$\n$A_3=2$\n$A_4=3$\n$A_5=5$\nThis is $A_n = F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$ if $F_1=1, F_2=1$.\n$A_0 = F_1 = 1$.\n$A_1 = F_2 = 1$.\n$A_2 = F_3 = 2$. But I calculated $A_2=1$.\nThis is the core issue.\nLet's re-verify $A_2=1$.\n$n=2$.\nConditions:\n1. $1 \\le t_1 < \\dots < t_m \\le 2$.\n2. $n \\pmod 2 = m \\pmod 2 \\implies 2 \\pmod 2 = m \\pmod 2 \\implies m$ is even.\n3. Eq $E_m$: $n=2 \\sum (-1)^{m-j} t_j$.\n4. $p_k \\ge 1$.\n\nPossible $m$: $0, 2$.\n$m=0$: $S=\\{\\}$. $n=2, m=0$. Even, even. Eq: $2 = 2 \\sum (\\dots) = 0$. False. Not valid.\n$m=2$: $S=\\{t_1, t_2\\}$. $n=2, m=2$. Even, even. Eq: $2 = 2(t_2-t_1) \\implies t_2-t_1=1$.\n  Possible $(t_1, t_2)$: $(1,2)$.\n  $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n  Check $p_1 \\ge 1$, $p_2 \\ge 1$. OK.\n  This is 1 valid set. So $A_2=1$.\n\nThe sequence for $A_n$ is:\n$A_0=1$\n$A_1=1$\n$A_2=1$\n$A_3=2$\n$A_4=3$\n$A_5=5$\nThis is $A_n = F_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 2$, where $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5$.\nNo, $A_2=1=F_2$. $A_3=2=F_3$. $A_4=3=F_4$. $A_5=5=F_5$.\nSo for $n \\ge 2$, $A_n = F_n$.\nAnd $A_0=1, A_1=1$.\nThis means $A_n = F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$, with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1$.\n$A_1=F_1=1$.\n$A_2=F_2=1$.\n$A_3=F_3=2$.\n$A_4=F_4=3$.\n$A_5=F_5=5$.\nThis sequence $A_n$ is $F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nWhat about $A_0$? $F_0=0$. But $A_0=1$.\nThe problem asks for $n \\ge 1$. So $A_n=F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe probability is $F_n \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's re-check example $n=1$: $A_1=F_1=1$. Prob $1/2^1=1/2$. Correct.\nLet's re-check example $n=2$: $A_2=F_2=1$. Prob $1/2^2=1/4$. Correct.\nLet's re-check example $n=3$: $A_3=F_3=2$. Prob $2/2^3=1/4$. Correct.\nLet's re-check example $n=5$: $A_5=F_5=5$. Prob $5/2^5=5/32$. Correct.\n\nThis is the correct sequence. The number of ways is $F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nWe need to calculate $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nMatrix exponentiation for $F_n$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_n & F_{n-1} \\\\ F_{n-1} & F_{n-2} \\end{pmatrix}$ for $n \\ge 2$.\nSo $F_n$ is the top-left element of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_1=1$.
