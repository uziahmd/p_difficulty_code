You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Replacing Digits.\" The goal is clear: maximize this number 'a' by strategically substituting its digits with digits from string 's'. Let's break down my thinking on how to tackle this efficiently.\n\nFirst off, maximizing a number boils down to making the *most significant* digits as large as possible.  That's my primary guiding principle. I'm dealing with strings, so comparing based on position from left to right is how I'll judge the magnitude.\n\nMy strategy needs to be focused and optimal.  I'm thinking of sorting 's' in *descending* order. That way, I'm always grabbing the biggest replacement digit available.  It makes my decision-making process much cleaner.\n\nThen, I'll iterate through 'a', digit by digit, from left to right.  For each position in 'a', I'll compare its current digit with the largest available digit from the sorted 's'.  If the 's' digit is *larger*, boom, swap it in! It's a no-brainer improvement.\n\nIf the 's' digit is *not* larger (less than or equal to), there's a crucial decision. Since I want to maximize, I *keep* the current 'a' digit, no replacement. This is the key. I can't guarantee any later digits in 's' will ever improve 'a' at that location. And since the current digit from 's' wasn't useful, it's not going to be useful for any later position either, so I can just move on and look at the *next* digit of 'a'. And since I want to maximize, there's no way to improve the current position with what I've got left.\n\nSo, in essence, I'm trying to make the *best* improvement at each step, ensuring the resultant number is maximized.  It's all about strategic replacements and leveraging the largest possible digits in the most significant positions. I think this will be a good starting point for coding a Python solution.\n",
