Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing a Tricky String Replacement Problem**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. I've got an initial string `s` full of digits, and a bunch of replacement queries to run on it. The goal is to figure out the final numerical value of `s` after all the replacements, modulo 1000000007. Seems straightforward, right? But the constraints are tight: string lengths and number of queries are up to 10^5, and the sum of the replacement strings lengths is also up to 10^5. A direct approach of repeatedly replacing and reconstructing the string is going to be far too slow, since the string's length can explode exponentially.\n\nSo, I need to come up with a clever way to calculate the final number without actually building the entire string at each step. Thinking about it, the final number is just a sum of digits multiplied by powers of 10, all modulo MOD. This can be expressed as `sum(digit * 10^power) % MOD`.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in efficiently tracking how each digit in the initial string contributes to the final result after the replacements. A single replacement `di -> ti` is key. When `di` gets replaced by `ti`, that `di` digit essentially expands into `ti`, shifting all the digits to its right. We're interested in keeping track of how the \"value\" of `di` changes as it turns into `ti`. That \"value\" is a linear combination of its digits, weighted by powers of 10.\n\nIt's about observing that the problem is not about the final string itself, but about the *final value* calculated from it, which means that instead of focusing on string manipulations, I need to figure out how to track the contribution of each initial digit to the final value, step by step, for all the queries. The goal is to derive the final weighted sum from the initial state, while not explicitly building the string. I need to get started on the algorithm!\n",
