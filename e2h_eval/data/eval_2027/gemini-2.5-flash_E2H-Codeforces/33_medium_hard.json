You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Refined Greedy Approach for Replacing Digits**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: I'm given a number 'a' and a set of digits 's', and I need to replace some digits in 'a' with digits from 's' to maximize the resulting number. The key is to make the *leftmost* digits as large as possible.\n\nI've realized the best strategy is a greedy one:\n\n1.  **Prioritize the Left:** Scan 'a' from left to right (most significant digit to least).\n2.  **Find the Best Fit:** For each digit in 'a', find the *largest* digit in 's' that's greater than the current digit in 'a'.\n3.  **Use it or Lose it:** If I find a larger digit, *replace* the current digit in 'a' with it and move to the next digit in 's'. *Crucially, if I can't improve the current digit with the current largest digit in 's', I leave the current digit in 'a' alone*.  This largest digit remains available for the next position.\n4.  **No Looking Back:** Once I replace a digit in 'a' with a digit from 's', I don't go back and try to \"optimize\" previously replaced digits. That would be inefficient and lead me down the wrong path.  The greedy approach handles the maximization at each step, making the highest value possible at each digit in 'a'.\n\nI'll convert 'a' and 's' to lists of characters for easy manipulation.  's' *must* be sorted in descending order to make it easy to find that largest available digit. I use a pointer (`s_ptr`) to track the current digit in 's'.  I iterate through 'a', and at each position, I check if the largest available digit from 's' (pointed to by `s_ptr`) is greater than the corresponding digit in 'a'. If it is, I make the replacement and increment `s_ptr`. Otherwise, the current digit in 'a' stays as it is, and the pointer `s_ptr` doesn't advance, so the next iteration will check if the next digit in 'a' *can* use that same, previously unavailable, largest digit from s.\n\n**Why this works:** The greedy choice is locally optimal at each step. By always picking the largest available digit from 's' that can increase the current digit in 'a', I guarantee the best possible result at that specific position.  Since the goal is to *maximize* the overall number, making leftmost digits large has the greatest impact. If no digit in `s` is bigger than the digit in `a` at the current position, then we *can't* change the value to something bigger using our allowed `s` characters.  Therefore, advancing the pointer is correct, and not consuming the character.\n\nI need to make sure I handle the edge cases, especially when 's' is shorter than 'a' or contains only smaller digits. I think my logic, and my testing, handles that.\n\nAnd that’s it. That’s my refined thinking and algorithm. I'm now ready to write the code.\n",
