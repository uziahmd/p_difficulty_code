    "thought": "**Minimizing LCM with a Python Script**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to tackle a competitive programming challenge. The objective is to find a non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`. If there are multiple `k` values yielding the same minimum LCM, I must select the smallest one.\n\nLet's represent `a+k` as `x` and `b+k` as `y`. We need to minimize `lcm(x, y)`. I know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor. Also, the difference between `x` and `y` is `y - x = b - a`.\n\nA key insight here is that the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, or `gcd(a+k, b+k)`, must be a divisor of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, which I'll call `diff`. If `a` equals `b`, the answer is obviously `k=0` because then `lcm(a,a)` becomes `a`, and any other value of `k` will increase the LCM.  Otherwise, if `a` and `b` are different, `diff` is greater than zero.\n\nSince the greatest common divisor must divide `diff`, I'll iterate through all divisors, `g`, of `diff`. For each divisor `g`, I need to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `g` divides `a+k`. That means that `k` has to be equivalent to `-a` modulo `g`, or `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`. Let's denote this `k` as `k_g`. With this, both `a+k_g` and `b+k_g` are guaranteed to be multiples of `g`.\n\nThen, for each divisor `g` of `diff`, I'll compute `k_g = (g - (a % g)) % g`, and then `current_lcm = (a + k_g) * (b + k_g) / gcd(a + k_g, b + k_g)`.  I'll keep track of the smallest `current_lcm` encountered so far and its corresponding `k`. Since the `gcd` calculation is correct, I can use the standard `math.gcd` function in Python.  The initial `best_k` should start at `0` if `a==b`.  Finally, I return the smallest `k` that gives me the minimum LCM.\n\nNow I need to find the divisors of `diff`.  I can iterate up to the square root of `diff`. For each number `i` that divides `diff`, I'll add both `i` and `diff/i` to the divisor list.\n\nThe time complexity will be dominated by finding the divisors, which is `O(sqrt(diff))` and then `O(D * log(max(a,b))` where D is the number of divisors (which is bounded). This shouldn't be a problem, given the constraints of the problem. Also, Python's integers handle arbitrarily large values, so there's no concern about integer overflow. This all seems solid. Now, I'll put this into code, and I believe it's going to work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we must choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\nAlso, `gcd(x, y)` must divide their difference `y - x`.\n`y - x = (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`.\nLet `diff = abs(b - a)`. Therefore, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `diff`.\n\nThis critical observation means we only need to consider `k` values that lead to `gcd(a+k, b+k)` being one of the divisors of `diff`.\nSpecifically, for each divisor `g` of `diff`, we can find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `g` divides `a+k`. If `g` divides `a+k`, then `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`, which means `k \\equiv -a \\pmod g`. The smallest non-negative `k` satisfying this is `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\nFor this `k`, `a+k` is a multiple of `g`. Since `b-a` is also a multiple of `g` (because `g` divides `diff`), it follows that `b+k = (a+k) + (b-a)` is also a multiple of `g`. Thus, `g` is a common divisor of `a+k` and `b+k`.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Handle the `a == b` case:** If `a` equals `b`, then `a+k` equals `b+k`. `lcm(a+k, b+k) = a+k`. To minimize this, we choose the smallest non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`. So, `lcm(a, a) = a`. Print `0` and exit.\n\n2.  **Calculate `diff`:** If `a != b`, calculate `diff = abs(b - a)`.\n\n3.  **Find all divisors of `diff`:** Iterate `i` from 1 up to `sqrt(diff)`. If `i` divides `diff`, then both `i` and `diff // i` are divisors. Store these divisors in a list.\n\n4.  **Initialize `min_lcm` and `best_k`:**\n    *   Set `min_lcm` to a very large value (e.g., `float('inf')`).\n    *   Set `best_k` to `0`. (The case `g=1` will always yield `k=0` and calculate `lcm(a,b)`, which provides an initial baseline.)\n\n5.  **Iterate through each divisor `g` of `diff`:**\n    *   **Calculate `k_g`:** Find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`. This is `k_g = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n    *   **Calculate `current_a` and `current_b`:** Set `current_a = a + k_g` and `current_b = b + k_g`.\n    *   **Calculate `current_lcm`:** Compute `lcm(current_a, current_b)` using the formula `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)`. Python's `math.gcd` function can be used.\n    *   **Update `min_lcm` and `best_k`:**\n        *   If `current_lcm < min_lcm`, update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `best_k = k_g`.\n        *   If `current_lcm == min_lcm`, update `best_k = min(best_k, k_g)` to ensure we pick the smallest `k` in case of ties.\n\n6.  **Print `best_k`:** After checking all divisors, `best_k` will hold the smallest `k` that minimizes the LCM.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (a=6, b=10):**\n1.  `a != b`.\n2.  `diff = abs(10 - 6) = 4`.\n3.  Divisors of 4: `1, 2, 4`.\n4.  `min_lcm = inf`, `best_k = 0`.\n5.  **For `g = 1`:**\n    *   `k_1 = (1 - (6 % 1)) % 1 = 0`.\n    *   `current_a = 6 + 0 = 6`, `current_b = 10 + 0 = 10`.\n    *   `gcd(6, 10) = 2`. `current_lcm = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n    *   `min_lcm = 30`, `best_k = 0`.\n6.  **For `g = 2`:**\n    *   `k_2 = (2 - (6 % 2)) % 2 = 0`.\n    *   `current_a = 6 + 0 = 6`, `current_b = 10 + 0 = 10`.\n    *   `gcd(6, 10) = 2`. `current_lcm = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n    *   `current_lcm == min_lcm`, so `best_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n7.  **For `g = 4`:**\n    *   `k_4 = (4 - (6 % 4)) % 4 = (4 - 2) % 4 = 2`.\n    *   `current_a = 6 + 2 = 8`, `current_b = 10 + 2 = 12`.\n    *   `gcd(8, 12) = 4`. `current_lcm = (8 * 12) // 4 = 24`.\n    *   `current_lcm < min_lcm`, so `min_lcm = 24`, `best_k = 2`.\n8.  Print `best_k` which is `2`.\n\nThis approach is efficient because the number of divisors for `diff` (up to `10^9`) is relatively small (at most 1344 for numbers less than `10^9`), and finding divisors takes `O(sqrt(diff))` time. Each LCM calculation involves `gcd`, which takes logarithmic time.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    diff = abs(b - a)\n\n    # Find all divisors of diff\n    divs = []\n    # Iterate up to sqrt(diff) to find divisors\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):\n        if diff % i == 0:\n            divs.append(i)\n            # If i*i != diff, then diff // i is a distinct divisor\n            if i * i != diff:\n                divs.append(diff // i)\n    \n    # Initialize min_lcm to a very large value and best_k\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0 # k=0 is always a candidate (e.g., when g=1), so initialize best_k to 0\n\n    for g in divs:\n        # k_g is the smallest non-negative k such that a+k is a multiple of g\n        # k = (g - (a % g)) % g\n        # This formula handles both cases: a % g == 0 (k_g = 0) and a % g != 0 (k_g = g - (a % g))\n        k_g = (g - (a % g)) % g\n        \n        current_a = a + k_g\n        current_b = b + k_g\n        \n        # Calculate lcm(current_a, current_b)\n        # lcm(x, y) = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(current_a, current_b)\n        # Use integer division for lcm to ensure correctness and avoid float issues\n        current_lcm = (current_a * current_b) // current_gcd\n        \n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_g\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            # If multiple k values give the same min_lcm, choose the smallest k\n            best_k = min(best_k, k_g)\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
