Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Refining the Algorithm for Optimal Angle Selection**\n\nMy primary goal is to write a Python script that efficiently finds three vertices within a regular n-gon (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`) whose angle (`v1-v2-v3`) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. I've already established the geometric principles: the angle is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the subtended arc, and the arc size determines the angle's magnitude.\n\nThe critical step lies in numbering the vertices and representing the subtended arc. After some experimentation, I'm settling on fixing `v2` as vertex 2. This means `v1` and `v3` will be selected from the remaining vertices. Let's re-index such that `v2` is always `2`, and the arc subtended by the angle `v1-2-v3` contains all vertices EXCEPT `2`.\n\nMy key insight is that the angle is directly proportional to the number of segments on the arc between `v1` and `v3` that *don't* include `2`. Thus, I'm focusing on calculating this number.  Each segment represents an arc of 360/n degrees. An inscribed angle subtending an arc spanning `k` such segments will have a measure of `k * (180/n)` degrees. I can create a series of possible angles by varying `k` from 1 to `n-2`.\n\nHere's my refined algorithm, focusing on optimization:\n\n1.  **Calculate the base angle:** `base_angle = 180.0 / n`.\n2.  **Calculate target `m_float`:** `m_float = a * n / 180.0`. `m_float` represents the ideal number of segments for the arc.\n3.  **Find integer candidates for `m`:**  I need integer values (the number of segments). Instead of brute-forcing, I'll calculate `m_float`, then consider:\n    *   `m1 = int(m_float)` (the floor of `m_float`)\n    *   `m2 = m1 + 1` (the ceiling)\n4.  **Create Candidate list and bound:** Construct a list named candidates\n    *   Initialize it with `1` and `n-2`, because all values of *m* range from `1` to `n-2`.\n    *   If `m1` is within the valid range (`1 <= m1 <= n-2`), add it to candidates.\n    *   If `m2` is within the valid range (`1 <= m2 <= n-2`), add it.\n    *   Remove duplicate values by sorting and using `set` on the list.\n5.  **Iterate and minimize:**\n    *   Loop through the candidates.\n    *   Calculate the current angle: `current_angle = m * base_angle`.\n    *   Calculate the difference: `current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    *   Find the `m` that minimizes `abs(m * base_angle - a)`. If the current difference is strictly less than the minimal difference, it's a new best.\n\nThis optimization significantly reduces the computational complexity to O(1), making it very efficient even for large values of `n`. It now accurately produces the three desired vertices.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices of the polygon, with its vertex on the circumcircle (an inscribed angle), has a measure that depends on the arc it subtends. Specifically, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.\n\nIn a regular `n`-gon, the `n` vertices divide the circumcircle into `n` equal arcs. Each such elementary arc corresponds to a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nAn inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends an arc `v1-v3` that does not contain `v2`. If this arc `v1-v3` spans `k` elementary arcs (i.e., `k` sides of the polygon), then the central angle for this arc is `k * (360/n)` degrees. The inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` will then be `(k * (360/n)) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\nThe number of elementary arcs `k` must be at least 1 (for `v1` and `v3` to be distinct from each other and `v2`).\nThe maximum value for `k` is `n-2`. This occurs when `v1` and `v3` are the \"furthest\" possible vertices from `v2` along the perimeter, without `v2` being on the subtended arc. For example, if `v2` is vertex 2, `v1` is vertex 1, and `v3` is vertex `n`. The arc from `1` to `n` (not containing `2`) consists of `n-2` segments. The angle `1-2-n` would be `(n-2) * (180/n)` degrees. This is the interior angle of a regular `n`-gon.\n\nSo, the possible angles that can be formed are `m * (180/n)` for `m` ranging from `1` to `n-2`.\nLet `base_angle = 180.0 / n`. We need to find an integer `m` in the range `[1, n-2]` such that `|m * base_angle - a|` is minimized.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding `m` in the range `[1, n-2]` that is closest to `m_float = a / base_angle = a * n / 180.0`.\n\nTo find the optimal `m` efficiently:\n1. Calculate `m_float = a * n / 180.0`.\n2. The integer `m` values closest to `m_float` are typically `floor(m_float)` and `ceil(m_float)`.\n3. We must also ensure `m` is within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n   So, we consider the following candidate `m` values:\n   - `1` (the smallest possible `m`)\n   - `n-2` (the largest possible `m`)\n   - `int(m_float)` (if it's within `[1, n-2]`)\n   - `int(m_float) + 1` (if it's within `[1, n-2]`)\n   We collect these candidates, remove duplicates, and then compare their absolute differences to `a`.\n\nLet's outline the algorithm:\n1. Read `n` and `a`.\n2. Calculate `base_angle = 180.0 / n`.\n3. Calculate `m_float = a * n / 180.0`.\n4. Initialize `best_m = -1` and `min_abs_diff = float('inf')`.\n5. Create a list of candidate `m` values:\n   `candidates = []`\n   `candidates.append(1)`\n   `candidates.append(n-2)`\n   `m_floor = int(m_float)`\n   `m_ceil = m_floor + 1`\n   If `m_floor >= 1` and `m_floor <= n-2`, add `m_floor` to `candidates`.\n   If `m_ceil >= 1` and `m_ceil <= n-2`, add `m_ceil` to `candidates`.\n6. Remove duplicates from `candidates` and sort them (optional, but ensures consistent behavior for ties).\n7. Iterate through each `m` in `candidates`:\n   a. Calculate `current_angle = m * base_angle`.\n   b. Calculate `current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n   c. If `current_diff < min_abs_diff`:\n      i. Update `min_abs_diff = current_diff`.\n      ii. Update `best_m = m`.\n8. Once `best_m` is found, we need to output three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3`. A simple way to do this is:\n   - Fix `v2 = 2`.\n   - Fix `v1 = 1`.\n   - Then `v3` must be `2 + best_m`.\n   This choice ensures `v1, v2, v3` are distinct: `v1=1`, `v2=2`. Since `best_m >= 1`, `v3 = 2 + best_m >= 3`. Also, since `best_m <= n-2`, `v3 = 2 + best_m <= 2 + (n-2) = n`. So `v3` is always in the range `[3, n]`.\n\nExample walkthrough: `n=4, a=67`\n1. `n=4, a=67`.\n2. `base_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n3. `m_float = 67 * 4 / 180.0 = 268 / 180.0 = 1.488...`.\n4. `best_m = -1`, `min_abs_diff = inf`.\n5. Candidates:\n   - `candidates.append(1)`\n   - `candidates.append(n-2) = candidates.append(2)`\n   - `m_floor = int(1.488...) = 1`. `1` is in `[1, 2]`. `candidates.append(1)`.\n   - `m_ceil = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2` is in `[1, 2]`. `candidates.append(2)`.\n   So, `candidates = [1, 2, 1, 2]`.\n6. `candidates = sorted(list(set([1, 2, 1, 2]))) = [1, 2]`.\n7. Iterate:\n   - For `m=1`:\n     `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n     `current_diff = abs(45.0 - 67) = 22.0`.\n     `22.0 < inf`, so `min_abs_diff = 22.0`, `best_m = 1`.\n   - For `m=2`:\n     `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n     `current_diff = abs(90.0 - 67) = 23.0`.\n     `23.0` is not `< 22.0`. No update.\n8. `best_m = 1`.\n   Output `1 2 (2 + 1)` which is `1 2 3`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    base_angle = 180.0 / n\n\n    m_float = a * n / 180.0\n\n    best_m = -1\n    min_abs_diff = float('inf')\n\n    # Collect candidate m values\n    candidates = set()\n    \n    # Always consider m=1 and m=n-2\n    candidates.add(1)\n    if n - 2 >= 1: # Ensure n-2 is a valid m (i.e., for n=3, n-2=1, no need to add again)\n        candidates.add(n - 2)\n\n    # Consider m values around m_float\n    m_floor = int(m_float)\n    m_ceil = m_floor + 1\n\n    if m_floor >= 1 and m_floor <= n - 2:\n        candidates.add(m_floor)\n    if m_ceil >= 1 and m_ceil <= n - 2:\n        candidates.add(m_ceil)\n    \n    # Iterate through candidates to find the best_m\n    # Sorting ensures deterministic behavior if multiple m values yield the same min_abs_diff,\n    # though problem states any is fine.\n    sorted_candidates = sorted(list(candidates))\n\n    for m in sorted_candidates:\n        current_angle = m * base_angle\n        current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n\n        if current_diff < min_abs_diff:\n            min_abs_diff = current_diff\n            best_m = m\n        # If current_diff is equal to min_abs_diff, we keep the existing best_m (which would be\n        # the one with smaller m if sorted_candidates is used).
