He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Prefix-Suffix Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem. It's essentially a string reconstruction challenge with a twist. I've got a target string `s` of length `n`, but I don't get it directly. Instead, I'm given `2n-2` strings. These are a mix of *all* the proper prefixes and *all* the proper suffixes of `s`. My task is to figure out which is which and represent it with a \"P\" for prefix or \"S\" for suffix.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n*   **Understanding the Inputs:** I'm given `n` and a list of strings. I know that for each length `k` (from 1 to `n-1`), I'll have exactly *two* strings. One must be a prefix of length `k`, and the other a suffix of length `k`. This is key.\n\n*   **Reconstructing `s` is the Crux:** My primary goal is to determine the original string `s`. If I can do that, I can easily label each input string. There are different ways to see this string. I know that `P_{n-1}` and `S_1` reconstruct the string. `s = P_{n-1} + S_1`\n    \n    *   I need to be smart about this because the longer string will provide most of the string.\n    *   This also applies for `P_1` and `S_{n-1}`, and the reconstructions need to be the same, so there is some redundancy, making this solution robust.\n\n*   **Focusing on Strings of Length `n-1`:** The strings of length `n-1` are going to be critical because the last suffix and first prefix can be recombined to reconstruct the target string. Let's call them `str1` and `str2`. My goal is to work through all combinations of what these two string are.\n    *   If `str1` is the full prefix (`P_{n-1}`) and `str2` is the full suffix (`S_{n-1}`), I can reconstruct `s`. There might be two ways to do this, both which would produce the same target string:\n        *   `s = str1 + str2[-1]` (the last char from the second string)\n        *   `s = str2[0] + str1` (the first char from the second string)\n\n    *   Now if I can identify the full string by comparing the potential string to the set of the available strings, then I know that I have the \"right\" combination.\n\n*   **Output Strategy:** Finally, after identifying prefixes and suffixes, the output will simply indicate the nature of the available strings.\n\nThe important thing is that the reconstructed string must be consistent.  This is a combinatorial puzzle where I have to find a string that matches all the substrings. I can solve this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify `2n-2` given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that for each length `k` from 1 to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings of length `k` among the input. One of these must be the `k`-length prefix and the other the `k`-length suffix of `s`. We need to find *any* valid assignment.\n\nThe core idea is to reconstruct the original string `s`.\nThe prefix of length `n-1` is `s[0...n-2]`.\nThe suffix of length `n-1` is `s[1...n-1]`.\n\nThere are two strings of length `n-1` among the input. Let's call them `L1` and `L2`.\nThere are two possibilities for how `L1` and `L2` relate to `s`:\n\n**Possibility 1:** `L1` is the prefix of length `n-1`, and `L2` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\nIn this case, `s` can be formed by taking `L1` and appending the last character of `L2`. So, `s = L1 + L2[-1]`.\nFor this to be consistent, `L1` must be `s` without its last character, and `L2` must be `s` without its first character. This implies `L1[1:]` must be equal to `L2[:-1]`. If this condition holds, then `s = L1 + L2[-1]` is a candidate string.\n\n**Possibility 2:** `L2` is the prefix of length `n-1`, and `L1` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\nSimilarly, `s` can be formed by taking `L2` and appending the last character of `L1`. So, `s = L2 + L1[-1]`.\nFor this to be consistent, `L2[1:]` must be equal to `L1[:-1]`. If this condition holds, then `s = L2 + L1[-1]` is another candidate string.\n\nIt's guaranteed that at least one such string `s` exists. We can pick either one that satisfies its respective consistency check.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Store all `2n-2` input strings along with their original indices. A list of tuples `(string, original_index)` or a list of custom objects could work.\n3.  Identify the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `str_n_minus_1_a` and `str_n_minus_1_b`.\n4.  **Attempt 1:** Assume `str_n_minus_1_a` is `P_{n-1}` and `str_n_minus_1_b` is `S_{n-1}`.\n    *   Check if `str_n_minus_1_a[1:] == str_n_minus_1_b[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, reconstruct `s = str_n_minus_1_a + str_n_minus_1_b[-1]`.\n    *   Verify this `s`:\n        *   Generate all prefixes of `s` (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n        *   Generate all suffixes of `s` (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n        *   Count occurrences of each generated prefix/suffix in the input list. Each must appear exactly once.\n        *   If all checks pass, we found a valid `s`. Proceed to construct the 'P'/'S' output string.\n5.  **Attempt 2:** If Attempt 1 failed, assume `str_n_minus_1_b` is `P_{n-1}` and `str_n_minus_1_a` is `S_{n-1}`.\n    *   Check if `str_n_minus_1_b[1:] == str_n_minus_1_a[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, reconstruct `s = str_n_minus_1_b + str_n_minus_1_a[-1]`.\n    *   Verify this `s` using the same method as in Attempt 1. This attempt is guaranteed to succeed.\n6.  Once a valid `s` is found:\n    *   Initialize an answer array `ans` of size `2n-2` with empty strings.\n    *   Create a set of prefixes `P_set` from the chosen `s`.\n    *   Iterate through the original input strings (with their indices):\n        *   If the current string is in `P_set`, assign 'P' to `ans[original_index]` and remove it from `P_set` (to handle duplicates correctly, as each prefix/suffix appears exactly once for a given length).\n        *   Else, assign 'S' to `ans[original_index]`.\n    *   Print the joined `ans` array.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings (with original indices):\n`['ba', 0]`, `['a', 1]`, `['abab', 2]`, `['a', 3]`, `['aba', 4]`, `['baba', 5]`, `['ab', 6]`, `['aba', 7]`\n\nStrings of length `n-1 = 4`: `['abab', 2]` and `['baba', 5]`. Let `L1 = 'abab'` and `L2 = 'baba'`.\n\n**Attempt 1:** Assume `L1` is `P_4` and `L2` is `S_4`.\nCheck `L1[1:] == L2[:-1]`: `'bab' == 'bab'`. This is true!\nCandidate `s = L1 + L2[-1] = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'`.\n\nNow verify `s = 'ababa'`:\nPrefixes: `a`, `ab`, `aba`, `abab`\nSuffixes: `a`, `ba`, `aba`, `baba`\n\nLet's check against input strings:\nInput: `ba`, `a`, `abab`, `a`, `aba`, `baba`, `ab`, `aba`\nPrefixes needed: `a`, `ab`, `aba`, `abab`\nSuffixes needed: `a`, `ba`, `aba`, `baba`\n\nWe can use a `collections.Counter` for efficient tracking.\n`input_counter = Counter(['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'])`\n\n`P_set = {'a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab'}`\n`S_set = {'a', 'ba', 'aba', 'baba'}`\n\n`ans = [''] * 8`\n`temp_P_set = set(P_set)` # Use a temporary set to mark 'P's\n\n1.  `['ba', 0]`: Not in `temp_P_set`. So `ans[0] = 'S'`.\n2.  `['a', 1]`: In `temp_P_set`. So `ans[1] = 'P'`. Remove 'a' from `temp_P_set`. `temp_P_set = {'ab', 'aba', 'abab'}`.\n3.  `['abab', 2]`: In `temp_P_set`. So `ans[2] = 'P'`. Remove 'abab' from `temp_P_set`. `temp_P_set = {'ab', 'aba'}`.\n4.  `['a', 3]`: Not in `temp_P_set`. So `ans[3] = 'S'`.\n5.  `['aba', 4]`: In `temp_P_set`. So `ans[4] = 'P'`. Remove 'aba' from `temp_P_set`. `temp_P_set = {'ab'}`.\n6.  `['baba', 5]`: Not in `temp_P_set`. So `ans[5] = 'S'`.\n7.  `['ab', 6]`: In `temp_P_set`. So `ans[6] = 'P'`. Remove 'ab' from `temp_P_set`. `temp_P_set = {}`.\n8.  `['aba', 7]`: Not in `temp_P_set`. So `ans[7] = 'S'`.\n\nResult: `['S', 'P', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S', 'P', 'S']` which is `SPPSPSPS`.
