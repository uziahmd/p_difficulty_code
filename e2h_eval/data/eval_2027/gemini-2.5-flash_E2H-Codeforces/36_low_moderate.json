The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Radio Tower Probability Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to figure out the probability of a valid radio tower configuration. The goal is to determine the likelihood of a setup where all towns between 1 and *n* receive a signal from *exactly* one tower, and towns 0 and *n+1* get no signal at all. This probability needs to be modulo 998244353, which is typical for competitive programming.\n\nThe setup is straightforward: towns are located at coordinates 0 through *n+1*. We randomly select towns 1 to *n* to potentially house a tower, each with a 50% chance. If a town gets a tower, we then determine the tower's power, which dictates its coverage range. A tower at town *i* with power *p* can cover other towns, specifically those within a distance of *p*, so *i - p < c < i + p*.\n\nLet's dissect the constraints to guarantee a valid configuration:\n\nFirst, towers need to respect the boundary conditions, namely towns 0 and *n+1* not receiving any signal. This implies that for a tower at *i* with power *p_i*, the power has to be less than or equal to both *i* and *n+1 - i*. This gives me a maximum power for each tower, specifically min(*i*, *n+1 - i*). That's a good starting point.\n\nSecond, the towns between 1 and *n* need to be covered by exactly one tower each. This constraint implies that for each town *j* in the set from 1 to *n*, there exists exactly one tower at some town *i*, and *j* falls within the coverage range of that tower, but no other. The coverage range is *i - p_i + 1* to *i + p_i - 1*. Since a tower with maximum power will stay within the town range 1-*n*, this constraint ensures a valid solution.\n\nIn essence, I need to compute the probability that when randomly placing towers and assigning them powers within the constraints, we obtain a coverage pattern where each of the towns 1 through *n* gets *exactly* one signal, and the towns at the edges (0 and *n+1*) remain silent. Now I need to come up with an efficient algorithm to calculate this probability. It appears I'll likely need dynamic programming or recursion, given the combinatorics involved. The trick will be accounting for all the valid tower placements and powers while avoiding double-counting or overshooting.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a valid assignment of signal powers exists, given a random configuration of towers. There are $n+2$ towns, $0, \\dots, n+1$. Towers can be built in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nA tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c-i| < p_i$. This means $i-p_i < c < i+p_i$.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n   - For town $0$: For any $i \\in S$, we must have $|0-i| \\ge p_i$, so $i \\ge p_i$.\n   - For town $n+1$: For any $i \\in S$, we must have $|(n+1)-i| \\ge p_i$, so $n+1-i \\ge p_i$.\n   Combining these, for any tower at $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n   This implies that the range of towns covered by a tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, which is $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$, will always be strictly within $(0, n+1)$. Specifically, it covers towns $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$. These towns are always in $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n   This means that the sets of towns covered by towers must form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n   Let $C(i, p_i) = \\{c \\mid i-p_i < c < i+p_i\\}$. The condition is:\n   - $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} C(i, p_i) = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$\n   - $C(i, p_i) \\cap C(j, p_j) = \\emptyset$ for $i, j \\in S, i \\ne j$.\n\nConsider the structure of covered intervals. A tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ covers the interval $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$. For these intervals to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, they must be disjoint and their union must cover $(0, n+1)$.\nLet's denote the interval covered by tower $i$ as $I_i = (i-p_i, i+p_i)$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le i$ means $i-p_i \\ge 0$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le n+1-i$ means $i+p_i \\le n+1$.\nSo, all intervals $I_i$ are subsets of $(0, n+1)$.\nFor $\\{I_i \\mid i \\in S\\}$ to partition $(0, n+1)$, they must look like this:\n$(0, x_1), (x_1, x_2), \\dots, (x_k, n+1)$.\nEach $I_i$ is centered at $i$. So $I_i = (i-p_i, i+p_i)$.\nThis implies that $i-p_i$ and $i+p_i$ must be integers.\nIf $I_i = (L_i, R_i)$, then $i = (L_i+R_i)/2$ and $p_i = (R_i-L_i)/2$.\nFor $i$ to be an integer, $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have the same parity.\nFor $p_i$ to be an integer, $R_i-L_i$ must be an even integer. This is consistent with $L_i, R_i$ having the same parity.\n\nThe intervals must be of the form $(L, R)$ where $L, R$ are integers of the same parity.\nThe centers $i$ must be integers, and the powers $p_i$ must be integers.\nThe partition constraint means that if we list the towns in $S$ in increasing order $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, then the intervals must be $I_{i_1}, I_{i_2}, \\dots, I_{i_k}$ such that:\n$I_{i_1} = (0, 2i_1)$, so $p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n$I_{i_k} = (2i_k - (n+1), n+1)$, so $p_{i_k} = n+1-i_k$.\nFor intermediate towers $i_j$, $I_{i_j} = (L, R)$ where $L$ is the right endpoint of $I_{i_{j-1}}$ and $R$ is the left endpoint of $I_{i_{j+1}}$.\nSo $I_{i_j} = (i_{j-1}+p_{i_{j-1}}, i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}})$.\nThis implies $i_j = ( (i_{j-1}+p_{i_{j-1}}) + (i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}) )/2$ and $p_{i_j} = ( (i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}) - (i_{j-1}+p_{i_{j-1}}) )/2$.\nThis is a very specific structure.\n\nA key observation is that the length of the interval covered by a tower $i$ with power $p_i$ is $2p_i-1$ (number of towns covered).\nThe total number of towns to be covered is $n$.\nSo $\\sum_{i \\in S} (2p_i-1) = n$.\nThis implies $\\sum_{i \\in S} 2p_i - |S| = n$.\nThe sum of the lengths of the intervals $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ must be $n+1$.\n$\\sum_{i \\in S} 2p_i = n+1$.\n\nConsider the \"gaps\" between towers. If towers are built at $i$ and $j$ ($i < j$), and they are \"adjacent\" in the partition, then $i+p_i = j-p_j$.\nThis means $j-i = p_i+p_j$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le i$ means $i-p_i \\ge 0$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le n+1-i$ means $i+p_i \\le n+1$.\n\nLet's look at the example $n=5$. Towns $1,2,3,4,5$ must be covered.\nIf towers are at $2,4,5$:\n$S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n$p_2=2$: covers $(0,4)$, towns $1,2,3$. $2p_2=4$.\n$p_4=1$: covers $(3,5)$, town $4$. $2p_4=2$.\n$p_5=1$: covers $(4,6)$, town $5$. $2p_5=2$.\nSum of $2p_i = 4+2+2=8$. $n+1=6$. This doesn't match.\nThe example states \"towns $1,2,3$ get the signal from the tower in town $2$, town $4$ gets the signal from the tower in town $4$, and town $5$ gets the signal from the tower in town $5$.\"\nThis means:\n$C(2,2) = \\{1,2,3\\}$\n$C(4,1) = \\{4\\}$\n$C(5,1) = \\{5\\}$\nThese are disjoint and their union is $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\nThe values $p_i$ satisfy the constraints:\n$p_2=2 \\le \\min(2, 5+1-2=4) = 2$. Valid.\n$p_4=1 \\le \\min(4, 5+1-4=2) = 1$. Valid.\n$p_5=1 \\le \\min(5, 5+1-5=1) = 1$. Valid.\nThis is a valid configuration.\nThe sum of $2p_i-1$ is $(2 \\cdot 2 - 1) + (2 \\cdot 1 - 1) + (2 \\cdot 1 - 1) = 3+1+1=5=n$. This is correct.\n\nThe condition $i-p_i < c < i+p_i$ means that $c$ is covered by tower $i$.\nThe interval $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ is not necessarily disjoint from other $(j-p_j, j+p_j)$.\nThe problem states \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\". This is a condition on *towns*, not on the open intervals.\nLet $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$. These are the leftmost and rightmost towns covered by tower $i$.\nThe condition is that for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there is a unique $i \\in S$ such that $L_i \\le j \\le R_i$.\nThis implies that the intervals $[L_i, R_i]$ for $i \\in S$ must partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis means they must be disjoint and their union must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nIf we sort the towers $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, then we must have:\n$L_{i_1} = 1$\n$R_{i_j} + 1 = L_{i_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$\n$R_{i_k} = n$\n\nFrom $L_i=1$, we get $i_1-p_{i_1}+1=1 \\Rightarrow p_{i_1}=i_1$.\nFrom $R_i=n$, we get $i_k+p_{i_k}-1=n \\Rightarrow p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\nFrom $R_{i_j}+1 = L_{i_{j+1}}$, we get $(i_j+p_{i_j}-1)+1 = (i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1) \\Rightarrow i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\n\nLet's verify the example $n=5$, $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n$i_1=2, p_2=2$. $L_2=2-2+1=1$. Correct.\n$i_2=4, p_4=1$. $R_2=2+2-1=3$. $L_4=4-1+1=4$. $R_2+1=3+1=4=L_4$. Correct.\n$i_3=5, p_5=1$. $R_4=4+1-1=4$. $L_5=5-1+1=5$. $R_4+1=4+1=5=L_5$. Correct.\n$R_5=5+1-1=5=n$. Correct.\nAll $p_i$ satisfy $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n$p_2=2 \\le \\min(2,4)=2$.\n$p_4=1 \\le \\min(4,2)=2$. Wait, $p_4=1 \\le \\min(4,2)$, this is $1 \\le 2$. This is fine.\n$p_5=1 \\le \\min(5,1)=1$.\n\nSo the condition is: there exists a set of powers $p_i$ (satisfying $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$) such that for $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ being the towns in $S$:\n1. $p_{i_1} = i_1$\n2. $p_{i_k} = n+1-i_k$\n3. For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\n\nFrom (1), $i_1-p_{i_1}=0$. From (2), $i_k+p_{i_k}=n+1$.\nFrom (3), $i_j+p_{i_j}$ and $i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ are consecutive integers.\nLet $x_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$. Then $i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}} = x_j-1$.\nThe numbers $x_0=0, x_1=i_1+p_{i_1}, x_2=i_2+p_{i_2}, \\dots, x_k=i_k+p_{i_k}$ form an increasing sequence.\nThe conditions become:\n$i_1-p_{i_1}=0 \\Rightarrow p_{i_1}=i_1$.\n$i_k+p_{i_k}=n+1 \\Rightarrow p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\nFor $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\nAlso, for each $j$, $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n\nLet's rewrite the condition $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\nThis means $p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} - (i_j+p_{i_j}) + 1$.\nAnd $p_{i_j} = (i_{j+1}-1-p_{i_{j+1}}) - i_j$.\nThis means the powers are uniquely determined by the choice of towers.\nFor a given set $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$, the powers $p_{i_j}$ are uniquely determined by:\n$p_{i_1} = i_1$\n$p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} - (i_j+p_{i_j}) + 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nThen we must check if these $p_{i_j}$ satisfy $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n\nLet $x_0=0$. For $j=1, \\dots, k$:\n$p_{i_j} = i_j - x_{j-1}$\n$x_j = i_j+p_{i_j} = i_j + (i_j-x_{j-1}) = 2i_j-x_{j-1}$.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $x_k = n+1$. (This is $i_k+p_{i_k}=n+1$)\n2. For all $j=1, \\dots, k$: $p_{i_j} \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow i_j-x_{j-1} \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow x_{j-1} \\le i_j-1$.\n3. For all $j=1, \\dots, k$: $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n   $i_j-x_{j-1} \\le i_j \\Rightarrow -x_{j-1} \\le 0 \\Rightarrow x_{j-1} \\ge 0$. This is always true since $x_0=0$ and $x_j$ are increasing.\n   $i_j-x_{j-1} \\le n+1-i_j \\Rightarrow 2i_j-x_{j-1} \\le n+1 \\Rightarrow x_j \\le n+1$. This is $x_k=n+1$ and $x_j < n+1$ for $j<k$.\n\nSo the conditions simplify to:\n1. $x_k = n+1$.\n2. For all $j=1, \\dots, k$: $x_{j-1} \\le i_j-1$. (This ensures $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$)\n3. For all $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $x_j < n+1$.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence $x_j$. $x_0=0$. $x_j = 2i_j-x_{j-1}$.\nThis implies that $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ have the same parity as $2i_j$. So $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ must have the same parity.\nSince $x_0=0$ (even), all $x_j$ must be even.\nThis means $2i_j-x_{j-1}$ must be even, which is true if $x_{j-1}$ is even.\nSo, if $x_j$ are all even, then $i_j$ can be any integer.\nThe condition $x_k=n+1$ means $n+1$ must be even. This implies $n$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd. In this case, no such sequence $x_j$ can exist, because $x_0=0$ is even, and all $x_j$ must have the same parity. So if $n$ is even, the probability is $0$.\n\nLet's recheck the example $n=2$. $n$ is even. Probability $1/4$.\nMy deduction that $n$ must be odd is wrong.\nThe values $i-p_i$ and $i+p_i$ must have the same parity.\n$L_i = i-p_i+1$, $R_i = i+p_i-1$.\n$L_i$ and $R_i$ must have the same parity if $R_i-L_i$ is even. $R_i-L_i = (i+p_i-1)-(i-p_i+1) = 2p_i-2$. This is always even.\nSo $L_i$ and $R_i$ always have the same parity.\nThe segment $[L_i, R_i]$ has length $2p_i-1$.\nThe segments are $[1, R_1], [R_1+1, R_2], \\dots, [R_{k-1}+1, n]$.\n$R_1$ and $1$ must have the same parity. So $R_1$ must be odd. $R_1 = i_1+p_{i_1}-1$. Since $p_{i_1}=i_1$, $R_1=2i_1-1$. This is always odd.\n$R_j$ and $R_j+1$ have different parities. So $L_{j+1}=R_j+1$.\n$L_{j+1}$ and $R_{j+1}$ must have the same parity.\nSo $R_j+1$ and $R_{j+1}$ must have the same parity. This means $R_j$ and $R_{j+1}$ must have different parities.\nSo $R_1$ is odd, $R_2$ is even, $R_3$ is odd, etc.\n$R_k=n$. If $k$ is odd, $n$ must be odd. If $k$ is even, $n$ must be even.\nThis means for $n$ even, we must have an even number of towers. For $n$ odd, we must have an odd number of towers.\n\nLet's return to the definition $x_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$.\n$x_0=0$.\n$p_{i_1}=i_1 \\Rightarrow x_1=2i_1$.\n$i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1 \\Rightarrow x_j = (i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}})+1$.\n$p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} - (x_j-1)$.\n$x_{j+1} = i_{j+1} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} + i_{j+1} - (x_j-1) = 2i_{j+1} - x_j + 1$.\nThis is the correct recurrence for $x_j$.\n$x_0=0$.\n$x_1=2i_1$.\n$x_2=2i_2-x_1+1 = 2i_2-2i_1+1$.\n$x_3=2i_3-x_2+1 = 2i_3-(2i_2-2i_1+1)+1 = 2i_3-2i_2+2i_1$.\n$x_j = 2i_j - 2i_{j-1} + \\dots + (-1)^{j-1}2i_1 + (-1)^j \\cdot 0 + (-1)^{j-1} + (-1)^{j-2} + \\dots + (-1)^1 + (-1)^0$.\nThe sum of $(-1)^m$ from $m=0$ to $j-1$ is $\\sum_{m=0}^{j-1} (-1)^m$.\nIf $j$ is even, sum is $0$. If $j$ is odd, sum is $1$.\nSo $x_j = 2i_j - 2i_{j-1} + \\dots + (-1)^{j-1}2i_1 + (j \\pmod 2)$.\nWe need $x_k = n+1$.\n$2i_k - 2i_{k-1} + \\dots + (-1)^{k-1}2i_1 + (k \\pmod 2) = n+1$.\nAlso, $p_{i_j} \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow i_j - (x_{j-1}-1) \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow i_j - x_{j-1} + 1 \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow i_j \\ge x_{j-1}$.\nAnd $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n$p_{i_j} \\le i_j \\Rightarrow i_j - (x_{j-1}-1) \\le i_j \\Rightarrow -x_{j-1}+1 \\le 0 \\Rightarrow x_{j-1} \\ge 1$. This implies $x_j$ must be strictly increasing.\n$p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j \\Rightarrow i_j - (x_{j-1}-1) \\le n+1-i_j \\Rightarrow 2i_j - x_{j-1} + 1 \\le n+1 \\Rightarrow x_j \\le n+1$.\nThis implies $x_j < n+1$ for $j<k$.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n1. $x_0=0$.\n2. For $j=1, \\dots, k$: $x_j = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + 1$ (where $x_0=0$).\n3. $x_k = n+1$.\n4. For $j=1, \\dots, k$: $x_{j-1} \\le i_j-1$. (This implies $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ and $i_j \\ge 1$)\n5. For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $x_j < n+1$. (This implies $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$)\n6. $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\n\nFrom $x_j = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + 1$:\n$x_j$ and $x_{j-1}+1$ have the same parity.\n$x_0=0$.\n$x_1=2i_1+1$. (Odd)\n$x_2=2i_2-x_1+1 = 2i_2-(2i_1+1)+1 = 2i_2-2i_1$. (Even)\n$x_3=2i_3-x_2+1 = 2i_3-(2i_2-2i_1)+1 = 2i_3-2i_2+2i_1+1$. (Odd)\nIn general, $x_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nCondition $x_k=n+1$:\nIf $k$ is odd, $n+1$ must be odd, so $n$ must be even.\nIf $k$ is even, $n+1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd.\n\nThis contradicts my earlier finding about $R_j$ parities. Let's re-verify the $R_j$ parities.\n$R_1=2i_1-1$ (odd).\n$R_2=2i_2-2i_1$ (even).\n$R_3=2i_3-2i_2+2i_1-1$ (odd).\nSo $R_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, even if $j$ is even.\nSince $R_k=n$:\nIf $k$ is odd, $n$ must be odd.\nIf $k$ is even, $n$ must be even.\nThis is consistent. My $x_j$ and $R_j$ definitions are different. $x_j = R_j+1$.\n$x_j = R_j+1$.\nIf $j$ is odd, $R_j$ is odd, so $x_j$ is even.\nIf $j$ is even, $R_j$ is even, so $x_j$ is odd.\nThis is the opposite of what I derived for $x_j$ parities. Let's re-derive $x_j$ parity.\n$x_0=0$ (even).\n$x_1=2i_1$. (even)\n$x_2=2i_2-x_1+1$. $x_1$ is even, so $x_2$ is odd.\n$x_3=2i_3-x_2+1$. $x_2$ is odd, so $x_3$ is even.\nSo $x_j$ is even if $j$ is even, and odd if $j$ is odd.\nThis matches $R_j+1$ parity: $R_j$ odd means $x_j$ even. $R_j$ even means $x_j$ odd.\nSo $x_j$ is even if $j$ is odd, and odd if $j$ is even.\nCondition $x_k=n+1$:\nIf $k$ is odd, $x_k$ is even. So $n+1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd.\nIf $k$ is even, $x_k$ is odd. So $n+1$ must be odd, so $n$ must be even.\nThis is the correct parity condition for $n$ and $k$.\n\nLet's define $y_j = x_j - j$.\n$y_0=0$.\n$y_j+j = 2i_j - (y_{j-1}+j-1) + 1$.\n$y_j = 2i_j - y_{j-1} - j + (j-1) + 1 = 2i_j - y_{j-1}$.\nThis is a simpler recurrence!\n$y_0=0$.\n$y_j = 2i_j - y_{j-1}$.\nThis means all $y_j$ must be even.\nWe need $x_k=n+1 \\Rightarrow y_k+k=n+1$.\nSince $y_k$ is even, $k$ and $n+1$ must have the same parity.\nSo $k \\pmod 2 = (n+1) \\pmod 2$.\nThis means $k$ and $n$ must have different parities.\nIf $n$ is even, $k$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is odd, $k$ must be even.\nThis is the opposite of the previous conclusion.\n\nLet's re-derive $x_j$ and $y_j$ carefully.\n$x_0=0$.\n$p_{i_1}=i_1$. $x_1=i_1+p_{i_1}=2i_1$.\n$p_{i_j} = i_j - (x_{j-1}-1)$ for $j>1$.\n$x_j = i_j+p_{i_j} = i_j + (i_j - x_{j-1} + 1) = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + 1$ for $j>1$.\n$x_0=0$.\n$x_1=2i_1$.\n$x_2=2i_2-x_1+1 = 2i_2-2i_1+1$.\n$x_3=2i_3-x_2+1 = 2i_3-(2i_2-2i_1+1)+1 = 2i_3-2i_2+2i_1$.\n$x_4=2i_4-x_3+1 = 2i_4-(2i_3-2i_2+2i_1)+1 = 2i_4-2i_3+2i_2-2i_1+1$.\nIn general, $x_j = 2i_j - 2i_{j-1} + \\dots + (-1)^{j-1}2i_1 + (j \\pmod 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1)$.\nNo, actually it's $x_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} 2i_m + (j \\pmod 2 == 1 ? 0 : 1)$. This is getting messy.\n\nLet $S_k = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of towers.\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose $S_k$ such that the conditions are met.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\n2. Define $x_0=0$. For $j=1, \\dots, k$, define $x_j = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$, where $\\delta_1=0$ and $\\delta_j=1$ for $j>1$.\n3. $x_k = n+1$.\n4. For $j=1, \\dots, k$, $p_{i_j} = i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j \\ge 1$.\n   This means $i_j \\ge x_{j-1} - \\delta_j + 1$.\n5. For $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $x_j < n+1$.\n\nLet's look at the sequence $x_j$.\n$x_0=0$.\n$x_1=2i_1$.\n$x_2=2i_2-x_1+1$.\n$x_3=2i_3-x_2+1$.\n...\n$x_j=2i_j-x_{j-1}+1$ for $j \\ge 2$.\n\nConsider the values $x_j$.\n$x_0=0$ (even).\n$x_1=2i_1$ (even).\n$x_2=2i_2-x_1+1$ (odd).\n$x_3=2i_3-x_2+1$ (even).\n$x_j$ is even if $j$ is odd or $j=0$. $x_j$ is odd if $j$ is even and $j \\ge 2$.\nSo $x_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2 == 0 ? \\text{odd} : \\text{even}$ for $j \\ge 1$. $x_0$ is even.\nCondition $x_k=n+1$:\nIf $k=1$, $x_1=2i_1=n+1$. This means $n+1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd. $i_1=(n+1)/2$.\nIf $k \\ge 2$:\n  If $k$ is odd, $x_k$ is even. So $n+1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd.\n  If $k$ is even, $x_k$ is odd. So $n+1$ must be odd, so $n$ must be even.\n\nThis means if $n$ is odd, $k$ must be odd. If $n$ is even, $k$ must be even.\nThis is the same as the $R_j$ parity check.\n\nLet's check the $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ conditions.\n$p_{i_1}=i_1 \\ge 1$. Since $i_1 \\ge 1$, this holds.\nFor $j \\ge 2$: $p_{i_j}=i_j-x_{j-1}+1 \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow i_j \\ge x_{j-1}$.\nThe conditions $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ and $i_j \\ge x_{j-1}$ for $j \\ge 2$.\nAlso $x_j < n+1$ for $j < k$.\n\nLet $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be a valid set of tower locations.\n$x_0=0$.\n$x_1=2i_1$.\n$x_j=2i_j-x_{j-1}+1$ for $j \\ge 2$.\n$x_k=n+1$.\n$1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\n$i_j \\ge x_{j-1}$ for $j \\ge 2$.\n$x_j < n+1$ for $j < k$.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern for $x_j$.\n$x_0=0$.\n$x_1=2i_1$.\n$x_2=2i_2-2i_1+1$.\n$x_3=2i_3-(2i_2-2i_1+1)+1 = 2i_3-2i_2+2i_1$.\n$x_4=2i_4-(2i_3-2i_2+2i_1)+1 = 2i_4-2i_3+2i_2-2i_1+1$.\nIn general:\nIf $j$ is odd: $x_j = 2i_j - 2i_{j-1} + \\dots + 2i_2 - 2i_1$. (Sum of $j$ terms, starting with $2i_j$)\nIf $j$ is even: $x_j = 2i_j - 2i_{j-1} + \\dots - 2i_2 + 2i_1 + 1$. (Sum of $j$ terms, starting with $2i_j$)\n\nThis is equivalent to $x_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} 2i_m + (j \\pmod 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0)$.\nWe need $x_k=n+1$.\nSo $\\sum_{m=1}^k (-1)^{k-m} 2i_m + (k \\pmod 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0) = n+1$.\n\nConsider the condition $i_j \\ge x_{j-1}$.\nFor $j=2$, $i_2 \\ge x_1 = 2i_1$.\nFor $j=3$, $i_3 \\ge x_2 = 2i_2-2i_1+1$.\nFor $j=4$, $i_4 \\ge x_3 = 2i_3-2i_2+2i_1$.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem structure.\nThe problem is about counting sequences $i_1, \\dots, i_k$.\nThis looks like a dynamic programming problem.\nLet $dp[j][\\text{last_i}][\\text{parity_of_sum}]$ be the number of ways to pick $j$ towers such that the conditions are met, ending with tower $i_j=\\text{last_i}$, and sum $x_j$ has some parity.\nThe state $x_{j-1}$ is what we need to carry. But $x_{j-1}$ can be up to $n$.\nA DP state like $dp[j][\\text{last_val_of_x}]$ could work.\n$dp[j][x]$: number of ways to pick $j$ towers such that $x_j = x$.\nTo compute $dp[j][x]$: iterate over $i_j$.\n$x = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j \\Rightarrow x_{j-1} = 2i_j - x + \\delta_j$.\nSo $dp[j][x] = \\sum_{i_j} dp[j-1][2i_j-x+\\delta_j]$.\nConstraints:\n$i_j \\le n$.\n$i_j > i_{j-1}$.\n$i_j \\ge x_{j-1} - \\delta_j + 1$.\n$x_{j-1} < n+1$.\n\nThe number of towers $k$ is not fixed. It can be any value from $1$ to $n$.\nThe maximum value of $x_j$ is $n+1$. So $x$ goes from $0$ to $n+1$.\nMax $j$ is $n$.\n$dp[j][x]$ has $O(n^2)$ states. Each state takes $O(n)$ to compute. $O(n^3)$ total. $n=2 \\cdot 10^5$ is too large.\n\nThe conditions $i_j \\ge x_{j-1}$ (for $j \\ge 2$) and $i_1 \\ge 1$ (for $j=1$) are crucial.\nAlso $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\n$x_j = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$.\n$x_j - i_j = i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$.\nLet $a_j = i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$. This is $p_{i_j}$.\nThen $x_j = i_j + a_j$.\nThe conditions are:\n$a_j \\ge 1$.\n$i_j > i_{j-1}$.\n$i_j+a_j < n+1$ for $j<k$.\n$i_k+a_k = n+1$.\n\nLet's try to map this to a known combinatorial problem.\nThe sequence $(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ starts at $0$ and ends at $n+1$.\n$x_j = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$.\nThis can be written as $x_j - i_j = i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$.\nLet $s_j = i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$. This is $p_{i_j}$.\nThen $x_j = i_j + s_j$.\nWe have $s_1 = i_1$, $x_1=2i_1$.\n$s_j = i_j - (x_{j-1}-1)$ for $j \\ge 2$. $x_j=i_j+s_j$.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $s_j \\ge 1$ for all $j=1,\\dots,k$.\n2. $i_j > i_{j-1}$ for $j=2,\\dots,k$.\n3. $x_k = n+1$.\n4. $x_j < n+1$ for $j=1,\\dots,k-1$.\n5. $i_j \\le n$ for all $j$.\n\nThe $x_j$ values are positions. $x_0=0, x_k=n+1$.\n$x_j = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$.\nThis means $x_j+x_{j-1} = 2i_j+\\delta_j$.\nSo $x_j+x_{j-1}$ is even if $\\delta_j=0$ (i.e. $j=1$), and odd if $\\delta_j=1$ (i.e. $j \\ge 2$).\n$x_0=0$. $x_1$ must be even. So $x_1+x_0$ is even. $2i_1$ is even.\n$x_2+x_1$ must be odd. So $x_2$ and $x_1$ must have different parities. Since $x_1$ is even, $x_2$ must be odd.\n$x_3+x_2$ must be odd. So $x_3$ and $x_2$ must have different parities. Since $x_2$ is odd, $x_3$ must be even.\nIn general, $x_j$ is even if $j$ is odd, and odd if $j$ is even (for $j \\ge 1$).\n\nThis is the same parity condition I found earlier.\n$x_k=n+1$:\nIf $k$ is odd, $x_k$ is even. So $n+1$ must be even, $n$ must be odd.\nIf $k$ is even, $x_k$ is odd. So $n+1$ must be odd, $n$ must be even.\n\nThis means that if $n$ is even, we only consider sequences with even $k$. If $n$ is odd, we only consider sequences with odd $k$.\nThis implies that $k \\equiv (n \\pmod 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1) \\pmod 2$. No, this is $k \\equiv (n \\pmod 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1) \\pmod 2$.\n$k \\pmod 2 = (n+1) \\pmod 2$. This is correct.\n\nLet's look at the conditions $i_j \\ge x_{j-1} - \\delta_j + 1$.\n$i_1 \\ge 1$. $x_0=0, \\delta_1=0$. $i_1 \\ge 0-0+1=1$.\n$i_j \\ge x_{j-1}$ for $j \\ge 2$. ($x_{j-1} - \\delta_j + 1 = x_{j-1}-1+1 = x_{j-1}$)\n\nSo we need to count sequences $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n+1$ such that:\n1. $x_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2 == 0 ? \\text{odd} : \\text{even}$ for $j \\ge 1$. $x_0=0$ (even).\n2. For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, there exists an integer $i_j$ such that $x_j = 2i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j$.\n   This means $2i_j = x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j$. The RHS must be even.\n   For $j=1$: $x_1+x_0-\\delta_1 = x_1+0-0=x_1$. $x_1$ must be even. This is true as $x_1$ has even parity.\n   For $j \\ge 2$: $x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j = x_j+x_{j-1}-1$.\n     If $j$ is even, $x_j$ is odd, $x_{j-1}$ is even. $x_j+x_{j-1}-1$ is odd+even-1 = odd-1 = even.\n     If $j$ is odd, $x_j$ is even, $x_{j-1}$ is odd. $x_j+x_{j-1}-1$ is even+odd-1 = odd-1 = even.\n   So $x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j$ is always even. $i_j = (x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j)/2$ is an integer.\n3. $i_j \\le n$. $i_j = (x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j)/2 \\le n$.\n4. $i_j > i_{j-1}$. This is the tricky part.\n   $i_1 = x_1/2$.\n   $i_j = (x_j+x_{j-1}-1)/2$ for $j \\ge 2$.\n   $i_j > i_{j-1} \\Leftrightarrow (x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j)/2 > (x_{j-1}+x_{j-2}-\\delta_{j-1})/2$.\n   $x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j > x_{j-1}+x_{j-2}-\\delta_{j-1}$.\n   $x_j > x_{j-2} + \\delta_j - \\delta_{j-1}$.\n\nLet's simplify $x_j > x_{j-2} + \\delta_j - \\delta_{j-1}$.\nFor $j=2$: $x_2 > x_0 + \\delta_2 - \\delta_1 = 0+1-0=1$. So $x_2 > 1$.\nFor $j=3$: $x_3 > x_1 + \\delta_3 - \\delta_2 = x_1+1-1=x_1$. So $x_3 > x_1$.\nFor $j \\ge 3$: $\\delta_j=\\delta_{j-1}=1$, so $x_j > x_{j-2}$.\n\nSo the conditions on $x_j$ are:\n1. $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n+1$.\n2. Parity conditions: $x_0$ even. For $j \\ge 1$, $x_j$ is even if $j$ is odd, odd if $j$ is even.\n3. $x_k=n+1$ implies $k \\pmod 2 = (n+1) \\pmod 2$.\n4. $x_2 > 1$.\n5. $x_j > x_{j-2}$ for $j \\ge 3$.\n6. $i_j = (x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j)/2 \\le n$.\n   This implies $x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j \\le 2n$.\n   For $j=1$: $x_1 \\le 2n$.\n   For $j \\ge 2$: $x_j+x_{j-1}-1 \\le 2n$.\n\nLet's consider the sequence $x_j$.\n$x_0=0$. $x_1$ is even, $x_1 \\ge 2$. $x_1 \\le 2n$.\n$x_2$ is odd, $x_2 \\ge x_1+1$ (since $x_j$ strictly increasing). $x_2 > 1$. $x_2+x_1-1 \\le 2n$.\n$x_3$ is even, $x_3 \\ge x_2+1$. $x_3 > x_1$. $x_3+x_2-1 \\le 2n$.\n$x_j \\ge x_{j-1}+1$.\nThe condition $x_j > x_{j-2}$ for $j \\ge 3$ is automatically satisfied if $x_j \\ge x_{j-1}+1$.\nThe condition $x_2 > 1$ is automatically satisfied if $x_2 \\ge x_1+1$ and $x_1 \\ge 2$.\n\nSo the simplified conditions are:\n1. $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n+1$.\n2. Parity: $x_0$ even. For $j \\ge 1$, $x_j$ is even if $j$ is odd, odd if $j$ is even.\n3. $x_1 \\ge 2$.\n4. $x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j \\le 2n$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n   $\\delta_1=0$. So $x_1 \\le 2n$.\n   $\\delta_j=1$ for $j \\ge 2$. So $x_j+x_{j-1}-1 \\le 2n$ for $j \\ge 2$.\n\nConsider the sequence $z_j = x_j - j$.\n$z_0=0$.\n$z_1=x_1-1$.\n$z_j=x_j-j$.\n$x_j = z_j+j$.\nSubstitute into $x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j \\le 2n$:\n$(z_j+j) + (z_{j-1}+j-1) - \\delta_j \\le 2n$.\n$z_j+z_{j-1} + 2j-1-\\delta_j \\le 2n$.\nFor $j=1$: $z_1+z_0+2(1)-1-\\delta_1 \\le 2n \\Rightarrow z_1+1 \\le 2n$.\nFor $j \\ge 2$: $z_j+z_{j-1}+2j-1-1 \\le 2n \\Rightarrow z_j+z_{j-1}+2j-2 \\le 2n$.\n\nThis transformation doesn't simplify the conditions much.\n\nLet's try to count the number of such sequences $x_0, \\dots, x_k$.\nThis is related to paths on a grid.\nConsider the sequence $(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_k)$.\n$x_j$ must alternate parity (starting from $x_0$ even, $x_1$ even, $x_2$ odd, $x_3$ even, etc.)\nThe sum of $x_j+x_{j-1}-\\delta_j$ must be at most $2n$.\nIf $n$ is odd, $k$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is even, $k$ must be even.\n\nThis is a known problem structure related to paths on a grid or compositions of an integer.\nThe problem is equivalent to counting sequences of $k$ integers $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ such that $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$ and the conditions on $p_{i_j}$ are met.\nThe conditions on $p_{i_j}$ are:\n$p_{i_1}=i_1$\n$p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$\n$i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nAlso $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$. This implies $i_j \\ge x_{j-1}-\\delta_j+1$.\nAnd $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n$p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ is $i_j-(x_{j-1}-\\delta_j) \\le i_j \\Rightarrow x_{j-1}-\\delta_j \\ge 0$.\n$x_0=0$.\n$x_1=2i_1$. $x_0-\\delta_1 = 0 \\ge 0$.\n$x_2=2i_2-x_1+1$. $x_1-\\delta_2 = x_1-1 \\ge 0$. This means $x_1 \\ge 1$. Since $x_1=2i_1$, $i_1 \\ge 1$.\n$x_j=2i_j-x_{j-1}+1$. $x_{j-1}-\\delta_j = x_{j-1}-1 \\ge 0$. This means $x_{j-1} \\ge 1$.\nThis implies $x_j \\ge 1$ for all $j \\ge 1$. This is already implied by $x_j$ being strictly increasing from $x_0=0$.\n\nSo the only condition left is $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$.\n$i_j - (x_{j-1}-\\delta_j) \\le n+1-i_j$.\n$2i_j - x_{j-1} + \\delta_j \\le n+1$.\n$x_j \\le n+1$.\nThis means $x_j < n+1$ for $j < k$ and $x_k=n+1$. This is already part of our conditions.\n\nSo the problem boils down to counting sequences $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n+1$ such that:\n1. $x_0=0$ (even). For $j \\ge 1$, $x_j$ is even if $j$ is odd, odd if $j$ is even.\n2. $x_1 \\ge 2$.\n3. $k \\pmod 2 = (n+1) \\pmod 2$. (This means $k$ and $n$ have different parities).\n\nThis is a specific type of composition or path counting problem.\nLet $N_n$ be the number of such sequences for a given $n$.\nThe total number of possible tower configurations is $2^n$. We need to find $N_n \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's test small $n$.\n$n=1$. $n$ is odd. $k$ must be even. But $k \\ge 1$. Smallest even $k$ is $2$.\n$x_0=0 < x_1 < x_2=2$.\n$x_1$ must be even. $x_1 \\ge 2$.\n$x_2$ must be odd. $x_2=2$ is even.\nThis means no such sequence exists for $n=1, k=2$.\nWhat if $k=0$? No towers. Then $x_0=n+1$? No.\nThe problem states $k \\ge 1$.\nMy parity check for $x_j$ for $j \\ge 1$: $x_j$ even if $j$ odd, $x_j$ odd if $j$ even.\nFor $n=1$: $k$ must be even.\n$k=2$: $x_0=0, x_1, x_2=2$. $x_1$ must be odd. But $x_1=2i_1$ must be even. Contradiction.\nSo for $n=1$, there are 0 ways. Output for $n=1$ is $748683265$.\n$748683265 \\equiv 1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. $4^{-1} \\equiv 748683265$.\nThis means for $n=1$, the answer is $1/4$.\nMy analysis is wrong for $n=1$.\nExample $n=1$: tower in town $1$. $S=\\{1\\}$. $k=1$.\n$p_1=1$. $p_1 \\le \\min(1, 1+1-1=1)=1$. Valid.\n$x_0=0$. $x_1=2i_1=2(1)=2$. $x_k=n+1 \\Rightarrow x_1=1+1=2$. Matches.\n$k=1$ is odd. $n=1$ is odd. $k \\pmod 2 = (n+1) \\pmod 2 \\Rightarrow 1 \\pmod 2 = 0 \\pmod 2$. This is false.\n$1=0$ (false).\nSo my parity condition $k \\pmod 2 = (n+1) \\pmod 2$ is wrong.\n\nLet's re-examine the $x_j$ sequence.\n$x_0=0$.\n$x_1=2i_1$.\n$x_j=2i_j-x_{j-1}+1$ for $j \\ge 2$.\n$x_k=n+1$.\n\n$x_0$ is even.\n$x_1$ is even.\n$x_2 = 2i_2-x_1+1$. Since $x_1$ is even, $x_2$ is odd.\n$x_3 = 2i_3-x_2+1$. Since $x_2$ is odd, $x_3$ is even.\nSo $x_j$ is even for $j=0,1$ and for odd $j \\ge 3$. $x_j$ is odd for even $j \\ge 2$.\nThis is: $x_j$ is even if $j \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\cup \\{\\text{odd } j \\ge 3\\}$.\n$x_j$ is odd if $j \\in \\{\\text{even } j \\ge 2\\}$.\nThis can be rewritten: $x_j$ is even if $j \\pmod 2 = 0$ OR $j=1$. $x_j$ is odd if $j \\pmod 2 = 0$ AND $j \\ge 2$.\nNo, $x_j$ is even for $j \\pmod 2 = 0$. $x_j$ is even for $j=1$. $x_j$ is odd for $j \\pmod 2 = 0, j \\ge 2$.\nThis is $x_j$ even if $j$ is odd, OR $j$ is even and $j=0$.\n$x_j$ is odd if $j$ is even and $j \\ge 2$.\n\nThis is equivalent to: $x_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$.\n$x_0=0$ (even). $0 \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n$x_1=2i_1$ (even). $1 \\pmod 2 = 1$. This is wrong. $x_1$ is always even.\nSo $x_j$ is even for $j=0,1$.\n$x_j$ is odd for $j=2,4,6,\\dots$.\n$x_j$ is even for $j=3,5,7,\\dots$.\nSo $x_j$ is even if $j=0,1$ or $j$ is odd and $j \\ge 3$.\n$x_j$ is odd if $j$ is even and $j \\ge 2$.\nThis means $x_j$ is even if $j \\in \\{0,1,3,5,\\dots\\}$.\n$x_j$ is odd if $j \\in \\{2,4,6,\\dots\\}$.\n\nFinal condition $x_k=n+1$:\nIf $k \\in \\{0,1,3,5,\\dots\\}$, $n+1$ must be even, so $n$ must be odd.\nIf $k \\in \\{2,4,6,\\dots\\}$, $n+1$ must be odd, so $n$ must be even.\n\nThis means if $n$ is odd, $k$ must be odd (or $k=0$ or $k=1$, but $k \\ge 1$).\nIf $n$ is even, $k$ must be even and $k \\ge 2$.\n\nLet $F_m$ be the $m$-th Fibonacci number, with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThe number of ways to choose $S$ is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_{1+1}=F_2=1$. This corresponds to $S=\\{1\\}$. $1/2^1 = 1/2$.\nThe example output for $n=1$ is $1/4$. This suggests $F_{n+1}$ is not the correct count.\nThe problem statement says $n=2$ example is $1/4$. $n=3$ is $1/4$. $n=5$ is $5/32$.\n$F_3=2$. $2/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$. Example is $1/4$.\n$F_4=3$. $3/2^3 = 3/8$. Example is $1/4$.\n$F_6=8$. $8/2^5 = 8/32 = 1/4$. Example is $5/32$.\n\nMy interpretation of the problem is likely incorrect.\nWhat if $n=1$? $S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=1$. Town $0$ is not covered ($|0-1|=1 \\not< 1$). Town $2$ is not covered ($|2-1|=1 \\not< 1$). Town $1$ is covered by tower $1$ ($|1-1|=0 < 1$). This is a valid configuration.\nThis means for $n=1$, $S=\\{1\\}$ is valid. Probability $1/2$.\nExample output for $n=1$ is $1/4$.\nWait, the example input is a list of $n$ values. The example output is a list of results.\nInput `2` -> Output `748683265` ($1/4$).\nInput `3` -> Output `748683265` ($1/4$).\nInput `5` -> Output `842268673` ($5/32$).\nInput `200000` -> Output `202370013`.\n\nFor $n=1$, my calculation gives $1/2$. Example says $1/4$.\nIs it possible that $n=1$ has no valid configurations?\nIf $n=1$, town $1$ must be covered by exactly one tower.\nIf $S=\\{1\\}$, $p_1=1$. Town $1$ is covered. Towns $0,2$ are not. Valid.\nIf $S=\\emptyset$, town $1$ is not covered. Invalid.\nSo for $n=1$, $S=\\{1\\}$ is the only valid configuration. Probability $1/2$.\nWhy is the example output $1/4$?\nAh, the example input is a list of strings: `['2', '3', '5', '200000']`.\nThe problem statement says: \"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$: with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis is for $n=2$. So for $n=2$, $S=\\{1,2\\}$ is valid.\n$i_1=1, i_2=2$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n$p_1=1 \\le \\min(1, 2+1-1=2)=1$. Valid.\n$p_2=1 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2=1)=1$. Valid.\n$C(1,1)=\\{1\\}$. $C(2,1)=\\{2\\}$. Union is $\\{1,2\\}$. Disjoint. Valid.\nThis configuration $S=\\{1,2\\}$ has probability $1/4$.\nFor $n=2$:\n$S=\\{1\\}$: $p_1=1$. $C(1,1)=\\{1\\}$. Town $2$ not covered. Invalid.\n$S=\\{2\\}$: $p_2=1$. $C(2,1)=\\{2\\}$. Town $1$ not covered. Invalid.\n$S=\\emptyset$: Town $1,2$ not covered. Invalid.\nSo for $n=2$, only $S=\\{1,2\\}$ works. Probability $1/4$. This matches the example.\n\nFor $n=3$: Example output $1/4$.\nPossible sets $S$:\n1. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$.\n   $C(1,1)=\\{1\\}, C(2,1)=\\{2\\}, C(3,1)=\\{3\\}$. All towns covered uniquely.\n   $p_1=1 \\le \\min(1,3)=1$. $p_2=1 \\le \\min(2,2)=2$. $p_3=1 \\le \\min(3,1)=1$. All valid.\n   Probability $1/8$.\n2. $S=\\{2\\}$. $p_2=2$.\n   $C(2,2)=\\{1,2,3\\}$. All towns covered uniquely.\n   $p_2=2 \\le \\min(2,3+1-2=2)=2$. Valid.\n   Probability $1/8$.\nAre there any other valid sets?\nTotal probability $1/8+1/8=2/8=1/4$. This matches the example.\n\nSo the problem asks for the number of sets $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that a valid assignment exists.\nLet $N_n$ be this count.\n$n=1: S=\\{1\\}$. Count is $1$. Probability $1/2^1 = 1/2$. Still not $1/4$.\nIs $n=1$ the first example in the input? No, `['2', '3', '5', '200000']` means $n=2$ is the first example.\nThe note says \"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$\". This refers to $n=2$.\nSo my calculations for $n=2$ and $n=3$ match the examples.\n\nWhat is the pattern for $N_n$?\n$N_1 = 1$.\n$N_2 = 1$.\n$N_3 = 2$.\n$N_4$?\n$N_5 = 5$. Example $5/32$.\nThe sequence $1,1,2,?,5,\\dots$ looks like Fibonacci numbers $F_2, F_2, F_3, ?, F_5$.\n$F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\nIf it's $F_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 2$?\n$N_2=F_1=1$.\n$N_3=F_2=1$. Nope, $N_3=2$.\nIf it's $F_n$? $N_1=F_1=1$. $N_2=F_2=1$. $N_3=F_3=2$. $N_4=F_4=3$. $N_5=F_5=5$.\nThis sequence $1,1,2,3,5,\\dots$ is $F_n$.\nSo it seems the number of valid sets $S$ is $F_n$.\nThe probability is $F_n / 2^n$.\n\nLet's prove that $N_n = F_n$.\nThis is a known result for tiling a $1 \\times n$ board with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ tiles (dominoes).\nA $1 \\times n$ board can be tiled in $F_{n+1}$ ways. If we use $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nOr $F_n$ ways if $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThe problem is about partitioning $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into segments.\nEach segment $[L, R]$ is covered by a single tower $i$.\n$L=i-p_i+1$, $R=i+p_i-1$.\nThe center of the segment is $i = (L+R)/2$.\nThe length of the segment is $R-L+1 = 2p_i-1$.\nSince $i$ must be an integer, $L+R$ must be even. So $L, R$ must have the same parity.\nSince $2p_i-1$ is always odd, $R-L+1$ is odd. This implies $R$ and $L$ must have the same parity. This is consistent.\nThe segments form a partition: $[1, R_1], [R_1+1, R_2], \\dots, [R_{k-1}+1, n]$.\n$R_1$ must have the same parity as $1$ (odd).\n$R_2$ must have the same parity as $R_1+1$ (even).\n$R_j$ must have the same parity as $R_{j-1}+1$. So $R_j$ alternates parity.\n$R_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd. $R_j$ is even if $j$ is even.\nThe last segment $[R_{k-1}+1, n]$ implies $n$ must have the same parity as $R_{k-1}+1$.\nSo $n$ must have different parity than $R_{k-1}$.\nIf $k-1$ is odd, $R_{k-1}$ is odd, so $n$ must be even.\nIf $k-1$ is even, $R_{k-1}$ is even, so $n$ must be odd.\nThis means $n$ and $k-1$ must have different parities. So $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nThis is the condition $n \\pmod 2 = k \\pmod 2$.\nThe earlier analysis said $k$ and $n$ must have different parities.\nLet's check $n=2$, $k=2$. $n,k$ same parity. $2 \\pmod 2 = 2 \\pmod 2$.\nLet's check $n=3$, $k=1$ (for $S=\\{2\\}$). $n,k$ different parity. $3 \\pmod 2 \\ne 1 \\pmod 2$.\nLet's check $n=3$, $k=3$ (for $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$). $n,k$ same parity. $3 \\pmod 2 = 3 \\pmod 2$.\n\nThe condition $i_j \\ge x_{j-1}$ for $j \\ge 2$ (which means $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$) and $i_j > i_{j-1}$ must be satisfied.\nThe conditions $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ must be satisfied.\nThe $L_j, R_j$ partition is:\n$L_1=1, R_1=2i_1-1$. $p_{i_1}=i_1$.\n$L_j=R_{j-1}+1, R_j=2i_j-R_{j-1}-1$. $p_{i_j} = i_j - (R_{j-1}+1) + 1 = i_j-R_{j-1}$.\nThe $p_{i_j}$ must be $\\ge 1$.\n$i_1 \\ge 1$.\n$i_j-R_{j-1} \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow i_j \\ge R_{j-1}+1$.\nThe $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$ constraint:\n$i_j-R_{j-1} \\le n+1-i_j \\Rightarrow 2i_j-R_{j-1} \\le n+1 \\Rightarrow R_j+1 \\le n+1 \\Rightarrow R_j \\le n$. This is already implied by $R_k=n$.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n1. $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\n2. $i_j \\ge R_{j-1}+1$ for $j \\ge 2$. (where $R_0=0$)\n3. $R_k=n$.\n4. $R_j = 2i_j-R_{j-1}-1$ for $j \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's define $R_0=0$.\n$R_j = 2i_j-R_{j-1}-1$.\n$i_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nFor $i_j$ to be an integer, $R_j+R_{j-1}+1$ must be even.\nThis means $R_j+R_{j-1}$ must be odd. So $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ must have different parities.\n$R_0=0$ (even).\n$R_1$ must be odd.\n$R_2$ must be even.\n$R_3$ must be odd.\nIn general, $R_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nCondition $R_k=n$:\nIf $k$ is odd, $n$ must be odd.\nIf $k$ is even, $n$ must be even.\nThis means $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity. This matches my current $n=2,3$ examples.\n\nThe condition $i_j \\ge R_{j-1}+1$ becomes $(R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2 \\ge R_{j-1}+1$.\n$R_j+R_{j-1}+1 \\ge 2R_{j-1}+2$.\n$R_j \\ge R_{j-1}+1$.\nThis means the sequence $R_0, R_1, \\dots, R_k$ must be strictly increasing.\nSo the problem is to count sequences $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$ such that:\n1. $R_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, even if $j$ is even.\n2. $n$ and $k$ have the same parity.\n3. For each $j$, $i_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2 \\le n$.\n   This is $R_j+R_{j-1}+1 \\le 2n$.\n   Since $R_j \\le n$ and $R_{j-1} \\le n-1$, $R_j+R_{j-1}+1 \\le n + (n-1) + 1 = 2n$.\n   This condition is always satisfied.\n\nSo the problem is to count sequences $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$ such that $R_j$ alternates parity (starting with $R_0$ even), and $k \\equiv n \\pmod 2$.\nThis is a standard problem. It's the number of ways to tile a $1 \\times n$ board using $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ blocks.\nA $1 \\times 1$ block corresponds to $R_j - R_{j-1} = 1$.\nA $1 \\times 2$ block corresponds to $R_j - R_{j-1} = 2$.\nThe condition $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ have different parities means $R_j - R_{j-1}$ must be odd.\nThis means we can only use $1 \\times 1$ blocks.\nThen $R_j = j$. So $R_k=k=n$.\nThis means $k=n$. The sequence is $0,1,2,\\dots,n$.\nThis corresponds to $S=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$ and $p_j=1$ for all $j$.\nThis is one valid configuration.\n\nThis is not $F_n$.\nThis must be the standard interpretation of this type of problem, where $i_j$ is the midpoint of the segment.\nThe question is $R_j \\ge R_{j-1}+1$.\n$i_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$.\n$i_j > i_{j-1}$ condition:\n$(R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2 > (R_{j-1}+R_{j-2}+1)/2$.\n$R_j > R_{j-2}$. This is $R_j \\ge R_{j-2}+2$ because $R_j$ and $R_{j-2}$ have the same parity.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n1. $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$.\n2. $R_j$ is odd if $j$ is odd, even if $j$ is even.\n3. $R_j \\ge R_{j-1}+1$. (Strictly increasing)\n4. $R_j \\ge R_{j-2}+2$ for $j \\ge 2$. (This is $i_j > i_{j-1}$ for $j \\ge 2$)\n   For $j=1$, $i_1=R_1/2$.\n   For $j=2$, $i_2=(R_2+R_1+1)/2$. $i_2 > i_1 \\Rightarrow (R_2+R_1+1)/2 > R_1/2 \\Rightarrow R_2+R_1+1 > R_1 \\Rightarrow R_2+1 > 0$. Always true since $R_2 \\ge R_1+1 \\ge 1+1=2$.\n   So the condition $i_j > i_{j-1}$ is always satisfied if $R_j \\ge R_{j-1}+1$.\n\nThis still leads to $R_j-R_{j-2} \\ge 2$.\nThis is a path from $(0,0)$ to $(n,k)$ on a grid with specific step types.\nThe number of ways to compose $n$ into parts where each part is $1$ or $2$.\nThis is $F_{n+1}$.\nLet $a_j = R_j-R_{j-1}$.\n$a_j \\ge 1$.\n$a_j$ must be odd. (Because $R_j, R_{j-1}$ have different parities).\nSo $a_j \\in \\{1, 3, 5, \\dots\\}$.\nThe condition $R_j \\ge R_{j-2}+2$ means $a_j+a_{j-1} \\ge 2$. This is always true if $a_j, a_{j-1} \\ge 1$.\n\nSo we are counting sequences $a_1, \\dots, a_k$ such that $\\sum a_j = n$, $a_j$ is odd, and $a_j \\ge 1$.\nThis is the number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts.\nFor example, $n=5$:\n$a_j$ odd, $\\sum a_j = 5$.\n$k=1: (5)$. $R_0=0, R_1=5$. $k=1, n=5$. Both odd. Valid.\n$i_1=5/2$. Not an integer. My $i_j$ must be integers.\n$i_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nFor $R_j+R_{j-1}+1$ to be even, $R_j+R_{j-1}$ must be odd.\nThis means $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ must have different parities. This is the condition $a_j$ is odd.\nSo $i_j$ is always an integer.\n\nSo the problem is exactly counting compositions of $n$ into odd parts.\nThe number of compositions of $n$ into $k$ odd parts is $\\binom{(n-k)/2+k-1}{k-1}$ if $n$ and $k$ have the same parity.\nSum over $k$.\nThe number of compositions of $n$ into odd parts is $F_n$ (with $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$).\nFor $n=1$, $F_1=1$. (5).\nFor $n=2$, $F_2=1$. (1+1).\nFor $n=3$, $F_3=2$. (3), (1+1+1).\nFor $n=5$, $F_5=5$. (5), (3+1+1), (1+3+1), (1+1+3), (1+1+1+1+1).\n\nThis matches the values $N_n=F_n$.\nSo the probability is $F_n \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to calculate $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe can use matrix exponentiation to find $F_n$ in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nThe Fibonacci sequence for matrix exponentiation is usually $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{m+1} \\\\ F_m \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^m \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo $F_n$ is the $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$ element of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nSpecifically, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_n & F_{n-1} \\\\ F_{n-1} & F_{n-2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo we need $F_n$.\n\nModulo is $998244353$.\n$2^n \\pmod{998244353}$ is needed for inverse.\n$2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353} = (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe can compute $2^n$ using modular exponentiation, then find its inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem: $a^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$ using matrix exponentiation.\n2. Compute $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$ using modular exponentiation and modular inverse.\n3. Multiply the results and print.\n\nBase cases for Fibonacci:\nIf $n=1$, $F_1=1$.\nIf $n=0$, $F_0=0$.\nMy matrix exponentiation gives $F_n$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$A^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$A^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{m+1} \\\\ F_m \\end{pmatrix} = A^m \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $m=n$: $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} \\\\ F_n \\end{pmatrix} = A^n \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo $F_n$ is the $(1,0)$ element of $A^n$.\nThis seems correct.\n\nExample $n=2$: $F_2=1$. $1 \\cdot (2^2)^{-1} = 1 \\cdot 4^{-1} = 1 \\cdot 748683265 = 748683265$. Correct.\nExample $n=3$: $F_3=2$. $2 \\cdot (2^3)^{-1} = 2 \\cdot 8^{-1} = 2 \\cdot 124780544 = 249561088$.\nExample output for $n=3$ is $748683265$. This is $1/4$.\nMy $F_3=2$ gives $2/8=1/4$. Correct.\nExample $n=5$: $F_5=5$. $5 \\cdot (2^5)^{-1} = 5 \\cdot 32^{-1} = 5 \\cdot 311951361 = 1559756805 \\equiv 842268673 \\pmod{998244353}$. Correct.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nThe problem asks for $F_n \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef matrix_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef matrix_pow(A, n):\n    result = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    base = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            result = matrix_mult(result, base)\n        base = matrix_mult(base, base)\n        n //= 2\n    return result\n\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Calculate F_n using matrix exponentiation\n    # [F(n+1), F(n)] = [[1,1],[1,0]]^n * [F(1), F(0)]\n    # We need F_n, which is the (1,0) element of A^n * [1,0]\n    # A^n = [[F(n+1), F(n)], [F(n), F(n-1)]]\n    # So F_n is the (0,1) or (1,0) element of A^n\n    # A^n_10 is F_n, A^n_01 is F_n\n    \n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    T_n = matrix_pow(T, n)\n    \n    # F_n is the element at (0,1) or (1,0) in T_n if we use F_0=0, F_1=1\n    # Check: T^1 = [[1,1],[1,0]] -> F_1=1\n    # T^2 = [[2,1],[1,1]] -> F_2=1\n    # T^3 = [[3,2],[2,1]] -> F_3=2\n    # So F_n is T_n[0][1] or T_n[1][0]\n    \n    return T_n[0][1] # Or T_n[1][0] for F_n\n\ndef mod_inv(a, m):\n    return pow(a, m - 2, m)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0: # Although problem states n >= 1\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Calculate F_n\n    fib_n = fibonacci(n)\n\n    # Calculate (2^n)^-1 mod MOD\n    pow2_n = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_pow2_n = mod_inv(pow2_n, MOD)\n\n    # Result is F_n * (2^n)^-1 mod MOD\n    result = (fib_n * inv_pow2_n) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n\n```\nTest with provided examples:\nn=2:\nfibonacci(2) = 1\npow(2,2,MOD) = 4\nmod_inv(4, MOD) = 748683265\n(1 * 748683265) % MOD = 748683265.

The logic for compositions of $n$ into odd parts being $F_n$ is a known combinatorial identity.\nThe proof for that identity is typically by considering the first part $a_1$. If $a_1=1$, the rest is a composition of $n-1$ into odd parts. If $a_1 \\ge 3$, replace $a_1$ with $a_1-2$, and the sum becomes $n-2$. This gives $C(n) = C(n-1) + C(n-2)$. With base cases $C(1)=1$ (part 1) and $C(2)=1$ (parts 1+1). This corresponds to $F_n$ with $F_1=1, F_2=1$.\n\nFinal check on constraints: $1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$. Matrix exponentiation is $O(\\log n)$, so this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the modulus\nMOD = 998244353\n\n# Function to multiply two 2x2 matrices\ndef matrix_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    C[0][0] = (A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]) % MOD\n    C[0][1] = (A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]) % MOD\n    C[1][0] = (A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0]) % MOD\n    C[1][1] = (A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]) % MOD\n    return C\n\n# Function to raise a 2x2 matrix to a power n\ndef matrix_pow(A, n):\n    result = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    base = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            result = matrix_mult(result, base)\n        base = matrix_mult(base, base)\n        n //= 2\n    return result\n\n# Function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number (F_0=0, F_1=1)\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # The transformation matrix for Fibonacci numbers\n    # [[F(k+1)], [F(k)]] = [[1, 1], [1, 0]] * [[F(k)], [F(k-1)]]\n    # To get F_n, we need to calculate [[1, 1], [1, 0]]^(n-1)\n    # The top-left element of [[1,1],[1,0]]^m is F_{m+1}\n    # So, for F_n, we need F_{(n-1)+1} = F_n, which is the top-left element of T^(n-1)\n    \n    T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    \n    # For F_n, we need T^(n-1)\n    # If using [F_1, F_0] as base: [[F_n, F_{n-1}], [F_{n-1}, F_{n-2}]] = T^(n-1)\n    # So F_n is T_n[0][0]\n    # For F_n with n>=1:\n    # T^1 = [[1,1],[1,0]] -> F_2=1, F_1=1, F_0=0.
