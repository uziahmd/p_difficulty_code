He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving this competitive programming problem:**\n\nThe goal is to find how many numbers `n` exist where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeros. I know the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is the same as the number of factors of 5 in `n!`'s prime factorization (because there are always more factors of 2 than 5). I can calculate this using Legendre's formula, which I can write as `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` as long as `5^k <= n`.\n\nI've analyzed the `Z(n)` function: it's non-decreasing, meaning it only goes up or stays the same. The jumps happen when `n` is a multiple of 5. For example, `Z(24)` is 4, but `Z(25)` is 6. This \"skipping\" is important! The problem asks for `n` where `Z(n) = m`. Since `Z(n)` doesn't decrease, once `Z(n) = m`, it will remain `m` for the next 4 consecutive numbers (because numbers like n+1 aren't multiples of 5). When you get to the next multiple of 5, the number of zeros increases.\n\nBased on this, if I find one `n` where `Z(n) = m`, I know the next 4 numbers will also have `m` zeros, so there are always 5 consecutive numbers with `m` zeros. If no `n` exists to have exactly m zeros, because that `m` value is 'skipped', the answer is zero. If you find one it means that number, plus the next 4 will be valid.\n\nTo find the smallest such `n`, I'm going to use binary search because `Z(n)` is monotonic. I'll need a range for this search. Because m can be large, around 100,000, I'll start with 4m (a little larger might be safer) as an upper bound, and 1 as a lower bound. Binary Search seems perfect for the task. I will implement a function to count the number of zeros. I check if the returned zeros value is equal to `m`.\n\nDuring the search, If I find an `n` such that `Z(n) = m`, I output 5 and the 5 consecutive numbers. Otherwise, I output 0. I also handle the edge case where no solution exists. After Binary Search implementation, I double-checked the input range with the problem description and it's fine. I checked the binary search implementation and edge cases and it is correct. I am ready to implement the code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n` values, followed by the values themselves in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s. In any factorial `n!`, the number of factors of 2 will always be greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes is solely determined by the number of factors of 5.\n\nThe number of factors of 5 in `n!` can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as `5^k <= n`.\n\n**Properties of Z(n)**\n\n1.  **Non-decreasing:** `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2.  **Increase only at multiples of 5:** `Z(n)` only increases its value when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n    *   If `n` is not a multiple of 5, then `Z(n) = Z(n-1)`. For example, `Z(5)=1`, `Z(6)=1`, `Z(7)=1`, `Z(8)=1`, `Z(9)=1`.\n    *   If `n` is a multiple of 5, then `Z(n) > Z(n-1)`. The increase `Z(n) - Z(n-1)` is equal to the number of factors of 5 in `n`. For example, `Z(5)-Z(4) = 1-0 = 1`. `Z(25)-Z(24) = 6-4 = 2` (because 25 has two factors of 5: 5*5).\n\n**Key Observation**\n\nDue to the property that `Z(n)` only increases at multiples of 5, if `Z(N) = m` for some `N`, then for `N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4`, as long as these are not multiples of 5, `Z` will remain `m`. The next time `Z` can change is at `N+5`.\nSpecifically, if `N` is the smallest positive integer such that `Z(N) = m`:\n*   `N` must be a multiple of 5. (Proof: If `N` were not a multiple of 5, then `Z(N) = Z(N-1)`, contradicting `N` being the *smallest* integer for which `Z(N)=m` while `Z(N-1)<m`.)\n*   Since `N` is a multiple of 5, `N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4` are not multiples of 5.\n*   Therefore, `Z(N) = Z(N+1) = Z(N+2) = Z(N+3) = Z(N+4) = m`.\n*   `Z(N+5)` will be strictly greater than `m` (because `N+5` is a multiple of 5, adding at least one factor of 5).\n\nThis implies that if `m` is a value that `Z(n)` can achieve, it will be achieved for exactly 5 consecutive integers: `N, N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4`, where `N` is the smallest such integer.\nIf `m` is a value that `Z(n)` \"skips\" (e.g., `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`, so `Z(n)` never equals 5), then there are 0 such integers `n`.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Binary Search for `N`:** Since `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to find the smallest `N` such that `Z(N) >= m`.\n    *   The lower bound for `n` is `1`.\n    *   For the upper bound, `Z(n)` is approximately `n/4`. So `n` is approximately `4m`. For `m = 100,000`, `n` is around `400,000`. A safe upper bound for binary search can be `5 * m` (e.g., `500,000` for `m=100,000`).\n2.  **Check `Z(N)`:** After finding `N` (the smallest integer such that `Z(N) >= m`):\n    *   If `Z(N) == m`, then we have found our starting `N`. The `k` values are `N, N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4`. Output `5` and then these 5 integers.\n    *   If `Z(N) > m`, it means `m` was a skipped value. For example, if `m=5`, the binary search would find `N=25` for which `Z(25)=6`. Since `Z(25) > 5`, `m=5` is skipped. In this case, output `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=1)**\n\n1.  `m = 1`.\n2.  Binary search for smallest `N` where `Z(N) >= 1`.\n    *   Range `[1, 5*1] = [1, 5]`.\n    *   `mid = 3`, `Z(3)=0`. `0 < 1`, so `low = 4`.\n    *   Range `[4, 5]`.\n    *   `mid = 4`, `Z(4)=0`. `0 < 1`, so `low = 5`.\n    *   Range `[5, 5]`.\n    *   `mid = 5`, `Z(5)=1`. `1 >= 1`, so `ans_n = 5`, `high = 4`.\n    *   Loop terminates (`low > high`). `ans_n = 5`.\n3.  Check `Z(ans_n)`: `Z(5) = 1`. This equals `m`.\n4.  Output:\n    `5`\n    `5 6 7 8 9`\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=5)**\n\n1.  `m = 5`.\n2.  Binary search for smallest `N` where `Z(N) >= 5`.\n    *   Range `[1, 5*5] = [1, 25]`.\n    *   ... (binary search proceeds)\n    *   Eventually, `ans_n` will be found as `25`. (`Z(24)=4`, `Z(25)=6`).\n3.  Check `Z(ans_n)`: `Z(25) = 6`. This is `> m` (5).\n4.  Output:\n    `0`\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\n*   Use `sys.stdin.readline()` for faster input and `sys.stdout.write()` for faster output in competitive programming.\n*   The `count_trailing_zeroes` function is efficient, performing `log5(n)` operations.\n*   The binary search performs `log2(upper_bound)` iterations. The total complexity will be `O(log(m) * log5(m))`, which is very fast for `m <= 100,000`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Function to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in n!\n    def count_trailing_zeroes(n_val):\n        count = 0\n        power_of_5 = 5\n        while n_val >= power_of_5:\n            count += n_val // power_of_5\n            power_of_5 *= 5\n        return count\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m\n    # A safe upper bound for n is approximately 4*m, but 5*m is definitely sufficient.\n    # For m=100,000, n is around 400,000. 5*m = 500,000.\n    low = 1\n    high = 5 * m \n    ans_n = -1 # This will store the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        \n        if zeroes >= m:\n            ans_n = mid\n            high = mid - 1 # Try to find an even smaller n\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1 # mid is too small, need a larger n\n\n    # After binary search, ans_n holds the smallest integer n such that Z(n) >= m.\n    # Since m >= 1, Z(n) will eventually reach or exceed m, so ans_n will always be found.\n\n    # Now, check if Z(ans_n) is exactly m.\n    if count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) == m:\n        # If it is, then ans_n, ans_n+1, ans_n+2, ans_n+3, ans_n+4 all have m zeroes.\n        # This is because:\n        # 1.
