Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solution for Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, here's my plan to tackle the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem.  First things first, I've got to analyze the situation: We've got `n` lanterns spread out on a street of length `l`, and each lantern is positioned at `a_i`. The aim is to find the minimum radius, `d`, each lantern needs to illuminate the entire street. \n\nThe core idea, of course, is to find the most efficient lantern placement. Sorting the lantern positions `a_i` is a no-brainer.  Once they're sorted, I can ensure optimal coverage.\n\nThere are a few key aspects to calculate the minimum radius (`d`). We have to consider three points.\n\n*   **Left End:** The leftmost point, `0`, must be illuminated. The distance from the first lantern (after sorting) at `a_0` to the starting point `0` is simply `a_0`. Therefore, `d` must be at least `a_0`.\n*   **Right End:** Similarly, the rightmost point `l` has to be illuminated. The distance from the last lantern at `a_{n-1}` to `l` is `l - a_{n-1}`. Thus, `d` must be greater than or equal to `l - a_{n-1}`.\n*   **Gaps:** Now, between adjacent lanterns at positions `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (after sorting), we've got to cover the space between them. For two lanterns to be in contact, then `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d` which resolves to `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. I'll have to find the maximum value among all such gaps, `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`, for all `i` from `0` to `n-2`.\n\nUltimately, the minimum radius, `d`, is simply the maximum of `a_0`, `l - a_{n-1}`, and the largest gap.  I'll store these as `d_left`, `d_right`, and `d_gap` respectively, and set `d = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)`.  I need to make sure to use floating-point numbers during the calculations to get the correct result.\n\nI've tested the logic with the example in the problem description, and some edge cases like when there is only one lantern, or multiple lanterns at the same point. It seems to work fine.\n\nRegarding the code implementation, I'll be using Python, `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` for reading/writing. I will sort the input list of lantern positions, find distances for the endpoints and gaps. Then I will print the maximum distance.\n\nThe time complexity should be dominated by the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)`. This is efficient enough for this problem as we know that `n` will not be too large.\n",
