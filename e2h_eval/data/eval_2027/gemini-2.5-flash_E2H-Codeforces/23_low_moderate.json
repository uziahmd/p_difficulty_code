            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Mahjong Problem: My Approach**\n\nOkay, I'm tackling this \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem. The core of it is figuring out the *minimum* number of tiles I need to add to my initial three to get at least one \"mentsu\" (a koutsu or shuntsu, for those unfamiliar). I'm thinking, \"Let's translate those input strings into something manageable.\" I'll probably go with a list of tuples like `[(number, suit), (number, suit), (number, suit)]`.  Numbers as integers, suits, well, maybe keep them as characters, no need for overcomplication there.\n\nNow, I'm seeing three cases. First, can I get away with zero extra tiles?  Meaning, do my initial three already form a mentsu?  Then, what about one tile? Finally, if both of those fail, it *must* take two extra tiles (the problem says this will always work).  So I need a function `is_mentsu(tiles)` to check this.\n\nA \"mentsu\" is either a \"koutsu\" (three identical tiles) or a \"shuntsu\" (three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit).  For the koutsu check, simple equality, easy peasy. For shuntsu, I need all the suits to match *and* the numbers to be sequential. So, I need to sort the tiles by suit first, then number (to get them grouped properly). I can use `[(int(s[0]), s[1]) for s in input().split()]` to easily parse the input.\n\nTo check if these *initial* three tiles are a mentsu, I'm thinking of building a helper function `check_three_tiles(t1, t2, t3)` that does exactly that. I need to be precise, as the problem hinges on this check. I'll parse the strings into the right tuple format, sort, and then run my `is_mentsu` on them. That should handle the zero extra tile case cleanly.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles (0, 1, or 2) Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld) from her hand of three tiles. A mentsu can be a koutsu (triplet of identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three tiles of the same suit).\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. Each tile has a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s).\n\nWe will check for the minimum number of tiles required in increasing order: 0, 1, then 2.\n\n**1. Check if 0 extra tiles are needed:**\nThis means the initial three tiles `t1, t2, t3` already form a mentsu.\nTo check this:\n- Parse the three tile strings into a more usable format, e.g., `(number, suit)` tuples.\n- Sort these three tiles. Sorting by suit then by number helps with shuntsu checks.\n- Check for Koutsu: Are all three tiles identical? `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`.\n- Check for Shuntsu:\n    - Are all three tiles of the same suit? `t1.suit == t2.suit == t3.suit`.\n    - Are their numbers sequential? `t1.num + 1 == t2.num` and `t2.num + 1 == t3.num`.\nIf either a koutsu or a shuntsu is found, the answer is 0.\n\n**2. Check if 1 extra tile is needed:**\nThis means by drawing one additional tile `t_extra`, the four tiles `t1, t2, t3, t_extra` can form a mentsu. Since a mentsu only requires three tiles, this means some subset of three tiles from `t1, t2, t3, t_extra` forms a mentsu.\nA more direct way to think about this is: can we form a mentsu using two of the original tiles `(ti, tj)` and one new tile `t_extra`?\nWe need to iterate through all pairs of distinct tiles from the initial hand `(t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3)`. For each pair `(t_a, t_b)`:\n- **Can they form a koutsu with one extra tile?**\n    - If `t_a == t_b`, we can draw a third identical tile `t_a` (or `t_b`) to form a koutsu `[t_a, t_b, t_a]`.\n- **Can they form a shuntsu with one extra tile?**\n    - If `t_a.suit == t_b.suit`:\n        - Let `n_a = t_a.num` and `n_b = t_b.num`. Assume `n_a < n_b` by sorting.\n        - If `n_b - n_a == 1` (e.g., 2m, 3m): We can draw `n_a - 1` (e.g., 1m) or `n_b + 1` (e.g., 4m) to form a shuntsu. (e.g., `[1m, 2m, 3m]` or `[2m, 3m, 4m]`).\n        - If `n_b - n_a == 2` (e.g., 2m, 4m): We can draw `n_a + 1` (e.g., 3m) to form a shuntsu `[2m, 3m, 4m]`.\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n**3. If neither 0 nor 1 extra tiles are sufficient:**\nThe minimum number of extra tiles needed is 2. This is always possible. For example, pick any of the initial tiles, say `t1`. Draw two more tiles identical to `t1` to form a koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`. Or, if we have `1m`, we can draw `2m` and `3m` to form a shuntsu `[1m, 2m, 3m]`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Represent tiles as `(number, suit)` tuples.\n- The input tiles are given as strings, e.g., \"1s 2s 3s\". We split this string and parse each tile.\n- Use a helper function, say `check_pair_for_mentsu(tile1, tile2)`, to encapsulate the logic for checking if two tiles can form a mentsu with one extra tile. This function would return `True` if possible, `False` otherwise.\n- The `check_pair_for_mentsu` function should handle sorting the numbers and checking differences.\n- The main logic will be:\n    1. Parse input tiles.\n    2. Check for 0 tiles.\n    3. If not 0, check all 3 pairs for 1 tile.\n    4. If not 1, return 2.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles_raw = []\n    for tile_str in s:\n        num = int(tile_str[0])\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        tiles_raw.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for consistent checking\n    # Sort by suit first, then by number\n    tiles_raw.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # --- Check for 0 extra tiles ---\n    # This means the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.\n    \n    # Check for Koutsu (triplet of identical tiles)\n    if tiles_raw[0] == tiles_raw[1] and tiles_raw[1] == tiles_raw[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for Shuntsu (sequence of three tiles of the same suit)\n    if (tiles_raw[0][1] == tiles_raw[1][1] and tiles_raw[1][1] == tiles_raw[2][1] and\n        tiles_raw[0][0] + 1 == tiles_raw[1][0] and tiles_raw[1][0] + 1 == tiles_raw[2][0]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 extra tile ---\n    # This means we can form a mentsu using two of the initial tiles and one drawn tile.\n    \n    # Helper function to check if two tiles can form a mentsu with one extra tile\n    def can_form_mentsu_with_one_extra(t1, t2):\n        # Case 1: Form a koutsu\n        if t1 == t2:\n            return True # e.g., [1m, 1m] -> draw 1m for [1m, 1m, 1m]\n        \n        # Case 2: Form a shuntsu\n        if t1[1] == t2[1]: # Same suit\n            n1, n2 = sorted([t1[0], t2[0]]) # Ensure n1 < n2\n            \n            # If numbers are consecutive (e.g., 2m, 3m)\n            # We can draw n1-1 (1m) or n2+1 (4m)\n            if n2 - n1 == 1:\n                return True # e.g., [2m, 3m] -> draw 1m or 4m\n            \n            # If numbers are separated by one (e.g., 2m, 4m)\n            # We can draw n1+1 (3m)\n            if n2 - n1 == 2:\n                return True # e.g., [2m, 4m] -> draw 3m\n        \n        return False\n\n    # Check all pairs of initial tiles\n    if (can_form_mentsu_with_one_extra(tiles_raw[0], tiles_raw[1]) or\n        can_form_mentsu_with_one_extra(tiles_raw[0], tiles_raw[2]) or\n        can_form_mentsu_with_one_extra(tiles_raw[1], tiles_raw[2])):\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # --- If neither 0 nor 1 extra tiles are sufficient, then 2 are needed ---\n    # This is always possible (e.g., draw two tiles identical to one of the existing tiles\n    # to form a koutsu, or draw two sequential tiles of the same suit as an existing tile\n    # to form a shuntsu).\n    print(2)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
