The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "**My Approach to Counting Gilded Cells**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The input is the plate's width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of gilded rings (`k`). I'm going to break this down step by step to ensure my solution is both accurate and efficient.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of these rings.  The problem defines them as bordering cells on progressively smaller inner rectangles.  Each ring has a width of 1 cell.  The outermost ring, ring 1, covers the entire plate, a rectangle of size `w x h`. Ring 2 borders a rectangle that's 2 cells in from each edge, and so on. The core idea is to find the dimensions of the inner rectangle each ring borders. The *i*th ring will border a rectangle whose dimensions are `w - 4(i-1)` and `h - 4(i-1)`. It is important to note the formula `w - 4(i-1)` because it is how we arrive at each inner rectangle.\n\nNext, I have to figure out how to count the gilded cells for a single ring. Since the problem explicitly states that each ring is formed by the bordering cells, effectively the perimeter of a rectangle, I can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle defined by the effective width and height.\n\nI can either use the formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` or, if the width and height are at least 2, `W * H - (W-2) * (H-2)`.  I think the first formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` is safer.\n\nTo find the total number of gilded cells, I'll need to sum up the perimeters of the rectangles defined by each of the `k` rings.  This involves iterating from `i = 1` to `k`, calculating the effective dimensions `W_i` and `H_i` for each ring, and then summing up the perimeter cells using the formula above.\n\nLet's do a quick check to make sure my approach is sound. Consider an example like `w=7, h=9, k=2`. For ring 1, my dimensions are `7 x 9`. For ring 2, I should get `3 x 5`.\n\nSo, the dimensions seem to be working. Now it's time to translate this into Python code.\n",
