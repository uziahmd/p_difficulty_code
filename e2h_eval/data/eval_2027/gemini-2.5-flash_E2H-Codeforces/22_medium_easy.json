After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving the \"Marks\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Marks\" problem.  The goal is to count the number of \"successful\" students based on their marks in different subjects.  The input is pretty straightforward: the number of students (`n`), the number of subjects (`m`), and a gradebook represented as a list of strings, where each string is a student's marks across all subjects.\n\nThe core idea is to identify the students who are the *best* at at least one subject.  \"Best\" here means they got the *maximum* mark for that subject compared to all other students.\n\nFirst, I'll need to read the input.  I'm thinking of using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially since this is likely a competitive programming problem. I'll store the gradebook as a list of strings, with each string representing a student's marks.  This avoids needing to deal with space-separated input, which simplifies things.\n\nNext, I need to implement the logic for identifying successful students. I'll iterate through each subject (column in the gradebook) and find the maximum mark for that subject. Then, I'll iterate through the students and mark any student who has that maximum mark for that subject as \"successful.\"  I'll use a boolean list, `successful_students`, of size `n` (the number of students) to keep track of this.\n\nThe crucial part is iterating through each subject and finding the maximum. For the nested loops, The complexity is manageable since `n` and `m` are bounded by 100, which means an O(n*m) solution is perfectly fine. I should also remember to convert the character marks in the input strings to integers for comparisons.\n\nI can make the code cleaner by initializing `successful_students` to `False` for all students. Then, in the loops, I'll set `successful_students[i] = True` if the student is best at a subject. At the end, I just need to count the `True` values in the `successful_students` list. I could use a simple loop for this, or the `sum()` function, since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 in a summation. I'll go with `sum()`.\n\nI think I have a solid algorithm in mind, and the logic seems sound. I'll start by writing the Python code, following this step-by-step approach. I'll make sure to test it thoroughly with the example cases provided to verify the correctness of the code and the logic. Looks like this can be solved in a straightforward manner.\n",
