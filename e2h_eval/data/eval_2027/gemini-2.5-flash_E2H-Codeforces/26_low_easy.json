    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Triangle Counting Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to count non-degenerate triangles. The sides have to be integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, with the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.  I'm focusing on efficiency here because those bounds on `B`, `C`, and `D` could get pretty large.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the non-degenerate triangle condition, which is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.  Because of the constraint `x <= y <= z`, the inequalities `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` are automatically satisfied.  The only one I *really* need to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nNow, the core of the problem: I have `x` going from `A` to `B`, and `y` from `B` to `C`. For each `(x, y)` pair, I need to count valid `z` values between `C` and `D` that also satisfy `x + y > z`.\n\nThis translates to finding the number of `z`s where `max(C, 1) <= z < x + y`.  Since we're always dealing with positive side lengths, the lower bound is just `C`.  The upper bound is `min(D, x + y - 1)`. So, the number of valid `z`s for a given `(x, y)` pair is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nIf I naively iterate through all the `x` and `y` possibilities, the runtime might become an issue.  I'm looking at potential `(B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)` combinations. With `B` and `C` reaching 500,000, that could easily get to the order of `10^11` operations, and that's just too much. I need to find a more elegant approach to this.  I need to rethink how I'm going to iterate through the combinations.  Let's consider fixing `x`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nThe conditions for a non-degenerate triangle are:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `x <= y <= z`, the conditions `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` are automatically satisfied because `x, y, z` are positive integers (since `A >= 1`):\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= 1`, we have `x + z >= 1 + y > y`.\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= 1`, we have `y + z >= x + 1 > x`.\n\nThus, we only need to satisfy the triangle inequality `x + y > z`.\n\nCombining this with the given range constraints, we need to find the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nLet's iterate through possible values of `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, we need to find pairs `(y, z)` that satisfy the conditions.\nThe ranges for `y` and `z` are:\n- `B <= y <= C`\n- `C <= z <= D`\n- `z < x + y`\n\nCombining the `z` constraints, we need `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a fixed `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `count_z(x, y)` be this value.\n\nA naive iteration over `x` and `y` would be `(B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)` operations. Given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`, this could be `(5 * 10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^{11}` in the worst case, which is too slow. We need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet `S = x + y`. The condition `z < x + y` becomes `z < S`.\nAlso, `y` must be at least `B`. So `S = x + y >= x + B`.\nAnd `y` must be at most `C`. So `S = x + y <= x + C`.\nThus, for a fixed `x`, `S` can range from `x + B` to `x + C`.\n\nFor a fixed `x`, we can iterate `y` from `B` to `C`.\nFor each `y`, we count valid `z` values.\nThe number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet `L_z = C` (lower bound for `z`).\nLet `U_z(x, y) = min(D, x + y - 1)` (upper bound for `z`).\nThe count for `z` is `max(0, U_z(x, y) - L_z + 1)`.\n\nNotice that `U_z(x, y)` is non-decreasing as `y` increases.\nThe term `x + y - 1` increases with `y`.\nThe term `min(D, x + y - 1)` will be `D` once `x + y - 1 >= D`, and `x + y - 1` otherwise.\n\nWe can rephrase the problem: for each `x` from `A` to `B`, we want to calculate `sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet `k = x + y - 1`.\nThe number of `z` values is `max(0, min(D, k) - C + 1)`.\nThis value changes its form when `k` crosses `D` or when `min(D, k) - C + 1` becomes positive.\nSpecifically, `min(D, k) - C + 1` is positive when `min(D, k) >= C`.\nIf `k < C`, then `min(D, k) - C + 1` is negative, so count is 0.\nIf `C <= k <= D`, then `min(D, k) = k`, so count is `k - C + 1`.\nIf `k > D`, then `min(D, k) = D`, so count is `D - C + 1`.\n\nLet `max_val = D`.\nWe can use a prefix sum array or a difference array approach for `y`.\nFor a fixed `x`, let `f(y) = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nWe need to calculate `sum_{y=B}^{C} f(y)`.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `x + y - 1` is `B + C - 1`.\nThe maximum possible value for `D` is `5 * 10^5`.\nThe maximum possible value for `B + C - 1` is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 - 1 = 10^6 - 1`.\nLet `M = D`. We can create a frequency array `counts` of size `M + 1`.\n`counts[s]` will store the number of ways to get `x + y = s` satisfying `A <= x <= B <= y <= C`.\n\nInitialize `counts` array of size `M + 1` to zeros.\nIterate `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, iterate `y` from `B` to `C`.\nCalculate `s = x + y`.\nIncrement `counts[s]` by 1.\n\nThis is still `(B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)` operations.\nWe need to optimize the calculation of `counts[s]`.\nFor a fixed `x`, as `y` goes from `B` to `C`, `s = x + y` goes from `x + B` to `x + C`.\nThis means for each `x`, we are adding 1 to `counts[s]` for `s` in range `[x + B, x + C]`.\nThis is a range update operation. We can use a difference array (or prefix sums) for this.\n\nCreate a `diff` array of size `M_max + 2` (where `M_max = B + C` is the maximum possible sum `x+y`).\nFor each `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  `diff[x + B]` increases by 1.\n  `diff[x + C + 1]` decreases by 1.\n\nAfter processing all `x` values:\nCompute the actual `counts` array by taking prefix sums of `diff`.\n`counts[s] = counts[s-1] + diff[s]` for `s` from `1` to `M_max`. (Initialize `counts[0] = diff[0]`).\nThis step takes `O(M_max)` time.\n\nThe maximum value of `M_max = B + C` is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`.\nThe number of `x` values is `B - A + 1`, which is at most `5 * 10^5`.\nSo, the `diff` array construction takes `O(B - A + 1)` time.\nThe prefix sum calculation takes `O(B + C)` time.\n\nOnce we have `counts[s]` (number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x+y=s` and `A <= x <= B <= y <= C`), we can calculate the total number of triangles.\nThe total number of triangles is `sum_{s=A+B}^{B+C} counts[s] * max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe sum for `s` needs to be split into ranges based on `min(D, s - 1)`.\nLet `s_prime = s - 1`.\nThe number of `z` values for `x+y=s` is `max(0, min(D, s_prime) - C + 1)`.\nThis term is 0 if `s_prime < C`. So we only care about `s_prime >= C`, or `s >= C + 1`.\nThe sum is over `s` from `max(A+B, C+1)` to `B+C`.\n\nLet `lower_s_bound = max(A+B, C+1)`.\nTotal triangles = `sum_{s=lower_s_bound}^{B+C} counts[s] * (min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nWe can split this sum into two parts:\n1. When `s - 1 <= D` (i.e., `s <= D + 1`):\n   The term is `s - 1 - C + 1 = s - C`.\n   This applies for `s` in `[lower_s_bound, min(B+C, D+1)]`.\n   Sum `counts[s] * (s - C)` for these `s`.\n2. When `s - 1 > D` (i.e., `s > D + 1`):\n   The term is `D - C + 1`.\n   This applies for `s` in `[max(lower_s_bound, D+2), B+C]`.\n   Sum `counts[s] * (D - C + 1)` for these `s`.\n\nThe second part is `(D - C + 1) * sum_{s=max(lower_s_bound, D+2)}^{B+C} counts[s]`.\nThe sum `sum counts[s]` can be computed efficiently using prefix sums of `counts`.\n\nLet's refine the calculation for `sum_{s=lower_s_bound}^{B+C} counts[s] * (min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `max_sum_xy = B + C`.\nLet `min_sum_xy = A + B`.\nThe relevant sums `s` for `x+y` range from `min_sum_xy` to `max_sum_xy`.\nWe need `s-1 >= C`, so `s >= C+1`.\nSo, we sum for `s` from `max(min_sum_xy, C+1)` to `max_sum_xy`. Let this range be `[S_start, S_end]`.\n\nFor `s` in `[S_start, min(S_end, D+1)]`: add `counts[s] * (s - C)`.\nFor `s` in `[max(S_start, D+2), S_end]`: add `counts[s] * (D - C + 1)`.\n\nThis approach is `O(B + C)` overall.\n\nExample: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n`M_max = B+C = 2+3 = 5`. `diff` array size `5+2=7`.\n`diff = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\n`x=1`:\n  `y` from `B=2` to `C=3`.\n  `x+B = 1+2 = 3`. `x+C = 1+3 = 4`.\n  `diff[3] += 1`, `diff[4+1] -= 1` -> `diff[5] -= 1`.\n  `diff = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0]`\n\n`x=2`:\n  `y` from `B=2` to `C=3`.\n  `x+B = 2+2 = 4`. `x+C = 2+3 = 5`.\n  `diff[4] += 1`, `diff[5+1] -= 1` -> `diff[6] -= 1`.\n  `diff = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1]`\n\nCompute `counts` from `diff` (prefix sum):\n`counts[0]=0`\n`counts[1]=0`\n`counts[2]=0`\n`counts[3]=diff[3]+counts[2] = 1+0 = 1` (`(x,y)=(1,2)` -> `s=3`)\n`counts[4]=diff[4]+counts[3] = 1+1 = 2` (`(x,y)=(1,3), (2,2)` -> `s=4`)\n`counts[5]=diff[5]+counts[4] = -1+2 = 1` (`(x,y)=(2,3)` -> `s=5`)\n`counts[6]=diff[6]+counts[5] = -1+1 = 0`\nSo, `counts = [0,0,0,1,2,1]` (up to index 5).\n\nNow calculate total triangles:\n`min_sum_xy = A+B = 1+2 = 3`.\n`max_sum_xy = B+C = 2+3 = 5`.\n`C=3, D=4`.\n`S_start = max(min_sum_xy, C+1) = max(3, 3+1) = max(3, 4) = 4`.\n`S_end = max_sum_xy = 5`.\n\nIterate `s` from `S_start=4` to `S_end=5`.\n\n`s=4`:\n  `s-1 = 3`. `min(D, s-1) = min(4, 3) = 3`.\n  `counts[4] * (min(D, s-1) - C + 1) = 2 * (3 - 3 + 1) = 2 * 1 = 2`.\n  Triangles: `(1,3,3), (2,2,3)`.\n\n`s=5`:\n  `s-1 = 4`. `min(D, s-1) = min(4, 4) = 4`.\n  `counts[5] * (min(D, s-1) - C + 1) = 1 * (4 - 3 + 1) = 1 * 2 = 2`.\n  Triangles: `(2,3,3), (2,3,4)`.\n\nTotal triangles = `2 + 2 = 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach seems correct and efficient enough.\n\nMaximum value for `D` is `5 * 10^5`.\nMaximum value for `B` is `5 * 10^5`.\nMaximum value for `C` is `5 * 10^5`.\nMaximum value for `B+C` is `10^6`.\nSo `diff` and `counts` arrays need to be of size `10^6 + 2`.\nThis is feasible for memory and time.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Max possible sum x+y is B+C\n    max_sum_xy = B + C\n    \n    # Use a difference array to efficiently calculate counts[s]\n    # where counts[s] is the number of pairs (x, y) such that x+y = s\n    # and A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C.\n    # The size needs to be max_sum_xy + 2 to handle indices up to max_sum_xy + 1.\n    diff = [0] * (max_sum_xy + 2)\n\n    # For each x from A to B:\n    #   y ranges from B to C.\n    #   So x+y ranges from x+B to x+C.\n    #   We want to increment counts[s] by 1 for s in [x+B, x+C].\n    #   This is a range update: add 1 to diff[x+B], subtract 1 from diff[x+C+1].\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        diff[x + B] += 1\n        diff[x + C + 1] -= 1\n    \n    # Calculate the actual counts[s] using prefix sums on diff array\n    counts = [0] * (max_sum_xy + 1)\n    current_count = 0\n    for s in range(1, max_sum_xy + 1):\n        current_count += diff[s]\n        counts[s] = current_count\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    # Iterate through possible sums s = x + y\n    # The sum s must be at least A+B (min x + min y)\n    # The sum s must be at most B+C (max x + max y)\n    # Also, for a valid triangle, z < x + y, and z >= C.\n    # So, x + y - 1 >= C, which means x + y >= C + 1.\n    \n    # The minimum sum s we need to consider is max(A+B, C+1)\n    # The maximum sum s we need to consider is B+C\n    \n    min_s_for_triangle = max(A + B, C + 1)\n    max_s_for_triangle = B + C\n\n    for s in range(min_s_for_triangle, max_s_for_triangle + 1):\n        if counts[s] == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # For a fixed s = x + y, we need to count z such that:\n        # C <= z <= D\n        # z < s (i.e., z <= s - 1)\n        \n        # So, C <= z <= min(D, s - 1)\n        \n        # The number of valid z values is max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1)\n        \n        upper_bound_z = min(D, s - 1)\n        \n        if upper_bound_z >= C:\n            num_z_for_this_s = upper_bound_z - C + 1\n            total_triangles += counts[s] * num_z_for_this_s\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_triangles) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
