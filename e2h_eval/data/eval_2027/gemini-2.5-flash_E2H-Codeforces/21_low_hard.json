The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is clear: maximize the number of chests I can open. The constraint is the parity rule: a chest with number *a<sub>i</sub>* can only be opened by a key with number *b<sub>j</sub>* if *a<sub>i</sub>* + *b<sub>j</sub>* is odd.  That immediately tells me *a<sub>i</sub>* and *b<sub>j</sub>* must have opposite parities. One has to be even, the other odd.\n\nMy first thought is to categorize everything. I'll count how many even and odd chests and keys I have: *chests_even*, *chests_odd*, *keys_even*, *keys_odd*.  Now it's a matching problem, basically. I need to figure out the best way to pair these up based on the parity rule.\n\nEven chests clearly need odd keys, and vice versa.  This feels like two independent sub-problems.  I can treat the even chests/odd keys pairing separately from the odd chests/even keys pairing.\n\nFor the even chest/odd key problem, I have *chests_even* chests and *keys_odd* keys.  Each odd key can open at most one even chest, and each even chest can be opened by at most one odd key. The limiting factor here is the smaller of the two counts: `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.  That's the maximum number of matches I can make in this category.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd chest/even key pairing, I have `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` maximum matches.  The total maximum number of opened chests is simply the sum of the maximums from these two independent pairings.  So, the solution is `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nI quickly verify this logic, ensuring that there's no overlap or conflict between the two pairings. An even chest *has* to use an odd key, and an odd chest *has* to use an even key; they are mutually exclusive. Keys and chests can't be reused between pairings.  This reinforces that the solution is sound. This solution efficiently captures the core principle of maximizing pairings under the imposed parity constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open. We are given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `j` can unlock chest `i` if and only if the sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\nThis implies two possible scenarios for a successful match:\n1. `a_i` is even and `b_j` is odd.\n2. `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is even.\n\nLet's count the number of chests and keys based on their parity:\n- `chests_even`: The count of chests with an even number `a_i`.\n- `chests_odd`: The count of chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n- `keys_even`: The count of keys with an even number `b_j`.\n- `keys_odd`: The count of keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n\nTo maximize the total number of opened chests, we need to maximize the matches for each scenario independently, as they use distinct sets of chests and keys.\n\nFor scenario 1 (even chest with odd key):\nWe have `chests_even` available even chests and `keys_odd` available odd keys. Each odd key can open at most one even chest, and each even chest can be opened by at most one odd key. The maximum number of matches we can make in this scenario is limited by the minimum of the available even chests and odd keys.\nMaximum matches for scenario 1 = `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nFor scenario 2 (odd chest with even key):\nSimilarly, we have `chests_odd` available odd chests and `keys_even` available even keys. The maximum number of matches we can make in this scenario is limited by the minimum of the available odd chests and even keys.\nMaximum matches for scenario 2 = `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince the keys and chests used in scenario 1 are completely distinct from those used in scenario 2 (an even chest cannot be opened by an even key, nor can an odd chest be opened by an odd key), these two sets of matches do not conflict. Therefore, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximum matches from these two independent scenarios.\n\nTotal maximum chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`, `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`:\n   - If `a_i` is even, increment `chests_even`.\n   - If `a_i` is odd, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`:\n   - If `b_j` is even, increment `keys_even`.\n   - If `b_j` is odd, increment `keys_odd`.\n5. Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n6. Print the result.\n\nExample Walkthrough (First Example):\n`n = 5`, `m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1. Count chest parities:\n   - `9` (odd) -> `chests_odd = 1`\n   - `14` (even) -> `chests_even = 1`\n   - `6` (even) -> `chests_even = 2`\n   - `2` (even) -> `chests_even = 3`\n   - `11` (odd) -> `chests_odd = 2`\n   So, `chests_even = 3`, `chests_odd = 2`.\n\n2. Count key parities:\n   - `8` (even) -> `keys_even = 1`\n   - `4` (even) -> `keys_even = 2`\n   - `7` (odd) -> `keys_odd = 1`\n   - `20` (even) -> `keys_even = 3`\n   So, `keys_even = 3`, `keys_odd = 1`.\n\n3. Calculate maximum matches:\n   - Matches for (even chest, odd key): `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n   - Matches for (odd chest, even key): `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n\n4. Total maximum chests = `1 + 2 = 3`.\n\nThis matches the example output. The approach is efficient as it only requires iterating through the chest and key numbers once to count parities, and then performing a constant number of arithmetic operations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # An even chest needs an odd key.\n    # An odd chest needs an even key.\n    \n    # Max matches for (even chest, odd key)\n    matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    # Max matches for (odd chest, even key)\n    matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    total_max_chests = matches_even_chest_odd_key + matches_odd_chest_even_key\n    \n    print(total_max_chests)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
