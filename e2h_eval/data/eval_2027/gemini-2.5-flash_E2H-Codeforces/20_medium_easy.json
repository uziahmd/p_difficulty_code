For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this competitive programming problem and my thought process for approaching it. I'm aiming for an efficient Python solution.**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to assign capacity values, *c<sub>s</sub>*, to binary strings of varying lengths, where the maximum size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly *f*. The *n* constraint being small (up to 15) suggests an exponential solution or a dynamic programming approach. The larger constraints on *k* and *f* limit brute-force search.\n\n**The Key Insight: Understanding the Maximum Multiset Size**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining the maximum size of the beautiful multiset given the *c<sub>s</sub>* values. This looks like a flow problem or, considering the binary prefix structure, a problem easily represented as a complete binary tree. Each node is a binary string, and the *c<sub>s</sub>* value acts as a capacity constraint.\n\nGiven *c<sub>s</sub>* for all strings *s* (of length 1 to *n*), we need to determine *f*. I see that *max_val(s)*, representing the maximum number of strings with prefix *s*, is crucial. For a string *s* of length *n*, its *max_val(s)* is simply *c<sub>s</sub>*. For a shorter string *s*, *max_val(s)* is the minimum of *c<sub>s</sub>* and the sum of its children's *max_val*.\n\n**Dynamic Programming on the Binary Tree**\n\nThe binary tree structure hints at dynamic programming. I'll define *dp[L][val]* as the number of ways to set the *c<sub>s</sub>* values for all strings that are descendants of a string of length *L*, such that the maximum value assigned to that string is *val*.\n\nThe base case is *L = n*. Here, *dp[n][val]* is 1 if *0 <= val <= k*, otherwise 0. To calculate *dp[L][val]*, the *conv_dp = dp[L+1] * dp[L+1]*. Then for values *S* of *max_val(s0) + max_val(s1)*, it's possible for a *c<sub>s</sub> < S*, *c<sub>s</sub> = val*. This needs to be handled through prefix sums (or a modified difference array) to improve the performance. This is the main part of the state calculations. The final value, *f*, is the sum of the maximum val for children of the root (0 and 1).\n\n**Optimizing for Speed: The Convolution Challenge**\n\nThe convolution step, essential for combining the possibilities from the children nodes in the binary tree, is the potential bottleneck. Directly using an *O(K^2)* convolution would be too slow. A Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for faster convolution (*O(K log K)*) seems necessary. I'm using *MOD = 998244353* which allows me to work with NTT.\n\nI'm implementing NTT with primitive root *g = 3*. I have to find the smallest power of 2 that's greater than the maximum size of the convolution result which is *2K + 1*. *K* is *2 * 10<sup>5</sup>*, so it's a bit of a computation for each level of the dynamic programming process. The *n* levels, *k*, and convolution contribute to complexity, which comes to *O(n K log K)*. I use a suffix array to deal with the sum.\n\n**Potential Pitfalls & Optimization Strategy**\n\nEven with NTT, an *O(nK log K)* solution might be slow in Python if not coded carefully. Using the `suffix_sum_conv_dp` structure is critical. The details of modular arithmetic, especially with NTT, must be implemented correctly. Python's list operations can also cause overhead.  This is a tight constraint to get correct.\n\nSo, the plan is to implement the dynamic programming approach with NTT convolution, paying close attention to modular arithmetic and array operations. I'll thoroughly test the solution with the example provided and a range of smaller test cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the number of ways to choose `c_s` for all binary strings `s` of length `1` to `n` (where `c_s` is an integer from `0` to `k`), such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset is exactly `f`. We need to output the answer modulo `998244353`.\n\n**Understanding the Maximum Beautiful Multiset Size**\n\nLet `count[t]` be the number of times a binary string `t` of length `n` appears in the multiset. The total size of the multiset is `sum(count[t])`.\nA multiset is beautiful if for every string `s` of length `1` to `n`, the sum of `count[t]` for all `t` of length `n` that have `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\nThis problem can be modeled on a full binary tree of depth `n`. Each node `s` (representing a binary string) has a capacity `c_s`. The leaves of the tree are strings of length `n`. We want to maximize the sum of values at the leaves, subject to the constraint that for any node `s`, the sum of values at leaves in its subtree does not exceed `c_s`.\n\nLet `max_val(s)` be the maximum possible sum of `count[t]` for `t` of length `n` such that `s` is a prefix of `t`.\n- For a leaf node `s` (length `n`), `max_val(s) = c_s`.\n- For an internal node `s` (length `L < n`), its children are `s0` and `s1`. The sum of counts for `s` is `max_val(s0) + max_val(s1)`. This sum must not exceed `c_s`. Thus, `max_val(s) = min(c_s, max_val(s0) + max_val(s1))`.\n\nThe problem defines `c_s` for strings `s` of length `1` to `n`. The total maximum size of the multiset is `max_val(\"0\") + max_val(\"1\")`.\n\n**Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nDue to the symmetric nature of the binary tree, the number of ways to achieve a certain `max_val` for a string `s` of a given length `L` will be the same regardless of the specific string `s`.\nLet `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` for all strings `s'` of length `L` to `n` that are descendants of a *single* string `s` of length `L-1`, and to choose `c_s` for this *single* string `s` (from `0` to `k`), such that `max_val(s)` evaluates to `val`.\nMore precisely, `dp[L][val]` is the number of ways to assign `c_x` for all `x` in the subtree rooted at a specific node of depth `L` (i.e., string of length `L`), such that the calculated `max_val` for that node is `val`.\n\n**Base Case:** `L = n`\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `max_val(s) = c_s`. Since `c_s` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, there is `1` way to achieve each `val` from `0` to `k`.\nSo, `dp[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step:** `L` from `n-1` down to `1`\nTo compute `dp[L][val]`, we consider a string `s` of length `L`. Its children are `s0` and `s1`.\n`max_val(s) = min(c_s, max_val(s0) + max_val(s1))`.\nThe choices for `c_s'` in `s0`'s subtree are independent of `s1`'s subtree.\nThe number of ways to get `max_val(s0) = val0` is `dp[L+1][val0]`.\nThe number of ways to get `max_val(s1) = val1` is `dp[L+1][val1]`.\nLet `S = val0 + val1`. The number of ways to get `max_val(s0) + max_val(s1) = S` is `sum(dp[L+1][val0] * dp[L+1][S - val0])` over valid `val0`. This is the `S`-th coefficient of the convolution of `dp[L+1]` with itself.\nLet `conv_dp[S]` denote this sum.\n\nNow, for a fixed `S` (with `conv_dp[S]` ways), we choose `c_s` from `0` to `k`.\n1. If we choose `c_s = x` where `x < S`: Then `max_val(s) = x`. This applies for `x` in `[0, min(S-1, k)]`. For each such `x`, `dp[L][x]` increases by `conv_dp[S]`.\n2. If we choose `c_s = x` where `x >= S`: Then `max_val(s) = S`. This applies for `x` in `[S, k]`. There are `k - S + 1` such choices for `x` (assuming `S <= k`). So, `dp[L][S]` increases by `conv_dp[S] * (k - S + 1)`.\n\nCombining these observations:\n`dp[L][val] = (sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} conv_dp[S]) + (conv_dp[val] * (k - val + 1))`\nThis formula holds for `0 <= val <= k`.\nThe `sum_{S=val+1}^{2k} conv_dp[S]` is a suffix sum. Let `suffix_sum_conv_dp[x] = sum_{j=x}^{2k} conv_dp[j]`.\nThen `dp[L][val] = (suffix_sum_conv_dp[val+1] + conv_dp[val] * (k - val + 1)) % MOD`.\n(Note: `conv_dp[val]` and `suffix_sum_conv_dp[val+1]` should be `0` if `val` or `val+1` are out of bounds of `conv_dp` or `suffix_sum_conv_dp` respectively. The maximum index for `conv_dp` is `2k`.)\n\n**Final Step:**\nAfter iterating down to `L=1`, `dp[1]` stores the number of ways to choose `c_s` for a single string `s` of length `1` (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\") and its descendants, such that `max_val(s)` is `val`.\nThe total maximum multiset size `F_total = max_val(\"0\") + max_val(\"1\")`. We need `F_total = f`.\nThis is again a convolution: `sum(dp[1][val0] * dp[1][f - val0])` for `0 <= val0 <= f`.\nThis is the `f`-th coefficient of the convolution of `dp[1]` with itself.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n- The maximum value for `val` is `k`. The arrays `dp[L]` have size `k+1`.\n- The maximum sum `S = val0 + val1` is `2k`. The convolution `conv_dp` has length up to `2k+1`.\n- Each step `L` to `L-1` involves:\n    1. Convolution using NTT: `O(K' log K')`, where `K'` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `2k`. For `k=2e5`, `2k=4e5`, `K'=524288`.\n    2. Calculating suffix sums: `O(K')`.\n    3. Calculating `dp[L]`: `O(k)`.\n- There are `n-1` such steps.\n- The final convolution is also `O(K' log K')`.\nTotal complexity: `O(n * K' log K')`.\nWith `n=15`, `k=2e5`, `K'=524288`, `log K' = 19`, this is roughly `15 * 524288 * 19` which is about `1.49 * 10^8`. This is borderline for Python but feasible given typical competitive programming time limits for Python.\n\n**Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) Details:**\n- Modulo: `MOD = 998244353` (a prime number).\n- Primitive root: `g = 3`.\n- The length `N` for NTT must be a power of 2 and `N` must divide `MOD - 1`. `MOD - 1 = 998244352 = 2^23 * 7 * 17`.\nThe chosen `N = 524288 = 2^19` satisfies these conditions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Constants for NTT\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Function to perform Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\n# If invert is True, performs inverse NTT\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    \n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    # Iterative NTT\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        # Calculate the root of unity for this level\n        w_len = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD -
