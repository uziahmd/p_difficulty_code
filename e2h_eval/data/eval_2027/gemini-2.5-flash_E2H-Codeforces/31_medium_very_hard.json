Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for Vanya and Cards**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The goal is to figure out the fewest cards I need to add to my existing pile to make the total sum zero. I need to be efficient about this.\n\nFirst, I'm analyzing the constraints: I've got a limited number of found cards (`n`), a maximum absolute value (`x`) for any card, and the numbers on the cards are integers within a certain range. The problem gives me the numbers on the initial `n` cards. My primary aim is to minimize the new cards I'll need.\n\nThe plan is to calculate the current sum (`S`) of the cards I already have. Then, to reach a target sum of zero, I have to add cards that sum up to `-S`. To be efficient, I want the fewest new cards, which means I'll be using cards with the largest possible absolute value, which is `x`.\n\nIf `S` is already zero, I'm done – no additional cards are necessary. If `S` isn't zero, I'm adding `x` or `-x` cards to cover `-S`. If `S` is positive, I'm adding cards with `-x` until the sum reaches 0. If `S` is negative, I'm adding `x` cards. It boils down to calculating `ceil(abs(S) / x)`.\n\nI validated this strategy with some example cases, ensuring the logic holds up. I found that I can optimize it by calculating `ceil(abs(S) / x)` efficiently using integer division. I've covered various edge cases: from zero sums to large numbers. No matter the initial cards and the maximum value, the core logic should work.\n\nThe final Python script will read `n` and `x`, read the cards, sum them up, and then calculate the number of new cards needed based on this formula. I'm using integer division for efficiency and simplicity. I'm also using `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` for potentially faster I/O in competitive programming.\n\nNow I'm confident my solution covers all cases and is efficient.\n",
