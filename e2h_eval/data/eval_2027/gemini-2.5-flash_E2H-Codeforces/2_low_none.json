Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Crafting the X-Pattern Checker: My Thinking Process**\n\nOkay, so I need to build a Python script to validate if an input grid forms this specific \"X\" pattern.  I'm given the dimensions, *n*, and it's guaranteed to be odd and at least 3, and less than 300, which is good.  This means there's always going to be a non-diagonal cell to check.\n\nThe rules are pretty clear: identical characters on *both* diagonals, a *different* character everywhere else, and those non-diagonal characters must also be identical to each other. I'll represent the grid as a 2D structure, probably a list of strings, since inputting strings is easy.  `grid[row][col]` will be the way I'll access the characters.\n\nI know I have to identify the diagonal cells. That's straightforward: a cell is on the main diagonal if `row == col`, and on the anti-diagonal if `row + col == n - 1`. Either diagonal means `row == col` OR `row + col == n - 1`.\n\nThe algorithm is starting to take shape. I'll read *n*, read in the grid, and I'll need two variables: `diag_char` and `other_char`. I'm thinking the best way to initialize these is to grab the first diagonal element, `grid[0][0]`, as the `diag_char`. Then, I can safely grab any cell that's not on a diagonal as the `other_char`.  Since *n* is at least 3, `grid[0][1]` is guaranteed to be a non-diagonal.\n\nThe crucial optimization, to handle that third rule (different characters) up front: I'll immediately compare `diag_char` and `other_char` after initialization. If they are the same, I can just output \"NO\" immediately and bail, saving me from doing all the other checks.\n\nNow, for the main validation loop: I'll iterate through every cell in the grid. For each cell, I'll check if it's on a diagonal. If it *is* on a diagonal, the character *must* match `diag_char`. If it's *not* on a diagonal, the character *must* match `other_char`. If I find any mismatch, I print \"NO\" and stop.\n\nIf I get all the way through the loops without finding any violations, then I know it's a valid \"X\" and I can print \"YES.\" I believe this will be both efficient and clear in its logic. I'll try to keep the code readable and easy to follow.  The revised algorithm is even better, making sure I grab a good initial non-diagonal character and get started right away.\n",
