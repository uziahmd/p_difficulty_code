String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on Counting Beautiful Strings**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to count these \"beautiful strings\".  A beautiful string is defined by a few key constraints, which boil down to the numbers of zeros and ones, and then a somewhat complex modification rule that dictates the final single character after repeated operations. I need to count the *number* of beautiful strings modulo 1000000007.\n\nMy immediate thought is to dissect the modification rule. It seems like it's the core challenge. I've broken down the operation into steps. We are given a string `s`, which is `s'` appended by two characters, `c1` and `c2`.  The operation replaces the last two characters with a new character `c_new`, based on the values of `c1` and `c2`. This process continues until we're left with a single character.\n\nNow, I'm trying to figure out the logic of this modification. I've realized that I need to represent the problem with some logic. So I've mapped out the cases. If both characters are '0', the result is '1'. Otherwise, it's '0'. If I look at the cases as `f(c1, c2)` I get `f(0, 0) = 1`, and `f(0, 1) = 0`, `f(1, 0) = 0`, and `f(1, 1) = 0`. This is where I start to think that this may have some logic equivalent to XOR. It isn't, but it has some similarities.\n\nI've struggled to formulate a concise mathematical expression for this, but I've realized that the parity of the number of '1's in the string is critical. Let's call `N1` the number of '1's. When we apply the modification, we have the following.\n- `00 -> 1`: `N1` increases by 1.\n- `01 -> 0`: `N1` remains the same.\n- `10 -> 0`: `N1` remains the same.\n- `11 -> 0`: `N1` decreases by 2.\n\nThe key observation here is that the final result depends on how many zeros are at the end, as well as the initial number of ones. I need to consider all the possibilities that will result in the single character `g`, which I'm assuming for now is fixed to 0. It's the only value that the instructions mention, which probably means it's implied. I should check the code for that just to be sure.\n\nThis suggests a combinatorial approach.  I need to figure out how many strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones can be transformed into the single character `g` using this operation. I'm going to consider how to use this XOR approach within a combinatorial way to solve this. I may need to write a recurrence relation. Let's start by exploring how I can express the operation as `f(c1,c2)`. This might help simplify the counting. This is where I begin to have an idea of using dynamic programming.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones such that after repeatedly applying a specific modification operation, the final single character is `g`. The modification operation replaces the last two characters `c1c2` with a single character: `1` if `c1c2` is `00`, and `0` otherwise (`01`, `10`, `11`).\n\nLet's analyze the effect of the operation on the string. This operation effectively processes characters from right to left.\nConsider the state of the string as a single value `v` that the last character would become if we processed all characters from right to left.\nLet `s = s_k s_{k-1} ... s_1 s_0`.\nThe operation replaces `s_1 s_0` with `v_0 = f(s_1, s_0)`.\nThen `s_2 v_0` is replaced with `v_1 = f(s_2, v_0)`.\nThis continues until we have `v_{k-1} = f(s_k, v_{k-2})`.\nThe final character is `v_{k-1}`.\n\nLet's define the operation `f(x, y)`:\n`f(0, 0) = 1`\n`f(0, 1) = 0`\n`f(1, 0) = 0`\n`f(1, 1) = 0`\n\nThis function can be written as `f(x, y) = (1-x) * (1-y)`.\nLet's trace the final character for a string `s_L s_{L-1} ... s_1 s_0`.\nThe final character is `s_L \\oplus s_{L-1} \\oplus ... \\oplus s_0` if `f(x,y)` was `x XOR y`. But it's not.\n\nLet's denote the value of the string `S` after reduction as `V(S)`.\n`V(s_0) = s_0`\n`V(s_1 s_0) = f(s_1, s_0)`\n`V(s_2 s_1 s_0) = f(s_2, f(s_1, s_0))`\nIn general, `V(s_k ... s_0) = f(s_k, V(s_{k-1} ... s_0))`.\n\nLet's test this with some examples:\n`V(\"00\") = f(0,0) = 1`\n`V(\"000\") = f(0, f(0,0)) = f(0,1) = 0`\n`V(\"0000\") = f(0, f(0, f(0,0))) = f(0, f(0,1)) = f(0,0) = 1`\n`V(\"00000\") = f(0, V(\"0000\")) = f(0,1) = 0`\nIt appears that `V(\"0\" * k)` is `1` if `k` is even and `k >= 2`, and `0` if `k` is odd.\nFor `k=1`, `V(\"0\") = 0`.\nThis can be summarized as `V(\"0\"*k) = (k % 2 == 0 && k >= 2) ? 1 : 0`.\n\nNow consider strings with '1's.\n`V(\"01\") = f(0,1) = 0`\n`V(\"10\") = f(1,0) = 0`\n`V(\"11\") = f(1,1) = 0`\n`V(\"001\") = f(0, f(0,1)) = f(0,0) = 1`\n`V(\"010\") = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,0) = 1`\n`V(\"100\") = f(1, f(0,0)) = f(1,1) = 0`\n`V(\"101\") = f(1, f(0,1)) = f(1,0) = 0`\n`V(\"110\") = f(1, f(1,0)) = f(1,0) = 0`\n`V(\"111\") = f(1, f(1,1)) = f(1,0) = 0`\n\nNotice that `f(1, x) = 0` for any `x`. This means if a '1' appears anywhere except possibly the last character, and it's not the first character, it will eventually cause the result to be 0 for the suffix to its right. More precisely, if `s_k=1`, then `V(s_k ... s_0) = f(1, V(s_{k-1} ... s_0)) = 0`.\nThis implies that if any character `s_i` is '1' for `i >= 1`, the final result is 0.\nThe only way to get a non-zero result is if all characters `s_i` for `i >= 1` are '0'.\nSo, for the final character to be 1, the string must be of the form `00...0s_0`.\nLet's verify this. If `s_i=1` for some `i >= 1`.\nLet `i_0` be the largest index such that `s_{i_0}=1`.\nThe string is `s_L ... s_{i_0+1} 1 s_{i_0-1} ... s_0`.\nThe suffix `V(s_{i_0-1} ... s_0)` will be some value `v`.\nThen we compute `f(1, v) = 0`.\nThen `f(s_{i_0+1}, 0)`.\nIf `s_{i_0+1}` is '0', `f(0,0)=1`.\nIf `s_{i_0+1}` is '1', `f(1,0)=0`.\nThis seems to propagate.\n\nLet's re-examine `f(x,y) = (1-x)(1-y)`.\n`V(s_k ... s_0) = (1-s_k) * V(s_{k-1} ... s_0)`.\nThis is wrong. The `V` on the right side is not `s_{k-1}`.\nLet `s = s_L s_{L-1} ... s_0`.\n`val_0 = s_0`\n`val_1 = f(s_1, val_0)`\n`val_2 = f(s_2, val_1)`\n...\n`val_L = f(s_L, val_{L-1})`\n\nConsider the effect of a '1' at index `i` (0-indexed from right).\nIf `s_i = 1`, then `val_i = f(s_i, val_{i-1}) = f(1, val_{i-1}) = 0`.\nOnce `val_i` becomes 0, then for any `j > i`:\n`val_j = f(s_j, val_{j-1})`. If `val_{j-1}` is 0, then `val_j` becomes `f(s_j, 0)`.\n`f(0,0)=1`, `f(1,0)=0`.\nSo if `val_{i-1}` becomes 0 due to `s_i=1`, then `val_i` becomes 0.\nThen `val_{i+1}` becomes `f(s_{i+1}, 0)`.\nIf `s_{i+1}=0`, `val_{i+1}=1`.\nIf `s_{i+1}=1`, `val_{i+1}=0`.\nThen `val_{i+2}` becomes `f(s_{i+2}, val_{i+1})`.\nThis means that a '1' at `s_i` for `i > 0` doesn't necessarily make the final result 0. It just makes `val_i = 0`.\nThe final value depends on `s_L s_{L-1} ... s_0`.\n\nLet's define `reduce(S)` as the final character.\n`reduce(S)` is `1` if and only if `S` is of the form `0...0` and `len(S)` is even and `len(S) >= 2`.\nOtherwise, `reduce(S)` is `0`.\n\nProof:\nBase cases:\n`reduce(\"0\") = 0`\n`reduce(\"1\") = 1` (This is wrong, `g` is the final character, not `s_0`. If `len(S)=1`, the operation is forbidden, so the character itself is the result).\nSo `V(s_0) = s_0`.\n`V(\"0\") = 0`.\n`V(\"1\") = 1`.\n\nNow let's re-evaluate the function `f(x,y)` to be `(1-x) AND (1-y)`.\nLet `s = s_k s_{k-1} ... s_0`.\n`res = s_0`\nFor `i = 1` to `k`: `res = (1-s_i) AND (1-res)`\nThis is equivalent to `res = NOT(s_i OR res)`.\n\nLet `res_i` be the result after processing `s_i ... s_0`.\n`res_0 = s_0`\n`res_i = NOT(s_i OR res_{i-1})` for `i > 0`.\n\nIf `s_i = 1` for any `i > 0`:\n`res_i = NOT(1 OR res_{i-1}) = NOT(1) = 0`.\nOnce `res_i` becomes 0, then for any `j > i`:\n`res_j = NOT(s_j OR res_{j-1})`.\nIf `res_{j-1}` is 0, `res_j = NOT(s_j OR 0) = NOT(s_j)`.\nSo if there is a '1' at index `i > 0`, then `res_i = 0`.\nThen `res_{i+1} = NOT(s_{i+1})`.\nThen `res_{i+2} = NOT(s_{i+2} OR NOT(s_{i+1}))`.\n`res_{i+3} = NOT(s_{i+3} OR NOT(s_{i+2} OR NOT(s_{i+1})))`.\n\nThis is `s_0` if `k=0`.\nIf `k > 0`: `res_k = NOT(s_k OR NOT(s_{k-1} OR NOT(... OR NOT(s_1 OR s_0)...)))`.\nThis expression is `1` if and only if all `s_j` are `0` and `k` is even.\nLet's test this.\nIf all `s_j = 0`:\n`res_0 = 0`\n`res_1 = NOT(0 OR 0) = 1`\n`res_2 = NOT(0 OR 1) = 0`\n`res_3 = NOT(0 OR 0) = 1`\n`res_k = 1` if `k` is odd.\n`res_k = 0` if `k` is even.\nThis contradicts my earlier finding `V(\"0\"*k) = (k % 2 == 0 && k >= 2) ? 1 : 0`.\nThe definition of `f(x,y)` implies `V(s_k...s_0) = f(s_k, f(s_{k-1}, ... f(s_1, s_0)...))`.\nThis is exactly `res_k`.\nMy `V(\"0\"*k)` derivation must have been wrong.\n`V(\"0\") = 0`\n`V(\"00\") = f(0,0) = 1` (k=1, index 0,1)\n`V(\"000\") = f(0, f(0,0)) = f(0,1) = 0` (k=2, index 0,1,2)\n`V(\"0000\") = f(0, f(0, f(0,0))) = f(0, f(0,1)) = f(0,0) = 1` (k=3, index 0,1,2,3)\nThe pattern for `V(\"0\"*L)` where `L` is length:\n`L=1`: `V(\"0\") = 0`\n`L=2`: `V(\"00\") = 1`\n`L=3`: `V(\"000\") = 0`\n`L=4`: `V(\"0000\") = 1`\nSo `V(\"0\"*L)` is `1` if `L` is even and `L >= 2`, else `0`.\nThis matches `res_k = 1` if `k` is odd (meaning length `k+1` is even).\nSo the length `L` is `k+1`.\n`res_k = 1` if `k` is odd, which means `L` is even.\n`res_k = 0` if `k` is even, which means `L` is odd.\nThis is correct.\n\nNow consider strings with '1's.\nIf there is a '1' at `s_0` (the rightmost character):\n`res_0 = 1`.\n`res_1 = NOT(s_1 OR 1) = 0`.\n`res_2 = NOT(s_2 OR 0) = NOT(s_2)`.\n`res_3 = NOT(s_3 OR NOT(s_2))`.\n`res_4 = NOT(s_4 OR NOT(s_3 OR NOT(s_2)))`.\nThis sequence `NOT(X)`, `NOT(Y OR NOT(X))`, `NOT(Z OR NOT(Y OR NOT(X)))` is more complex.\nIt is `1` if the number of `0`s to the left of the rightmost `1` is even.\nLet `k` be the number of characters to the left of `s_0`.\nIf `s_0 = 1`:\n`res_0 = 1`.\n`res_1 = NOT(s_1 OR 1) = 0`.\n`res_2 = NOT(s_2 OR 0) = NOT(s_2)`.\n`res_3 = NOT(s_3 OR NOT(s_2))`.\n`res_4 = NOT(s_4 OR NOT(s_3 OR NOT(s_2)))`.\nThis is `0` if `s_1 = 1`.\nThis is `1` if `s_1 = 0, s_2 = 0, s_3 = 0, ...` and `k` is even.\nLet `S = s_k s_{k-1} ... s_1 1`. The first '1' is at `s_0`.\n`res_0 = 1`.\n`res_1 = NOT(s_1 OR 1) = 0`.\n`res_2 = NOT(s_2 OR 0) = NOT(s_2)`.\n`res_3 = NOT(s_3 OR NOT(s_2))`.\n`res_j = NOT(s_j OR res_{j-1})`.\nThe result `res_k` is `0` if `s_1=1`.\nIf `s_1=0`, `res_1=0`. `res_2=NOT(s_2)`. `res_3=NOT(s_3 OR NOT(s_2))`.\nThis is `0` if `m >= 1` and `g=1`. This is `0` if `m >= 1` and `g=1`.\n\nLet's simplify the final character logic:\nThe final character is `g`.\nThe string has `n` zeros and `m` ones. Total length `L = n+m`.\n\nCase 1: `g = 1`\nThe only way to get a '1' is if the string consists of only '0's, and its length `L` is even and `L >= 2`.\nIf `m > 0`, the string contains at least one '1'.\nIf `s_0 = 1`, then `res_0 = 1`. `res_1 = NOT(s_1 OR 1) = 0`. So the final result is `0` unless `L=1`. If `L=1`, then `s_0=1`, and the result is `1`. This means `n=0, m=1`.\nIf `s_0 = 0`, and `s_i = 1` for some `i > 0`. Let `i_0` be the smallest index `>0` where `s_{i_0}=1`.\nThen `s_{i_0-1} ... s_0` are all '0's.\n`res_{i_0-1}` is `1` if `i_0-1` is odd (i.e. `i_0` is even).\n`res_{i_0-1}` is `0` if `i_0-1` is even (i.e. `i_0` is odd).\nThen `res_{i_0} = NOT(s_{i_0} OR res_{i_0-1}) = NOT(1 OR res_{i_0-1}) = 0`.\nOnce it becomes `0` at `res_{i_0}`, then for `j > i_0`:\n`res_j = NOT(s_j OR res_{j-1})`.\nIf `res_{j-1}=0`, then `res_j = NOT(s_j)`.\nSo, if `s_i=1` for some `i > 0`, then `res_i` becomes `0`.\nThen `res_{i+1}` becomes `NOT(s_{i+1})`.\n`res_{i+2}` becomes `NOT(s_{i+2} OR NOT(s_{i+1}))`.\nThis is `0` if `s_{i+1}=1`. `1` if `s_{i+1}=0, s_{i+2}=0`.\nThis is `0` if `m >= 1` and `g=1`.\nThis means if `m >= 1`, the final result can never be `1`, unless `L=1` and `s_0=1`.\nSo if `m > 0` and `g=1`:\n    If `n=0, m=1`, string is \"1\", result is 1. Count = 1.\n    Otherwise, result is 0. Count = 0.\nIf `m = 0` and `g=1`:\n    String is \"0\"*n.\n    If `n=0`, string is empty, not allowed (`n+m >= 1`).\n    If `n=1`, string is \"0\", result is 0.\n    If `n >= 2` and `n` is even, result is 1. Count = 1 (for \"0\"*n).\n    If `n >= 2` and `n` is odd, result is 0. Count = 0.\n\nSummary for `g=1`:\n- If `n=0, m=1`: Answer is 1. (String \"1\")\n- If `m=0` and `n` is even and `n >= 2`: Answer is 1. (String \"0\"*n)\n- Otherwise: Answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: `g = 0`\nWe need strings that result in `0`.\nThis is all other strings not covered in `g=1`.\nTotal number of strings is `C(n+m, n)`.\nLet `A_1` be the count for `g=1`.\nLet `A_0` be the count for `g=0`.\n`A_0 = C(n+m, n) - A_1`.\n\nLet's compute `A_1` based on the conditions above:\n`A_1 = 0`.\nIf `n=0` and `m=1`: `A_1 = 1`.\nIf `m=0` and `n >= 2` and `n % 2 == 0`: `A_1 = 1`.\n\nSo for `g=0`:\n`ans = C(n+m, n)`.\nIf `n=0` and `m=1`: `ans -= 1`.\nIf `m=0` and `n >= 2` and `n % 2 == 0`: `ans -= 1`.\n\nNeed to implement combinations `C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!) mod P`.\n`P = 1000000007`.\nPrecompute factorials and inverse factorials.\n\nConstraints: `0 <= n, m <= 10^5`, `n+m >= 1`.\n\nEdge cases:\n`n=0, m=0, g=0`: Not allowed (`n+m >= 1`).\n`n=0, m=0, g=1`: Not allowed (`n+m >= 1`).\n\nExample 1: `n=1, m=1, g=0`\n`L = 2`. `C(2,1) = 2`.\n`A_1` conditions:\n`n=0, m=1`: false\n`m=0, n>=2, n%2==0`: false\nSo `A_1 = 0`.\n`A_0 = C(2,1) - 0 = 2`.

This implies `m=1`. `n` must be even.\n   This means if `m=1`, and the string is of the form `0^n 1`, then the result is `1` if `n` is even.\n   The total length is `n+1`.\n\nLet's test these three conditions.\n`V(\"0\") = 0`\n`V(\"1\") = 1` (case 1: `n=0, m=1`)\n`V(\"00\") = 1` (case 2: `n=2, m=0`)\n`V(\"01\") = 0`\n`V(\"10\") = 0`\n`V(\"11\") = 0`\n`V(\"000\") = 0`\n`V(\"001\") = 1` (case 3: `n=2, m=1`)\n`V(\"010\") = 1`\n`V(\"100\") = 0`\n`V(\"101\") = 0`\n`V(\"110\") = 0`\n`V(\"111\") = 0`\n`V(\"0000\") = 1` (case 2: `n=4, m=0`)\n`V(\"0001\") = 0`\n`V(\"0010\") = 0`\n`V(\"0011\") = 0`\n`V(\"0100\") = 1`\n`V(\"0101\") = 0`\n`V(\"0110\") = 0`\n`V(\"0111\") = 0`\n`V(\"1000\") = 0`\n`V(\"1001\") = 0`\n`V(\"1010\") = 0`\n`V(\"1011\") = 0`\n`V(\"1100\") = 0`\n`V(\"1101\") = 0`\n`V(\"1110\") = 0`\n`V(\"1111\") = 0`\n\nIt appears that the only strings that result in `1` are:\n- `1` (`n=0, m=1`)\n- `00...0` (`n` zeros, `m=0`, `n` even, `n >= 2`)\n- `00...01` (`n` zeros followed by `1`, `m=1`, `n` even, `n >= 0`). This covers `1` itself if `n=0`.\n  So `0^n 1` where `n` is even and `m=1`.\n\nThis means for `g=1`, the strings are:\n1. `0^n` (all zeros): `m=0`, `n` is even and `n >= 2`. (e.g. \"00\", \"0000\")\n2. `0^k 1` (a '1' at the end, `k` zeros before it): `m=1`, `k` is even. (e.g. \"1\", \"001\", \"00001\")\nAre there any other strings that result in 1?\nConsider `S = S' c_1 c_0`. `V(S) = NOT(S's_0 OR V(S's_1))`.\nNo, `V(S_k ... S_0) = NOT(S_k OR V(S_{k-1} ... S_0))`.\nLet `s_p` be the rightmost '1'.\n`S = s_L ... s_{p+1} 1 0...0` (`p` zeros after `1`).\n`V(0...0)` (p zeros) is `0` if `p` is odd, `1` if `p` is even and `p >= 2`.\n`V(1 0...0)`: `res_p = V(0...0)`.\n`res_{p+1} = NOT(1 OR res_p) = 0`.\nSo if there is a '1' not at the rightmost position (`s_0`), and not the only '1' in the string, then it will turn `res_{p+1}` to `0`.\nAnd then this `0` propagates as `NOT(s_j)` or `NOT(s_j OR 0)`.\n`res_{p+2} = NOT(s_{p+2} OR 0) = NOT(s_{p+2})`.\n`res_{p+3} = NOT(s_{p+3} OR NOT(s_{p+2}))`.\nThis is exactly the same pattern as `0^k 1` if `s_{p+1}` is treated as `s_1` and `s_{p+2}` as `s_2` etc.\nSo the value of the string is `1` if and only if the last `m` characters are `1` and the `n` zeros are all before the first `1`, and the number of `0`s before the first `1` is even.\nThis means string must be `0...01...1`.\n`0^k 1^m`.\nIf `m > 1`:\n`V(0^k 1^m) = V(0^k 1^{m-1} 1) = NOT(1 OR V(0^k 1^{m-1})) = 0`.\nSo if `m > 1`, the result is always `0`.\nThis is a key observation!\nIf `m > 1`, the result is `0`.\nIf `m = 1`:\n  The string contains exactly one '1'. Let it be at index `k` from the right.\n  `S = s_L ... s_{k+1} 1 s_{k-1} ... s_0`.\n  If `k > 0`, then `s_{k-1} ... s_0` are all '0's.\n  `V(s_{k-1} ... s_0)` (which is `0^k`) is `1` if `k` is even (`k>=2`), `0` if `k` is odd (`k>=1`).\n  Then `V(1 s_{k-1} ... s_0) = NOT(1 OR V(s_{k-1} ... s_0)) = 0`.\n  So if `m=1` and the '1' is not at `s_0` (i.e., `k > 0`), the result is `0`.\n  This means if `m=1`, the only way to get a non-zero result is if the '1' is at `s_0`.\n  So string must be `0^n 1`.\n  For `0^n 1`: result is `1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd. (This covers \"1\" when `n=0`)\nIf `m = 0`:\n  String is `0^n`.\n  Result is `1` if `n` is even and `n >= 2`, `0` otherwise (`n=1` or `n` odd).\n\nFinal simplified conditions for `g=1`:\n1. `m=0`: String is `0^n`. Result is `1` if `n` is even and `n >= 2`.\n2. `m=1`: String is `0^n 1`. Result is `1` if `n` is even. (This string has `n` zeros and `1` one).\n3. `m > 1`: Result is always `0`.\n\nLet's re-verify this with examples.\nExample 1: `n=1, m=1, g=0`\n  `m=1`. String must be `0^1 1` = \"01\". `n=1` is odd. So `01` results in `0`.\n  Total strings `C(2,1) = 2` (\"01\", \"10\").\n  Strings resulting in `1`: none. So `A_1=0`.\n  `A_0 = C(2,1) - 0 = 2`. Correct.\n\nExample 2: `n=2, m=2, g=0`\n  `m=2 > 1`. So `A_1 = 0`.\n  `A_0 = C(4,2) - 0 = 6`. Example output is 4. Still wrong.\n\nMy reasoning `V(0^k 1^m) = NOT(1 OR V(0^k 1^{m-1})) = 0` for `m > 1` must be wrong.\n`V(s_L ... s_0) = f(s_L, f(s_{L-1}, ... f(s_1, s_0)...))`.\nLet's use `f(x,y) = (1-x)(1-y)`.\n`V(s_L ... s_0) = (1-s_L)(1-V(s_{L-1} ... s_0))`.\nThis is `1` if `s_L=0` AND `V(s_{L-1} ... s_0)=0`.\nThis is `0` if `s_L=1` OR `V(s_{L-1} ... s_0)=1`.\n\nLet `S` be a string. Let `N_0(S)` be the number of zeros and `N_1(S)` be the number of ones.\nIf `N_1(S)` is odd, then the final result is `1`.\nIf `N_1(S)` is even, then the final result is `0`.\nThis rule is for `f(x,y) = x XOR y`. This is not `f(x,y) = (1-x)(1-y)`.\n\nLet's trace the parity of 1s in the string.\n`00 -> 1` (N1 increases by 1)\n`01 -> 0` (N1 stays same)\n`10 -> 0` (N1 stays same)\n`11 -> 0` (N1 decreases by 2)\nThe parity of `N_1` changes only for `00 -> 1`.\nIf the string is `s'00`, it becomes `s'1`. `N_1` changes parity.\nIf the string is `s'01`, it becomes `s'0`. `N_1` stays same.\nIf the string is `s'10`, it becomes `s'0`. `N_1` stays same.\nIf the string is `s'11`, it becomes `s'0`. `N_1` stays same.\n\nThis implies that the parity of the count of '1's in the string is preserved *unless* the last two characters are `00`.\nIf we end up with a single character, its value is `g`.\nIf `g=0`, then `N_1` in the final string is `0`.\nIf `g=1`, then `N_1` in the final string is `1`.\n\nLet `P(S)` be the parity of '1's in string `S`.\n`P(S'00) = P(S')`. `P(S'1) = P(S') XOR 1`. So `P(S'00)` becomes `P(S'1)`. Parity changes.\n`P(S'01) = P(S') XOR 1`. `P(S'0) = P(S')`. Parity changes.\n`P(S'10) = P(S') XOR 1`. `P(S'0) = P(S')`. Parity changes.\n`P(S'11) = P(S')`. `P(S'0) = P(S')`. Parity stays same.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's use the definition of `f(x,y) = (1-x)(1-y)` again.\n`V(s_L ... s_0) = (1-s_L) * (1-V(s_{L-1} ... s_0))`. This is `1` iff `s_L=0` and `V(s_{L-1} ... s_0)=0`.\nThis can be computed recursively.\n`V(S) = (1-s_L) * (1-V(S'))` where `S = s_L S'`.\nThis means `V(S)` is `1` iff `s_L=0` and `V(S')=0`.\nAnd `V(S)` is `0` if `s_L=1` or `V(S')=1`.\n\nLet `L` be the length of the string.\nBase cases:\n`V(\"0\") = 0`\n`V(\"1\") = 1`\n\nFor `L >= 2`:\n`V(s_L ... s_0) = 1` iff `s_L=0` AND `V(s_{L-1} ... s_0)=0`.\n`V(s_L ... s_0) = 0` iff `s_L=1` OR `V(s_{L-1} ... s_0)=1`.\n\nLet's find strings that result in `1`.\n1. `V(\"1\") = 1`. This is `n=0, m=1`.\n2. `V(\"00\") = 1`. This is `s_1=0, V(s_0)=V(\"0\")=0`. So `n=2, m=0`.\n3. `V(\"001\") = 1`. This is `s_2=0, V(\"01\")=0`. `V(\"01\")` is `s_1=0, V(\"1\")=1`. So `V(\"01\")=0`. So `V(\"001\")=1`. This is `n=2, m=1`.\n4. `V(\"010\") = 1`. This is `s_2=0, V(\"10\")=0`. `V(\"10\")` is `s_1=1, V(\"0\")=0`. So `V(\"10\")=0`. So `V(\"010\")=1`. This is `n=1, m=2`.\n\nThis is what I was missing. The string `010` (n=1, m=2) results in 1.\nMy earlier deductions about `m>1` resulting in `0` were based on a flawed recursive formula.\nThe correct recursive formula is `V(s_L ... s_0) = f(s_L, V(s_{L-1} ... s_0))`.\nThis is exactly `res_k = NOT(s_k OR res_{k-1})`.\n\nLet's use `res_k = NOT(s_k OR res_{k-1})`.\nStrings that result in `1`:\n`res_k = 1` means `s_k=0` AND `res_{k-1}=0`.\n`res_{k-1}=0` means `s_{k-1}=1` OR `res_{k-2}=1`.\n\nSo `res_k = 1` iff `s_k=0` AND (`s_{k-1}=1` OR `res_{k-2}=1`).\nThis means the string must start with `0`.\nIf `s_L=0`: `res_L = 1` iff `res_{L-1}=0`.\nIf `s_L=1`: `res_L = 0`.\nSo, for the final result to be `1`, the string must start with `0`. (Unless length is 1, `s_0=1` gives 1).\n\nIf `L=1`:\n`V(\"0\") = 0`\n`V(\"1\") = 1` (This is `n=0, m=1`).\n\nIf `L >= 2`:\n`V(s_L ... s_0) = 1` requires `s_L = 0`.\nAnd `V(s_{L-1} ... s_0) = 0`.\nSo if `s_L = 0`, we need `V(s_{L-1} ... s_0) = 0`.\nThis means `s_{L-1}=1` OR `V(s_{L-2} ... s_0)=1`.\n\nLet's list all strings that result in `1` for small `n, m`:\n`n=0, m=1`: \"1\" -> 1.

All other `A_0(n,m)=0` if `n+m=1`.\n\nFor `n+m >= 2`:\n`A_1(n,m)`:\n  Strings must start with `0`. So we need `n >= 1`.\n  The rest of the string `S'` has `n-1` zeros and `m` ones, and `V(S')=0`.\n  So `A_1(n,m) = A_0(n-1, m)` (if `n >= 1`).\n`A_0(n,m)`:\n  Strings can start with `1`: `m >= 1`. The rest `S'` has `n` zeros and `m-1` ones.\n    `V(1S') = 0`. So this contributes `C(n+m-1, n)` strings.\n  Strings can start with `0`: `n >= 1`. The rest `S'` has `n-1` zeros and `m` ones.\n    We need `V(S')=1`. This contributes `A_1(n-1, m)` strings.\n  So `A_0(n,m) = C(n+m-1, n) + A_1(n-1, m)` (if `m >= 1` for first term, `n >= 1` for second term).\n\nLet `N = n+m`.\n`A_1(n,m)`:\n  If `n=0, m=1`: `1`.\n  If `n=0, m!=1`: `0`.\n  If `n>=1`: `A_0(n-1, m)`.\n`A_0(n,m)`:\n  If `n=1, m=0`: `1`.\n  If `n!=1, m=0`: `0`.\n  If `m>=1`: `C(N-1, n)` (strings starting with '1').\n  If `n>=1`: `A_1(n-1, m)` (strings starting with '0' and `V(S')=1`).\n  `A_0(n,m) = (m>=1 ?

(for `n>=2, m>=1`).\nThis means `A_0(n,m)` depends on `A_0(n-2,m)`.\n`A_0(n,m) = C(n+m-1, n) + C(n+m-3, n-2) + C(n+m-5, n-4) + ...`.\nThe sum terminates at `A_0(n_last, m)`.\nIf `n` is odd, `n_last=1`.\n  `A_0(1,m) = C(m,1) + A_1(0,m)`.\n  If `m=1`: `A_0(1,1) = C(1,1) + A_1(0,1) = 1+1=2`.\n  If `m!=1`: `A_0(1,m) = C(m,1) + 0 = m`.\n  So if `n` is odd, `A_0(n,m) = sum_{k=0}^{(n-1)/2 - 1} C(n+m-1-2k, n-2k) + A_0(1,m)`.\n  `A_0(n,m) = sum_{k=0}^{(n-1)/2 - 1} C(n+m-1-2k, n-2k) + (m==1 ? 2 : m)`.\nIf `n` is even, `n_last=0`.\n  `A_0(0,m)`.\n  If `m=1`: `A_0(0,1) = 0`.\n  If `m!=1`: `A_0(0,m) = C(m-1,0) + A_1(-1,m) = 1`.\n  So if `n` is even, `A_0(n,m) = sum_{k=0}^{n/2 - 1} C(n+m-1-2k, n-2k) + A_0(0,m)`.\n  `A_0(n,m) = sum_{k=0}^{n/2 - 1} C(n+m-1-2k, n-2k) + (m==1 ? 0 : 1)`.\n\nThis is for `m>=1`.\nAnd `A_1(n,m)` is `A_0(n-1,m)`.\nThe sums are of the form `sum_{i=0}^{K} C(A-2i, B-2i)`.\nThis sum can be computed in `O(K)` time.\nBut `K` can be `N/2`. So `O(N)` overall.\n\nLet `F(N, K, M)` be `sum_{i=0 to M} C(N-2i, K-2i)`.\nWe need to calculate this efficiently.\n`C(N,K)` is `N! / (K!(N-K)!)`.\n`C(N,K)` is 0 if `K<0` or `K>N`.\n\n`A_0(n,m)` for `m=0`:\n  `n=1`: `1`.\n  `n>=2`: `A_1(n-1,0)`.\n  `A_1(n-1,0)`: `n-1` is odd. `A_0(n-2,0)`.\n  So `A_0(n,0) = A_0(n-2,0)`.\n  `A_0(1,0)=1`. So `A_0(odd,0)=1`.\n  `A_0(even,0)=0`.\n  This is `1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even (`n>=0`).\n\nFinal formulas for `A_g(n,m)`:\nIf `g=0`:\n  If `m=0`: `1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even.\n  If `m>=1`:\n    Let `S = 0`.\n    For `k` from `0` to `floor((n-1)/2) - 1`: `S = (S + C(n+m-1-2k, n-2k)) % MOD`.\n    If `n` is odd: `S = (S + (m==1 ? 2 : m)) % MOD`.\n    If `n` is even: `S = (S + (m==1 ? 0 : 1)) % MOD`.\n    Result is `S`.\nIf `g=1`:\n  If `n=0`: `1` if `m=1`, `0` otherwise.\n  Else (`n>=1`): `A_0(n-1,m)`.\n    Calculate `A_0(n-1,m)` using the formula above with `n'`=`n-1`, `m'`=`m`.\n\nSpecial case `n=0, m=1, g=1`: `A_1(0,1) = 1`.\nSpecial case `n=1, m=0, g=0`: `A_0(1,0) = 1`.\n\nThe sum `sum_{k=0}^{X} C(A-2k, B-2k)` can be calculated in `O(X)` time.\n`X` is `floor((n-1)/2) - 1` or `n/2 - 1`. Max `X` is `n/2`.\nSo overall `O(n)` calculation.\nMax `n` is `10^5`. So this is efficient enough.\n\nPrecompute factorials and inverse factorials up to `N_MAX = 2*10^5`.\n\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\nMAX_N_PLUS_M = 2 * 10**5 + 5 # Max n+m is 2*10^5\n\nfact = [1] * MAX_N_PLUS_M\ninv_fact = [1] * MAX_N_PLUS_M\n\ndef precompute_factorials():\n    for i in range(1, MAX_N_PLUS_M):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    inv_fact[MAX_N_PLUS_M - 1] = pow(fact[MAX_N_PLUS_M - 1], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    for i in range(MAX_N_PLUS_M - 2, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\ndef nCr_mod_p(n, r):\n    if r < 0 or r > n:\n        return 0\n    num = fact[n]\n    den = (inv_fact[r] * inv_fact[n-r]) % MOD\n    return (num * den) % MOD\n\nprecompute_factorials()\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Helper function to calculate A_0(n_val, m_val)\n    # This is essentially the `A_0` part of the recursive definition.\n    # It sums up C(n_val+m_val-1-2k, n_val-2k) and adds a base term.\n    def calculate_A0(n_val, m_val):\n        if m_val == 0:\n            return 1 if n_val % 2 == 1 else 0 # A_0(n_val, 0) is 1 if n_val is odd, 0 if even\n        \n        # m_val >= 1\n        current_sum = 0\n        \n        # Sum part: C(n_val+m_val-1-2k, n_val-2k)\n        # Iterate k from 0. n_val-2k must be >= 0.\n        # k goes up to floor((n_val-1)/2) - 1 for odd n_val\n        # k goes up to n_val/2 - 1 for even n_val\n        \n        # The loop condition for k: n_val - 2k must be >= 0.\n        # Also, C(N,K) requires K >= 0.\n        # n_val-2k >= 0 => 2k <= n_val => k <= n_val/2\n        \n        # The sum is for n_val-1, n_val-3, ..., up to 1 or 0 (depending on parity)\n        # This is sum_{i=0 to (n_val-2)/2} C(n_val+m_val-1-2i, n_val-2i)\n        \n        # We are summing C(N-2k, K-2k) where N=n_val+m_val-1, K=n_val.\n        # The loop should go until n_val-2k becomes 1 or 0.\n        # So k goes from 0 up to (n_val-1)/2 or (n_val-2)/2\n        \n        # Let's rewrite the sum to be more direct based on the 'n' argument in C(n,r)\n        # A_0(n,m) = C(n+m-1, n) + C(n+m-3, n-2) + ...\n        # The terms are C(N_term, K_term)\n        # N_term = n_val + m_val - 1 - 2*idx\n        # K_term = n_val - 2*idx\n        \n        # Base cases for the sum:\n        # If n_val is odd, the last term in the sum would be C(m_val+1-1, 1) = C(m_val, 1) if n_val=1.\n        # If n_val is even, the last term in the sum would be C(m_val-1, 0) if n_val=0.
