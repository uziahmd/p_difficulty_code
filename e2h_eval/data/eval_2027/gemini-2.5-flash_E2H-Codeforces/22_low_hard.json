After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Marks\" Problem in Python**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Marks\" problem.  It's a classic competitive programming scenario, and I need to whip up a Python script to solve it.  Let's break down the logic systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core elements. We have *n* students and *m* subjects, with marks ranging from 1 to 9. A \"best\" student is one who achieves the highest mark in a particular subject. A \"successful\" student is defined as someone who is \"best\" in at least one subject. My ultimate goal is to count the number of these successful students.\n\nThe input is straightforward: `n` and `m` on the first line, followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` single-digit marks. I'll need to parse this effectively. I think the best approach here is to read the marks into a list of strings, where each string represents a student's marks. This keeps the index access simple. I can then convert the characters to integers on the fly when necessary.\n\nThe core algorithm will involve a few steps. First, I have to figure out the maximum mark achieved in each subject.  I can create a list, `max_marks_per_subject`, to store these maximum values. I'll initialize this list with zeros or smallest possible value, and iterate through each subject, then go through each student's mark for that subject, updating the maximum value as I go.\n\nThen comes the \"best\" student identification.  For each subject, I'll compare each student's mark to the maximum mark calculated in the previous step.  If a student matches the maximum mark, they are marked as the \"best\" for that subject. It'll be handy to have a boolean variable or list to track whether a student is \"best\" at any subject, that is, successful.\n\nFinally, I'll iterate through the students. If a student is \"best\" in at least one subject (i.e., the boolean is true), I'll increment a counter for successful students. This counter is my final output.\n\nI've already run through an example in my head, verifying that my process makes sense for a small set of test data. Now, it's just a matter of translating this logic into clean, efficient Python code. I'm confident I can make this work.\n",
