Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem and figure out how to write a Python script for it. The core of this challenge seems to be interpreting a string, the \"Golorp name,\" as a set of constraints and an expression that needs to be satisfied. I think I've got a handle on the key elements.**\n\nFirst, I'm noticing a consistent structure: `?(<expression>):-<constraints>.`. The `<expression>` part involves underscores (`_`) and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), while the `<constraints>` section is a comma-separated list of relations (e.g., `___>__`). This is where the magic happens. The underscores are the real puzzle. I've considered a few interpretations, and the most promising seems to be that **each contiguous group of underscores represents a single variable, and the *number* of these variable groups determines how many input variables we have**.\n\nHere's how I think it works:\n1.  **Variable Assignment:** I'll scan the expression. Each new group of underscores (`_`, `__`, `___`, etc.) is assigned a unique variable, `v0, v1, v2, ...` in the order they appear.\n2.  **Number Construction:** When a group of, say, `k` underscores appears, it forms a *single* `k-digit* number. For example, `___` is *one* variable.\n3.  **Expression and Constraints:** The entire expression is then evaluated using these variables. The constraints are also interpreted using these variables. The goal is to find values for these variables (from 0 to 9) that satisfy both the expression (though the expression's actual result is likely not essential, as long as it doesn't cause errors) and the given constraints.\n4.  **Lexicographic Order:** The lexicographically smallest solution means I need to search for valid combinations of variable values, trying the smallest values first, a backtracking approach would be best.\n\nWith this in mind, let's see how this works. I'll need to write Python code to:\n1.  **Parse the Golorp name**: Extract the expression and the constraints.\n2.  **Identify variable groups**: Count all groups of `_`.\n3.  **Translate into variables**: Map these groups to variables like v0, v1, v2,...\n4.  **Create constraints**: Build Boolean expressions from constraints.\n5.  **Backtracking Search**: Search for values using backtracking, and stop when a valid solution is found. It'll start trying `000...0`, and increment values to find the first valid set.\n\nLet's test this strategy with the example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`.\n*   Expression: `_-_/___*__`. The variables would be `v0`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`\n*   Constraints: `___>__`. So the constraint is that `v2` > `v3`.\nThe output `0010` gives `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`. This meets all criteria. Now I know that what makes a solution valid.\n\nSo, this interpretation seems robust, but I'll need to write the script carefully to handle all the different combinations of operators and constraints correctly. Time to get coding!",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (0-9) that satisfy a \"golorp's name\" (a program string). If no such sequence exists, we output \"false\".\n\nThe golorp's name has a specific structure: `?(<expression>):-<constraints>.`\n\n**1. Parsing the Golorp Name and Identifying Variables:**\n\nThe key to this problem lies in correctly interpreting the `_` symbols. Based on the examples and typical competitive programming conventions, the most plausible interpretation is:\n\n*   **Variable Identification:** The \"jaws\" (the `<expression>` part) determines the number of variables. Each *contiguous block* of underscores (`_`, `__`, `___`, etc.) in the `<expression>` part corresponds to a unique variable. These variables are implicitly named `v0, v1, v2, ...` in the order their corresponding blocks appear from left to right in the expression. The total count of such unique blocks determines `N`, the number of variables we need to find values for.\n*   **Variable Mapping:** When a block of underscores appears anywhere in the golorp's name (either in the expression or constraints), it maps to the variable `v_i` that was assigned to the *first occurrence* of a block of that exact length in the `<expression>` part. If a block of a certain length appears in the constraints but not in the expression, it's an error (or implies no variable exists for it, but the problem guarantees valid names, so this shouldn't happen). This means `__` in the constraints refers to the same variable as the first `__` in the expression, `___` refers to the same variable as the first `___` in the expression, and so on.\n\nLet's refine the variable mapping:\n1.  Scan the `<expression>` part.\n2.  For each *unique length* of an underscore block encountered, assign it to the next available variable `v_k`. Store this mapping (e.g., `length -> v_k`).\n3.  The total number of unique variable assignments made this way is `N`.\n4.  When evaluating the expression or constraints, any underscore block `k` characters long is replaced by the variable `v_i` that was assigned to blocks of length `k`.\n\nLet's re-examine Example 2: `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\nExpression: `__-_+_/_____`\nBlocks and their lengths:\n*   `__` (length 2) -> Assign `v0`.\n*   `_` (length 1) -> Assign `v1`.\n*   `_` (length 1) -> This length (1) is already assigned to `v1`. So, this block also maps to `v1`.\n*   `_____` (length 5) -> Assign `v2`.\nSo, we have `N=3` variables: `v0` (for length 2), `v1` (for length 1), `v2` (for length 5).\nThis means the output should be 3 digits. The example output is `false`. This interpretation still doesn't match the examples perfectly.\n\nThe most robust interpretation that matches all examples (especially the output length) is:\n1.  **Extract all contiguous blocks of underscores** from the *entire* golorp name (expression + constraints).\n2.  **Assign variables:** Each *unique* block (defined by its length) is mapped to a distinct variable `v_i`. The variables `v0, v1, ..., v_{N-1}` are assigned in increasing order of the block lengths they represent. If multiple blocks have the same length, they map to the same variable.\n    *   Example: `_` maps to `v0`, `__` maps to `v1`, `___` maps to `v2`, `____` maps to `v3`, etc.\n    *   The total number of variables `N` is the number of distinct block lengths found in the golorp name.\n3.  **Evaluate:** Replace each block of underscores with its corresponding variable `v_i`.\n\nLet's try Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\nBlocks: `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`, `___`, `__`.\nDistinct lengths: 1, 2, 3.\nSo, `N=3` variables:\n*   Length 1 (`_`) -> `v0`\n*   Length 2 (`__`) -> `v1`\n*   Length 3 (`___`) -> `v2`\nOutput for this example is `0010` (4 digits). This interpretation still doesn't match the output length.\n\n**The only interpretation that consistently matches the number of output digits in the examples is:**\n1.  **Identify all contiguous blocks of underscores in the `<expression>` part.**\n2.  **Each such block is a distinct variable.** These are `v0, v1, ..., v_{N-1}` in order of appearance. `N` is the total count of these blocks.\n3.  **Mapping in constraints:** When a block of underscores appears in the constraints, it maps to the variable `v_i` that corresponds to the *i-th block of underscores encountered in the expression*. This means the first `_` in the expression is `v0`, the second `_` is `v1`, the first `___` is `v2`, the first `__` is `v3` *if those were the 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd blocks encountered*.\n\nLet's apply this to Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\nExpression: `_-_/___*__`\nBlocks in expression, and their assigned variables:\n1.  `_` -> `v0`\n2.  `_` -> `v1`\n3.  `___` -> `v2`\n4.  `__` -> `v3`\nSo, `N=4` variables: `v0, v1, v2, v3`. This matches the output length `0010`.\nThe expression becomes: `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`.\nConstraints: `___>__`\nThe `___` here refers to the 3rd block in the expression, which is `v2`.\nThe `__` here refers to the 4th block in the expression, which is `v3`.\nSo, the constraint is `v2 > v3`.\n\nLet's apply this to Example 2: `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\nExpression: `__-_+_/_____`\nBlocks in expression, and their assigned variables:\n1.  `__` -> `v0`\n2.  `_` -> `v1`\n3.  `_` -> `v2`\n4.  `_____` -> `v3`\nSo, `N=4` variables: `v0, v1, v2, v3`. This matches the output length (if it were not `false`).\nThe expression becomes: `v0 - v1 + v2 / v3`.\nConstraints: `__>__,_____<__.`\n*   `__` (first constraint block) -> `v0` (because `__` was the 1st block in expression)\n*   `_` (second constraint block) -> `v1` (because `_` was the 2nd block in expression)\n*   `_____` (third constraint block) -> `v3` (because `_____` was the 4th block in expression)\n*   `_` (fourth constraint block) -> `v2` (because `_` was the 3rd block in expression)\nSo, constraints are: `v0 > v1` AND `v3 < v2`.\nThis interpretation finally works for all examples!\n\n**2. Expression and Constraint Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Numbers:** A block of `k` underscores, e.g., `___`, represents a `k`-digit number. If `v_a, v_b, v_c` are the values of the variables assigned to these `k` underscore blocks, the number's value is `100*v_a + 10*v_b + v_c`. (Wait, this is if `_` are digits, but we just established `_` blocks are variables. So, `___` means `v_k` where `v_k` is the variable assigned to the `___` block.)\n    *   This is crucial: If `___` maps to `v2`, its value is simply `v2`.\n    *   Example 1: `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`. `v2` and `v3` are single-digit variables 0-9. `v2` is not a 3-digit number.\n*   **Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Standard integer arithmetic. Division by zero is an invalid state.\n*   **Comparisons:** `>`, `<`, `=`, `<=`, `>=`.\n*   **Target Value:** The expression must evaluate to `0`. This is a common convention in \"minimal diet\" or \"health-conscious\" problems where the expression represents some \"cost\" or \"energy\" that should be minimized. Since it's not explicitly stated, `0` is the most reasonable assumption. If it could be any value, the problem would be underspecified.\n\n**Let's re-verify Example 1 with this interpretation:** `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\nVariables: `v0, v1, v2, v3` (all 0-9).\nExpression: `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`. Must evaluate to `0`.\nConstraints: `v2 > v3`.\nSolution `0010`: `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`.\nCheck expression: `0 - 0 / 1 * 0`.\n`0 / 1 = 0`. `0 * 0 = 0`. `0 - 0 = 0`. Evaluates to `0`. No division by zero.\nCheck constraint: `1 > 0`. True.\nThis matches!\n\n**Re-verify Example 2:** `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\nVariables: `v0, v1, v2, v3` (all 0-9).\nExpression: `v0 - v1 + v2 / v3`. Must evaluate to `0`.\nConstraints: `v0 > v1` AND `v3 < v2`.\nSearch for `v0v1v2v3` (lexicographically smallest):\nConditions:\n1.  `v3 != 0` (for `v2 / v3` to be valid)\n2.  `v0 > v1`\n3.  `v3 < v2`\n4.  `v0 - v1 + v2 / v3 == 0` (integer division)\n\nLet's try to find a solution:\n`v0` must be at least 1 (from `v0 > v1`).\n`v3` must be at least 1 (from `v3 != 0`).\n`v2` must be at least 2 (from `v3 < v2` and `v3 >= 1`).\n\nTry `v0=1`:\n    `v1=0`: (`v0>v1` ok)\n        Expression becomes `1 - 0 + v2 / v3 = 0` => `1 + v2 / v3 = 0` => `v2 / v3 = -1`.\n        Since `v2, v3 >= 1`, `v2 / v3` will always be non-negative (0 or positive). It can never be -1.\n        So, `v0=1, v1=0` cannot lead to a solution.\nTry `v0=2`:\n    `v1=0`: (`v0>v1` ok)\n        Expression: `2 - 0 + v2 / v3 = 0` => `2 + v2 / v3 = 0` => `v2 / v3 = -2`. Impossible.\n    `v1=1`: (`v0>v1` ok)\n        Expression: `2 - 1 + v2 / v3 = 0` => `1 + v2 / v3 = 0` => `v2 / v3 = -1`. Impossible.\n\nIt seems `v_expr = v0 - v1 + v2 / v3` will always be `v0 - v1 + (non-negative)` which is `(v0-v1) + (non-negative)`.\nSince `v0 > v1`, `v0 - v1 >= 1`.\nSo `v_expr >= 1 + (non-negative) >= 1`.\nTherefore, `v_expr` can never be `0`.\nThis correctly explains why the output is `false` for Example 2.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent.\n\n**3. Implementation Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Parse the input string:**\n    *   Split into expression and constraints parts.\n    *   Use regular expressions to find all contiguous blocks of `_` in the expression part. Assign `v0, v1, ... v_{N-1}` to these blocks in order. Store the length of each block.\n    *   For the constraints part, find all `_` blocks. For each block, identify which `v_i` it maps to based on its position in the original expression.\n2.  **Generate candidate solutions:** Since variable values are 0-9 and `N` is relatively small (max 1024 chars, maybe 10-20 variables?), a brute-force approach using recursion/backtracking to try all combinations `v0, v1, ..., v_{N-1}` from `0` to `9` is feasible. Lexicographical order is naturally handled by trying `v0=0` then `v0=1`, etc., and then `v1=0`, etc.\n3.  **Evaluate for each candidate:**\n    *   Substitute variable values into the expression and constraints.\n    *   **Expression evaluation:** Use a parser (or `eval` after careful string replacement) to calculate the expression's value. Handle operator precedence. Integer division `/` should be used. Crucially, check for division by zero. If `b=0` in `a/b`, it's invalid.\n    *   **Constraint evaluation:** Check all constraints.\n    *   If both expression evaluates to `0` (and no errors) AND all constraints are true, then we found a valid solution. Since we are searching lexicographically, the first one found is the answer.\n\n**Detailed Parsing and Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Splitting:** The string is `?(<EXPR>):-<CONSTR>.`. Use `s.split('?:-')` to get `(<EXPR>)` and `<CONSTR>.`. Then remove `?(` and `)` and `.`\n*   **Variable Mapping:**\n    *   Use `re.finditer(r'_+', expression_str)` to find all `_` blocks.\n    *   Store `var_map = []` where `var_map[i]` is the length of the `i`-th block in the expression. `N = len(var_map)`.\n*   **Expression/Constraint Transformation:**\n    *   Replace `_` blocks with `v[i]` placeholders.\n    *   Example: `_-_/___*__` becomes `v[0]-v[1]/v[2]*v[3]`.\n    *   Example: `___>__` becomes `v[2]>v[3]`.\n    *   Store these transformed strings for later evaluation.\n*   **Evaluation Function:**\n    *   Create a function `evaluate(expr_str, values)`:\n        *   Replace `v[i]` in `expr_str` with `str(values[i])`.\n        *   Use `eval()` carefully. `eval()` handles operator precedence.\n        *   To handle division by zero:\n            *   One way is to wrap `eval()` in a `try-except ZeroDivisionError`.\n            *   Another is to pre-parse the expression tree and check for `0` denominators before division. For this problem, `try-except` is simpler.\n    *   Create a function `check_constraints(constraints_list, values)`:\n        *   For each constraint string, replace `v[i]` with `str(values[i])`.\n        *   Use `eval()` to get boolean result. If any is `False`, return `False`.\n        *   Also need to check for division by zero in constraints.\n\n**Example 3:** `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\nExpression blocks: `______________________` (22 underscores), `____` (4), `_______` (7), `__` (2), `_____` (5), `______` (6), `___` (3).\nTotal 7 blocks, so `N=7` variables: `v0` (len 22), `v1` (len 4), `v2` (len 7), `v3` (len 2), `v4` (len 5), `v5` (len 6), `v6` (len 3).\nOutput: `0250341`. This is 7 digits. Matches `N=7`.\n\n**Maximum N:**\nInput length is up to 1024. If all are `_`, that's 1024 variables. But blocks of `_` are separated by operators.\nMax `N` is roughly `len/2`. So around 500 variables. This is too large for brute force `10^N`.\nHowever, the example `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___)` has 7 variables for a very long expression. The number of *blocks* is relatively small.\nA block is `_` or `__` or `___` etc.\nThe maximum number of variables `N` is the number of blocks in the expression.\nIf the expression is `_-_-_...` (alternating `_` and `-`), then `N` could be `(len+1)/2`.\nFor 1024 chars, `N` could be around 512.\n`10^512` is impossible.\n\n**Re-reading the problem carefully:** \"All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples.\"\nThis suggests `N` will be small, like in the examples (4, 4, 7, 4).\nThe longest expression in examples is `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___)` which is 7 variables.\nThis implies `N` is small enough for `10^N` brute force. Let's assume `N` is at most ~10. `10^10` is too much. `N` at most ~7-8 seems plausible for `10^N`.\n`10^7` is 10 million. `10^8` is 100 million. This might be acceptable for a few seconds.\n\nLet's assume `N` is small enough for backtracking.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve():\n    golorp_name = input()\n\n    # 1.

E.g., if the 3rd block in the expression was `___` (assigned to `v2`),\n        # then the 3rd block in the entire name (expression + constraints) would also refer to `v2`.\n\n        # Let's re-parse the entire string and map blocks to variables globally.\n        # This means we need to count all blocks of underscores in the entire string.\n        # The N variables are v0, v1, ..., v(N-1) where N is the total count of blocks in the expression.\n        # The i-th block in the expression is v[i].\n        # The k-th block *overall* (expression then constraints) maps to v[j] where j is the index\n        # of the k-th block in the expression. This is also not right.\n\n        # Let's go with the one that passed all examples in the thought process:\n        # N = number of blocks in expression.\n        # The i-th block in the expression maps to variable v[i].\n        # For constraints, we also parse them as if they are part of the expression,\n        # meaning the j-th block in the constraint part maps to v[j + N_expr_blocks_before_constraints].\n        # This is also wrong.\n\n        # The *only* interpretation that worked with Example 1 and Example 2's 'false' was:\n        # 1. N is the number of blocks in the expression.\n        # 2. The i-th block in the expression is assigned to variable v[i].\n        # 3. When parsing constraints, the j-th block of underscores (from left to right in the constraint string)\n        #    is mapped to v[j]. This means constraints have their own variable indices, v[0], v[1] etc.\n        #    This is also wrong as Example 1's constraint `___ > __` maps to `v2 > v3`.\n\n        # Final, final interpretation (which is what I used to get the examples right):\n        # 1. Find all contiguous blocks of underscores in the expression part. Let these be `e_b0, e_b1, ..., e_b(N-1)`.\n        # 2. These define `N` variables: `v0, v1, ..., v(N-1)`. Variable `v_i` corresponds to block `e_bi`.\n        # 3. When building the expression template, `e_bi` is replaced by `v[i]`.\n        # 4. When building constraint templates:\n        #    For each block `c_bj` in the constraints string, find its *index* relative to *all* underscore blocks\n        #    in the *entire original string*. If `c_bj` is the `k`-th underscore block overall (expression + constraints),\n        #    then it maps to `v[k]`. This is the one that gives `0010` for 4 variables from 12 underscores.\n        #    BUT the output `0010` is 4 digits, not 12. So this is also wrong.\n\n        # Let's take the problem literally: \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n        # \"Jaws\" is the expression. So `N` comes from the expression.\n        # The *output* length must match `N`.\n        # Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` Output `0010` (4 digits).\n        # Expression: `_-_/___*__`\n        # Blocks: `_` (1st), `_` (2nd), `___` (3rd), `__` (4th). Total 4 blocks. So `N=4`.\n        # This means `v0` is the 1st `_`, `v1` is the 2nd `_`, `v2` is the `___`, `v3` is the `__`.\n        # Expression template: `v[0]-v[1]/v[2]*v[3]`\n        # Constraints: `___>__`\n        # How do `___` and `__` map to `v0, v1, v2, v3`?\n        # If `___` maps to `v2` (because `v2` was the variable for the 3rd block in the expression, which was `___`)\n        # If `__` maps to `v3` (because `v3` was the variable for the 4th block in the expression, which was `__`)\n        # This is the most consistent and simplest.\n\n    # Re-build logic with this interpretation:\n    # 1.
