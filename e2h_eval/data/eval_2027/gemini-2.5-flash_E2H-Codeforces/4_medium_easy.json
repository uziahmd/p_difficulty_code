The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**I've got this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem clearly in my sights.** The core issue is the massive number of rounds, making a brute-force approach a total non-starter. I immediately zeroed in on the cyclic nature of the players' choices. It's all about finding the repeating pattern and leveraging that for efficiency.\n\n**The game's rules and the cyclical strategies are straightforward.** Nikephoros and Polycarpus each have their own repeating sequences. The key insight is that the combined choices of both players will also form a repeating pattern.  The length of this combined cycle is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences. This, I know, is the critical piece of information.  Once I simulate this repeating segment, I can expand this single simulation to cover all the given number of rounds efficiently.\n\n**My plan is to:**\n1. **Develop a `get_winner` helper function**.  This will take the two player choices and return who wins or if it is a draw.  I have defined winning conditions inside it for simplicity and to reduce errors.\n2.  **Calculate the LCM of the sequence lengths.** I'll use the `math.gcd` function for this, since I'm already aware of how to calculate the LCM using it.\n3.  **Simulate the cycle.** I'll loop through the LCM rounds, counting N and P losses within this one cycle.\n4.  **Calculate the total losses.** I'll determine how many full cycles are in the full number of rounds. Then, I multiply the full cycle losses and add any additional losses from the leftover rounds.\n5.  **Simulate the remaining rounds.** For any remainder after the full cycles, I will simulate it.\n\n**I have to be careful with integer overflow**, though Python's arbitrary-precision integers mean I should be fine.  I've already thought through edge cases, such as when one sequence is very short compared to the other and that will work as expected with this approach. My solution is concise, efficient, and leverages well-known techniques, which should yield a correct and well-optimized solution to the problem. The final Python script reflects these considerations.\n",
    "response": "The problem requires calculating the total number of losses for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game over `n` rounds. Both players use a cyclic strategy: Nikephoros repeats a sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus repeats a sequence `B` of length `k`. The total number of rounds `n` can be very large (up to 2 * 10^9), while the sequence lengths `m` and `k` are relatively small (up to 1000).\n\n**Key Idea: Periodicity**\n\nSince both players use cyclic sequences, their combined choices `(Nikephoros's choice, Polycarpus's choice)` will also repeat in a cycle.\n*   Nikephoros's choice for round `i` is `A[(i-1) % m]`.\n*   Polycarpus's choice for round `i` is `B[(i-1) % k]`.\nThe pair of choices `(A[(i-1) % m], B[(i-1) % k])` will repeat with a period equal to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.\n\nThe LCM can be calculated using the formula: `LCM(m, k) = (m * k) / GCD(m, k)`, where GCD is the Greatest Common Divisor. The maximum `LCM(m, k)` for `m, k <= 1000` is `1000 * 999 = 999000`, which is small enough to simulate.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Determine Round Outcome:** Create a helper function `get_winner(n_choice, p_choice)` that takes Nikephoros's and Polycarpus's choices for a round and returns:\n    *   `0`: if it's a draw (no one gets a spot).\n    *   `1`: if Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus gets a spot).\n    *   `-1`: if Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros gets a spot).\n\n2.  **Calculate Cycle Length:**\n    *   Get `m = len(A)` and `k = len(B)`.\n    *   Calculate `lcm = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)`. This `lcm` value represents the number of rounds in one complete cycle of game outcomes.\n\n3.  **Simulate One Cycle:**\n    *   Initialize `n_losses_in_cycle = 0` and `p_losses_in_cycle = 0`.\n    *   Loop `i` from `0` to `lcm - 1`:\n        *   Get `n_choice = A[i % m]` and `p_choice = B[i % k]`.\n        *   Call `get_winner(n_choice, p_choice)`.\n        *   If Nikephoros wins (`1`), increment `p_losses_in_cycle`.\n        *   If Polycarpus wins (`-1`), increment `n_losses_in_cycle`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Losses:**\n    *   Determine how many full cycles fit into `n` rounds: `num_full_cycles = n // lcm`.\n    *   Determine the number of remaining rounds: `remaining_rounds = n % lcm`.\n    *   Calculate initial total losses based on full cycles:\n        *   `total_n_losses = num_full_cycles * n_losses_in_cycle`\n        *   `total_p_losses = num_full_cycles * p_losses_in_cycle`\n\n5.  **Simulate Remaining Rounds:**\n    *   Loop `i` from `0` to `remaining_rounds - 1`:\n        *   Get `n_choice = A[i % m]` and `p_choice = B[i % k]`.\n        *   Call `get_winner(n_choice, p_choice)`.\n        *   If Nikephoros wins (`1`), increment `total_p_losses`.\n        *   If Polycarpus wins (`-1`), increment `total_n_losses`.\n\n6.  **Print Result:** Print `total_n_losses` and `total_p_losses`.\n\nThis approach avoids simulating `n` individual rounds, which would be too slow, and instead leverages the game's periodicity to perform calculations in `O(LCM(m, k))` time, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to determine the winner of a single round\n# Returns:\n#   0 for a draw\n#   1 if Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses)\n#  -1 if Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses)\ndef get_winner(n_choice, p_choice):\n    if n_choice == p_choice:\n        return 0  # Draw\n    \n    # Nikephoros's winning conditions\n    if (n_choice == 'R' and p_choice == 'S') or \\\n       (n_choice == 'S' and p_choice == 'P') or \\\n       (n_choice == 'P' and p_choice == 'R'):\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n    \n    # Otherwise, Polycarpus wins\n    return -1 # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input()\n    B = input()\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Calculate LCM of m and k, which is the cycle length for game outcomes\n    # LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = (m * k) // common_divisor\n\n    # Simulate one full cycle to count losses for each player\n    n_losses_in_cycle = 0\n    p_losses_in_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        n_choice = A[i % m]\n        p_choice = B[i % k]\n        \n        result = get_winner(n_choice, p_choice)\n        if result == 1:\n            p_losses_in_cycle += 1\n        elif result == -1:\n            n_losses_in_cycle += 1\n\n    # Calculate total losses based on full cycles\n    num_full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remaining_rounds = n % lcm\n\n    total_n_losses = num_full_cycles * n_losses_in_cycle\n    total_p_losses = num_full_cycles * p_losses_in_cycle\n\n    # Simulate the remaining rounds (less than one full cycle)\n    for i in range(remaining_rounds):\n        n_choice = A[i % m]\n        p_choice = B[i % k]\n        \n        result = get_winner(n_choice, p_choice)\n        if result == 1:\n            total_p_losses += 1\n        elif result == -1:\n            total_n_losses += 1\n\n    print(total_n_losses, total_p_losses)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
