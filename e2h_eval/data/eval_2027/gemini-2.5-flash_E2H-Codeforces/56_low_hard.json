Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need a Python script to solve this. First things first:  Let's break down the problem statement. The core is figuring out if I can create a \"non-intersecting perfect matching\" between Rebel spaceships (`R`) and bases (`B`).  Right off the bat, if `R` and `B` aren't equal, there's no way to create a perfect matching, so I'll output \"No\" and be done with it. Let's assume `R` and `B` are both `N`.\n\nThe really tricky part is the \"non-intersecting paths\" constraint.  They are straight lines, and no two lines can cross each other. This is fundamentally a geometric problem, and since `R` and `B` are small (up to 10), I'm thinking a brute-force approach, like backtracking or trying all permutations, might be viable. That's a good place to start.\n\nNow, how do I check for intersections? Well, I know a little about computational geometry.  Two line segments intersect if and only if they \"straddle\" each other.  Straddling means that the endpoints of one line segment are on opposite sides of the line containing the other segment, and vice versa.  The crucial \"no three points on the same line\" constraint is a huge help; I don't need to worry about collinear segments, which would make the intersection detection more complex.\n\nI remember the orientation test, based on the cross product, from when I was working with geometric algorithms.  It's perfect for this. I can quickly determine if a point is to the left, right, or on a line defined by two other points.  I'll use that to check if each segment's endpoints are on opposite sides of the other segment. That's my main tool for checking for intersecting pairs of spaceship-base assignments.\n\nSo, the plan is to generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations of the bases), check if the resulting segments intersect using the orientation test, and output \"Yes\" if I find a valid, non-intersecting matching, or \"No\" if I exhaust all permutations. I'll need to write a function for the orientation test and another function to efficiently check the intersections for a given matching. Seems like a workable strategy.  Let's code it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a perfect matching exists between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two assigned paths (straight lines from a base to its spaceship) intersect.\n\nFirst, a perfect matching requires that the number of Rebel spaceships must be equal to the number of bases. If `R != B`, it's impossible to form a perfect matching, so we can immediately output \"No\". Let's assume `R = B = N`.\n\nSince `N` is very small (up to 10), we can try all possible permutations of assignments. There are `N!` ways to assign `N` spaceships to `N` bases. For `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`, which is a feasible number of assignments to check.\n\nFor each potential assignment (a set of `N` segments), we need to check if any two segments intersect.\nA standard way to check if two line segments `P1P2` and `P3P4` intersect is using the orientation test (cross product).\nGiven three points `A`, `B`, `C`, the `orientation(A, B, C)` function returns:\n*   `> 0` if `C` is counter-clockwise (left turn) from vector `AB`.\n*   `< 0` if `C` is clockwise (right turn) from vector `AB`.\n*   `= 0` if `A`, `B`, `C` are collinear.\n\nTwo line segments `P1P2` and `P3P4` intersect if and only if:\n1.  `orientation(P1, P2, P3)` and `orientation(P1, P2, P4)` have different signs (meaning `P3` and `P4` are on opposite sides of the line `P1P2`), AND\n2.  `orientation(P3, P4, P1)` and `orientation(P3, P4, P2)` have different signs (meaning `P1` and `P2` are on opposite sides of the line `P3P4`).\n\nThe problem statement guarantees that \"no three points are on the same line\". This simplifies the intersection check: we don't need to handle collinear cases or endpoints lying on another segment. If the conditions above are met, the segments properly cross.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  Read coordinates of `R` Rebel spaceships into a list `rebels`.\n3.  Read coordinates of `B` bases into a list `bases`.\n4.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5.  Iterate through all permutations of `rebels` (or `bases`). Let's say we fix the order of `bases` and permute `rebels`.\n    *   For each permutation `p` of `rebels`:\n        *   Form `N` segments: `(bases[0], p[0])`, `(bases[1], p[1])`, ..., `(bases[N-1], p[N-1])`.\n        *   Assume `is_valid_assignment = True`.\n        *   Iterate through all pairs of segments `(bases[i], p[i])` and `(bases[j], p[j])` where `i < j`.\n            *   If these two segments intersect using the `orientation` test:\n                *   Set `is_valid_assignment = False`.\n                *   Break from the inner loop (no need to check further pairs for this assignment).\n        *   If `is_valid_assignment` is still `True` after checking all pairs, it means we found a non-intersecting perfect matching. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n6.  If the loop finishes without finding any valid assignment, print \"No\".\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   The `orientation` function can be implemented using the cross product formula `(B.y - A.y) * (C.x - B.x) - (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - B.y)`.\n*   The `segments_intersect` function uses the `orientation` function to check the two conditions.\n*   The `itertools.permutations` function is used to generate all possible assignments.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Helper function to calculate orientation of (A, B, C)\n# Returns:\n#   > 0 if C is counter-clockwise (left turn) from vector AB\n#   < 0 if C is clockwise (right turn) from vector AB\n#   = 0 if A, B, C are collinear\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n          (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    return val\n\n# Helper function to check if two line segments p1q1 and p2q2 intersect\n# Assumes no three points are collinear (as per problem statement)\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if orientations are different\n    # and not collinear (which is guaranteed by the problem)\n    if o1 != 0 and o2 != 0 and o3 != 0 and o4 != 0: # Ensure no collinearity\n        return (o1 > 0) != (o2 > 0) and (o3 > 0) != (o4 > 0)\n    \n    # With the \"no three points on the same line\" guarantee,\n    # we don't need to handle edge cases like collinear segments or endpoints\n    # lying on another segment, as these would involve an orientation of 0.\n    # If any orientation is 0, it would mean 3 points are collinear, which is forbidden.\n    # Therefore, we only care about the general crossing case.\n    return False\n\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        rebels.append(tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        bases.append(tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    N = R\n\n    # Iterate over all permutations of rebel spaceships\n    # We fix the order of bases and try to match them with permutations of rebels\n    for p_rebels in permutations(rebels):\n        current_segments = []\n        for i in range(N):\n            current_segments.append((bases[i], p_rebels[i]))\n\n        is_valid_assignment = True\n        # Check for intersections between all pairs of segments\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i + 1, N):\n                s1_p1, s1_q1 = current_segments[i]\n                s2_p2, s2_q2 = current_segments[j]\n\n                if segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_q1, s2_p2, s2_q2):\n                    is_valid_assignment = False\n                    break\n            if not is_valid_assignment:\n                break\n        \n        if is_valid_assignment:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    # If no valid assignment was found after checking all permutations\n    print(\"No\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
