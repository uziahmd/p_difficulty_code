Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for \"New Year Candles\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to solve this \"New Year Candles\" problem. The core idea seems to be simulating how long Vasily can light his room, given some initial candles and the ability to craft new candles from the burned-out ones.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n*   Vasily starts with `a` new candles.\n*   Each candle burns for 1 hour.\n*   `b` burned-out candles make 1 new candle.\n*   I need to find the maximum total hours the room is lit.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nIt's a straightforward simulation. I'll need to keep track of:\n\n*   `total_hours`: The total hours lit.\n*   `new_candles`: The current number of new candles.\n*   `burned_out_candles`: How many burned-out candles are available.\n\nThe main loop will iterate while `new_candles` is greater than zero:\n\n1.  **Burn Candles:** Vasily lights all `new_candles`.\n    *   `total_hours` increases by `new_candles`.\n    *   `burned_out_candles` increases by `new_candles`.\n    *   `new_candles` becomes 0.\n2.  **Craft New Candles:** Calculate how many new candles can be crafted (`crafted_candles = burned_out_candles // b`).\n    *   Update `burned_out_candles` (remainder).\n    *   Add the `crafted_candles` to `new_candles`.\n\n**Edge Cases and Constraints:**\n\nThe constraints are `1 <= a <= 1000` and `2 <= b <= 1000`. These suggest the problem won't involve extremely large numbers or an infinite loop. Even in the worst-case scenario (a large initial `a` and `b` close to 1), the candles effectively 'burn away' and will converge fairly quickly.\n\n**Input and Output:**\n\nThe input will be given in the format of two integers `a` and `b` on a single line. The output will be the maximum number of hours the room will be lit up.\n\n**Final Thoughts and the Code:**\n\nSince the problem statement says \"The single line contains two integers, a and b,\" I'll assume only one set of inputs will be given. Here's what the Python code should look like:\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    a_str, b_str = line.split()\n    a = int(a_str)\n    b = int(b_str)\n\n    total_hours = 0\n    new_candles = a\n    burned_out_candles = 0\n\n    while new_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += new_candles\n        burned_out_candles += new_candles\n        new_candles = 0\n\n        crafted_candles = burned_out_candles // b\n        burned_out_candles %= b\n        new_candles += crafted_candles\n\n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\nThe comments are only for my thought process and should be deleted, leaving this clean code. I'm pretty confident that the single-test-case solution is the right one, based on the description.\n",
