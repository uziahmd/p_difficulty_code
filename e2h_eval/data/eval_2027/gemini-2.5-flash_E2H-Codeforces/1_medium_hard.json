The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Plan for Gilded Cells**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, given its width (`w`) and height (`h`), and the number of gilded rings (`k`).  Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, 2 cells away from the previous one. The dimensions of the rectangles become smaller with each ring.\n\nFirst, I figured out the dimensions of the inner rectangles forming the rings. The i-th ring has an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. I thought of it as starting with the outer rectangle (`w x h`) and then shrinking it by 4 cells (2 on each side) for each ring.\n\nThen I determined how many border cells are on each ring. Since each ring has a width of 1 cell, the border cells count is calculated using the formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` where `W` and `H` are the width and height of the current rectangle. I also confirmed with examples the dimensions calculation.\n\nAfter verifying the formula, I considered the constraints (`3 <= w, h <= 100`) and the relationship between `w`, `h` and `k`, that limits the maximum number of rings. The constraint is `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This prevents the rectangles from shrinking to impossible sizes. I made sure to implement this constraint in the code.\n\nThe main idea is to loop through the rings, calculate the number of cells in each ring (using the perimeter formula) and accumulate a running total. In the code, the loop variable i goes from 0 to k-1 (representing rings 1 to k). For each ring, I calculate `current_w` and `current_h` as dimensions of the rectangle, and then add the border cell count for the given ring. The calculation takes into account that 2 cells from each edge aren't gilded.\n\nTo be extra careful, I have to make sure the loop starts from 1 because that is how rings are described. My code now computes the number of gilded cells correctly for the given inputs `w`, `h` and `k`.\n",
