    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  My initial thought is to figure out the best way to approach this. It seems straightforward enough at first glance, but I know competitive programming can have hidden complexities. I've got an array of integers, let's call it `a`, and I need to remove one element.  Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the resulting array. My goal is to minimize this instability.\n\nThe constraints are manageable: array size `n` up to 10^5, and element values up to 10^5. That gives me a general idea of the acceptable complexity of my solution.\n\nI've looked at the examples to ensure that I am approaching the problem the way it is intended: I've also run through a few thought experiments for the problem, which helps me understand the edge cases. It's clear that removing either the absolute maximum or the absolute minimum will likely be key to finding the optimal solution. \n\nThe crux of the problem lies in recognizing that minimizing the difference between `max` and `min` directly translates to making the `max` as small as possible and the `min` as large as possible.\n\nLet's think about how removing an element impacts these values. If I *don't* remove the maximum, the new maximum will still be the original maximum.  If I *do* remove the maximum, the new maximum will be the second largest element.  This is also true for the minimum. If I remove the minimum, the new minimum will be the second smallest.\n\nThis tells me that sorting the array is a critical first step. Once sorted, the solution becomes quite obvious. I can consider removing the smallest, the second largest, the largest and the second smallest elements and taking the minimum of those values to find the most stable solution.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly one element from an array `a` to minimize the instability of the remaining `n-1` elements. Instability is defined as `max - min`.\n\nTo minimize `max - min`, we want to make the maximum value as small as possible and the minimum value as large as possible.\n\nConsider the sorted version of the array `a`. Let the sorted array be `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n`, where `s_1` is the smallest element and `s_n` is the largest element. `s_2` is the second smallest, and `s_{n-1}` is the second largest.\n\nWhen we remove an element, there are two primary scenarios that can lead to a reduced instability:\n\n1.  **Removing the maximum element (`s_n`):** If we remove `s_n`, the new maximum of the array will be `s_{n-1}` (the second largest element). The minimum will still be `s_1` (assuming `s_1` is not `s_n`, which is true for `n > 1`). The instability in this case would be `s_{n-1} - s_1`.\n\n2.  **Removing the minimum element (`s_1`):** If we remove `s_1`, the new minimum of the array will be `s_2` (the second smallest element). The maximum will still be `s_n` (assuming `s_n` is not `s_1`). The instability in this case would be `s_n - s_2`.\n\nAny other element removal (i.e., removing an element `a_i` where `s_1 < a_i < s_n`) would not change the maximum (`s_n`) or the minimum (`s_1`) of the array. The instability would remain `s_n - s_1`, which is the instability of the original array. This value is generally larger than or equal to the instabilities from removing `s_n` or `s_1`.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible instability must be the minimum of these two values:\n`min(s_{n-1} - s_1, s_n - s_2)`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the integer `n`.\n2.  Read the `n` integers into an array `a`.\n3.  Sort the array `a`. This takes `O(N log N)` time.\n4.  After sorting, the elements are `a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]`.\n    *   `s_1` corresponds to `a[0]`.\n    *   `s_2` corresponds to `a[1]`.\n    *   `s_{n-1}` corresponds to `a[n-2]`.\n    *   `s_n` corresponds to `a[n-1]`.\n5.  Calculate `instability1 = a[n-2] - a[0]` (removing the largest element).\n6.  Calculate `instability2 = a[n-1] - a[1]` (removing the smallest element).\n7.  The minimum instability is `min(instability1, instability2)`.\n8.  Print this minimum value.\n\n**Example 1: `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`**\n1.  `n = 4`\n2.  `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`\n3.  Sorted `a`: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`\n4.  `a[0] = 1`, `a[1] = 3`, `a[n-2] = a[2] = 3`, `a[n-1] = a[3] = 7`\n5.  `instability1 = a[n-2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`\n6.  `instability2 = a[n-1] - a[1] = 7 - 3 = 4`\n7.  `min(2, 4) = 2`. Output: `2`.\n\n**Example 2: `a = [1, 100000]`**\n1.  `n = 2`\n2.  `a = [1, 100000]`\n3.  Sorted `a`: `[1, 100000]`\n4.  `a[0] = 1`, `a[1] = 100000`\n    *   Note for `n=2`: `a[n-2]` is `a[0]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[1]`.\n5.  `instability1 = a[n-2] - a[0] = a[0] - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0` (effectively removing `a[1]`, leaving `[a[0]]`)\n6.  `instability2 = a[n-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] = 100000 - 100000 = 0` (effectively removing `a[0]`, leaving `[a[1]]`)\n7.  `min(0, 0) = 0`. Output: `0`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the edge case `n=2` because removing one element leaves an array with a single element, for which `max - min` is always `0`.\n\nThe time complexity is dominated by sorting, which is `O(N log N)`. Space complexity is `O(N)` for storing the array (or `O(1)` if sorting in-place and input can be modified). Given `N <= 10^5`, `N log N` is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Case 1: Remove the largest element (a[n-1])\n    # The remaining array's max will be a[n-2], min will be a[0]\n    instability1 = a[n-2] - a[0]\n\n    # Case 2: Remove the smallest element (a[0])\n    # The remaining array's max will be a[n-1], min will be a[1]\n    instability2 = a[n-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(instability1, instability2))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
