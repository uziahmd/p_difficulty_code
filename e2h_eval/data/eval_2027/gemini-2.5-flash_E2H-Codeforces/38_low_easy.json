    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Optimization Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. My goal is to figure out two things: the absolute smallest number of nodes (`n`) needed to construct a \"p-reachable\" directed graph, and then, within the set of all graphs using that minimum `n`, I want the one with the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's dissect this. \"Reachable from each other\" means there's a directed path both ways between two nodes (`u` and `v`), and importantly, the problem stipulates `u < v`. This implies they're within the same strongly connected component (SCC). If two nodes are in the same SCC, they are reachable from each other, satisfying the `u < v` constraint.\n\nNow, if I have an SCC with size `k`, any pair of distinct nodes within it satisfies this condition. The number of such pairs is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. So, let's say I have SCCs with sizes `k1, k2, ... km`, totaling `n` nodes. The total number of reachable pairs will be the sum of `ki * (ki - 1) / 2` for each SCC. This sum is equal to `p`.\n\nTo minimize `n` for a given `p`, I need to maximize the `k` values, because the formula grows quadratically. This means I want fewer, larger SCCs rather than many small ones. For example, if `p = 3`, a single SCC of size 3 (which gives 3 pairs) is much more efficient than using three SCCs of size 2 (which gives 3 pairs). It's evident the former uses the minimum value for `n`.\n\nTherefore, I need to try using one large SCC.  I can express this using an equation: `k * (k - 1) / 2 = p`.  I need to find the smallest integer value of `k` which holds true. Since `k * (k - 1) / 2` is a monotonically increasing function, I just need to find the smallest `k` that satisfies this relation, which can be found by solving the quadratic: `k^2 - k - 2p = 0`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all `p`-reachable directed graphs with this minimum `n`, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is **reachable from each other** if there's a path from `u` to `v` and a path from `v` to `u`. This means `u` and `v` are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n- A directed graph is **`p`-reachable** if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is **unidirectional** if `u \\neq v`, there exists a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nLet the graph have `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m`. The total number of nodes is `n = k_1 + k_2 + \\ldots + k_m`.\nFor any SCC of size `k_i`, all `k_i` nodes are mutually reachable. The number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` within this SCC is `k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2`.\nThe total number of such pairs in the graph is `P = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2`. We are given `P = p`.\n\nTo minimize `n` for a fixed `p`, we should make the `k_i` values as large as possible. This is because the function `f(k) = k * (k-1) / 2` grows quadratically with `k`. Using fewer, larger SCCs is more efficient in terms of nodes than using many small SCCs to achieve the same `p`.\nFor example, to get `p=3`:\n- One SCC of size `k=3`: `3 * 2 / 2 = 3`. Total nodes `n=3`.\n- Three SCCs of size `k=2`: `3 * (2 * 1 / 2) = 3`. Total nodes `n=6`.\nThe first option gives a smaller `n`.\n\nSo, the strategy is to find the largest possible `k` such that `k * (k-1) / 2 \\le p`. Let this `k` be `k_1`.\nThe remaining `p'` value is `p' = p - k_1 * (k_1 - 1) / 2`.\nThen we repeat the process for `p'` to find `k_2`, and so on, until `p` becomes 0.\nThe minimum `n` will be the sum of these `k_i` values.\n\nLet's find the largest `k` such that `k * (k-1) / 2 \\le p`.\nWe can use binary search or solve the quadratic inequality `k^2 - k - 2p \\le 0`.\nThe positive root of `k^2 - k - 2p = 0` is `(1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2`.\nSo, `k_1 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2 \\rfloor`.\nHowever, this `k_1` might make `k_1 * (k_1 - 1) / 2` slightly larger than `p`.\nA simpler way is to iterate `k` starting from 1 until `k * (k-1) / 2 > p`. The previous `k-1` is our `k_1`.\nSince `p \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5`, `k` will be at most around `\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 10^5} \\approx 632`. This is small enough for a loop.\n\nAlgorithm for minimum `n`:\n1. Initialize `min_n = 0`.\n2. While `p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k-1) / 2 \\le p`.\n      This can be done by iterating `k` from 1 upwards.\n      `current_k = 0`\n      `while current_k * (current_k - 1) / 2 <= p:`\n          `current_k += 1`\n      `k_found = current_k - 1`\n      (A more direct way: `k_found = int((1 + (1 + 8*p)**0.5) / 2)`. Then check if `k_found * (k_found - 1) / 2 > p`, if so, `k_found -= 1`. This is more robust against floating point issues.)\n   b. Add `k_found` to `min_n`.\n   c. Subtract `k_found * (k_found - 1) / 2` from `p`.\n3. The final `min_n` is the answer.\n\nExample: `p = 3`\n1. `p=3`. Find `k`:\n   `k=1`: `1*0/2 = 0 \\le 3`\n   `k=2`: `2*1/2 = 1 \\le 3`\n   `k=3`: `3*2/2 = 3 \\le 3`\n   `k=4`: `4*3/2 = 6 > 3`. So `k_found = 3`.\n2. `min_n = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n3. `p = 3 - (3*2/2) = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n4. `p=0`, loop ends. `min_n = 3`.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n1. `p=4`. Find `k`:\n   `k_found = 3` (from above, `3*2/2 = 3 \\le 4`).\n2. `min_n = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n3. `p = 4 - (3*2/2) = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n4. `p=1`. Find `k`:\n   `k=1`: `1*0/2 = 0 \\le 1`\n   `k=2`: `2*1/2 = 1 \\le 1`\n   `k=3`: `3*2/2 = 3 > 1`. So `k_found = 2`.\n5. `min_n = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n6. `p = 1 - (2*1/2) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n7. `p=0`, loop ends. `min_n = 5`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nA unidirectional pair `(u, v)` means there's a path `u \\to v` but no path `v \\to u`. This happens when `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `u`'s SCC to `v`'s SCC in the condensation graph (DAG of SCCs).\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we want to maximize paths between distinct SCCs, while minimizing reverse paths. This is achieved by arranging the SCCs in a linear chain (a topological sort).\nLet the SCCs be `S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_m` with sizes `k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m`.\nWe can arrange them such that there are paths from `S_i` to `S_j` if `i < j`, and no paths from `S_j` to `S_i` if `i < j`. This is done by adding edges from every node in `S_i` to every node in `S_{i+1}` (or just one edge from one node in `S_i` to one node in `S_{i+1}`).\nFor any `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` with `i < j`:\n- There is a path `u \\to v`.\n- There is no path `v \\to u` (because `S_j` comes after `S_i` in the topological order).\nSo, all `k_i \\times k_j` pairs `(u, v)` with `u \\in S_i, v \\in S_j, i < j` are unidirectional.\n\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i \\cdot k_j`.\nThis sum can be rewritten as:\n`(\\sum_{i=1}^m k_i)^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i^2`\n`-------------------------------------`\n`2`\nThis is `(n^2 - \\sum k_i^2) / 2`.\n\nTo maximize this value for a fixed `n`, we need to minimize `\\sum k_i^2`.\nFor a fixed sum `n = \\sum k_i`, `\\sum k_i^2` is minimized when the `k_i` values are as close to each other as possible.\nHowever, our `k_i` values are determined by the greedy strategy for minimizing `n`. These `k_i` values are generally not close to each other (e.g., `p=4` gives `k_1=3, k_2=2`).\nSo, we use the `k_i` values found in Part 1.\n\nAlgorithm for maximum unidirectional pairs:\n1. Re-calculate the `k_i` values using the same greedy strategy as in Part 1. Store them in a list `K = [k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m]`.\n2. Calculate `max_unidirectional_pairs = 0`.\n3. For each pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `0 \\le i < j < len(K)`:\n   `max_unidirectional_pairs += K[i] * K[j]`.\n4. The final `max_unidirectional_pairs` is the answer.\n\nExample: `p = 3`\n1. `min_n = 3`. The SCC sizes are `K = [3]`.\n2. `max_unidirectional_pairs = 0` (only one SCC, no pairs `k_i * k_j` for `i < j`).\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n1. `min_n = 5`. The SCC sizes are `K = [3, 2]`.\n2. `max_unidirectional_pairs = K[0] * K[1] = 3 * 2 = 6`.\n\nExample: `p = 0`\n1. `min_n = 0`. (No nodes needed if `p=0`). The SCC sizes are `K = []`.\n2. `max_unidirectional_pairs = 0`.\n\n**Implementation details:**\nThe maximum `p` is `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nThe maximum `k` will be around 632.\nThe number of SCCs `m` will be small. If all `k_i=2` (smallest non-trivial SCC), `p = m \\cdot 1`, so `m = p = 2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nHowever, `k_i` values are maximized, so `m` will be much smaller.\nFor `p=2 \\cdot 10^5`, `k_1 \\approx 632`. `p_remaining = 2 \\cdot 10^5 - 632 \\cdot 631 / 2 \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^5 - 199396 = 604`.\nThen `k_2 \\approx \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 604} \\approx 34`. `p_remaining \\approx 604 - 34 \\cdot 33 / 2 = 604 - 561 = 43`.\nThen `k_3 \\approx \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 43} \\approx 9`. `p_remaining \\approx 43 - 9 \\cdot 8 / 2 = 43 - 36 = 7`.\nThen `k_4 \\approx \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 7} \\approx 4`. `p_remaining \\approx 7 - 4 \\cdot 3 / 2 = 7 - 6 = 1`.\nThen `k_5 = 2`. `p_remaining = 1 - 2 \\cdot 1 / 2 = 0`.\nSo, for `p=2 \\cdot 10^5`, we have `m=5` SCCs.\nThe number of `k_i` values is very small, so `O(m^2)` for unidirectional pairs is fine.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    scc_sizes = []\n    current_p = p\n    min_nodes = 0\n\n    # Calculate minimum nodes and the sizes of SCCs\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p\n        # k^2 - k - 2*current_p <= 0\n        # Roots of k^2 - k - 2*current_p = 0 are (1 +/- sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2\n        # We need the positive root, and floor it\n        k = int((1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2)\n        \n        # Adjust k if k*(k-1)/2 is too large (due to float precision or floor behavior)\n        if k * (k - 1) // 2 > current_p:\n            k -= 1\n        \n        # If k is 0 or 1, it means we can't form any pairs, but we might need a node for current_p = 0 or 1.\n        # k=1 gives 0 pairs, k=2 gives 1 pair.\n        # If current_p = 1, k should be 2.
