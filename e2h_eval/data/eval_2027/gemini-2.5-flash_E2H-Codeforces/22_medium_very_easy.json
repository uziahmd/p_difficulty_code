After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Marks Problem - Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this \"Marks\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python script to solve it. It seems straightforward enough. We have `n` students and `m` subjects, and each student gets a mark from '1' to '9' in each subject. The goal is to find how many students are considered \"successful.\" A student is successful if they're the best at *at least one* subject – meaning they got the highest mark for that subject.\n\nMy initial thought is to represent the gradebook as a 2D structure, probably a list of lists or a list of strings. Since the marks are single characters, storing them as strings is fine, and it avoids the need for explicit integer conversion.  `gradebook[i][j]` will hold the mark for student `i` in subject `j`.\n\nThe main algorithm will involve two nested loops: one to find the maximum mark for each subject and another to identify the students who achieved that maximum. First, I'll need to iterate through each subject (the columns of the gradebook) from `j = 0` to `m-1`. For each subject, I'll iterate through all the students (rows) from `i = 0` to `n-1` to find the `max_mark_for_subject_j`.\n\nThen, I'll need a way to keep track of successful students. A boolean array (or a set, as I later realized is more efficient) `is_successful[n]` initialized to `False` seems like a good approach. After finding the maximum mark for a subject, I'll iterate through the students again. If a student's mark matches the maximum, I mark them as successful in `is_successful`.\n\nFinally, to get the total number of successful students, I'll just count how many `True` values are in the `is_successful` array, or I can use the length of the set if I decide to use one.\n\nI'm thinking, for the implementation, I can read `n` and `m` first. Then I'll populate the `gradebook` list.  Inside the nested loops, finding the `max_mark` for each subject and identifying successful students should be pretty easy to implement.  To be efficient I should use a set to store the student indices since it will eliminate redundant successful students.  For the edge cases I can see the code would work for `n=1`, `m=1`, the case where all students get the same marks etc.\n\nLooking at the constraints, the loops are `O(n*m)`, and that's well within the limits, so the overall complexity should be `O(n*m)`. It's a clean solution and seems quite optimized for this particular problem. I'll test it out and make sure it handles all cases. I'm quite happy with this!\n",
