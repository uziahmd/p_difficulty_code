            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My thinking on solving the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to write a Python script that figures out if we can connect Rebel spaceships to bases without those connection paths crossing. The input gives us the number of Rebels (`R`) and Bases (`B`), and then their coordinates.  First things first: if `R` and `B` aren't equal, we immediately output \"No\" because a perfect match is impossible. The problem says `R` and `B` are small (at most 10), which is a huge hint towards brute-force – trying out all possible ways to match ships and bases.\n\nThe core idea is geometric:  two segments intersect if their endpoints are on opposite sides of each other's lines. The problem cleverly simplifies things by guaranteeing that no three points are ever on a straight line and no points coincide, avoiding annoying edge cases of segments overlapping or endpoints sitting on lines.\n\nSince `R` and `B` can go up to 10,  there are a maximum of 10! (factorial) possible matchings to check.  10! is still manageable for computers, so generating and checking these is feasible. For each matching, we'll create the line segments from ships to bases and test all pairs of segments for intersection. Checking two segments for intersection involves some simple arithmetic (orientation calculation using cross-products or something similar).\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  Read `R`, `B`, and all the coordinates into lists.\n2.  If `R != B`, print \"No\".\n3.  Generate all permutations of how to connect ships to bases (using `itertools.permutations`).\n4.  For each permutation, build the segments.\n5.  Check every pair of these segments to see if they intersect using an optimized geometric intersection test.\n6.  If no intersections, print \"Yes\" and stop.\n7.  If all permutations result in intersections, print \"No\".\n\nThe key function is the intersection check:  Given two segments, we need to test if they cross. We can use the cross product/orientation method to do this. The problem's \"no three points collinear\" guarantee means we don't have to worry about the segments just barely touching or being on top of each other.  I'll define an `orientation()` function that'll tell me if three points are in a clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear arrangement. I can use its output to check if two segments are on opposite sides, which determines if an intersection occurs. I'll make sure to get the cross-product convention right, though.\n\nI will use Python tuples `(x, y)` to represent coordinates and the standard geometric algorithms for intersection detection, and I'll use Python's built-in permutations to loop through all configurations of matching.\n\nMy algorithm seems solid. Now, let's turn it into a working Python script.\n",
