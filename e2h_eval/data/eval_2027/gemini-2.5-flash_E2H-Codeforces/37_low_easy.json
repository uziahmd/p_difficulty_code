Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 22) — the size of the array.The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of the array.\n\n## Output\nIf there is no such array b, print -1.Otherwise in the only line print n space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn.

Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**The Gluttony Problem: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Gluttony\" problem, and my first instinct is to dive deep into the problem statement.  We're given an array `a` of distinct integers and need to construct a permutation `b` that satisfies a rather stringent condition: the sum of any non-empty proper subset of `a` must *not* equal the sum of the same subset in `b`.  The constraints, `n` up to 22 and values up to 10^9, are in the realm of manageable, but the subset condition is where the real complexity lies.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down this condition. Let `sum_a(S)` represent the sum of elements in subset `S` from `a`, and `sum_b(S)` for the same in `b`. We need to ensure `sum_a(S) != sum_b(S)` for *every* possible `S` (excluding the empty set and the full array).\n\nThe critical observation here is that to satisfy this, `b` needs to be \"significantly\" different from `a`. Intuitively, if `b[i]` is far from `a[i]` for a lot of positions `i`, we might have a good shot.  My mind immediately jumps to cyclic shifts - the simplest non-trivial permutation. If `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`, will that work?\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of subset sums. If `sum_a(S) == sum_b(S)`, that means `sum_{i in S} a[i] == sum_{i in S} a[(i+1) % n]`.  Let's test this cyclic shift hypothesis.\n\nI'm running through the provided examples in my head. For `n=2`, with `a=[1, 2]`, it's trivial, and a cyclic shift `[2, 1]` works, as it satisfies the subset sum difference. But with `n=4` and `a=[1000, 100, 10, 1]`, a simple cyclic shift doesn't produce the output given in the example. The given example, `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`, seems to involve a reordering that isn't just a basic shift.  This suggests that cyclic shift alone might not be a general solution, and I'll need to explore other permutations, perhaps guided by a more sophisticated strategy. I need to dig deeper here and determine what more complex permutation could fulfill the condition.\n",
