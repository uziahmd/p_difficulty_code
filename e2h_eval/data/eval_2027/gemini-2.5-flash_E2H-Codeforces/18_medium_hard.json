The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this Frog Jumping problem. My goal is to write a Python script for an expert audience.**\n\nFirst, I recognize this as a dynamic programming or graph problem with a twist: the constraint that the frog can't jump outside the range [0, x]. The problem asks for the sum of reachable integers up to m, so I need to find an efficient way to calculate f(x) for many x values.\n\nThe core of f(x) is reachable points. I know the problem uses \"+a\" and \"-b\" jumps. The key is that the \"never outside [0, x]\" condition makes this non-trivial. Without this, I'm dealing with the Bezout identity and gcd(a,b).\n\nI can consider it a graph problem where nodes are integers and edges are jumps. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a natural fit.\n\nHowever, since m can be very large, a simple BFS for each x won't work. I'm searching for patterns in how f(x) changes with x.  It makes me think there's a relationship to the Frobenius Coin Problem.\n\nI'm considering a Dijkstra-like approach. Let `dist[k]` be the minimum X needed to reach k with all intermediate values <= X. This feels promising, but the complexity comes from finding what each state represents and how to compute `dist[k]`.\n\nHere's the problem: if I'm at a state (k, where I'm at), the new states become either (k+a, max(X, k+a)) or (k-b, max(X, k)). This makes Dijkstra tricky.\n\nThe trick could be to find a periodicity in f(x) that will allow a more optimized solution. If `g = gcd(a, b)` then I can try reducing the problem to f(x/g). Then maybe I can determine some upper bound value on X past which further points become reachable.\n\nAfter thinking about Dijkstra a bit more, I should be able to create a table to calculate the number of reachable states for all x and then return the sum. The key insight is that since a and b are small, the states become a finite set.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `S = sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach within the interval `[0, x]`, starting from `0` and making jumps of `+a` or `-b`. The crucial constraint is that *all intermediate positions* must also stay within `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable points must be multiples of `g`.\nWe can simplify the problem by dividing `a, b` by `g`. Let `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`.\nIf the frog can reach `p'` within `[0, x']` using `a', b'`, then it can reach `p = p'*g` within `[0, x = x'*g]` using `a, b`.\nSo, `f(x)` is the number of reachable multiples of `g` in `[0, x]`, which is equivalent to `f'(floor(x/g))`, where `f'` is for `a', b'`.\nThe sum `sum(f(i) for i=0 to m)` can be rewritten using this:\n`sum(f'(floor(i/g)) for i=0 to m)`.\nLet `k = floor(i/g)`. For a given `k`, `f'(k)` contributes to `f(i)` for `i` in `[k*g, (k+1)*g - 1]`.\nThe number of such `i` values is `g`. However, we only sum up to `m`.\nSo, `f'(k)` contributes `min(g, m - k*g + 1)` times.\nThe sum becomes `sum(f'(k) * min(g, m - k*g + 1) for k=0 to floor(m/g))`.\nLet `M = floor(m/g)`. The sum is `sum(f'(k) * (m - k*g + 1) for k=0 to M)`.\nFor `k < M`, `m - k*g + 1 >= g`, so `min(g, m - k*g + 1) = g`.\nFor `k = M`, `min(g, m - M*g + 1) = m - M*g + 1`.\nSo, `sum(f(i) for i=0 to m) = g * sum(f'(k) for k=0 to M-1) + f'(M) * (m - M*g + 1)`.\nThis allows us to work with `a', b'` where `gcd(a', b') = 1` and `M` instead of `m`. Let's use `a, b, m` for `a', b', M` from now on.\n\nNow we assume `gcd(a, b) = 1`.\nLet `dist[p]` be the minimum `X` such that `p` is reachable from `0`, and all intermediate points are in `[0, X]`.\nWe can compute `dist[p]` for `p` from `0` up to `a+b-1` (or a slightly larger bound like `2*max(a,b)` or `a+b`). This is because the Frobenius number for `x*a - y*b` is roughly `a*b`. The maximum value of `a,b` is `10^5`, so `a*b` is too large. However, `a+b` is `2*10^5`.\n`dist[p]` can be found using Dijkstra's algorithm. The states are `0, ..., K` where `K` is our chosen bound.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, and `dist[p] = infinity` for `p > 0`.\nUse a min-priority queue `pq`. Add `(0, 0)` to `pq` (cost, node).\nWhen extracting `(current_X, u)` from `pq`:\n1. If `current_X > dist[u]`, continue (already found a better path).\n2. Consider jumping `+a`: `v = u + a`.\n   `new_X = max(current_X, v)`.\n   If `v <= K` and `new_X < dist[v]`:\n     `dist[v] = new_X`, add `(new_X, v)` to `pq`.\n3. Consider jumping `-b`: `v = u - b`.\n   `new_X = max(current_X, u)`. (Since `v < u`, `v` cannot be the new maximum unless `u` was already the max).\n   If `v >= 0` and `new_X < dist[v]`:\n     `dist[v] = new_X`, add `(new_X, v)` to `pq`.\n\nThe maximum value for `K` we need to compute `dist[p]` for is `a+b-1`.\nWhy `a+b-1`? If `gcd(a, b) = 1`, then any integer `N >= (a-1)(b-1)` can be expressed as `xa + yb`.\nFor `xa - yb`, any `N >= 0` can be expressed as `xa - yb` if `gcd(a,b)=1` and `N` is large enough.\nA known result states that for `gcd(a,b)=1`, any integer `p >= b` can be reached from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, such that all intermediate points are in `[0, p]`, if `p` is sufficiently large.\nSpecifically, if `p >= a+b-1`, then `dist[p] = p`.\nLet's use `K = max(a, b) + a + b` as a safe upper bound for the Dijkstra states. Let this be `MAX_DIST_CALC`.\n`MAX_DIST_CALC` can be up to `10^5 + 10^5 + 10^5 = 3 * 10^5`. Dijkstra on `3*10^5` nodes is feasible.\n\nAfter computing `dist[p]` for `p` from `0` to `MAX_DIST_CALC`:\n`f(x)` is the count of `p` in `[0, x]` such that `dist[p] <= x`.\nFor `x` up to `MAX_DIST_CALC`:\nWe can precompute `f(x)` values. Let `reachable_count[x]` be `f(x)`.\n`reachable_count[x] = reachable_count[x-1]` if `x` is not reachable (i.e., `dist[x] > x`).\n`reachable_count[x] = reachable_count[x-1] + 1` if `x` is reachable (i.e., `dist[x] <= x`).\nThis can be computed by iterating `x` from `0` to `MAX_DIST_CALC`.\n`f(0) = 1` (only 0 is reachable).\nFor `x = 1` to `MAX_DIST_CALC`:\n  `f(x) = f(x-1)`\n  If `dist[x] <= x`: `f(x) += 1`\n\nNow we need to calculate `sum(f(i) for i=0 to m)`.\nWe have `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `MAX_DIST_CALC`. Sum these directly.\nFor `i > MAX_DIST_CALC`:\nIf `i >= MAX_DIST_CALC`, then `dist[i] = i`. This means `i` is always reachable within `[0, i]`.\nSo for `i >= MAX_DIST_CALC`, `f(i) = f(i-1) + 1`.\nThis implies `f(i) = f(MAX_DIST_CALC) + (i - MAX_DIST_CALC)`.\nThis is an arithmetic progression.\nLet `C = MAX_DIST_CALC`.\nThe total sum is `sum(f(i) for i=0 to C) + sum(f(C) + (i-C) for i=C+1 to m)`.\nThe second sum is `sum(f(C) - C + i for i=C+1 to m)`.\nLet `base = f(C) - C`.\nThe sum is `sum(base + i for i=C+1 to m)`.\nThis is `base * (m - C) + sum(i for i=C+1 to m)`.\n`sum(i for i=C+1 to m) = (m * (m+1) / 2) - (C * (C+1) / 2)`.\nAll calculations should use integer division for `m*(m+1)/2`.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Read `m, a, b`.\n2. Calculate `common_divisor = gcd(a, b)`.\n3. Update `m_prime = m // common_divisor`, `a_prime = a // common_divisor`, `b_prime = b // common_divisor`.\n4. Define `K = a_prime + b_prime + max(a_prime, b_prime)`. This is a sufficiently large bound. `K` can be up to `3 * 10^5`.\n5. Initialize `dist = [infinity] * (K + 1)`. `dist[0] = 0`.\n6. Use a min-priority queue `pq`. Add `(0, 0)` to `pq`.\n7. Run Dijkstra:\n   While `pq` is not empty:\n     `current_X, u = heapq.heappop(pq)`\n     If `current_X > dist[u]`, continue.\n     // Jump `+a_prime`\n     `v_plus = u + a_prime`\n     `new_X_plus = max(current_X, v_plus)`\n     If `v_plus <= K` and `new_X_plus < dist[v_plus]`:\n       `dist[v_plus] = new_X_plus`\n       `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_X_plus, v_plus))`\n     // Jump `-b_prime`\n     `v_minus = u - b_prime`\n     `new_X_minus = max(current_X, u)`\n     If `v_minus >= 0` and `new_X_minus < dist[v_minus]`:\n       `dist[v_minus] = new_X_minus`\n       `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_X_minus, v_minus))`\n8. Calculate `f_prime_values = [0] * (K + 1)`.\n   `f_prime_values[0] = 1`.\n   For `x = 1` to `K`:\n     `f_prime_values[x] = f_prime_values[x-1]`\n     If `dist[x] <= x`: `f_prime_values[x] += 1`\n9. Calculate the total sum `total_sum = 0`.\n   For `i = 0` to `min(m_prime, K)`:\n     `total_sum += f_prime_values[i]`\n   If `m_prime > K`:\n     `base = f_prime_values[K] - K`\n     `num_terms = m_prime - K`\n     `sum_arith = base * num_terms + (K + 1 + m_prime) * num_terms // 2`\n     `total_sum += sum_arith`\n10. Multiply `total_sum` by `common_divisor`. This is the final answer.\n\nExample 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`\n1. `g = gcd(5,3) = 1`.\n2. `m_prime=7, a_prime=5, b_prime=3`.\n3. `K = 5+3+max(5,3) = 8+5 = 13`.
