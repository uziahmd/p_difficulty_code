Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem. My primary goal here is to determine whether a non-intersecting matching is possible between rebel spaceships and bases. Given the constraints, I'm thinking a brute-force approach, maybe checking all permutations, is the way to go. The limits on the number of ships and bases (R, B <= 10) screams \"brute force is acceptable.\" The fact that no three points are collinear is a huge simplification, I'll keep that in mind.\n\n**Intersection Check is the Core**\n\nThe real heart of this problem is the segment intersection check. We need a reliable way to determine if two line segments, one connecting a rebel ship to a base, would cross each other. This is the crucial step. I recall the standard \"straddle\" test. It looks like the most straightforward way to detect intersection, and I will be using the orientation function in my implementation. I'll need to remember the order of the points to make that work.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Implementation**\n\nThe core idea is clear:\n1.  If the number of rebels does not equal the number of bases, report \"No\" and terminate.\n2.  Iterate through every possible pairing (permutation) of rebels and bases, trying to form a perfect matching.\n3.  For each pairing (permutation), check if the lines connecting the rebels to bases intersect.\n4.  If I find a non-intersecting matching at any permutation, print \"Yes\" and terminate.\n5.  If all permutations result in intersecting segments, then print \"No.\"\n\nThe main function `solve` will handle the overall flow, with `do_intersect` as the primary helper to check for intersections.\n\n**Simplified Intersection with Orientation**\n\nThe key to simplifying `do_intersect` is the constraint that \"no three points are on the same line.\" Thanks to this, I don't need to explicitly handle collinear cases with `on_segment`, it simplifies the intersection check significantly.\n\n**Orientation Function and Data Structure**\n\nMy `orientation` function will be the cornerstone. The value helps determine if three points form a clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear orientation. With the guaranteed lack of collinear points, I can simplify the `orientation` to return only 1 or 2, representing CCW or CW. Points will be represented as tuples `(x, y)`.\n\n**Testing and Optimization**\n\nI have to carefully test my implementation with provided examples to verify the accuracy of the intersection check. Also, I'll check some edge cases. The overall time complexity of this approach will be `O(B! * R^2)`. It should be good enough for this easy problem! I should be able to get a solution quickly, so I'll go ahead and build the code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship guards exactly one base and each base is guarded by exactly one spaceship (a perfect matching), and no two paths (straight lines from a base to its assigned spaceship) intersect. The constraints `R, B <= 10` are very small, suggesting that a brute-force approach iterating through all possible assignments might be feasible.\n\n**1. Basic Check:**\nFirst, a perfect matching is only possible if the number of Rebel spaceships `R` is equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, we can immediately output \"No\".\n\n**2. Brute-Force Strategy:**\nIf `R = B = N`, we need to find a permutation of bases to assign to the Rebel spaceships. Let `rebel_ships` be a list of `N` spaceship coordinates and `bases` be a list of `N` base coordinates. We can iterate through all `N!` permutations of indices `(0, 1, ..., N-1)`. For each permutation `P`, we form `N` segments: `(rebel_ships[i], bases[P[i]])` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n\n**3. Intersection Check:**\nFor each set of `N` segments formed by a permutation, we need to check if any two segments intersect.\nTwo line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if and only if:\n*   `p1` and `q1` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `(p2, q2)`.\n*   `p2` and `q2` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `(p1, q1)`.\n\nThis condition can be checked using the concept of \"orientation\" (or cross product). The `orientation(p, q, r)` function determines whether points `p, q, r` are collinear, clockwise, or counter-clockwise.\n\n*   `orientation(p, q, r)`:\n    Calculate `val = (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)`.\n    *   If `val > 0`, points are in counter-clockwise order.\n    *   If `val < 0`, points are in clockwise order.\n    *   If `val == 0`, points are collinear.\n\nThe problem statement guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\". This is a crucial simplification:\n*   It means `orientation(p, q, r)` will *never* return `0` for distinct points `p, q, r`.\n*   It also means we don't need to worry about degenerate intersection cases like segments overlapping or touching at an internal point. Any intersection will be a clear crossing.\n\nSo, the `do_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)` function simplifies to:\n1.  Calculate `o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)`.\n2.  Calculate `o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)`.\n3.  Calculate `o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)`.\n4.  Calculate `o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)`.\n5.  If `o1 != o2` AND `o3 != o4`, then the segments intersect. Otherwise, they do not.\n\n**4. Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n3.  Read `R` spaceship coordinates into a list `rebel_ships`.\n4.  Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n5.  For each permutation `P` of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` (where `N=R=B`):\n    a.  Create a list of `N` segments, where the `i`-th segment connects `rebel_ships[i]` to `bases[P[i]]`.\n    b.  Assume `intersects_found = False`.\n    c.  For every unique pair of segments `(segment_j, segment_k)` in the list:\n        i.  Call `do_intersect(segment_j.p1, segment_j.q1, segment_k.p1, segment_k.q1)`.\n        ii. If they intersect, set `intersects_found = True` and break from the inner loops.\n    d.  If `intersects_found` is still `False` after checking all pairs, it means this permutation provides a valid non-intersecting matching. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n6.  If all permutations are checked and none yield a valid matching, print \"No\".\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   `N` is up to 10.\n*   Number of permutations: `N!`. For `N=10`, this is `3,628,800`.\n*   For each permutation, we check `N * (N-1) / 2` pairs of segments. For `N=10`, this is `45` pairs.\n*   Each intersection check involves 4 orientation calculations, which are constant time arithmetic operations.\n*   Total operations: `O(N! * N^2)`. For `N=10`, this is roughly `3.6 * 10^6 * 10^2 = 3.6 * 10^8`. This is on the higher side for typical time limits (usually `10^8` operations per second), but for simple integer arithmetic and Python's `itertools.permutations`, it often passes within limits for \"easy\" problems with such small `N`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# Helper function to determine the orientation of an ordered triplet (p, q, r)\n# Returns 1 if counter-clockwise (CCW), 2 if clockwise (CW).\n# Due to problem constraints (\"no three points are on the same line\"),\n# it will never return 0 (collinear).\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # Calculate the cross product (q - p) x (r - q)\n    # (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n          (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    \n    # Since no three points are collinear, val will never be 0.\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2 # 1 for CCW, 2 for CW\n\n# Helper function to check if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect\ndef do_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Find the four orientations needed for general case\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if all orientations are different\n    # and they \"straddle\" each other.\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Given the constraint \"no three points are on the same line\",\n    # the special cases (collinear points, endpoints on other segments)\n    # that would typically need `on_segment` checks cannot occur.\n    # Therefore, if the general case is not met, they do not intersect.\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # A perfect matching is only possible if R == B\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    rebel_ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        rebel_ships.append((x, y))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n\n    # Iterate through all permutations of base assignments.\n    # A permutation `p_indices` means rebel_ships[i] is connected to bases[p_indices[i]].\n    # itertools.permutations generates tuples of indices, e.g., (0, 1, 2) for N=3.\n    for p_indices in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            # Create a segment from the i-th rebel ship to the base specified by p_indices[i]\n            segments.append((rebel_ships[i], bases[p_indices[i]]))\n\n        intersects_found = False\n        # Check for intersections among all unique pairs of segments\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R): # Compare segment `i` with segment `j` (where j > i)\n                seg1_p1, seg1_q1 = segments[i]\n                seg2_p1, seg2_q1 = segments[j]\n                \n                if do_intersect(seg1_p1, seg1_q1, seg2_p1, seg2_q1):\n                    intersects_found = True\n                    break # Found an intersection, no need to check further pairs for this permutation\n            if intersects_found:\n                break # Break from outer loop as well if intersection found\n\n        # If no intersections were found for this permutation, we have a valid matching\n        if not intersects_found:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    # If no permutation yielded a non-intersecting matching after checking all possibilities\n    print(\"No\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
