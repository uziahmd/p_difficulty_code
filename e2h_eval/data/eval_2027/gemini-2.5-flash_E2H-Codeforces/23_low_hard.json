            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment: Tokitsukaze and Mahjong**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle this \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem. The core of it seems straightforward: figure out the fewest extra tiles required to complete at least one \"mentsu\" (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) starting with just three tiles.\n\nI'm thinking, right off the bat, I need to represent these tiles in a structured way. Each tile has a number and a suit. I'll probably represent them as tuples, like `(number, suit)`.  Makes it much easier to work with, especially when I'm comparing and sorting them.\n\nThe problem implies I need to check for zero, one, or two draws.  It's a process of elimination: can I make a mentsu with what I have?  If not, what if I draw once? If still nothing, two draws should do it.  The challenge is to find the most efficient way to determine the minimum number of draws.\n\nSo, the first step is parsing the input. I need to take those string representations of tiles (e.g., \"1m\", \"9s\") and convert them into my (number, suit) tuple format.  Integer for the number, of course.  Then, sorting those tuples seems like a good move. It will simplify checking for shuntsu because I can then just look at consecutive elements. For example, if I get `['3p', '9m', '2p']`, I'll transform it into `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`.\n\nNow, onto checking for zero draws.  I need to see if the initial three tiles *already* form a mentsu.  That breaks down into two cases:\n\n*   **Koutsu:** Are the three tiles identical?  A simple equality check should do the trick. `T1 == T2 and T2 == T3`.\n*   **Shuntsu:** Are they sequential *and* the same suit? First check that all the suits are the same, then if the numbers are sequential: `T1.suit == T2.suit == T3.suit` and  `T1.num + 1 == T2.num and T2.num + 1 == T3.num`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles (0, 1, or 2) Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu) from her hand. She starts with three tiles.\n\nA mentsu is either:\n1.  **Koutsu (triplet):** Three identical tiles (e.g., [1m, 1m, 1m]).\n2.  **Shuntsu (sequence):** Three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit (e.g., [1m, 2m, 3m]).\n\nWe need to check the possibilities in increasing order of draws: 0 draws, then 1 draw, then 2 draws.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. It's helpful to parse them into a more structured format, like `(number, suit)`. For example, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`. Sorting these parsed tiles can simplify checks for sequences.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nCan we form a mentsu with just the initial three tiles?\n*   **Koutsu:** Check if `t1 == t2` and `t2 == t3`.\n*   **Shuntsu:** Check if `t1.suit == t2.suit == t3.suit` AND `t1.num + 1 == t2.num` AND `t2.num + 1 == t3.num`.\nIf either condition is met, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, can we form a mentsu by drawing one additional tile? This means we need to find two tiles among the initial three that can form a koutsu or shuntsu with one more tile.\nLet the initial tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. We consider all pairs and all individual tiles.\n\n*   **To form a Koutsu:**\n    *   Do we have two identical tiles? E.g., `t1 == t2`. If so, drawing a third `t1` would form a koutsu.\n    *   This covers cases like `[1m, 1m, 2p]`. Draw `1m`.\n*   **To form a Shuntsu:**\n    *   Do we have two tiles of the same suit that are sequential? E.g., `t1.suit == t2.suit` and `t1.num + 1 == t2.num`. If so, drawing `t1.num - 1` (if valid, i.e., >= 1) or `t2.num + 1` (if valid, i.e., <= 9) would form a shuntsu.\n        *   Example `[1m, 2m, 5p]`. Draw `3m`.\n    *   Do we have two tiles of the same suit with a gap of 2? E.g., `t1.suit == t2.suit` and `t1.num + 2 == t2.num`. If so, drawing `t1.num + 1` would form a shuntsu.\n        *   Example `[1m, 3m, 5p]`. Draw `2m`.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws must be the answer. With two draws, we can always form a mentsu. For example, pick any tile `t1` from the hand, and draw two more tiles identical to `t1`. This forms a koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`. So, the maximum number of draws needed is 2.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n1.  **Parsing and Sorting:**\n    Convert input strings `['1s', '2s', '3s']` into a list of tuples `[(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')]`.\n    Sort this list: `[(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')]` remains the same. `['3p', '9m', '2p']` becomes `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`. This sorting is crucial for easily checking sequences.\n2.  **Checking 0 draws:**\n    A direct check on the sorted list `[t1, t2, t3]` for koutsu (`t1==t2==t3`) or shuntsu (`t1.suit==t2.suit==t3.suit and t1.num+1==t2.num and t2.num+1==t3.num`).\n3.  **Checking 1 draw:**\n    Iterate through all unique pairs of tiles `(t_i, t_j)` from the initial three.\n    Also, consider each individual tile `t_i`.\n    *   **Koutsu:** If `t_i == t_j`, we need one more `t_i`.\n    *   **Shuntsu:**\n        *   If `t_i.suit == t_j.suit`:\n            *   If `t_i.num == t_j.num`: We have two identical tiles. We can draw `t_i.num-1` and `t_i.num+1` to form a sequence (e.g., `[1m, 1m, 2m, 3m]`). But this is not what we're looking for with 1 draw. This case is covered by the identical pair for koutsu (draw `t_i`).\n            *   If `abs(t_i.num - t_j.num) == 1`: E.g., `[1m, 2m]`. We can draw `3m` or `0m` (invalid) or `1m` (invalid). Specifically, draw `t_i.num-1` or `t_j.num+1`.\n            *   If `abs(t_i.num - t_j.num) == 2`: E.g., `[1m, 3m]`. We can draw `2m`.\n    A more robust way for 1 draw:\n    Consider all unique pairs `(t_i, t_j)` from the initial three tiles.\n    *   If `t_i == t_j`: 1 draw (draw `t_i`) to make a koutsu.\n    *   If `t_i.suit == t_j.suit`:\n        *   If `t_j.num - t_i.num == 1`: 1 draw (draw `t_i.num-1` or `t_j.num+1`) to make a shuntsu.\n        *   If `t_j.num - t_i.num == 2`: 1 draw (draw `t_i.num+1`) to make a shuntsu.\n    We can use a `set` to store the unique \"needed\" tiles for 1 draw. If the set is not empty, the answer is 1.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `3p 9m 2p`**\n1.  **Parse and Sort:** `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`\n2.  **0 Draws Check:**\n    *   Koutsu: `(2,'p') == (3,'p') == (9,'m')` is false.\n    *   Shuntsu: Suits are not all same. False.\n    Result: Not 0 draws.\n3.  **1 Draw Check:**\n    Pairs: `((2,'p'), (3,'p'))`, `((2,'p'), (9,'m'))`, `((3,'p'), (9,'m'))`.\n    *   Pair `((2,'p'), (3,'p'))`: Suits are same, numbers are `2, 3`. Difference is 1.\n        *   Can draw `1p` (to make `[1p, 2p, 3p]`).\n        *   Can draw `4p` (to make `[2p, 3p, 4p]`).\n        Since we found a way to form a shuntsu with 1 draw, the answer is 1.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for t_str in tiles_str:\n        num = int(t_str[0])\n        suit = t_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles.
