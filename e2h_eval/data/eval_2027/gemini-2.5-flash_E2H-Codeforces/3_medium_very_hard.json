Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. My goal is to write a Python script to find the smallest light radius (`d`) needed to illuminate a street of length `l` with `n` lanterns positioned at `a_i` locations.  The core challenge is ensuring every point on the street from 0 to `l` is lit.**\n\n**The Approach:**\n\n*   **Initial Setup:** I'll start by reading in the values of `n` and `l`. Then, I'll read the lantern positions `a_i` and sort them in ascending order. This sorting is critical because it allows me to reason about the gaps between lanterns more easily.\n\n*   **Identifying Critical Points:** The key is to identify the points on the street that need the most \"coverage.\" These are:\n    1.  The beginning of the street (0)\n    2.  The end of the street (`l`)\n    3.  The points halfway between each pair of adjacent lanterns.\n\n*   **Calculating the Radius:** To cover the entire street, the value of `d` must be large enough to handle the maximum of three cases:\n\n    1.  **The Starting Point:** The first lantern, `a[0]`, needs to light up the segment from 0 to itself. Therefore, `d` must be at least the value of `a[0]`.\n\n    2.  **The End Point:** Similarly, the last lantern `a[n-1]` must extend its light to `l`. So, `d` must be at least `l - a[n-1]`.\n\n    3.  **Gaps Between Lanterns:**  For any two adjacent lanterns, let's say at positions `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, the midpoint of the segment between them, `(a[i] + a[i+1]) / 2`, is the furthest point from both. To cover this point, `d` needs to be at least half the distance between the two lanterns: `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`.  I must find the largest of these gap distances among all adjacent lantern pairs.\n\n*   **The Solution:**  The final light radius `d` is then the maximum value obtained from the calculations described above.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  I'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` for faster input.\n2.  I'll store the `a_i` values in a sorted list.\n3.  I'll iterate through the sorted `a_i` array and track the maximum gap between lanterns.\n4.  I'll use `float()` to ensure that calculations involving division are performed with floating-point precision to avoid rounding errors.\n5.  Finally, I'll print the minimum required `d` with 10 decimal places as requested using the appropriate string formatting.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n*   **`n = 1`:**  If there's only one lantern, I have to ensure that its radius is sufficient to cover the distance from either the start or end of the street to the lantern's position.\n*   Lanterns at `0` or `l`: This is handled correctly because the logic of checking the distances from the start and end of the street works, but it's important to remember this edge case during calculations.\n\n**This approach provides a clear and correct solution to the problem. I'm confident in my solution!**\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns, located at given points `a_i` on a street of length `l` (from coordinate 0 to `l`), illuminate the entire street. Each lantern at `a_i` lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo ensure the entire street `[0, l]` is lit, we need to consider three types of critical segments that must be covered:\n\n1.  **The segment from the beginning of the street (0) to the first lantern.**\n    If the first lantern (after sorting the positions) is at `a_0`, it must cover the point 0. This means its light must extend at least `a_0` units to the left. So, `d` must be at least `a_0 - 0 = a_0`.\n\n2.  **The segments between any two adjacent lanterns.**\n    Consider two adjacent lanterns at `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (after sorting). The point that is furthest from both `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` within the gap `(a_i, a_{i+1})` is their midpoint: `(a_i + a_{i+1}) / 2`. To cover this midpoint, the light from `a_i` must reach it, meaning `a_i + d >= (a_i + a_{i+1}) / 2`, which simplifies to `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. Similarly, the light from `a_{i+1}` must reach it, meaning `a_{i+1} - d <= (a_i + a_{i+1}) / 2`, which also simplifies to `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. Thus, `d` must be at least half the distance between `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. We need to find the maximum such requirement among all adjacent pairs.\n\n3.  **The segment from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).**\n    If the last lantern (after sorting) is at `a_{n-1}`, it must cover the point `l`. This means its light must extend at least `l - a_{n-1}` units to the right. So, `d` must be at least `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\nThe minimum light radius `d` required to light the entire street will be the maximum of these three individual requirements.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`.\n2.  Read the `n` lantern positions into a list.\n3.  Sort the list of lantern positions in ascending order. Let the sorted positions be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n4.  Initialize a variable `max_d` to `0.0` (using a float to handle potential decimal values).\n5.  Calculate the `d` required for the first segment: `max_d = max(max_d, float(a[0]))`.\n6.  Iterate through the sorted lantern positions from `i = 0` to `n-2`:\n    Calculate the `d` required for the gap between `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`: `current_gap_d = float(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0`.\n    Update `max_d`: `max_d = max(max_d, current_gap_d)`.\n7.  Calculate the `d` required for the last segment: `max_d = max(max_d, float(l - a[n-1]))`.\n8.  Print `max_d` formatted to 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach covers all critical points and segments of the street, ensuring the minimum `d` is found.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n (number of lanterns) and l (length of the street)\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the lantern positions\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions to easily identify gaps and boundaries.\n    # This is crucial for the logic to work correctly.\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Initialize max_d, which will store the minimum required light radius.\n    # We use a float to handle potential decimal results, as d can be fractional.\n    max_d = 0.0\n\n    # Case 1: Distance from the beginning of the street (coordinate 0)\n    # to the first lantern (a[0]).\n    # The segment [0, a[0]] must be covered.
