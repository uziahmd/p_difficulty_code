Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon.\" I need a Python script to find three vertices of a regular n-gon that form an angle closest to a given target angle 'a'.  The input is the number of vertices 'n' and the target angle 'a'.  My output should be the indices of those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the geometry.  I know it's a regular n-gon, so all sides are equal, and all interior angles are equal.  I'm thinking about the properties of inscribed angles and central angles.  Since all vertices are on a circumcircle, the inscribed angle theorem will be key.  The central angle subtended by a side is 360/n degrees.  An inscribed angle is half of the central angle it intercepts.\n\nThe central idea is: fix one vertex, let's call it v2. Then I need to choose two other vertices, v1 and v3.  The angle v1-v2-v3 is what I need to calculate.  I'll start with v2 = 2. It does not matter what the actual vertex is as long as I can represent them. Let's fix v2. The difference in indices (mod n) between v1 and v3 determines the inscribed angle.\n\nI need to figure out how to calculate that angle.  I can express this angle using k, where k is the number of sides between v1 and v3 (excluding the sides v1-v2 and v2-v3 if you can think of sides the right way, that is). The central angle subtended by the arc not containing v2 between vertices v1 and v3 is k * (360/n). The angle v1-v2-v3 is half of this central angle, so (k * 360/n)/2 = k * (180/n).  I need k to represent the number of segments not including vertex 2, the fixed vertex.\n\nThe next step is to find an efficient way to iterate through possible combinations of v1, v2, v3, calculating the angle each time, and keeping track of the one that minimizes the absolute difference from 'a'. My focus is to find k, the number of sides subtending the arc between v1 and v3. I am wondering if iterating through values of k, from 1 to n-2, will give me all the possible angles. The angles are inscribed, meaning they are equal to k*(180/n).\n\nSince k should determine the angle, I will use a loop to iterate through all possible values of k. Then find which angle, k*(180/n) is closest to 'a'. I'll need to calculate the actual indices and return the result. I need to make sure the vertices are distinct.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular convex `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex) is as close as possible to a given target angle `a`. We need to output the 1-indexed labels of these vertices.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon:**\n\n1.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` (where `v2` is the angle's vertex) is an inscribed angle. Its measure is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the arc `v1-v3` (the arc that does not contain `v2`).\n\n2.  **Central Angle per Side:** In a regular `n`-gon, the central angle subtended by each side is `360 / n` degrees.\n\n3.  **Possible Angles:**\n    Let's fix `v2` as vertex 2 (we can pick any vertex for `v2` due to symmetry; vertex 2 is a convenient choice for 1-indexed labels).\n    Let `v1` be vertex 1.\n    Then `v3` must be some vertex `j`, where `j` is distinct from 1 and 2.\n    The arc intercepted by angle `1-2-j` is the arc `1-j` that does not contain vertex 2.\n    The number of sides along this arc `1-j` (clockwise from 1 to `j`, not passing through 2) determines the angle.\n    If there are `k` sides between `v1` and `v3` along this arc, the central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360 / n)`.\n    The inscribed angle `1-2-j` is `(k * (360 / n)) / 2 = k * (180 / n)`.\n\n    What are the possible values for `k`?\n    *   `k` represents the number of segments on the polygon's perimeter between `v1` and `v3` (excluding the path that goes through `v2`).\n    *   Since `v1`, `v2`, `v3` must be distinct, `k` cannot be 0.\n    *   The maximum number of segments between two vertices on one side of a diagonal is `n - 2`. For example, if `v1=1` and `v2=2`, then `v3` can be `3, 4, ..., n`.\n        *   If `v3=3`, the arc `1-3` (not containing 2) has 1 segment (1 side). `k=1`. Angle is `1 * (180 / n)`.\n        *   If `v3=4`, the arc `1-4` (not containing 2) has 2 segments. `k=2`. Angle is `2 * (180 / n)`.\n        *   ...\n        *   If `v3=n`, the arc `1-n` (not containing 2) has `n-2` segments. `k=n-2`. Angle is `(n-2) * (180 / n)`.\n\n    So, the possible angles are `k * (180 / n)` for `k` from `1` to `n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal Angle:**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` (where `1 <= k <= n-2`) such that `|k * (180 / n) - a|` is minimized.\n\nLet `base_angle = 180 / n`. The possible angles are `k * base_angle`.\nWe are looking for `k * base_angle` closest to `a`.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` such that `k` is closest to `a / base_angle`.\nLet `target_k_float = a / base_angle`.\n\nThe integer `k` closest to `target_k_float` would be `round(target_k_float)`.\nLet `k_candidate = round(target_k_float)`.\n\nWe must ensure `k_candidate` is within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n*   If `k_candidate < 1`, the closest valid `k` is 1.\n*   If `k_candidate > n-2`, the closest valid `k` is `n-2`.\n*   Otherwise, `k_candidate` is within the range.\n\nSo, the optimal `k` will be `max(1, min(n-2, round(a / (180/n))))`.\n\nHowever, `round()` might be ambiguous for `X.5`. For example, `round(2.5)` is usually 2 in Python 3 (round half to even). It's safer to check both `floor(target_k_float)` and `ceil(target_k_float)`.\n\nLet `k_lower = floor(target_k_float)` and `k_upper = ceil(target_k_float)`.\nWe need to consider `k_lower` and `k_upper`, ensuring they are within `[1, n-2]`.\nLet's filter them:\n`k_options = []`\nIf `k_lower >= 1` and `k_lower <= n-2`, add `k_lower` to `k_options`.\nIf `k_upper >= 1` and `k_upper <= n-2` and `k_upper != k_lower`, add `k_upper` to `k_options`.\n\nIf `k_options` is empty, it means `target_k_float` is outside `[1, n-2]`.\n*   If `target_k_float < 1`, the closest valid `k` is 1.\n*   If `target_k_float > n-2`, the closest valid `k` is `n-2`.\nIn these cases, `k_options` should just contain `1` or `n-2` respectively.\nA simpler way to handle this is to apply the bounds *after* finding the best `k`:\n`k_best_unbounded = round(target_k_float)`\n`k_final = max(1, min(n - 2, k_best_unbounded))`\n\nThis `k_final` gives us the number of sides on the arc.\nThe actual angle formed will be `k_final * (180 / n)`.\n\nTo handle the `round()` tie-breaking accurately, we can calculate the absolute difference for `floor` and `ceil` candidates.\nLet `k1 = floor(target_k_float)` and `k2 = ceil(target_k_float)`.\nWe need to consider `k1` and `k2` (if distinct) after clamping them to `[1, n-2]`.\n\nLet `k_cand1 = max(1, min(n - 2, floor(a * n / 180)))`\nLet `k_cand2 = max(1, min(n - 2, ceil(a * n / 180)))`\n\nCalculate the actual angles:\n`angle1 = k_cand1 * (180 / n)`\n`angle2 = k_cand2 * (180 / n)`\n\nCompare `|angle1 - a|` and `|angle2 - a|`.\nIf `|angle1 - a| <= |angle2 - a|`, then `k_optimal = k_cand1`.\nElse, `k_optimal = k_cand2`.\n\n**Outputting Vertices:**\n\nOnce `k_optimal` is found:\n*   `v2` can be vertex 2.\n*   `v1` can be vertex 1.\n*   `v3` should be `v2 + k_optimal` (clockwise). Since vertices are 1-indexed and `n` is the total count, `v3` will be `(2 + k_optimal - 1) % n + 1`.\n    A simpler way: `v3 = 2 + k_optimal`. (This assumes `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1, and `v3` is `k_optimal` steps clockwise from `v1` *relative to `v2`*, but the formula `k * (180/n)` assumes `k` sides between `v1` and `v3` *not passing `v2`*.\n    Let `v1=1`, `v2=2`.\n    If `k=1`, `v3=3`. Angle `1-2-3`.\n    If `k=2`, `v3=4`. Angle `1-2-4`.\n    ...\n    If `k=n-2`, `v3=n`. Angle `1-2-n`.\n    So, `v1=1`, `v2=2`, `v3 = 2 + k_optimal`.\n\nExample: `n=3, a=15`\n`base_angle = 180 / 3 = 60`.\nPossible `k` values: `1` to `n-2 = 3-2 = 1`. So `k=1`.\n`k_optimal = 1`.\nAngle is `1 * 60 = 60`.\nVertices: `1, 2, 2+1 = 3`. Output: `1 2 3`. Correct.\n\nExample: `n=4, a=67`\n`base_angle = 180 / 4 = 45`.\nPossible `k` values: `1` to `n-2 = 4-2 = 2`. So `k=1` or `k=2`.\nTarget `k_float = 67 / 45 = 1.488...`\n`k_cand1 = max(1, min(2, floor(1.488...))) = max(1, min(2, 1)) = 1`.\n`k_cand2 = max(1, min(2, ceil(1.488...))) = max(1, min(2, 2)) = 2`.\n\nAngles:\n`angle1 = 1 * 45 = 45`. Difference `|45 - 67| = 22`.\n`angle2 = 2 * 45 = 90`. Difference `|90 - 67| = 23`.\n`k_optimal = 1`.\nVertices: `1, 2, 2+1 = 3`. Output: `1 2 3`.\nThe example output is `2 1 3`. This is equivalent, just a different choice of `v1, v2, v3` (angle `3-1-2` is the same as `1-2-3` by symmetry). Any valid set of vertices is fine. My choice `1 2 3` is correct.\n\nExample: `n=4, a=68`\n`base_angle = 180 / 4 = 45`.\nTarget `k_float = 68 / 45 = 1.511...`\n`k_cand1 = max(1, min(2, floor(1.511...))) = max(1, min(2, 1)) = 1`.\n`k_cand2 = max(1, min(2, ceil(1.511...))) = max(1, min(2, 2)) = 2`.\n\nAngles:\n`angle1 = 1 * 45 = 45`. Difference `|45 - 68| = 23`.\n`angle2 = 2 * 45 = 90`. Difference `|90 - 68| = 22`.\n`k_optimal = 2`.\nVertices: `1, 2, 2+2 = 4`. Output: `1 2 4`.\nThe example output is `4 1 2`. This is equivalent. My choice `1 2 4` is correct.\n\nThe logic seems sound.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The base angle for one segment of the arc is 180/n degrees.\n    # An angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 (v2 being the vertex)\n    # has a measure of k * (180/n), where k is the number of sides\n    # on the arc v1-v3 that does not contain v2.\n    # The minimum k is 1 (for adjacent vertices like 1-2-3).\n    # The maximum k is n-2 (for vertices like 1-2-n).\n    # So k can range from 1 to n-2.\n\n    base_angle_per_segment = 180.0 / n\n\n    # We want to find k such that k * base_angle_per_segment is closest to 'a'.\n    # This means k should be close to a / base_angle_per_segment.\n    target_k_float = a / base_angle_per_segment\n\n    # Consider two candidate integer values for k: floor and ceil of target_k_float.\n    # We must also ensure k is within the valid range [1, n-2].\n    k_cand1 = math.floor(target_k_float)\n    k_cand2 = math.ceil(target_k_float)\n\n    # Clamp k_cand1 and k_cand2 to the valid range [1, n-2]\n    k_cand1 = max(1, min(n - 2, k_cand1))\n    k_cand2 = max(1, min(n - 2, k_cand2))\n\n    # Calculate the actual angles for these candidates\n    angle1 = k_cand1 * base_angle_per_segment\n    angle2 = k_cand2 * base_angle_per_segment\n\n    # Determine which k provides a closer angle to 'a'\n    diff1 = abs(angle1 - a)\n    diff2 = abs(angle2 - a)\n\n    optimal_k = 0\n    if diff1 <= diff2:\n        optimal_k = k_cand1\n    else:\n        optimal_k = k_cand2\n\n    # Output the vertices.\n    # We can fix v2 to be vertex 2.\n    # We can fix v1 to be vertex 1.\n    # Then v3 will be vertex (2 + optimal_k).\n    # This ensures v1, v2, v3 are distinct and form the desired angle.\n    # v1 = 1, v2 = 2, v3 = 2 + optimal_k\n    # For example, if optimal_k=1, v3=3.
