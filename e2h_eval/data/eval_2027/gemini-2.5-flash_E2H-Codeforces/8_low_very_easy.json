Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Flawed Flow Problem: A Python Script Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and my first instinct is to dive into the core constraints and see how best to translate them into a Python script. Let's break down the problem's essentials:  We're given a graph with *n* vertices and *m* edges, each with a flow capacity *ci*. Our goal is to orient these edges such that a valid flow is established. The input format is pretty straightforward: *n*, *m*, and then *m* lines specifying the edges and their capacities (*ai*, *bi*, *ci*).  The output, which gives the flow directions, is just a list of 0s and 1s, with 0 meaning from *ai* to *bi* and 1 meaning the other way around.\n\nThe heart of this problem lies in satisfying these conditions: Flow Conservation (at all intermediate vertices), handling the Source and Sink, ensuring the directed graph is acyclic, and dealing with a 'Max Flow' (even though this part is cleverly simplified for us by the problem statement).\n\nStarting with the easiest bit, Vertex 1 acts as a source, no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must flow *out*. This is a crucial starting point.\n\nAcyclicity gives us pause. The idea of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) screams \"topological sort,\" but we can't build it directly. What really matters is flow conservation at intermediate vertices (all nodes from 2 to n-1).  This is the cornerstone. For any intermediate vertex, the total incoming flow must equal the total outgoing flow. If we can satisfy this conservation rule, and avoid creating cycles, we should be golden. This problem can definitely be translated to code.\n\nRegarding the \"Max Flow\" part, the guarantee that \"a solution always exists\" removes a significant hurdle. We don't need to actually *compute* the max flow; we're just given the capacities and have to find *a* valid flow direction. This is important to remember! It keeps the complexity of the solution within reasonable bounds.\n\nSo, how do we handle flow conservation and acyclicity together? That's the real puzzle. I'm thinking... Let's use some graph traversal. I need to be careful, as a standard breadth-first or depth-first search might run into issues with cycles. I think I'll start the code with this in mind and make sure to validate the output against all requirements. The code will need to be well-structured, easy to debug, and take advantage of python's graph library if possible. Let's implement!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine the direction of flow for each edge in an undirected graph, given the flow volume `ci` for each edge. The goal is to satisfy several conditions:\n1.  **Flow Conservation:** For any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the total incoming flow must equal the total outgoing flow.\n2.  **Source Condition:** Vertex 1 (source) must have no incoming edges.\n3.  **Acyclicity:** The resulting directed graph must not contain any cycles.\n4.  **Max Flow:** The resulting flow should be a correct maximum flow. (This condition is simplified by the guarantee that a solution always exists, meaning the given `ci` values are consistent with some max flow, and we just need to find *any* valid direction.)\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n\n*   **Source Condition:** Vertex 1 having no incoming edges implies that all edges connected to vertex 1 must be directed *away* from vertex 1. This gives us a starting point.\n*   **Acyclicity:** A directed acyclic graph (DAG) has a topological ordering. This often suggests algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS).\n*   **Flow Conservation:** This is the core constraint for intermediate vertices. For any vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), its \"net flow\" must be zero. If we direct an edge `u -- v` with volume `c` as `u -> v`, `v` receives `c` flow. If `v -> u`, `v` sends `c` flow.\n\n**Strategy: Using a Queue and Flow Balance**\n\nWe can model the flow conservation for intermediate vertices. For each vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), let `balance[v]` be the sum of `ci` for all edges incident to `v`. Initially, this `balance[v]` represents the potential total flow through `v` if all edges were directed towards `v`. As we direct edges, we update this balance.\n\nConsider a vertex `v`. If we direct an edge `u -> v` with flow `c`, `v` receives `c` flow. If we direct `v -> u` with flow `c`, `v` sends `c` flow. For flow conservation `(in_flow = out_flow)` to hold, `balance[v]` will eventually be split equally between incoming and outgoing flows.\nSpecifically, for an intermediate vertex `v`, the total flow passing *through* it is `sum(ci for edges incident to v) / 2`. Let's call this `target_flow[v]`. We need to ensure that `in_flow[v] == target_flow[v]` and `out_flow[v] == target_flow[v]`.\n\nThe acyclicity condition, combined with the source condition, hints at a topological sort-like approach. We can start from vertex 1, direct its outgoing edges, and then process other vertices.\n\nLet's maintain `current_in_flow[v]` for each vertex `v`, representing the sum of `ci` for edges already directed *into* `v`.\nFor each vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), calculate `total_incident_flow[v] = sum(ci for all edges incident to v)`. The target incoming flow for `v` will be `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`.\n\nWe can use a queue-based approach (similar to Kahn's algorithm for topological sort) or a DFS-based approach. Given the \"very easy question\" hint, a queue-based approach seems suitable and simpler to implement while satisfying acyclicity implicitly.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Create an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[u]` stores `(v, c, edge_idx)` for all edges `u -- v` with flow `c` and original index `edge_idx`.\n    *   Initialize `ans` array of size `m` to store the directions (0 for `a -> b`, 1 for `b -> a`).\n    *   Calculate `total_incident_flow[v]` for all `v` from 1 to `n`. This is the sum of `ci` for all edges connected to `v`.\n    *   Initialize `current_in_flow[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n    *   Create a queue `q`.\n    *   Add vertex 1 to the queue `q`.\n\n2.  **BFS-like Traversal:**\n    *   While `q` is not empty:\n        *   Dequeue a vertex `u`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` connected by an edge with flow `c` and original index `edge_idx`:\n            *   If this edge has not been directed yet (e.g., check if `ans[edge_idx]` is unassigned or if `v` has not been visited from `u`'s perspective):\n                *   **Direct the edge:** We want to direct flow from `u` to `v` if possible, to satisfy the source condition and maintain a topological order.\n                *   If `u` is the source (vertex 1), or if `current_in_flow[u]` is still less than `total_incident_flow[u] / 2` (meaning `u` still needs to send out flow), then we can potentially direct `u -> v`.\n                *   Let's simplify: When we process `u`, we assume it has already received all its required incoming flow (if `u != 1`). Now it needs to send out flow. We direct edges from `u` to its unvisited neighbors `v`.\n                *   Specifically, if `current_in_flow[u]` is less than `total_incident_flow[u] / 2`, it means `u` still needs to send `total_incident_flow[u] / 2 - current_in_flow[u]` flow out.\n                *   **Direct `u -> v`:**\n                    *   Set `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (flow `u -> v`).\n                    *   Add `c` to `current_in_flow[v]`.\n                    *   If `current_in_flow[v]` becomes equal to `total_incident_flow[v] / 2` (meaning `v` has received all its required incoming flow), then enqueue `v`. This ensures `v` will be processed to direct its *outgoing* edges.\n\nThis approach works for `v != n`. What about `n`? Vertex `n` (sink) should have no outgoing edges. The `current_in_flow[n]` will accumulate all the flow, and it should eventually equal `total_incident_flow[n] / 2`. We don't enqueue `n` to direct its outgoing edges.\n\n**Refined Algorithm (using `visited` to avoid re-processing edges):**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   `adj`: `adj[u]` stores `(v, c, edge_idx)` for edges connected to `u`.\n    *   `ans`: `[-1] * m` (or similar placeholder for unassigned).\n    *   `total_incident_flow[v]`: `sum(c for (v, c, _) in adj[u])` for all `u`.\n    *   `current_in_flow[v]`: `[0] * (n + 1)`.\n    *   `q`: `collections.deque()`.\n    *   Add vertex 1 to `q`.\n\n2.  **BFS Loop:**\n    *   While `q` is not empty:\n        *   `u = q.popleft()`.\n        *   For each `(v, c, edge_idx)` in `adj[u]`:\n            *   If `ans[edge_idx]` is still `-1` (meaning this edge hasn't been directed yet):\n                *   **Determine direction:**\n                    *   We are processing `u`. We want to direct edges such that `u` sends out flow to its neighbors `v`, *unless* `u` is the sink `n`.\n                    *   The crucial insight is that for any vertex `u` (other than the sink `n`), once it has received all its required incoming flow (`current_in_flow[u] == total_incident_flow[u] / 2`), it must then send out all its remaining flow.\n                    *   So, if `current_in_flow[u] < total_incident_flow[u] / 2`, it means `u` still needs to receive flow, so we should direct `v -> u`. This is not correct for a BFS from source.\n\nThe simpler approach for acyclicity and flow conservation is to process vertices in an order where we know their incoming flow is finalized.\n\n**Corrected Logic (Similar to Kahn's algorithm):**\n\n1.  **Calculate `total_incident_flow` for each vertex `v` (1 to `n`).**\n    `total_incident_flow[v] = sum(c for (neighbor, c, _) in adj[v])`\n2.  **Initialize `current_in_flow` for each vertex `v` (1 to `n`) to 0.**\n3.  **Initialize a queue `q` and add vertex 1 to it.**\n4.  **Initialize `ans` array of size `m` with placeholder values.**\n5.  **BFS loop:**\n    While `q` is not empty:\n        `u = q.popleft()`\n        For each `(v, c, edge_idx)` in `adj[u]`:\n            If `ans[edge_idx]` is not set yet (i.e., this edge hasn't been directed):\n                **Direct `u -> v`:**\n                `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (meaning flow `u -> v`).\n                `current_in_flow[v] += c`.\n                If `v != n` and `current_in_flow[v] == total_incident_flow[v] / 2`:\n                    `q.append(v)`\n\nThis algorithm correctly handles the source and acyclicity. By starting from vertex 1 and only adding `v` to the queue once it has received all its required incoming flow, we ensure that when `v` is processed, all edges directed into `v` have already been set. Then, all subsequent edges connected to `v` that haven't been directed must be directed *out* of `v`.\n\nLet's trace this logic for an intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`):\n*   `v` is added to the queue only when `current_in_flow[v]` reaches `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`. This means all edges that are directed *into* `v` have been processed, and their flow `c` contributed to `current_in_flow[v]`.\n*   When `v` is popped from the queue, we iterate through its neighbors. For any undirected edge `v -- w`:\n    *   If `w` was the vertex that caused `v` to reach its target incoming flow (i.e., `w -> v` was directed), then `ans[edge_idx]` for `w -- v` is already set.\n    *   If `w` is an unvisited neighbor, we now direct `v -> w`. This means `v` is sending out flow. This ensures `v` sends out exactly `total_incident_flow[v] / 2` flow, because it received that much and now it's directing all remaining undirected edges outwards.\n\nThis works because `total_incident_flow[v]` is the sum of all `ci` for edges incident to `v`. For flow conservation, `in_flow[v]` must equal `out_flow[v]`. This implies `in_flow[v] + out_flow[v] = total_incident_flow[v]`. Since `in_flow[v] = out_flow[v]`, both must be `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nInput:\n3 3\n3 2 10 (edge 0)\n1 2 10 (edge 1)\n3 1 5  (edge 2)\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    `n=3, m=3`\n    `adj`:\n    `1: [(2, 10, 1), (3, 5, 2)]`\n    `2: [(3, 10, 0), (1, 10, 1)]`\n    `3: [(2, 10, 0), (1, 5, 2)]`\n    `ans = [-1, -1, -1]`\n    `total_incident_flow`:\n    `total_incident_flow[1] = 10 + 5 = 15`\n    `total_incident_flow[2] = 10 + 10 = 20`\n    `total_incident_flow[3] = 10 + 5 = 15`\n    `current_in_flow = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    `q = deque([1])`\n\n2.  **BFS:**\n    *   **Pop `u = 1`:**\n        *   Neighbor `(v=2, c=10, edge_idx=1)`: `ans[1]` is `-1`.\n            *   `ans[1] = 0` (1 -> 2).\n            *   `current_in_flow[2] += 10` (`current_in_flow[2]` is now 10).\n            *   `v=2 != n` (3). `current_in_flow[2]` (10) `== total_incident_flow[2]/2` (20/2 = 10).

When `v` is popped, all its remaining undirected edges are directed outwards. This ensures `in_flow[v] = out_flow[v] = total_incident_flow[v] / 2`.\n*   **Acyclicity:** The BFS traversal from the source, only adding a node to the queue once its incoming flow is satisfied, naturally creates a topological ordering, guaranteeing acyclicity.\n*   **Max Flow:** Guaranteed by problem statement.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list and `total_incident_flow`: O(N + M)\n*   BFS: Each vertex is enqueued/dequeued at most once. Each edge is visited at most twice (once from each endpoint). O(N + M).\nOverall complexity: O(N + M).\nGiven N, M <= 2 * 10^5, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport collections\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Store edges with their original index\n    # adj[u] will store tuples (v, c, edge_idx)\n    adj = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    edges_input = [] # To store (a_i, b_i) for mapping output direction\n\n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append((v, c, i))\n        adj[v].append((u, c, i))\n        edges_input.append((u, v))\n\n    # Calculate total flow incident to each vertex\n    # total_incident_flow[v] will be sum of c for all edges connected to v\n    total_incident_flow = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        for v, c, _ in adj[u]:\n            total_incident_flow[u] += c\n\n    # current_in_flow[v] tracks the sum of flow for edges directed INTO v\n    current_in_flow = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # ans[i] will store the direction for the i-th edge\n    # 0 for a_i -> b_i, 1 for b_i -> a_i\n    ans = [-1] * m\n\n    # Queue for BFS-like traversal\n    q = collections.deque()\n\n    # Start BFS from source (vertex 1)\n    q.append(1)\n\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n\n        # Iterate through neighbors of u\n        for v, c, edge_idx in adj[u]:\n            # If this edge hasn't been directed yet\n            if ans[edge_idx] == -1:\n                # Direct the edge u -> v\n                # Check original (a_i, b_i) for edge_idx\n                a_i, b_i = edges_input[edge_idx]\n                if a_i == u and b_i == v:\n                    ans[edge_idx] = 0 # Flow u -> v, which is a_i -> b_i\n                else: # a_i == v and b_i == u\n                    ans[edge_idx] = 1 # Flow u -> v, which is b_i -> a_i\n\n                current_in_flow[v] += c\n\n                # If v is not the sink (n) and has received all its required incoming flow,\n                # add it to the queue to process its outgoing edges\n                # total_incident_flow[v] / 2 is the target incoming flow for intermediate nodes\n                if v != n and current_in_flow[v] == total_incident_flow[v] // 2:\n                    q.append(v)\n\n    # Print results\n    for i in range(m):\n        sys.stdout.write(str(ans[i]) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
