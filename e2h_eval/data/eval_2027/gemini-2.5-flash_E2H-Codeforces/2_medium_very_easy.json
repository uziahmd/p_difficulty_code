Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Identifying X-Pattern in a Grid**\n\nAlright, so I've been tasked with figuring out a way to automatically determine if a given square grid of characters (an `n x n` grid, where `n` is odd) conforms to a specific \"X\" pattern. Here's what I've distilled:\n\nThe rules are pretty straightforward:\n\n1.  **Diagonals Consistency**:  All the characters along *both* diagonals (the main one from top-left to bottom-right and the anti-diagonal from top-right to bottom-left) must be identical.\n2.  **Non-Diagonal Homogeneity**: All the other characters in the grid – those that *aren't* on either diagonal – must also be the same.\n3.  **Cross-Check**: Crucially, the character used on the diagonals must be *different* from the character used everywhere else (outside the diagonals).\n\nTo code this, I’m thinking in terms of coordinates, `(r, c)` representing rows and columns (0-indexed). I have the logic that a cell belongs to a diagonal when `r == c` or `r + c == n - 1`. The core of the algorithm will involve reading in the grid, character by character, and tracking two key variables: `diag_char` (the character used on the diagonals) and `other_char` (the character found in the non-diagonal positions).\n\nI’ll initialize both to `None` and during my scan, as I encounter characters, I’ll populate the grid in this fashion: if it is diagonal, I'll store the character, otherwise I will store the off-diagonal character. Then it’s a matter of ensuring consistency – that every character I see on a diagonal matches `diag_char`, that every non-diagonal character matches `other_char`, and then comparing `diag_char` and `other_char` to make sure they're different at the very end. The constraint, that `n` is odd, ensures the center cell is correctly handled as it resides on the intersection of the two diagonals.\n\nA flag, say `is_x`, will track whether the pattern has been violated at any point.\n\nThe process boils down to these specific steps:\n\n1.  Read the size of the grid (`n`).\n2.  Read the grid itself, storing it as a 2D list.\n3.  Set a `diag_char` to the top-left cell value.\n4.  Set a `other_char` to the cell to the right of it.\n5.  Iterate through each cell, checking its position (diagonal or non-diagonal).\n6.  If on a diagonal, make sure the character matches `diag_char`. If not, set `is_x` to `False` and break out of the current loops.\n7.  Otherwise, if not on a diagonal, make sure the character matches `other_char`. If not, set `is_x` to `False` and break out of the current loops.\n8.  Finally, check if the two characters are same:\n    a.  If `diag_char` and `other_char` are equal: set `is_x` to `False`.\n9.  Print \"YES\" if `is_x` is `True`, print \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe crucial checks for the final evaluation include the use of early loop termination to optimize execution time, and to manage the edge cases of character equality within their respected locations.\n\nAfter running some test cases, I'm confident that this should work correctly. The nested loop has a time complexity of O(n^2), but as `n` is at most 300, that’s manageable.\n",
