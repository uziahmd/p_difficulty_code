    "thought": "**Refined Algorithm for LCM Minimization**\n\nOkay, so I've been working on this problem, and I think I've got a solid strategy. We're trying to find the smallest non-negative integer *k* that minimizes the least common multiple of *a + k* and *b + k*.  Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I define *d* as the absolute difference between *a* and *b*. If *d* is zero, then *a* equals *b*, and the LCM is minimized at *k = 0*. Otherwise, we want to iterate through all divisors of *d*, representing potential greatest common divisors of *a+k* and *b+k*.\n\nFor each divisor *g* of *d*, I calculate the *k* that forces *a + k* and *b + k* to be multiples of *g*. The crucial part is figuring out that we want the smallest *k* such that *a+k* is the smallest multiple of g that is greater or equal to *a*.\n\nOnce I have a *k* for a given *g*, I compute the LCM and keep track of the smallest LCM seen so far and the corresponding *k*. If I find a smaller LCM, I update my results. Also, if I have equal LCM values for different *k* values, I keep the smallest *k* value that leads to the same LCM.\n\nWe can compute this quickly with the given formulas. We start with calculating *d = |b - a|*. If *d = 0* then the value for *k* is 0. Otherwise:\n\n1.  Calculate *d = abs(b - a)*.\n2.  If *d == 0*, then the result is *k = 0*.\n3.  Otherwise:\n    *   Initialize *min\\_lcm = infinity* and *best\\_k = 0*.\n    *   Find all divisors *g* of *d*.\n    *   For each divisor *g*:\n        *   Calculate *k = (g - (a % g)) % g*.\n        *   Calculate *val\\_a = a + k* and *val\\_b = b + k*.\n        *   Calculate *current\\_lcm = (val\\_a * val\\_b) // gcd(val\\_a, val\\_b)*.\n        *   If *current\\_lcm < min\\_lcm*:\n            *   *min\\_lcm = current\\_lcm*\n            *   *best\\_k = k*\n        *   Else if *current\\_lcm == min\\_lcm*:\n            *   *best\\_k = min(best\\_k, k)* (smallest k)\n\nThis strategy hinges on the insight that the *gcd* of the two numbers must be a divisor of the difference.  The time complexity will be dependent on how efficiently we can find the divisors of *d*.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If there are multiple `k` values yielding the same minimum LCM, we choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nA key property of the greatest common divisor is `gcd(X, Y) = gcd(X, Y-X)`.\nApplying this, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, (b+k) - (a+k)) = gcd(a+k, b-a)`.\nLet `d = |b-a|`. This means `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `d`.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible values for `g = gcd(a+k, b+k)`. Since `g` must be a divisor of `d`, we can find all divisors of `d`.\n\nFor a fixed divisor `g` of `d`:\nWe are looking for a `k >= 0` such that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` is at least `g`. This implies that both `a+k` and `b+k` must be multiples of `g`.\nIf `a+k` is a multiple of `g`, and `b-a` is a multiple of `g` (by our choice of `g`), then `b+k = (a+k) + (b-a)` will also be a multiple of `g`.\nTherefore, for a given `g`, we only need to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`.\n\nThis `k` can be calculated as follows:\nLet `rem = a % g`.\nIf `rem == 0`, then `a` is already a multiple of `g`, so the smallest `k` is `0`.\nIf `rem != 0`, then `a` is not a multiple of `g`. The next multiple of `g` after `a` is `a - rem + g`.\nSo, `a+k = a - rem + g`, which means `k = g - rem`.\nThis can be concisely written as `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n\nNow, for each divisor `g` of `d`:\n1. Calculate `k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g`. This is the smallest non-negative `k` that makes `a+k` a multiple of `g`.\n2. Let `val_a = a + k_candidate`.\n3. Let `val_b = b + k_candidate`.\n4. Calculate `current_lcm = (val_a * val_b) // gcd(val_a, val_b)`. Note that `gcd(val_a, val_b)` will be at least `g` because both `val_a` and `val_b` are multiples of `g`.\n\nWe maintain `min_lcm` and `best_k`.\nInitialize `min_lcm` to a very large value (e.g., infinity) and `best_k` to `0`.\nFor each `g`:\nIf `current_lcm < min_lcm`, update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `best_k = k_candidate`.\nIf `current_lcm == min_lcm`, update `best_k = min(best_k, k_candidate)` (to ensure we pick the smallest `k`).\n\nEdge case: If `a == b`, then `d = 0`. In this case, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`.\n`lcm(a+k, b+k) = (a+k)`. To minimize `a+k`, we choose `k=0`. The result is `a`. So if `a == b`, `k=0`.\n\nAlgorithm steps:\n1. Handle the `a == b` case: if `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n2. Calculate `d = abs(b - a)`.\n3. Initialize `min_lcm = float('inf')` and `best_k = 0`.\n4. Find all divisors of `d`. We can do this by iterating `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(d)`. If `i` divides `d`, then both `i` and `d/i` are divisors.\n5. For each divisor `g` (both `i` and `d/i`):\n   a. Calculate `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n   b. Calculate `val_a = a + k`.\n   c. Calculate `val_b = b + k`.\n   d. Calculate `current_gcd = math.gcd(val_a, val_b)`.\n   e. Calculate `current_lcm = (val_a // current_gcd) * val_b`. (To prevent overflow, divide first before multiplying. `val_a * val_b` can exceed `2^63-1` if `a,b` are `10^9` and `k` is small, `(10^9)^2 = 10^18`, which fits in Python's arbitrary precision integers).\n   f. If `current_lcm < min_lcm`:\n      `min_lcm = current_lcm`\n      `best_k = k`\n   g. Else if `current_lcm == min_lcm`:\n      `best_k = min(best_k, k)`\n6. Print `best_k`.\n\nThe maximum value of `d` is `10^9`. Finding divisors up to `sqrt(10^9) approx 31622` is efficient. The number of divisors for `N <= 10^9` is at most `1344` (for `735134400`). So the loop runs at most `~2 * 1344` times. Each iteration involves a few arithmetic operations and a `gcd` call, which is efficient (logarithmic in its arguments). This approach should be well within time limits.\n\nExample 1: `a=6, b=10`\n`d = |10-6| = 4`.\nDivisors of `4`: `1, 2, 4`.\n\n- `g = 1`:\n  `k = (1 - (6 % 1)) % 1 = 0`.\n  `val_a = 6+0 = 6`, `val_b = 10+0 = 10`.\n  `lcm(6, 10) = (6*10) // gcd(6,10) = 60 // 2 = 30`.\n  `min_lcm = 30`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n- `g = 2`:\n  `k = (2 - (6 % 2)) % 2 = 0`.\n  `val_a = 6+0 = 6`, `val_b = 10+0 = 10`.\n  `lcm(6, 10) = 30`.\n  `current_lcm = 30`, `best_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n- `g = 4`:\n  `k = (4 - (6 % 4)) % 4 = (4 - 2) % 4 = 2 % 4 = 2`.\n  `val_a = 6+2 = 8`, `val_b = 10+2 = 12`.\n  `lcm(8, 12) = (8*12) // gcd(8,12) = 96 // 4 = 24`.\n  `current_lcm = 24`. This is less than `min_lcm = 30`.\n  `min_lcm = 24`, `best_k = 2`.\n\nFinal `best_k = 2`. This matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a <= b for simplicity in calculations, doesn't affect |b-a|\n    # but ensures a+k <= b+k.
