Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solution to Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vanya and Cards problem. The core is figuring out the minimum number of cards needed to get a sum of zero, given some initial cards and a constraint on the card values.\n\nThe strategy is pretty straightforward. I need to sum the values of the existing cards. If that sum is already zero, great, I need nothing. If it's not zero, I need to figure out what to add to reach zero. The key is *minimizing* the cards.\n\nTo minimize, I'll use cards with the largest possible absolute value, which is given as 'x'. So, I calculate the current sum, take its absolute value, and then divide it by 'x'.  The ceiling of that division gives me the minimum number of additional cards.  I'm basically figuring out how many cards with value 'x' (or '-x', depending on the sign of the current sum) it takes to cancel out the initial sum.  I've verified it works with a bunch of examples and it seems sound.\n\nFor the implementation, I'm reading 'n' and 'x', reading the card values, calculating the sum, and then applying the formula `ceil(abs(current_sum) / x)`.  The Python code is clean, concise, and efficient. I have thought through edge cases, ensuring I get correct answers for all situations. I'm using math.ceil to do the calculations.\n",
