            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# TV Game\n\nThere is a new TV game on BerTV. In this game two players get a number A consisting of 2n digits. Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Algorithm Design**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. The core of it is a competitive scenario where two players, Homer and Marge, are trying to maximize the sum of their individual numbers.  We're given a number `A` with an even number of digits (`2n`), and each player gets `n` moves. Each move involves taking the leftmost digit from `A` and appending it to their number.  My goal is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves (represented by \"H\" and \"M\") that leads to the highest possible combined score.\n\nI need to start with some examples to get a grasp on this. I've been tracing through a couple of scenarios. I quickly realized that the problem's not just about picking the biggest numbers; the order in which we pick them significantly impacts the final result. I initially got tripped up with Example 2 (\"9911\") because I didn't trace the move sequences *very* carefully. I quickly realized there's no way to just pick the biggest numbers one by one, alternating.\n\nLet's think algorithmically.  I can see a few approaches:\n\n1.  **Brute Force:** Generate *every* possible sequence of \"H\" and \"M\" moves (there would be `2^(2n)` possibilities).  For each sequence, I could simulate the game and calculate the total score.  This is guaranteed to find the optimal solution, but it's computationally *horrendous*, especially as `n` gets bigger. Exponential time. No, no.\n\n2.  **Greedy?** Could I greedily pick the largest digit available for each move? Maybe.  But I'm skeptical. Example 1 shows this *won't* necessarily be optimal. Choosing a big first number can also force a second *smaller* number.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Programming?** Perhaps, I can use the principle of optimality?  Maybe I can look at the remaining choices at each move and make a decision by looking ahead to how those choices will affect future scoring. I like this approach as it potentially avoids the exponential time complexity.\n    *   Let's see: `dp[i][j]` could represent the maximum score attainable, with `i` moves remaining for Homer, `j` moves remaining for Marge. It's a bit tricky, but worth exploring further.\n\n4. **Observation and Pattern recognition:** After working through examples, my intuition is that we might be able to exploit the parity of the digits, and how they relate to the relative sizes, and make an optimal choice based on this rule.\n\nGiven I'm aiming for a Python script, I think I'll try to refine the DP-based approach. The tricky part will be defining the state and transition clearly. The example tracing will provide a helpful sanity-check. Time to get coding!\n",
