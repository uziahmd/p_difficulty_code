The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving Xenia and the Ringroad with Python**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break down my thought process here. I need a Python script to figure out the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. We've got `n` houses in a ring, `m` tasks, and an array `a` where `a_i` tells us which house the i-th task is at. Xenia starts at house 1 and has to go clockwise.\n\nI'm thinking about how the time will be calculated. Xenia starts at house 1, and for each task, she needs to move from her current house to the task's house. The trick here is that she can only move clockwise.\n\nLet's trace Xenia's movements. Initially, `current_house = 1` and `total_time = 0`. For each task, I need to figure out the time:\n\n*   If the task's house `a_i` is the same or after her `current_house`, the steps are just `a_i - current_house`.\n*   If `a_i` is before her `current_house`, it's a bit more complicated. She has to go past house `n` and loop around. After some mental gymnastics, I've got this: the steps are `n - current_house + a_i`. This looks right after double-checking with an example.\n\nSo, the logic boils down to this: for each task, I calculate the time based on the two cases above. I add that time to my `total_time`, and then update `current_house` to the house where the task was completed. I will use `prev_house` as variable for keeping track of the houses.\n\nI've tested the logic in my head for one of the provided examples, and it seems to be working as expected. Now I can move on to coding the actual Python script.\n",
