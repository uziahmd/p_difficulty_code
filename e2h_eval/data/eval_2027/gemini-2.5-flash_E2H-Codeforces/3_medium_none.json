Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Process for Solving the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out the smallest radius, `d`, needed for lanterns to light up an entire street of length `l`.  We're given the positions of the lanterns, `a_i`.  First things first, I've got to sort those lantern positions.  Makes everything a lot easier to think about, right?\n\nThe street starts at 0 and goes to `l`. Now, I have to account for the ends of the street.  The first lantern has to cover from 0 to its position, which means `d` has to be at least as big as the position of that first lantern, `a_1`.  Similarly, the last lantern has to reach all the way to `l`, which means `d` needs to be at least `l` minus the last lantern's position, `l - a_n`.\n\nNext, I need to look at the gaps between the lanterns. If I have two lanterns, say at positions `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, I need to make sure their light overlaps in the middle. The smallest radius needed to bridge the gap is half the distance between those lanterns: `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  I have to check this for all adjacent pairs.\n\nSo, to summarize:  `d` needs to be at least the larger of: the position of the first lantern, the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street, and half the largest gap between lanterns.  I have to find the `max` value of those three.\n\nI read in the inputs: number of lanterns (`n`), street length (`l`), and the lantern positions (`a`). I sort the lantern positions, calculate the distances for the start and end of the street, and then loop through the gaps between all the lanterns. Finally, I find the largest of those values and that's the answer.  Gotta make sure to print with sufficient precision!\n",
