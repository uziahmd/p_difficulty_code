    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey for Frog Jumping**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this Frog Jumping problem.  The goal is to efficiently calculate the sum of reachable positions, *f(i)*, up to a maximum value *m*, where the frog can jump forward by *a* or backward by *b* within the bounds of 0 and *x*. First, I need to understand *f(x)*.  It represents the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the range [0, *x*].  This looks like a reachability problem, essentially a graph traversal with nodes as integers and edges as jumps (+*a*, -*b*).\n\nNow, any reachable number *p* must be expressible as *k* * a* - *l* * b*, for some non-negative integers *k* and *l*. A critical insight: all reachable numbers must be multiples of the greatest common divisor of *a* and *b*, let's call it *g*.  So, I can simplify the problem by dividing *a*, *b*, and *x* by *g*. Now, I can assume *a* and *b* are coprime.\n\nWith that simplification, I consider how the reachability is affected by the [0, *x*] constraint.  A breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) seems straightforward to find the reachable points for each *x*, but that will be far too slow, as I would be doing that process *m* times. The time complexity would quickly become impractical.\n\nThe key to efficient calculation is the structure of *f(x)*. This function is non-decreasing, as *x* increases the frog can reach at least as many points, or more. What if I looked at how the reachable values behave with respect to modular arithmetic?  If I consider remainders modulo *a*, I can create a graph where the nodes are the possible remainders (0 to *a-1*).  Edges represent possible transitions using +*a* and -*b* (adjusted to account for remainders). Dijkstra's algorithm seems well-suited to finding the minimum reachable number for each remainder.\n\nLet me define `min_reach[r]` as the smallest non-negative reachable number that has remainder *r* when divided by *a*. This will use Dijkstra to find the cost from the starting state (0 remainder) to any other state. This looks like the solution!  If a remainder is unreachable, then `min_reach[r]` will remain at infinity.\n\nThe important thing is that `min_reach[r]` gives the minimal value of p given that p % a = r. Given `min_reach[r]`, I can easily compute all of the reachable values modulo a.\n\nAfter running Dijkstra's, I can use the `min_reach` array to calculate *f(x)*. It should involve looking at `floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a)` for each remainder *r*. The sum of this over all *r* should give *f(x)*.  To compute the sum over the values 0 to *m*, I have to sum over the calculation of *f(x)* across all values 0 to *m*.  That looks computationally tractable.\n\nFinally, I need to account for the case where *g* is not 1. I have already simplified to that case.\n\nThis seems efficient enough with Dijkstra's running in *O(a log a)* (or possibly *O(a)*). I am ready to implement this solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i from 0 to m)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach starting from `0` and staying within the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any position the frog can reach must be a multiple of `g`. If a position `p` is reachable, then `p = k*a - l*b` for some non-negative integers `k, l`. Since `a` and `b` are multiples of `g`, `p` must also be a multiple of `g`.\nWe can simplify the problem by dividing all positions and jump lengths by `g`. Let `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`. Now `gcd(a', b') = 1`. If the frog can reach `p'` using jumps `+a'` and `-b'` within `[0, x']`, then `p'*g` is reachable using jumps `+a` and `-b` within `[0, x'*g]`.\nSo, `f(x) = f'(floor(x/g))`, where `f'` is the function for `a', b'` and `g=1`.\nThe sum we need to compute is `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{m} f'(floor(i/g))`.\nLet `M_prime = floor(m/g)`.\nThe values `floor(i/g)` for `i` from `0` to `m` will range from `0` to `M_prime`.\nFor `k` from `0` to `M_prime-1`, there are `g` values of `i` such that `floor(i/g) = k` (specifically, `i` from `k*g` to `(k+1)*g - 1`).\nFor `k = M_prime`, there are `m - M_prime*g + 1` values of `i` such that `floor(i/g) = M_prime` (specifically, `i` from `M_prime*g` to `m`).\nSo the sum can be rewritten as:\n`g * sum_{k=0}^{M_prime-1} f'(k) + (m - M_prime*g + 1) * f'(M_prime)`.\nThis means we need to compute `sum_{k=0}^{X} f'(k)` for some `X` (up to `M_prime`). Let's call this `S_f(X)`.\nThen the total sum is `g * S_f(M_prime-1) + (m - M_prime*g + 1) * f'(M_prime)`.\nIf `M_prime = 0`, the sum is just `(m+1) * f'(0)`.\nThis reduces the problem to the case where `gcd(a, b) = 1`. Let's assume `a, b` are already `a', b'` and `m` is `M_prime`.\n\n**Calculating `f(x)` for `gcd(a, b) = 1`**\n\nLet `min_reach[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `p` such that `p % a = r` and `p` is reachable from `0`.\nWe can find `min_reach[r]` for all `r \\in [0, a-1]` using Dijkstra's algorithm.\nThe nodes in our graph are `0, 1, ..., a-1`. An edge exists from `r` to `(r-b)%a` with weight `b`.\nInitialize `min_reach[0] = 0` and `min_reach[r] = infinity` for `r \\neq 0`.\nPush `(0, 0)` to a min-priority queue.\nWhile the priority queue is not empty:\n1.  Extract `(d, r)` with the minimum `d`.\n2.  If `d > min_reach[r]`, continue (already found a shorter path).\n3.  Let `next_r = (r - b % a + a) % a`.\n4.  If `d + b < min_reach[next_r]`:\n    `min_reach[next_r] = d + b`\n    Push `(d + b, next_r)` to the priority queue.\n\nAfter Dijkstra's, `min_reach[r]` contains the minimum reachable value congruent to `r \\pmod a`.\nAny other reachable value `p` congruent to `r \\pmod a` must be of the form `min_reach[r] + k*a` for some `k \\ge 0`.\nFor a given `x`, `f(x)` is the count of all such `p` that satisfy `0 \\le p \\le x`.\nSo, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} count_r(x)`, where `count_r(x)` is the number of integers `p = min_reach[r] + k*a` such that `0 \\le p \\le x`.\nIf `min_reach[r] > x`, then `count_r(x) = 0`.\nOtherwise, `min_reach[r] + k*a \\le x \\implies k*a \\le x - min_reach[r] \\implies k \\le (x - min_reach[r])/a`.\nSince `k \\ge 0`, `count_r(x) = floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1`.\n\n**Calculating `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`**\n\nWe need `sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{r=0}^{a-1} count_r(i)`.\nSwap the summations: `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} sum_{i=0}^{m} count_r(i)`.\nFor a fixed `r`, we need to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} count_r(i)`.\nLet `mr = min_reach[r]`.\n`count_r(i)` is `0` if `i < mr`.\nSo the sum starts from `i = mr`: `sum_{i=mr}^{m} (floor((i - mr) / a) + 1)`.\nLet `j = i - mr`. The sum becomes `sum_{j=0}^{m-mr} (floor(j / a) + 1)`.\nLet `N = m - mr`. If `N < 0`, the sum is `0`. Otherwise, we need to compute `S(N) = sum_{j=0}^{N} (floor(j / a) + 1)`.\nThis sum can be computed in `O(1)`:\nLet `Q = N // a` and `R = N % a`.\nThe terms `floor(j/a) + 1` are:\n`1` for `j = 0, ..., a-1` (`a` terms)\n`2` for `j = a, ..., 2a-1` (`a` terms)\n...\n`Q` for `j = (Q-1)a, ..., Qa-1` (`a` terms)\n`Q+1` for `j = Qa, ..., N` (`R+1` terms)\nSo, `S(N) = a * (1 + 2 + ... + Q) + (R+1) * (Q+1)`.\nUsing the sum formula `1 + ... + Q = Q*(Q+1)/2`:\n`S(N) = a * Q*(Q+1)//2 + (R+1)*(Q+1)`.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1.  Calculate `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2.  Set `a_prime = a // g`, `b_prime = b // g`.\n3.  Compute `min_reach_prime` array for `a_prime`, `b_prime` using Dijkstra's. This takes `O(a_prime log a_prime)` time.\n4.  Initialize `total_sum_f_prime = 0`.\n5.  For each `r` from `0` to `a_prime-1`:\n    a.  Let `mr = min_reach_prime[r]`.\n    b.  If `mr > M_prime`, this `r` contributes nothing to `f'(k)` for `k <= M_prime`. Skip.\n    c.  Calculate `N = M_prime - mr`.\n    d.  Calculate `Q = N // a_prime`, `R = N % a_prime`.\n    e.  `current_sum_for_r = a_prime * Q * (Q + 1) // 2 + (R + 1) * (Q + 1)`.\n    f.  `total_sum_f_prime += current_sum_for_r`.\n6.  The result for `sum_{k=0}^{M_prime} f'(k)` is `total_sum_f_prime`.\n7.  Now we need `f'(M_prime)`. This can be computed by `sum_{r=0}^{a_prime-1} count_r(M_prime)`.\n    `f_M_prime = 0`.\n    For each `r` from `0` to `a_prime-1`:\n        `mr = min_reach_prime[r]`.\n        If `mr <= M_prime`:\n            `f_M_prime += (M_prime - mr) // a_prime + 1`.\n8.  The final answer is `g * total_sum_f_prime - (g-1) * f_M_prime`.\n    This is `g * sum_{k=0}^{M_prime-1} f'(k) + (m - M_prime*g + 1) * f'(M_prime)`.\n    `m_prime_val = m // g`.\n    `res = g * total_sum_f_prime`.\n    `res -= (g - (m - m_prime_val * g + 1)) * f_M_prime`.\n    `res = g * total_sum_f_prime - (g - (m % g + 1)) * f_M_prime`.\n    If `m < g`, `M_prime = 0`. Then `total_sum_f_prime` is just `f'(0) = 1` if `mr=0`.\n    The sum `sum_{k=0}^{M_prime-1} f'(k)` is `0` if `M_prime=0`.\n    So the formula `g * sum_{k=0}^{M_prime-1} f'(k) + (m - M_prime*g + 1) * f'(M_prime)` becomes `(m+1) * f'(0)`.\n    `f'(0)` is always `1` because `0` is always reachable.\n    So if `M_prime = 0`, the result is `m+1`.\n\nThe maximum value of `a_prime` is `10^5`. Dijkstra's takes `O(a_prime log a_prime)`. The summation takes `O(a_prime)`. Total time complexity is `O(a_prime log a_prime)`.\nThe values `min_reach_prime[r]` can be up to `a_prime * b_prime` which is `10^5 * 10^5 = 10^{10}`. `m` is `10^9`.\nThe intermediate sums `S(N)` can be large (`m * a_prime` roughly `10^9 * 10^5 = 10^{14}`). The final sum can be even larger (`g * 10^{14}` which is `10^5 * 10^{14} = 10^{19}`). Python's arbitrary precision integers handle this automatically.\n\nExample 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`\n`g = gcd(5,3) = 1`. `a_prime=5, b_prime=3`. `M_prime=7`.\nDijkstra for `a_prime=5, b_prime=3`:\n`min_reach_prime = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]` for `r = 0,1,2,3,4`.\n\n`total_sum_f_prime = 0`.\n`f_M_prime = f'(7) = 0`.\n\nFor `r=0, mr=0`: `N = 7-0=7`. `Q=7//5=1, R=7%5=2`.\n`S(7) = 5*1*(1+1)//2 + (2+1)*(1+1) = 5*1 + 3*2 = 5+6 = 11`.\n`total_sum_f_prime += 11`.\n`f'(7)` for `r=0`: `(7-0)//5+1 = 1+1=2`. `f_M_prime += 2`.\n\nFor `r=1, mr=9`: `mr > M_prime`.

Why is my `f'(7)` different?\nLet's trace `f(7)` by hand. `a=5, b=3`.\nStart `0`.\n`0+5=5`.\n`5-3=2`.\n`2+5=7`.\n`7-3=4`.\n`4-3=1`.\n`1+5=6`.\n`6-3=3`.\nReachable: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`. Count is 8.\nMy `min_reach_prime` values: `[0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`.\nFor `x=7`:\n`r=0, mr=0`: `(7-0)//5+1 = 2`. Values: `0, 5`.\n`r=1, mr=9`: `9>7`. No values.\n`r=2, mr=3`: `(7-3)//5+1 = 1`.

This is wrong.\n\nThe issue is that `min_reach[r]` is the minimum *non-negative* reachable value. The Dijkstra algorithm correctly finds this.\nHowever, if we are at `p`, we can reach `p+a` (if `p+a <= x`) and `p-b` (if `p-b >= 0`).\nMy Dijkstra only considers `p-b` jumps to update `min_reach[r]`.\nThis is a standard problem: the set of reachable points modulo `a` is found using Dijkstra.\nThe `min_reach[r]` values are correct.\nThe error is in the interpretation of `f(x)`. It's not just `min_reach[r] + k*a`.\nIt's all points `p` such that `p` is reachable from `0` and `0 <= p <= x`.\nThe `min_reach[r]` values are the smallest values `p` for each remainder `r` such that `p` is reachable *using any sequence of +a and -b jumps that eventually leads to p*.\nThe constraint `0 <= intermediate_pos <= x` applies to *all* intermediate positions.\nMy current `f(x)` calculation `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)` counts `min_reach[r], min_reach[r]+a, min_reach[r]+2a, ...` as long as they are `le x`.\nThis is correct if the intermediate points are not constrained.\nBut the problem states: \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means the BFS/DFS approach I initially outlined is required for each `x`.\nThe Dijkstra approach finds reachable points without considering the `x` constraint for intermediate steps.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `f(x)`.\n`f(x)` is the size of the set of points `S_x = {p | p \\text{ is reachable from } 0 \\text{ such that all intermediate steps } k \\text{ satisfy } 0 \\le k \\le x}`.\nThis is a much harder constraint.\nThe points reachable from `0` without any `x` constraint are `P = {k*g | k \\in Z}`.\nThe `min_reach[r]` (after dividing by `g`) correctly finds the smallest positive values `p` such that `p % a = r` and `p` is reachable.\nLet's call these `min_pos[r]`.\nThe set of all points reachable from `0` is `{min_pos[r] + k*a | k \\ge 0, r \\in [0, a-1]}` (if `min_pos[r]` is defined).\nThis is still not correct. `min_pos[r]` is the smallest `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\nThe set of all reachable points is actually `\\{ k \\cdot g \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ and } k \\cdot g \\ge \\text{some lower bound} \\}`.\nFor `gcd(a,b)=1`, any integer `k` can be reached if we don't care about the sign of coefficients.\nWith `+a` and `-b` operations, we can reach any `N` that is a multiple of `g`.\nThe set of non-negative reachable points is `\\{ k \\cdot g \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\cdot g \\ge 0 \\text{ and } k \\cdot g \\ge \\text{some lower bound} \\}`.\nThe `min_pos[r]` values from Dijkstra are the smallest non-negative values `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\nAny point `p'` reachable from `0` can be written as `p' = min_pos[p'%a] + k*a` for some `k >= 0`.\nThis set of points `\\{ min_pos[r] + k*a \\mid r \\in [0, a-1], k \\ge 0 \\}` are *all* the non-negative reachable points using `+a` and `-b` jumps, *without considering the `[0, x]` interval constraint on intermediate jumps*.\nThis is the standard Frobenius Coin Problem / extended Euclidean algorithm problem.\n\nThe problem specifically says \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means `f(x)` is the number of nodes reachable from `0` in the graph where nodes are `0, ..., x` and edges are `k -> k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) and `k -> k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\nThis is a standard BFS/DFS on a graph of size `x+1`.\nFor `a, b <= 10^5`, this means `x` can be up to `10^5`.\nFor `x > a * b` (approximately), the set of reachable points might stabilize or grow linearly.\nThe maximum value of `x` for which `f(x)` might behave differently is related to `a*b`.\nIf `x` is large enough, say `x >= a*b`, then if we can reach `k`, we can reach `k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) and `k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\nIf `k` is reachable and `k \\ge b`, then `k-b` is reachable.\nIf `k` is reachable and `k+a \\le x`, then `k+a` is reachable.\nThe range of values `min_reach[r]` is up to `a*b`.\nIf `x` is large enough, say `x >= a*b`, then for any reachable `p` with `p \\le x-a`, `p+a` is reachable.\nAnd for any reachable `p` with `p \\ge b`, `p-b` is reachable.\nThis means that for `x` large enough, all values `p` in `[min_val, x]` that are multiples of `g` become reachable, where `min_val` is the smallest reachable positive integer.\nThe crucial observation is that if `k` is reachable and `k \\ge b`, then `k-b` is reachable. If `k \\ge \\text{max_min_reach_val}`, then all `k-b, k-2b, ...` down to `min_reach[k%a]` are reachable.\nThe maximum value in `min_reach` array (let's call it `max_mr`) is at most `(a-1)b`.\nIf `x >= max_mr`, then any `p` reachable from `0` and `p \\le x` is reachable *without violating the `[0, x]` constraint on intermediate steps*.\nThis is because `min_reach[r]` is the smallest number `p` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\nIf `p` is reachable, then `p = k*a - l*b`. All intermediate steps `p_j` are `\\ge 0`.\nIf `p_j < 0`, we can rephrase `p_j` as `p_j + (c_j)*a - (c_j)*a`.\nThe values `min_reach[r]` are found via Dijkstra, which means all intermediate values `d` are always non-negative.\nSo the `min_reach[r]` values are indeed the minimum reachable values that are non-negative.\nThe question is if a jump `k+a` or `k-b` makes an intermediate value `>x` or `<0`.\nIf `x >= max_mr`, then for any `p \\le x`, any `p+a` or `p-b` jump:\nIf `p-b < 0`, it's not allowed. If `p-b >= 0`, it is `p-b`.\nIf `p+a > x`, it's not allowed. If `p+a <= x`, it is `p+a`.\nThe critical insight is that if we can reach `p` and `p \\ge max(a,b)`, and `p \\le x - max(a,b)`, then we can reach `p+a` and `p-b` without going out of bounds `[0, x]`.\nThe `min_reach[r]` values are the smallest reachable points for each remainder `r`.\nIf `x` is large enough, say `x >= max_mr + a`, then for any `p` in `[max_mr, x-a]`, if `p` is reachable, then `p+a` is reachable.\nAnd for any `p` in `[b, x]`, if `p` is reachable, then `p-b` is reachable.\nThis forms a \"contiguous block\" of reachable numbers.\nFor `x >= max_mr`, `f(x)` is `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)`. This is the formula I used.\nThe range of `a` and `b` is `10^5`, so `max_mr` can be `10^{10}`. This is larger than `m`.\nSo the condition `x >= max_mr` might never be met.\nThis implies we have to use the BFS for small `x`.\n\nLet `L = max(a, b) + max_mr`. If `x >= L`, then `f(x)` grows linearly.\n`max_mr` can be up to `(a-1)b`. So `L` can be `a + (a-1)b`.\nFor `a, b = 10^5`, `L` can be `10^{10}`.\nThis means for `m = 10^9`, we are always in the \"small `x`\" regime.\nWe must compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m` using BFS.\nThis is too slow. `m` BFS runs.\n\nLet's consider the structure of `f(x)`.\n`f(x)` is the number of nodes reachable in `[0, x]`.\n`f(x)` is non-decreasing.\nThe maximum value `min_reach[r]` is `(a-1)b` if `gcd(a,b)=1`.\nThis value `(a-1)b` is the largest non-reachable number if `a,b` are coprime, and we only use `+a, +b`.\nBut we use `+a, -b`.\nThe maximum `min_reach[r]` value (the one from Dijkstra) is `(a-1)b` (e.g. `a=10^5, b=10^5-1`).\nLet `K = max(min_reach[r] \\text{ for } r=0..a-1)`.\nFor `x > K`, the formula `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)` *is* correct.\nWhy? Because `min_reach[r]` is the smallest `p \\ge 0` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `p` is reachable.\nThe Dijkstra algorithm for `min_reach[r]` finds these values by repeatedly applying `k \\to k-b`. All intermediate `d` values are `\\ge 0`.\nSo if `p` is one of these `min_reach[r]` values, it means there's a path from `0` to `p` where all intermediate points are `\\ge 0`.\nIf `x >= K`, then for any `min_reach[r] \\le x`, all points `min_reach[r] + k*a` are also reachable and `\\ge 0`.\nThe only constraint is `p \\le x`.\nThe condition \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\" means that *all* steps must be within `[0, x]`.\nThis is exactly what makes the problem hard.\nLet `dp[i]` be true if `i` is reachable, false otherwise.\n`dp[0] = true`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `x`:\n  If `dp[i]` is true:\n    If `i+a <= x`, `dp[i+a] = true`.\n    If `i-b >= 0`, `dp[i-b] = true`.\nThis is a standard BFS. The `f(x)` is `count(dp[j]=true for j in 0..x)`.\n\nThe crucial part is that `a` and `b` are positive integers.\nIf `gcd(a,b)=1`, then any integer `k` can be represented as `x*a + y*b`.\nIf `k` is reachable, then `k = N_a * a - N_b * b` for some `N_a, N_b \\ge 0`.\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum number of `+b` jumps needed to reach `k` starting from `0` using only `+a` jumps, such that `k` is the highest point reached. This is not quite it.\n\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum value `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` (staying within `[0, x]`).\nNo, this `dist[r]` is what I calculated before.\nThe problem is that if `x` is small, say `x=10`, `a=5, b=3`.\n`f(7)` example:\n`0`.\n`0+5=5`.\n`5-3=2`.\n`2+5=7`.\n`7-3=4`.\n`4-3=1`.\n`1+5=6`.\n`6-3=3`.\nAll these points `{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}` are reachable. All intermediate jumps are within `[0,7]`. So `f(7)=8`.\nMy `min_reach_prime` for `a=5, b=3` was `[0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`.\nThe values `9, 12` are `>7`. They are not reachable within `[0,7]`.\nThis means the `min_reach` array is NOT what we need. It calculates reachability without the `x` constraint.\n\nThe problem implies that `f(x)` depends on `x` not just as an upper bound, but as a constraint on the path.\nThis is a standard \"reachable nodes in range\" problem.\nThe solution must use the fact that `a, b` are relatively small (`10^5`), while `m` is large (`10^9`).\nThis means we can do something `O(a)` or `O(b)` or `O(a+b)` for `f(x)` for small `x`, and then find a pattern for large `x`.\nThe pattern for `f(x)` is that it becomes `x/g + C` for large `x`.\n\nLet's use the `gcd(a, b) = 1` case.\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum number of `+a` jumps to reach `i` from `0` such that all intermediate positions are `\\ge 0`.\nNo, this is still not correct.\nLet `dp[i]` be `true` if `i` is reachable from `0` staying within `[0, X]`.\nThis is a BFS.\n`q = deque([0])`, `visited = {0}`.\nWhile `q`:\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  If `curr + a <= X` and `curr + a` not in `visited`: `visited.add(curr + a)`, `q.append(curr + a)`.\n  If `curr - b >= 0` and `curr - b` not in `visited`: `visited.add(curr - b)`, `q.append(curr - b)`.\n`f(X) = len(visited)`.\n\nThe state of the frog is just its position.\nLet `limit = a + b`. Or `2*a*b`.\nIf `x` is large enough, say `x >= L`, then `f(x)` will be `f(L) + (x-L)*g`.\nThe maximum value of `a` and `b` is `10^5`.\nThe range `[0, a+b]` is `[0, 2*10^5]`.\nLet's compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `K_limit`, where `K_limit` is some value like `2*a` or `a+b`.\nThe maximum value of `a` is `10^5`.\nLet `max_val = max(a, b)`.\nLet `K_limit = max_val + a + b`. This is `2*10^5 + 2*10^5 = 4*10^5`.\nWe can run BFS for each `x` up to `K_limit`.\nNo, for each `x`, the BFS restarts. Still too slow.\nWe need `f(i)` for `i=0..m`.\n`f(i)` is non-decreasing.\nThe values `f(i)` will be `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, ..., f(L), f(L)+g, f(L)+2g, ...`\nThe number of points reachable `p` such that `p \\le x` is `f(x)`.\nLet `reachable[k]` be true if `k` is reachable.\n`reachable[0] = true`.\nWe can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `max(a,b) * 2`. Or `a+b`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the smallest integer `j` such that `j \\equiv i \\pmod g` and `j` is reachable.\nThis is exactly the `min_reach` array from before, but for `g=1`.\nLet `dp[r]` be the minimum value `v` such that `v \\pmod a = r` and `v` is reachable from `0` (without `x` constraint).\nThis is the Dijkstra result.\nLet `limit = a+b`.\nFor `x > limit`, `f(x)` becomes `f(limit) + (x-limit)/g`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)` can be split into two parts:\n1.  `sum_{i=0}^{K_0} f(i)`: for small `i`, computed directly.\n2.  `sum_{i=K_0+1}^{m} f(i)`: for large `i`, where `f(i)` has a linear form.\nWhat is `K_0`? It should be large enough such that for `i > K_0`, `f(i)` follows a pattern.\nThe pattern is that `f(i)` becomes `(i/g) + C` for some `C`.\nThe maximum value of `min_reach[r]` (after dividing by `g`) is `(a_prime-1)b_prime`.\nLet `K_0 = (a_prime-1)b_prime`. This is the largest non-reachable value (if `a_prime, b_prime` are coprime).\nThis is the value where the set of reachable points for `g=1` becomes `[0, \\infty)`.\nThis `K_0` can be `10^{10}`. So `K_0` can be larger than `m`.\nThis means the `f(x)` formula `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)` *is* the correct one to use.\nThe `min_reach[r]` values are computed using Dijkstra. The fact that the frog \"never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\" means that we only count points `p` in `[0, x]` that are reachable. The `min_reach[r]` values are the minimum `p \\ge 0` reachable *if we only care about `p \\ge 0` for intermediate steps*.\nLet's consider the problem statement carefully: \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means the entire path from `0` to `p` must stay within `[0, x]`.\nThis is a standard BFS.\nFor `m=10^9, a,b=10^5`.\n`K_0 = 2*a_prime*b_prime` roughly.\nIf `a=10^5, b=10^5`, `g=10^5`. `a_prime=1, b_prime=1`.\n`min_reach_prime[0]=0`. `f'(x) = (x-0)//1 + 1 = x+1`.\n`sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{m} f'(floor(i/g)) = sum_{i=0}^{m} (floor(i/g)+1)`.\nThis is `g * sum_{k=0}^{M_prime-1} (k+1) + (m - M_prime*g + 1) * (M_prime+1)`.\nThis is the `sum_arith_series` formula.\nMy previous logic for `gcd(a,b)=1` and `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)` is correct.\nThe `min_reach[r]` values are computed by Dijkstra, which implicitly means all intermediate steps are `\\ge 0`.\nThe `x` constraint for intermediate steps is what's tricky.\nIf `p` is reachable from `0` using only `\\ge 0` intermediate steps, it can be written as `p = k*a - l*b`.\nIf `p \\le x`, can we say `p` is reachable using only `[0, x]` intermediate steps?\nNot necessarily. E.g., `a=10, b=1`. `x=12`.\n`0 \\to 10 \\to 9 \\to 8 \\to ... \\to 1 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to ...`\n`0 \\to 10`. `10 \\le 12`.\n`10 \\to 10-1 = 9`. `9 \\le 12`.\n`0 \\to 10 \\to 10+10 = 20`. This is not allowed if `x=12`.\nThe problem note for `a=5, b=3, m=7`: `f(7)=8`.\nMy `min_reach_prime = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`.\nMy formula `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} max(0, floor((x - min_reach[r]) / a) + 1)` gives `f(7)=4`.\nThis means my interpretation of `f(x)` using `min_reach` is wrong.\nThe `x` constraint for intermediate jumps is critical.\n\nThe only way to solve this efficiently is if the number of distinct `f(i)` values is small, or if `f(i)` stabilizes quickly.\nThe values `min_reach[r]` are the smallest reachable points if we only care about `pos >= 0`.\nThe actual reachable points `P_x` for a given `x` are found by BFS.\nLet `R_x = {p \\mid p \\text{ is reachable from } 0 \\text{ staying in } [0, x]}`.\n`f(x) = |R_x|`.\nThe states for BFS are `0, ..., x`.\nThe maximum value of `x` for which `f(x)` is computed by BFS is limited by `a+b`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the minimum `x` such that `i` is reachable from `0` and all intermediate points are in `[0, x]`.\nThis is not helpful.\n\nLet's consider the maximum value `K_max` we need to compute `f(i)` for directly using BFS.\nFor `i > K_max`, `f(i)` must follow a pattern.\nWhat is `K_max`? It's related to `a+b`.\nThe set of reachable points for `x` is `S_x`.\n`S_x` can be found by BFS.\n`q = deque([0])`, `visited = {0}`.\n`reachable_bfs = [False] * (max_val_to_check + 1)`.\n`reachable_bfs[0] = True`.\n`q.append(0)`.\nWhile `q`:\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  If `curr + a <= max_val_to_check` and not `reachable_bfs[curr+a]`:\n    `reachable_bfs[curr+a] = True`\n    `q.append(curr+a)`\n  If `curr - b >= 0` and not `reachable_bfs[curr-b]`:\n    `reachable_bfs[curr-b] = True`\n    `q.append(curr-b)`\nThis BFS computes `S_{max_val_to_check}`.\nThis is the set of points reachable *if the upper bound is `max_val_to_check`*.\nLet `K = a+b`. We can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `K` by running `K` BFSs.\nThis is `K * K` states in worst case. `(2*10^5)^2 = 4*10^{10}`. Still too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation must be that the `f(x)` values quickly become linear.\nWhat is the \"period\" or \"stabilization point\"?\nIt's `a` or `b`.\nThe standard solution to this kind of problems is usually related to `a+b`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the smallest `x` such that `i` is reachable.\nIf `dp[i]` is computed by BFS starting from `0`.\n`q = deque([0])`, `dist = [-1] * (max_pos_to_check + 1)`. `dist[0] = 0`.\nWhile `q`:\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  If `curr + a <= max_pos_to_check` and `dist[curr+a] == -1`:\n    `dist[curr+a] = max(dist[curr], curr+a)`\n    `q.append(curr+a)`\n  If `curr - b >= 0` and `dist[curr-b] == -1`:\n    `dist[curr-b] = max(dist[curr], curr)`\n    `q.append(curr-b)`\nThis `dist[i]` is the minimum `max_pos` on any path from `0` to `i`.\n`f(x)` is the number of `i` such that `dist[i] <= x`.\nLet `N = max(a,b)`. We can compute `dist[i]` for `i` up to `N + a + b`.\nLet `K_MAX = a + b`. Max value `2*10^5`.\nWe can compute `dist[i]` for `i` from `0` to `K_MAX`.\nThis BFS runs in `O(K_MAX)` time.\nAfter computing `dist[i]` for `i=0..K_MAX`:\n`f(x) = count(i \\le x \\text{ s.t. } dist[i] \\le x)`.\nThe `dist` values can be `K_MAX`.\nFor `i > K_MAX`, what is `dist[i]`?\nIf `i` is reachable, then `i` must be `min_reach[i%a] + k*a`.\nAnd `dist[i]` must be `max(dist[min_reach[i%a]], i)`.\nThis is the previous `min_reach` array from Dijkstra.\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Divide `a, b, m` by `g`. Let `a', b', M_prime`.\nCompute `min_val_for_rem[r]` using Dijkstra for `a', b'`. This is `min_reach_prime`.\nThe values `min_val_for_rem[r]` are the minimum values `p \\ge 0` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod{a'}` and `p` is reachable.\nLet `K = max(min_val_for_rem[r] \\text{ for } r=0..a'-1)`.\nThis `K` can be `(a'-1)b'`, up to `10^{10}`.\nIf `x >= K`, then `f(x)` is `sum_{r=0}^{a'-1} max(0, floor((x - min_val_for_rem[r]) / a') + 1)`.\nThis is the formula I had first. The example `f(7)=8` vs `f(7)=4` discrepancy means `K` is not `max_mr`.\nThe problem states `f(7)=8` for `a=5, b=3`. `g=1`. `a'=5, b'=3`.\n`min_val_for_rem = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`. `K = 12`.\nSince `7 < 12`, the formula doesn't apply.\nThe formula applies for `x >= K`.\nSo we need to compute `f(i)` directly for `i` up to `K`.\nBut `K` can be `10^{10}`. This is the problem.\nThe maximum `K` for which `f(i)` needs to be computed by BFS is `a+b`.\nLet `K_0 = a+b`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `K_0`, we compute `f(i)` using BFS.\n`f_values = [0] * (K_0 + 1)`.\n`q = deque([0])`, `visited = {0}`.\n`curr_max = 0`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `K_0`:\n  While `q`:\n    `p = q.popleft()`\n    If `p > curr_max`: `curr_max = p`.\n    If `p+a <= i` and `p+a` not in `visited`:\n      `visited.add(p+a)`\n      `q.append(p+a)`\n    If `p-b >= 0` and `p-b` not in `visited`:\n      `visited.add(p-b)`\n      `q.append(p-b)`\n  `f_values[i] = len(visited)`. This is not correct.\n  The BFS must be run for each `i`.\n\nThe key is that for `x` large enough, `f(x)` follows a linear pattern.\nThe \"large enough\" value is often around `a+b` or `a*b/g`.\nThe largest value of `a,b` is `10^5`. So `a+b` is `2*10^5`.\nLet `MAX_X_TO_BFS = a+b`.\nWe can run a single BFS up to `MAX_X_TO_BFS`.\n`reachable = [False] * (MAX_X_TO_BFS + 1)`.\n`q = deque([0])`. `reachable[0] = True`.\n`f_prefix_sum = [0] * (MAX_X_TO_BFS + 1)`.\n`count = 0`.\nFor `x` from `0` to `MAX_X_TO_BFS`:\n  If `reachable[x]`:\n    `count += 1`.\n    If `x+a <= MAX_X_TO_BFS`: `reachable[x+a] = True`.\n    If `x-b >= 0`: `reachable[x-b] = True`.\n  `f_prefix_sum[x] = count`.\n  This is not a BFS.
