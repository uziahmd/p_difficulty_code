For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "**The Heart of the Matter: Finding Those Abnormal Permutations**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem's laid out: two permutations, `p` and `q`, where `p` is *lexicographically* smaller than `q`, and the number of inversions in `p` is *greater* than in `q`. We need to count these \"abnormal\" pairs.  The key is that `n` can be up to 500.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the building blocks.  We have the total number of permutations of `n` elements, which is `n!`.  The maximum inversions are `n*(n-1)/2`, when the permutation is in reverse order. The minimum is 0, when it's in ascending order.  Let's keep track of `mod` for the results.\n\nWe're after a summation: iterating through all permutations `p` and then for each `p`, iterating through `q` that meets both conditions.  Lexicographical comparison is usually handled dynamically, building permutations from left to right. Inversion counts also can be tracked during construction. I need a clear DP structure here to make the process manageable.\n\nA standard dynamic programming approach would involve `dp[i][j]`, the number of permutations of `i` elements with `j` inversions. That can be built up recursively, but with the constraint of `n=500`, this direct route becomes very large. I can build `dp` which can then be used in the actual construction process.\n\nI realized that `inv_counts[i][j]` is sufficient which is the number of permutations of `i` elements having exactly `j` inversions. Then `inv_counts[n][k]` gives me the permutations of the whole set which can be used to compare the number of inversions between each pair.\n\nNow, for the lexicographical comparison. We iterate from the start of each permutation up to `n`, at each index `k`, ensuring `p[k] < q[k]`. If they're equal, we move on. If `p[k] < q[k]`, then we can count all the permutations for both `p` and `q` based on `inv_counts`.\n\nThe total pairs where `inv(p) > inv(q)` is `((n!)^2 - S_inv_eq) // 2`. And where `p <_L q` is `((n!)^2 - n!) // 2`. The main goal is to reduce computation complexity here.\n\nSince there's a relation between the reverse permutation and the total number of inversions, I have the symmetry.  I'm exploring the system of equations.  It appears that the key is the symmetry inherent in the problem.  We have four types of pairs: less than lexicographically, greater than inversion count; less than lexicographically, less than inversion count, etc. But the symmetry won't be as simple as I had hoped.\n\nThe approach of iterating through the differing position is correct. But the way to calculate the suffix, `dp` state, is important. Also, building a relation between `p`, `q` and `dp` is the critical point.\nI should build up a dynamic programming relation between `dp_inv_diff` for building up permutation.\nWith that relation, I should be able to get `O(N * M)` for each iteration.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1, ..., n` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q` and the number of inversions in `p` is greater than the number of inversions in `q`. We need to output the answer modulo `mod`.\n\nLet `inv(perm)` denote the number of inversions in a permutation `perm`.\nThe maximum number of inversions for a permutation of `n` elements is `MAX_INV = n * (n - 1) / 2`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We will build the permutations digit by digit from left to right.\nThe key idea is to iterate through the first position `k` (from `0` to `n-1`) where `p_k` and `q_k` differ.\nIf `p_0, ..., p_{k-1}` are identical to `q_0, ..., q_{k-1}`, and `p_k < q_k`, then `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`.\nFor such a `k`, we fix `p_0, ..., p_{k-1}` (and `q_0, ..., q_{k-1}`), then choose `p_k` and `q_k` from the remaining available numbers such that `p_k < q_k`. Finally, we complete `p` and `q` using the `n-k-1` remaining numbers.\n\nLet `dp_inv[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `i` elements (e.g., `1, ..., i`) that have `j` inversions.\nThis can be computed efficiently:\n`dp_inv[0][0] = 1`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `n`:\n  `prefix_sum = 0`\n  For `j` from `0` to `i * (i - 1) / 2`:\n    `prefix_sum = (prefix_sum + dp_inv[i-1][j]) % mod`\n    `if j >= i: prefix_sum = (prefix_sum - dp_inv[i-1][j-i] + mod) % mod`\n    `dp_inv[i][j] = prefix_sum`\nThe time complexity for this is `O(n * MAX_INV)`.\n\nThe main DP state will be `dp_diff[i][j]`, representing the number of pairs of permutations `(p', q')` of `i` elements (e.g., `1, ..., i`) such that `inv(p') - inv(q') = j`.\nThe `diff` can range from `-i*(i-1)/2` to `i*(i-1)/2`. We use an offset `MAX_INV` to store `j` as `j + MAX_INV`.\n`dp_diff[0][MAX_INV] = 1` (0 elements, 0 inversions for both, diff is 0).\nFor `i` from `1` to `n`:\n  Let `K = i - 1`.\n  `current_max_inv_i_minus_1 = K * (K - 1) // 2`.\n  `current_max_diff_i_minus_1 = K * (K - 1)`.\n  For `diff_idx` from `MAX_INV - current_max_diff_i_minus_1` to `MAX_INV + current_max_diff_i_minus_1`:\n    `dp_diff[i-1][diff_idx]` represents `dp_diff[i-1][diff_idx - MAX_INV]`.\n    When we add the `i`-th element:\n    If we insert `i` into `p'` at position `k_p` (0 to `i-1` from right-to-left), it adds `k_p` inversions.\n    If we insert `i` into `q'` at position `k_q` (0 to `i-1` from right-to-left), it adds `k_q` inversions.\n    The new difference is `old_diff + k_p - k_q`.\n    The number of ways to pick `k_p` and `k_q` such that `k_p - k_q = d'` is `i - |d'|` for `d'` from `-(i-1)` to `(i-1)`.\n    So `dp_diff[i][diff_idx] = sum_{d' = -(i-1)}^{i-1} (i - |d'|) * dp_diff[i-1][diff_idx - d']`.\n  This is a convolution. It can be optimized using prefix sums.\n  Let `A[x] = dp_diff[i-1][x]`. We want to compute `C[x] = sum_{d' = -(i-1)}^{i-1} (i - |d'|) A[x - d']`.\n  This can be rewritten as `C[x] = sum_{s=0}^{i-1} (sum_{k_p=0}^{s} A[x - (s - k_p) - k_p] + sum_{k_p=s+1}^{i-1} A[x - (k_p - s) - k_p])`.\n  A simpler way to compute `C[x]` is to observe that `(i - |d'|)` is a \"triangular\" sequence.\n  `C[x] = sum_{k_p=0}^{i-1} sum_{k_q=0}^{i-1} A[x - (k_p - k_q)]`.\n  This is `sum_{k_p=0}^{i-1} (sum_{k_q=0}^{i-1} A[x - k_p + k_q])`.\n  Let `S[v] = sum_{k=0}^{i-1} A[v+k]`. Then `C[x] = sum_{k_p=0}^{i-1} S[x - k_p]`.\n  This is still `O(n * MAX_INV * n)`.\n  However, the `sum_{k_p=0}^{i-1} sum_{k_q=0}^{i-1} dp_diff[i-1][old_diff_idx - k_p + k_q]` can be computed in `O(MAX_INV)` for each `i` by maintaining running sums.\n  Let `current_dp = dp_diff[i-1]`.\n  Let `next_dp = dp_diff[i]`.\n  `temp_sum = 0`\n  For `j` from `0` to `2 * MAX_INV`:\n    `temp_sum = (temp_sum + current_dp[j]) % mod`\n    `if j >= i: temp_sum = (temp_sum - current_dp[j-i] + mod) % mod`\n    `next_dp[j] = temp_sum`\n  `temp_sum = 0`\n  For `j` from `0` to `2 * MAX_INV`:\n    `temp_sum = (temp_sum + next_dp[j]) % mod`\n    `if j >= i: temp_sum = (temp_sum - next_dp[j-i] + mod) % mod`\n    `next_dp[j] = temp_sum`\n  This correctly computes the convolution `dp_diff[i-1]` with `(1+x+...+x^{i-1})^2`.\nThe time complexity for this is `O(n * MAX_INV)`.\n\nNow, we calculate the total answer.\n`total_ans = 0`.\n`current_p_prefix_inv = 0`.\n`current_q_prefix_inv = 0`.\n`used_mask = 0`. (A bitmask for small `n`, but for `n=500` we need a different approach to track used numbers).\nInstead of a mask, we can keep track of the count of numbers smaller than `v` that are available.\n\nLet `fact[k]` be `k!`.\n`fact[0] = 1`. For `k=1..n`, `fact[k] = (fact[k-1] * k) % mod`.\n\nWe iterate `k` from `0` to `n-1` (position where `p` and `q` first differ).\nAt position `k`, we have `n-k` available numbers.\nFor each available number `v_p` for `p_k`:\n  For each available number `v_q` for `q_k`:\n    If `v_p == v_q`, then `p_k = q_k`. We continue to the next iteration (effectively, this is handled by `current_p_prefix_inv` and `current_q_prefix_inv` updates if `p_k = q_k`).\n    If `v_p < v_q`: `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q` at this position.\n      Number of inversions `v_p` adds to `p_prefix`: `count_available_smaller_than(v_p, available_numbers)`.\n      Number of inversions `v_q` adds to `q_prefix`: `count_available_smaller_than(v_q, available_numbers)`.\n      Let `inv_p_added = count_smaller_available(v_p)`.\n      Let `inv_q_added = count_smaller_available(v_q)`.\n      The remaining `n-k-1` numbers can be arranged in `(n-k-1)!` ways for `p_suffix` and `(n-k-1)!` ways for `q_suffix`.\n      The difference in inversions for the suffixes is handled by `dp_diff[n-k-1]`.\n      We need `current_p_prefix_inv + inv_p_added + inv(p_suffix) > current_q_prefix_inv + inv_q_added + inv(q_suffix)`.\n      Let `base_diff = current_p_prefix_inv + inv_p_added - (current_q_prefix_inv + inv_q_added)`.\n      We need to sum `dp_diff[n-k-1][diff_suffix]` for `diff_suffix > -base_diff`.\n      This is `sum_{j = -base_diff + 1}^{MAX_INV_suffix} dp_diff[n-k-1][j + MAX_INV]`.\n      This sum can be computed using prefix sums of `dp_diff`.\n\nLet `pref_dp_diff[i][j]` be `sum_{x=0}^{j} dp_diff[i][x]`.\nThe sum `sum_{j = S}^{E} dp_diff[i][j]` is `(pref_dp_diff[i][E] - pref_dp_diff[i][S-1] + mod) % mod`.\n\nThe number of available numbers smaller than `v` is `v - 1 - count_used_smaller_than(v)`.\n`count_used_smaller_than(v)` can be maintained using a Fenwick tree (BIT) or segment tree on values `1..n`.\nFor `n=500`, a BIT is `O(log n)`.\nThe outer loop runs `n` times. Inside, two nested loops for `v_p, v_q` (`O(n^2)`). Inside that, BIT operations `O(log n)`. Total `O(n^3 log n)`.\n`500^3 * log 500 = 125 * 10^6 * 9 \\approx 10^9`, too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation for `p_k = q_k` is that the `k`-th element chosen `v` adds `count_smaller_available(v)` inversions to both `p` and `q`.\nSo `current_p_prefix_inv` and `current_q_prefix_inv` are always equal if `p_0..p_{k-1}` are equal to `q_0..q_{k-1}`.\nLet `prefix_inv_sum` be this common inversion count.\nWhen we choose `p_k = v_p` and `q_k = v_q` with `v_p < v_q`:\n`inv_p_added = count_smaller_available(v_p)`.\n`inv_q_added = count_smaller_available(v_q)`.\nThe `base_diff` is `prefix_inv_sum + inv_p_added - (prefix_inv_sum + inv_q_added) = inv_p_added - inv_q_added`.\nThis simplifies things significantly. The `prefix_inv_sum` cancels out.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Precompute `dp_inv[i][j]` for `i=0..n, j=0..MAX_INV`. `O(n * MAX_INV)`.\n2.

The logic above directly counts `p_k < q_k`.\n      The issue is that `v_p` and `v_q` for `p_k` and `q_k` might be chosen from `1..n` but are not necessarily small values. The `num_available_smaller_than_X` logic is for the actual values.\n\nLet's refine `num_available_smaller_than_X`.\nWhen we choose `p_k = v_p` and `q_k = v_q`, the values `v_p` and `v_q` are from the set of `n-k` available numbers.\nThe number of inversions `v_p` adds to `p` at position `k` is the count of values `x` already chosen for `p_0..p_{k-1}` such that `x > v_p`. This is `current_prefix_inv_p_k`.\nThe number of inversions `v_p` adds with elements *to its right* in `p_k, ..., p_{n-1}` is the count of elements `y` in `available_numbers \\setminus \\{v_p\\}` such that `y < v_p`.\nThis is exactly `count_available_smaller_than(v_p)`.\nSo `inv_p_added = count_available_smaller_than(v_p)`.\n`count_available_smaller_than(v)` is `(v-1) - BIT.query(v-1)`.

The values `v_p, v_q` themselves don't matter, only their relative order among the available elements.\nSo `used_count_smaller(x)` is simply the index of `x` in `list_of_available_values`.\nThen the `O(log N)` factor is removed.\nThe total time complexity is `O(N * MAX_INV + N^3)`.\n`500 * 124750 = 6.2 * 10^7`.\n`500^3 = 1.25 * 10^8`.\nTotal `~1.8 * 10^8`.

Still too slow.\n\nThe only way for `O(N^3)` to pass is if the `k` loop is `O(N)`, and the inner loops for `v_p, v_q` are `O(N^2)`.\nThe `base_diff` calculation is `O(1)` if `c_u_s` values are precalculated.\nThe `O(N)` precalculation of `c_u_s` values for unused elements and `available_indices` list would be for each `k`.\nThis makes the overall complexity `O(N * (N + N^2)) = O(N^3)`.\nThis is the most plausible complexity.
