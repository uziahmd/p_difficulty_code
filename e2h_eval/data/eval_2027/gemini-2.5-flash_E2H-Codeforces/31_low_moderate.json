Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem.  Essentially, Vanya has a bunch of cards with integer values, and he wants the sum of all the cards, including any he adds, to be zero. The catch is that the absolute value of any card can't exceed a given value, `x`.  So, I need to figure out the minimum number of extra cards Vanya needs to reach that target sum of zero.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. I have `n` cards he *already* has, and each card value is within the range of `-x` to `x`.  He *could* have an unlimited supply of each number within that range, but he doesn't *need* them all - just enough to get the total sum to zero.\n\nThe core of the problem is calculating how far off the initial sum is from zero.  The examples are helpful here.  If the current sum is, say, 2 (like in Example 1), I'm just one `-2` card away. Easy.  But if the sum is -4 (like in Example 2), things get trickier. I *can't* just use one `4` card because `4 > x`.\n\nMy strategy has to be about minimizing the number of cards. If I need a sum of, say, 7, and `x` is 3, I'm going to want to use as many 3s as possible, because that's the most efficient way to reduce the sum and use the fewest cards. So, I need to focus on this idea of finding how many `x` cards (or `-x` cards, depending on the current sum) will be *needed*.\n\nHere's the algorithm I'm seeing:\n\n1.  **Calculate the current sum:**  Sum all the values on the `n` cards Vanya *already* has.\n2.  **Find the absolute value:**  Take the absolute value of that current sum - that tells me how far away I am from zero.\n3.  **Determine the *direction* I need to go:** Based on whether the sum is positive or negative, I know if I need to add positive or negative cards.\n4.  **Use the maximum values:** Divide the absolute value of the current sum by `x`. That gives me the *minimum* number of cards I *must* add, given that I'm aiming for cards with an absolute value of `x`.  I'll need to use the `ceil` function to round up to the nearest integer, to cover any remaining amount.\n5.  **The answer:** That rounded-up result is the minimum number of additional cards needed!  If the absolute sum is zero, then of course, no cards are needed.\n",
