Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Path to 'Crazy Town': A Mental Walkthrough**\n\nAlright, let's break down this \"Crazy Town\" problem. It's essentially a geometry problem disguised as a city traversal. The core idea is this: we're given a home and university location, and a bunch of lines (roads) that crisscross the plane. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of road crossings needed to get from home to the university.\n\nMy first thought is that the number of steps directly corresponds to the number of roads that *separate* the home and university blocks.  If a road is on the same side of both the home and university, then it's not a barrier. But if the road lies between them, we *must* cross it.\n\nThe input provides coordinates for home, university, and the coefficients for the line equations representing the roads. The crucial part is figuring out how to efficiently determine if two points (home and university) are on opposite sides of a given line.\n\nThis leads to the core calculation: `ax + by + c`. For a point (x, y), evaluating this expression gives a value: positive, negative, or zero.  The sign of the value tells us which side of the line the point lies on.  Since we're guaranteed the home and university aren't *on* any road, the result will always be either positive or negative.\n\nTherefore, for each road, I need to plug in the home coordinates and the university coordinates into the line equation.  If the results have opposite signs, we have a crossing.  This is the key insight.  I'll initialize a step counter to zero. Then, for each road, I perform this calculation for both home and university, check if the signs differ, and increment the step counter if so.\n\nMathematically, if `val1` is the result for home and `val2` for university, and `val1 * val2 < 0`, the signs are opposite, and we increment the count.  This is elegant and efficient.  There's no need to handle zero cases because the problem explicitly states that the home and university won't be on the line.\n\nFinally, the problem's constraints are straightforward. The number of roads is manageable (n <= 300), and the coordinates and coefficients fall within a reasonable range (-10^6 to 10^6).  Python's built-in integer handling handles potential large numbers from the `ax + by + c` calculation, so no overflow concerns. The overall algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), so it will be very efficient. The algorithm will work with the logic that each step corresponds to an intersecting line that separates the home and university blocks.\n\nLet's code it up and test it!\n",
