Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, I'm tackling this \"New Year Candles\" problem. Seems straightforward at first glance, but I want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly. Essentially, Vasily has a starting number of candles (`a`) and a burn-to-new-candle ratio (`b`). The goal is to maximize the total hours the room is lit. This screams simulation, so I'll need to keep track of a few key variables: the total lit hours (`total_hours`), the currently usable new candles (`current_new_candles`), and the number of burned-out candles (`burned_out_candles`).\n\nThe core logic will be an iterative process: I'll use all the current new candles to light the room, incrementing `total_hours`. After they're burned, they become burned-out candles, increasing `burned_out_candles`. Then, the crucial part: I'll check if I have enough burned-out candles to make new ones. If `burned_out_candles` divided by `b` is greater than zero, I'll create new candles (add them to `current_new_candles`) and subtract the necessary burned-out ones. This loop continues until I have no more new candles and can't create any more from the burned-out ones.\n\nTo really solidify my understanding, I'm going to trace an example. Let's take `a = 4` and `b = 2`. Initially, I have 4 new candles, and no burned-out ones. In the first iteration, I burn the 4 candles, getting 4 hours of light and 4 burned-out candles. Since `4 // 2 = 2`, I can make 2 new candles, leaving me with zero burned-out candles. In the second iteration, I burn the 2 candles, gaining 2 hours and 2 burned-out candles. This allows me to make 1 more new candle, again using up the burned-out ones. Finally, in the third iteration, I burn the last candle and end up with one burned-out candle, which is not enough to make any new ones. So, I end with a total of 7 hours. The iteration stops there. Okay, that example confirms the process works as I expected. I'm ready to translate this logic into Python.\n",
