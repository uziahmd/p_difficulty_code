His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, and my current solution approach.**\n\nOkay, this problem's got me thinking. It's a ranking problem, but with a twist - we don't know the exact pairings between the scores from the two tours. It's essentially a matching problem combined with a ranking calculation under certain constraints. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve given his minimum total score, 'x', and the scores of 'n' participants across two tours, 'a' and 'b'.\n\nMy initial breakdown goes like this: input is 'n', 'x', and lists 'a' and 'b'. The output will be two integers representing best and worst ranks. Participants are ranked by the sum of their tour scores (higher sum = better rank). Crucially, equal sums can be broken arbitrarily. Vasya's total score is *at least* 'x', meaning there's *at least* one pair (a_i, b_j) from the provided input scores for which the sum is >= 'x'.\n\nI immediately recognize the need to understand how the *arbitrary* assignment of 'a' and 'b' scores affects rankings. We have 'n' tour 1 scores and 'n' tour 2 scores, and the challenge is to pair these to determine each participant's total score. Since it's a perfect matching, each score from 'a' must be used exactly once and each from 'b' must be used exactly once.\n\nTo achieve the *best* rank (which, ideally, would be 1), I want to maximize Vasya's total score – find the best possible sum of the pair for Vasya. Also, the smaller the scores for the others, the better. So, the best case, I think I need Vasya to have highest possible score (max(a)+max(b)) if it's over or equal to 'x'. This might lead him to rank 1. But, I cannot forget all possible pairing scenarios.\n\nFor the best rank, I'm now fairly convinced it will *always* be 1. Why? Because I can *always* find a pairing that puts Vasya at the top. Since there must be at least one valid pairing that meets the >= 'x' criteria. Also, tie-breaking rules let him win by default.\n\nNow, for the worst rank, the thought process is completely opposite. Minimize Vasya's score (while still being >= 'x'), and maximize everyone else's scores relative to him. If many people score higher or equal, that will drive up his worst rank. If Vasya gets the lowest score among the possible combinations, it will increase worst rank. So I need to sort 'a' and 'b' and try pairing up to have some way to minimize his total score. Then, the people with sums greater or equal than Vasya is what will determine his worst rank.\n\nSort a and b ascending. Vasya should take lowest combination of scores that are at least 'x'. So, I thought about maximizing the other participant scores. Also, for the worst rank, maximizing ties (people with score equal to Vasya's), will increase the worst rank.\n\nMy current strategy for worst rank involves a greedy approach. I calculate `count_ge(S)` to maximize pairs that will have a sum at least 'S'. I'll sort 'a' and 'b' (both ascending). Sort them in ascending order. Then, I iterate through each possible score `a_i` for Vasya. For each, I find the smallest corresponding `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. This gives me my potential 'S_min_Vasya' (the minimum possible Vasya's score). To calculate `count_ge`, using two pointer approach, iterate through possible pairs to find how many scores >= than the `S_min_Vasya` with the remaining scores (excluding Vasya's selected a_i and b_j).\n\nTo find `S_min_Vasya`, I can iterate through the sorted `a` values and, for each `a_i`, use `bisect_left` on `b` to find the smallest `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. This efficiently finds the minimum score Vasya *can* achieve.\nI then calculate the actual number of pairs that could be strictly above, or equal with Vasya (using the greedy algorithm: 2 pointers). The worst case is when Vasya gets the *smallest* valid total score, and a *lot* of other participants also score at least as high.\n\nThe time complexity is dominated by the sorting (O(n log n)) and the calculation of `count_ge(S_min_Vasya)` (O(n)).",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad. We are given the number of participants `n`, Vasya's minimum total score `x`, and two lists of scores `a` and `b` for the first and second tours, respectively. We don't know which `a_i` corresponds to which `b_j`, only that each participant has one score from `a` and one from `b`, and all scores are used exactly once to form `n` pairs. Vasya is one of these participants. Participants are ranked by total score (sum of tour 1 and tour 2 points) in decreasing order. Ties are broken arbitrarily by the jury.\n\n**1. Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to have a total score that is greater than or equal to all other participants' scores. Since we can arbitrarily pair scores, Vasya can always be assigned the highest score from tour 1 (`max(a)`) and the highest score from tour 2 (`max(b)`). His total score would be `max(a) + max(b)`. No other participant can achieve a higher score than this. Even if other participants also achieve the same maximum score, the problem states that in case of ties, the jury can assign places according to their choice. Therefore, the jury can choose to place Vasya first.\nThe problem guarantees that Vasya was present and could achieve at least `x` points, so `max(a) + max(b)` will certainly be at least `x` (or if it's less than `x`, it means the guarantee implies that Vasya cannot achieve `max(a)+max(b)` if that sum is less than `x`, but then the guarantee would be violated. The guarantee simply ensures that *some* pair `a_i, b_j` sums to at least `x`. Vasya can always be assigned `max(a)` and `max(b)`).\nThus, the best rank Vasya can achieve is always **1**.\n\n**2. Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo find Vasya's worst possible rank, we need to consider a scenario where:\na. Vasya's total score `S_V` is as low as possible, but still `S_V >= x`.\nb. For this score `S_V`, the maximum possible number of other participants score `S_V` or more.\nc. Due to arbitrary tie-breaking, all participants who score `S_V` (and are not Vasya) are placed above Vasya.\n\nLet's formalize this:\nThe worst rank for Vasya will be `k`, where `k` is the maximum number of participants who can score at least `S_V`, and Vasya is one of these `k` participants.\n\nTo achieve this, we follow these steps:\n\n*   **Sort the scores:** Sort both `a` and `b` arrays in ascending order. Let them be `a_0, ..., a_{n-1}` and `b_0, ..., b_{n-1}`.\n\n*   **Find Vasya's minimum possible score `S_min_Vasya` (such that `S_min_Vasya >= x`):**\n    We iterate through each score `a_i` from the sorted `a` array. For each `a_i`, Vasya needs to be paired with some `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To minimize `a_i + b_j`, we should choose the smallest `b_j` that satisfies `b_j >= x - a_i`. We can efficiently find this `b_j` using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the sorted `b` array. If such a `b_j` exists, `a_i + b_j` is a candidate for Vasya's score. We take the minimum of all such candidate scores over all possible `a_i`.\n    This step has a time complexity of `O(N log N)`.\n\n*   **Calculate the maximum number of participants who can score at least `S_min_Vasya`:**\n    Let `S_target = S_min_Vasya`. We want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_k, b_l)` that can be formed (using each `a_k` and `b_l` at most once) such that `a_k + b_l >= S_target`. This can be done using a two-pointer approach:\n    1.  Initialize `count = 0`, `ptr_a = 0` (for sorted `a`), `ptr_b = n - 1` (for sorted `b`).\n    2.  While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n        a.  If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_target`: This pair `(a[ptr_a], b[ptr_b])` contributes to the count. We increment `count`, move `ptr_a` forward (`ptr_a++`), and `ptr_b` backward (`ptr_b--`) to use these scores.\n        b.  Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < S_target`): `a[ptr_a]` is too small to form a sum of at least `S_target` even with the largest available `b` (`b[ptr_b]`). So, `a[ptr_a]` cannot be part of any pair summing to `S_target` or more with the remaining `b` values. We must use `a[ptr_a]` with a smaller `b` (or a `b` that results in a sum less than `S_target`), so we move `ptr_a` forward (`ptr_a++`).\n    3.  The final `count` is the maximum number of participants who can score at least `S_target`. This `count` will be Vasya's worst rank.\n    This step has a time complexity of `O(N)`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n = 5, x = 2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n1.  **Best Rank:** 1.\n2.  **Worst Rank:**\n    *   Sorted `a`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n    *   Sorted `b`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n    *   `S_min_Vasya`:\n        For `a[0]=1`, `target_b = 2 - 1 = 1`. `bisect_left(b, 1)` gives index 0. `a[0] + b[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n        `S_min_Vasya = 2`.\n    *   `count_ge(S_target = 2)`:\n        `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 4`, `count = 0`\n        - `a[0]+b[4] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `count = 1`. `ptr_a = 1`, `ptr_b = 3`.\n        - `a[1]+b[3] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `count = 2`. `ptr_a = 2`, `ptr_b = 2`.\n        - `a[2]+b[2] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `count = 3`. `ptr_a = 3`, `ptr_b = 1`.\n        - `a[3]+b[1] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `count = 4`. `ptr_a = 4`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n        - `a[4]+b[0] = 1+1=2 >= 2`. `count = 5`. `ptr_a = 5`, `ptr_b = -1`.\n        Loop ends. `count = 5`.\n    *   Worst rank is 5.\nOutput: `1 5`\n\n**Overall Complexity:**\nSorting `a` and `b` takes `O(N log N)`.\nCalculating `S_min_Vasya` takes `O(N log N)` (N iterations, each with a binary search).\nCalculating `count_ge` takes `O(N)`.\nThe dominant complexity is `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_left\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank is always 1.\n    # Vasya can be assigned the highest score from tour 1 and highest from tour 2.\n    # No one can score higher, and in case of ties, jury can place Vasya first.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst rank calculation\n    # Sort both arrays in ascending order\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n\n    # Step 1: Find S_min_Vasya - the minimum possible score Vasya could get while satisfying S_V >= x\n    s_min_vasya = float('inf')\n    for val_a in a:\n        # We need b_j such that val_a + b_j >= x, so b_j >= x - val_a\n        required_b = x - val_a\n        \n        # Find the smallest b_j in sorted b that is >= required_b\n        idx_b = bisect_left(b, required_b)\n        \n        if idx_b < n:\n            # If such a b_j exists, this is a candidate score for Vasya\n            current_vasya_score = val_a + b[idx_b]\n            s_min_vasya = min(s_min_vasya, current_vasya_score)\n            \n    # The problem guarantees that Vasya was present and could achieve at least x points,\n    # so s_min_vasya will not remain infinity.\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of participants who can score at least S_min_Vasya\n    # This count will be Vasya's worst rank.\n    \n    count_ge_s_min_vasya = 0\n    ptr_a = 0\n    ptr_b = n - 1 # Start from the largest b score\n\n    while ptr_a < n and ptr_b >= 0:\n        if a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= s_min_vasya:\n            # This pair (a[ptr_a], b[ptr_b]) can achieve at least s_min_vasya\n            count_ge_s_min_vasya += 1\n            ptr_a += 1 # Use a[ptr_a]\n            ptr_b -= 1 # Use b[ptr_b]\n        else:\n            # a[ptr_a] is too small to combine with b[ptr_b] (the largest remaining b)\n            # to reach s_min_vasya.
