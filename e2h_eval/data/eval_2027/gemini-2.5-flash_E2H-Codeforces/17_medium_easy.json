He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Prefixes and Suffixes: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem. Here's how I'm breaking it down. The core is figuring out the original string `s`, which is `n` characters long. We're given all the *improper* prefixes and suffixes – those from length 1 to `n-1`. The goal is to output a string of 'P's and 'S's, showing whether each input string is a prefix or suffix of *some* possible `s`.\n\n**Problem Understanding and Strategy:**\n\nThe key is realizing that for each length `k` (from 1 to `n-1`), there's exactly one prefix and one suffix. That's a huge clue!  And the strings are all lowercase letters which is good.  If we know the prefix of length `n-1` (`P_{n-1}`) and the suffix of length `n-1` (`S_{n-1}`), we can *potentially* reconstruct `s`. But there's a constraint: `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}` have to overlap in a consistent way.  Specifically, `P_{n-1}[1:]` must equal `S_{n-1}[:-1]`. This is crucial.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Input:** Read `n` and the `2n-2` input strings. I'll store them in a list, maybe a list of tuples like `(string, original_index)` for later, or just the raw strings to keep it simple.\n2.  **Length-n-1 Candidates:** Filter the input for the two strings of length `n-1`. Those *must* be the key building blocks.  I'll call them `cand1` and `cand2`.\n3.  **Case Analysis:**  We have two possibilities:\n    *   **Case 1:** `cand1` is `P_{n-1}`, `cand2` is `S_{n-1}`.  Check if they overlap correctly: `cand1[1:] == cand2[:-1]`. If so, build `s` as `cand1 + cand2[-1]`. Then, importantly, check if this `s` generates *all* the input strings (prefixes and suffixes, with the right counts) using `check_consistency()`.\n    *   **Case 2:** `cand2` is `P_{n-1}`, `cand1` is `S_{n-1}`.  Do the same overlap check (`cand2[1:] == cand1[:-1]`).  Build `s` as `cand2 + cand1[-1]`, and call `check_consistency()`.\n4.  **Guaranteed Solution:** The problem states there's *always* a solution. So, one of these cases *must* work.  I'll just try Case 1 first, and if it fails, move to Case 2. Since the solution exists, the second case isn't necessary, but it gives an alternative valid solution.\n5.  **`check_consistency()` function:** This is vital. I'll build a function to *verify* if a candidate string `s_candidate` is truly valid. It must generate *exactly* the set of input strings. The function will:\n    *   Generate *all* expected prefixes and suffixes of `s_candidate`.\n    *   Use `collections.Counter()` to count the occurrences of each input string and the occurrences of the prefixes and suffixes.\n    *   Return `True` if the counts match perfectly, `False` otherwise.\n6.  **Construct Output:** Once I have a valid `s`, I can assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string. I'll use `collections.defaultdict(int)` to track how many times each prefix/suffix is *still* needed. Iterate through the *original* input string list in their original order.  If an input string matches a *remaining* prefix, output 'P' (and decrement the prefix count), otherwise, it must match a suffix, so output 'S' (and decrement the suffix count).\n\n**Edge Cases & Concerns:**\n*   `n` is small enough (2 to 100), so string operations won't be a bottleneck.\n*   The `check_consistency()` function is the most crucial part to avoid false positives. I need to make sure to count duplicate input strings properly.\n*   Make sure to handle the order of the original input strings.\n\nThe current strategy is using Case 1 first, then Case 2. If no valid `s` found after these two cases, it's due to a logic error that",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for each of `2n-2` given strings, whether it is a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that the input strings comprise all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s` (i.e., those of lengths `1` to `n-1`), with exactly two strings for each length.\n\nThe core idea to solve this problem is to first reconstruct the original string `s`. Once `s` is known, we can easily identify all its prefixes and suffixes and then match them against the input strings.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Candidate `s`:**\n    *   The most crucial information comes from the two strings of length `n-1`. Let's call them `str1` and `str2`.\n    *   One of these must be the prefix of length `n-1` (`P_{n-1} = s[0...n-2]`), and the other must be the suffix of length `n-1` (`S_{n-1} = s[1...n-1]`).\n    *   There are two possibilities for assigning `str1` and `str2` to `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`:\n        *   **Possibility 1:** `str1` is `P_{n-1}` and `str2` is `S_{n-1}`.\n        *   **Possibility 2:** `str2` is `P_{n-1}` and `str1` is `S_{n-1}`.\n    *   For each possibility, we can form a candidate string `s_candidate`. If `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}` are known, then `s = P_{n-1} + S_{n-1}[-1]` (concatenating the prefix with the last character of the suffix) or `s = P_{n-1}[0] + S_{n-1}` (concatenating the first character of the prefix with the suffix). Both forms should be equivalent.\n    *   A necessary condition for a valid `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}` pair is that their overlapping part must match: `P_{n-1}[1:]` must be equal to `S_{n-1}[:-1]`. This corresponds to `s[1...n-2]`.\n\n2.  **Verify Candidate `s` using `check_consistency`:**\n    *   Once we have a `s_candidate` (e.g., from Possibility 1), we need to verify if it's the correct string `s`.\n    *   We do this by generating all its improper prefixes (`s[0...k-1]` for `k=1...n-1`) and improper suffixes (`s[n-k...n-1]` for `k=1...n-1`).\n    *   We then count the occurrences of each generated string.\n    *   We also count the occurrences of each string in the original input.\n    *   If the counts of all strings (including duplicates) exactly match between the generated set and the input set, then `s_candidate` is a valid `s`.\n    *   Since the problem guarantees a valid `s` exists, at least one of the two possibilities for `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}` will lead to a consistent `s_candidate`. We pick the first one we find.\n\n3.  **Construct the 'P'/'S' Output:**\n    *   After finding the correct `s`, we need to generate the 'P'/'S' string in the order of the original input.\n    *   First, prepare two counters (or dictionaries) for the expected prefixes and suffixes of `s`. For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, add `s[0:k]` to `expected_prefix_counts` and `s[n-k:n]` to `expected_suffix_counts`. Increment their counts to handle duplicates (e.g., 'a' in 'ababa' is both a prefix and a suffix).\n    *   Iterate through the `original_input_strings` (preserving their input order). For each string:\n        *   If it matches an expected prefix and its count in `expected_prefix_counts` is greater than 0, assign 'P' to it and decrement its count.\n        *   Else if it matches an expected suffix and its count in `expected_suffix_counts` is greater than 0, assign 'S' to it and decrement its count.\n        *   Since each string must be either a prefix or a suffix (and exactly two of each length are given), this logic will correctly assign 'P' or 'S' to every input string.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=5, s=\"ababa\"):**\nInput strings: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\n\n1.  **Find strings of length `n-1 = 4`:** `abab` and `baba`.\n    *   Let `cand1 = \"abab\"` and `cand2 = \"baba\"`.\n\n2.  **Possibility 1: `P_{n-1} = \"abab\"`, `S_{n-1} = \"baba\"`**\n    *   Check overlap: `cand1[1:]` (`\"bab\"`) == `cand2[:-1]` (`\"bab\"`). They match!\n    *   Candidate `s = cand1 + cand2[-1]` = `\"abab\" + \"a\"` = `\"ababa\"`.\n    *   `check_consistency(\"ababa\", input_strings, 5)`:\n        *   Generated prefixes: `a, ab, aba, abab`\n        *   Generated suffixes: `a, ba, aba, baba`\n        *   Combined counts: `{'a': 2, 'ab': 1, 'aba': 2, 'abab': 1, 'ba': 1, 'baba': 1}`\n        *   Input counts: `collections.Counter(['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'])` also gives `{'a': 2, 'ab': 1, 'aba': 2, 'abab': 1, 'ba': 1, 'baba': 1}`.\n        *   Counts match!
