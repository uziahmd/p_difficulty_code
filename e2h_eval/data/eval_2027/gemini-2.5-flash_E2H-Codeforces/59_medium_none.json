    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a competitive programming problem. The goal is to count valid arrays of sets, given a specific \"child\" relationship between the sets.  Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the \"child\" relationship.  If set A is a child of set B, any element 'x' in A means 'x+1' must be in B. This immediately tells me that if K (the maximum element) is in A, A can't be a child of any set. Empty sets are a special case; an empty set is a child of any set.\n\nThe problem seems to hinge on this constraint.  I'm trying to figure out how this \"child\" relationship impacts the structure of the valid arrays.  If a set contains K, it must be the last one in the \"child\" chain. If a set contains K-1, the next set must contain K, and so on. This creates a kind of structure where sets are increasingly \"populated\" towards the end of the chain.\n\nThinking about constraints, I realize that the elements within each set are restricted. If an element 'x' is in set S_i, it means x + (N-i) can be no larger than K.  This limits the values an element can have depending on its position within the array.  I define M_i = K - (N-i) to track this boundary.\n\nI try to visualize this: let `S'_1`, `S'_2`, ..., `S'_N` be the rearranged sets in the array.  If a value 'x' is in `S'_i`, then `x+(N-i)` must be at most `K`.  I now focus on elements and where they can possibly be within the sets. I define the sequence `x_{j,i}` as the element `j` is or is not an element of `S_i`.\n\nI'm thinking of building this up, starting from the end of the chain, `S_N` and working backward, because the constraints seem easier to apply in reverse order.  I try to define `f(S)` as the \"child\" set of `S`.\n\nNow, I try to organize my thought process into how each element value can be present across the sets. If `j` is in `S'_i`, it must be the case that `j+1` is in `S'_{i+1}`, `j+2` in `S'_{i+2}`, and so on.\n\nI switch my strategy and introduce bitmasks `b_{j}` for the presence of each value j across the set sequence. I analyze the conditions on these bitmasks. It's a complicated structure to analyze this way, though.\n\nBack to the direct problem, I look at the constraints with an intuitive feeling that the \"child\" structure may lead to a non-increasing sequence.\n\nI realize the problem involves a chain of constraints - the contents of one set limit the possible values of the previous sets.  This reminds me of dynamic programming or grid-based approaches. It seems the state of `S_i` affects `S_{i-1}`, because it must be a \"parent.\"\n\nSo I reformulate this based on a grid `K*N` where rows indicate values 1-K and columns represent sets 1-N. In the grid cells if a value is present or absent from the array, there are propagation rules.\n\nI introduce a condition that if `x` is in `S'_i`, then `x+1` is in `S'_{i+1}`. Using the grid notation, this is equivalent to: If a cell is \"on\" then the next cell must be \"on\", and thus creates non-decreasing lines. I apply the non-decreasing condition to the grid of elements.\n\nI then focus on the main condition, for each set, it must be valid for it to be a child of the next.\n\nI then apply the idea of a diagonal grid with a constant `j-i` diagonal. The values must follow a pattern of non-decreasing bits. The sequence can start with any number of `0` followed by any number of `1`.\n\nI make a crucial observation: The condition on the cells along each diagonal must be `00..011..1`. This means there is only a small set of choices per diagonal. The constraint of `j-i <= K-N` will be applied here. This suggests that the solution is the product of values along each diagonal.\n\nFinally, I remember that the question wants *arrays* and not just sequences of sets.  This adds a layer of complication because order matters. If it was distinct sets, I would divide by factorial, but the sets can be identical. However, the arrays are ordered, not multis",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of arrays `[S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N]` of sets, where each set `S_i` contains integers from `1` to `K`, such that there exists a permutation `[S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N]` of the original array satisfying `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` for `1 \\le i \\le N-1`. A set `A` is a child of `B` if for every `x \\in A`, `x+1 \\in B`.\n\nLet's analyze the child condition:\nIf `x \\in S'_i`, then `x+1 \\in S'_{i+1}`.\nBy induction, if `x \\in S'_i`, then `x+k \\in S'_{i+k}` for `1 \\le k \\le N-i`.\nThis implies that `x+(N-i)` must be an element of `S'_N`. Since all elements are at most `K`, we must have `x+(N-i) \\le K`.\nThus, for any `x \\in S'_i`, we must have `x \\le K-(N-i)`.\nLet `M_i = \\max(0, K-(N-i))`. Then `S'_i` can only contain elements from `\\{1, 2, \\ldots, M_i\\}`. If `M_i=0`, `S'_i` must be empty.\nNote that `M_1 = \\max(0, K-N+1)`, `M_2 = \\max(0, K-N+2)`, ..., `M_N = \\max(0, K) = K`.\nThe sequence `M_1, M_2, \\ldots, M_N` is non-decreasing.\n\nLet `S_j` be the set of allowed values for an element at position `j` in a valid chain.\n`S_j = \\{x \\mid 1 \\le x \\le M_j\\}`.\nSo, any set `S'_j` in a valid chain must be a subset of `S_j`.\n\nThe problem is simplified by realizing that the condition \"there exists a way to rearrange\" means we are counting multisets of sets. If a multiset `{T_1, \\ldots, T_N}` can be arranged into a valid chain `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]`, then any permutation of this multiset, `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]`, is counted as a valid array.\nThe number of arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` is `N!` times the number of distinct multisets `{S_1, \\ldots, S_N}` which can be ordered into a valid chain, divided by `\\prod k_i!` for each multiset where `k_i` is the count of identical sets. This is hard to compute.\n\nA common interpretation in competitive programming for \"there exists a permutation\" when combined with \"number of different arrays\" (which implies ordered arrays) is that we need to count the number of ordered arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` such that *the multiset* `{S_1, \\ldots, S_N}` can form a valid chain.\nThis is equivalent to saying: find the number of sequences `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` such that `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` for all `i`. Let this count be `C`.\nThen, for each such sequence `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]`, we take its multiset `{S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N}`. Any permutation of this multiset is a valid array. If all `S'_i` are distinct, this gives `N!` arrays. If there are `k_1` copies of `T_1`, `k_2` copies of `T_2`, etc., then it gives `N! / (k_1! k_2! \\ldots)` arrays.\nSumming `N! / (k_1! k_2! \\ldots)` over all distinct multisets is the total number of arrays.\nThis is exactly the coefficient of `x^N/N!` in the exponential generating function `\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (\\text{count of distinct sets } T \\text{ that can appear in a chain}) \\frac{x^k}{k!}`. This is `N!` times the number of multisets.\nThis is equivalent to counting ordered sequences `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` where `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}`.\nLet's verify with the example `N=2, K=2`. The example output is `11`.\nOur method for counting valid chains: `S'_1 \\subseteq \\{1\\}` and `S'_2 \\subseteq \\{1,2\\}`.\nIf `1 \\in S'_1`, then `2 \\in S'_2`.\nIf `S'_1 = {}`: `S'_2` can be `{}`, `{1}`, `{2}`, `{1,2}`. (4 choices)\nIf `S'_1 = {1}`: `S'_2` must contain `2`. So `S'_2` can be `{2}`, `{1,2}`. (2 choices)\nTotal `4+2=6` valid chains `[S'_1, S'_2]`. These are:\n`({}, {})`, `({}, {1})`, `({}, {2})`, `({}, {1,2})`, `({1}, {2})`, `({1}, {1,2})`.\nThe problem asks for ordered arrays `[S_1, S_2]`.\nFor `({}, {})`: `[{}, {}]` is 1 array.\nFor `({}, {1})`: `[{}, {1}]`, `[{1}, {}]` are 2 arrays.\nFor `({}, {2})`: `[{}, {2}]`, `[{2}, {}]` are 2 arrays.\nFor `({}, {1,2})`: `[{}, {1,2}]`, `[{1,2}, {}]` are 2 arrays.\nFor `({1}, {2})`: `[{1}, {2}]`, `[{2}, {1}]` are 2 arrays.\nFor `({1}, {1,2})`: `[{1}, {1,2}]`, `[{1,2}, {1}]` are 2 arrays.\nTotal: `1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11`. This matches the example output.\nSo, the task is to count the number of ordered sequences `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` such that `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` for all `i`.\n\nLet's define `x_{j,i} = 1` if `j \\in S'_i` and `0` otherwise.\nThe conditions are:\n1.  `x_{j,i}=1 \\implies j \\le K-(N-i)`.\n2.  `x_{j,i}=1 \\implies x_{j+1, i+1}=1` (for `j<K, i<N`).\n\nCondition 2 implies that if `x_{j,i}=1`, then all cells `(j+k, i+k)` for `k \\ge 0` (within bounds `j+k \\le K, i+k \\le N`) must also be `1`.\nThis means that for a fixed \"diagonal\" `d = j-i`, the sequence of values `x_{j,i}` along this diagonal must be non-decreasing: `x_{j,i} \\le x_{j+1, i+1}`.\nA non-decreasing binary sequence `b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_L` must be of the form `0, \\ldots, 0, 1, \\ldots, 1`. There are `L+2` such sequences (including all zeros and all ones).\n\nLet's analyze the diagonals `d = j-i`. The range of `d` is `1-N` to `K-1`.\nFor each `d`, we consider the cells `(j,i)` such that `j-i=d`.\nThe first cell on such a diagonal is `(\\max(1, 1+d), \\max(1, 1-d))`.\nThe last cell on such a diagonal is `(\\min(K, N+d), \\min(N, K-d))`.\nLet `len_d` be the number of cells on diagonal `d`.\nThe condition `j \\le K-(N-i)` can be rewritten as `j-i \\le K-N`.\nSo, for any `(j,i)` on a diagonal `d` where `d > K-N`, `x_{j,i}` must be `0`.\nIf `d > K-N`, there is only `1` choice for that diagonal (all zeros).\nIf `d \\le K-N`, then all cells `(j,i)` on this diagonal satisfy `j-i \\le K-N`. So they are allowed to be `1`.\nFor such a diagonal, the sequence `x_{j,i}` must be non-decreasing. There are `len_d + 1` choices for such a sequence (where `len_d` is the number of cells on the diagonal, so `len_d+1` means `0` to `len_d` ones).\n\nThe total number of valid sequences `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` is the product of the number of choices for each diagonal.\n`Total = \\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-1} (\\text{choices for diagonal } d)`\n\nLet's calculate `len_d`:\nThe `j` values on diagonal `d` are `1+d, 2+d, \\ldots, K`.\nThe `i` values on diagonal `d` are `1, 2, \\ldots, N`.\nSo `j` ranges from `\\max(1, 1+d)` to `\\min(K, N+d)`.\nThe number of cells is `\\min(K, N+d) - \\max(1, 1+d) + 1`.\nThis can be simplified: `len_d = (\\min(K-d, N) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1)`.\nLet `first_i = \\max(1, 1-d)` and `last_i = \\min(N, K-d)`.\nThen `len_d = last_i - first_i + 1`.\nThe number of choices for diagonal `d` is `len_d + 1` if `d \\le K-N`, and `1` if `d > K-N`.\n\nThe overall range for `d` is `[1-N, K-1]`.\nThe range for `d` where `d \\le K-N` is `[1-N, K-N]`.\nSo we need to calculate `\\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-N} (len_d+1) \\pmod{998244353}`.\n\nLet's analyze `len_d` more carefully:\n`len_d = \\min(K, N+d) - \\max(1, 1+d) + 1`.\nThis can be split into cases:\n1.  `d < 1-N`: This range is empty if `1-N \\ge 1-N`.\n2.  `1-N \\le d < 1`: `max(1,1+d)=1`. `min(K, N+d) = N+d` (since `N+d < N+1 \\le K` for `d<1` if `K \\ge N+1`).\n    No, this is not good. Let's use `first_i, last_i`.\n    `first_i = \\max(1, 1-d)`. `last_i = \\min(N, K-d)`.\n    If `d \\le 0`: `first_i = 1`.\n    If `d > 0`: `first_i = 1-d` is wrong. `first_i = 1`.\n    If `d < 1`: `1-d > 1`. So `first_i = 1-d` is correct.\n    `first_i = 1-d` for `d \\le 0`.\n    `first_i = 1` for `d > 0`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `len_d`. A diagonal `d = j-i` has points `(j,i)` where `1 \\le j \\le K` and `1 \\le i \\le N`.\nThis means `1 \\le i \\le N` and `1 \\le i+d \\le K`.\nSo `\\max(1, 1-d) \\le i \\le \\min(N, K-d)`.\n`len_d = \\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1`.\n\nThe product is `P = \\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-N} (\\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 2) \\pmod{998244353}`.\nLet `MOD = 998244353`.\nThe loop runs for `d` from `1-N` to `K-N`.\nThe number of terms in the product is `(K-N) - (1-N) + 1 = K-1`.\nThis is fine for `K-1` up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\n\nExample `N=2, K=2`:\n`d` from `1-2=-1` to `2-2=0`.\n`d=-1`: `len_{-1} = \\min(2, 2-(-1)) - \\max(1, 1-(-1)) + 1 = \\min(2,3) - \\max(1,2) + 1 = 2-2+1=1`.\nChoices for `d=-1`: `len_{-1}+1 = 1+1 = 2`.\n`d=0`: `len_0 = \\min(2, 2-0) - \\max(1, 1-0) + 1 = \\min(2,2) - \\max(1,1) + 1 = 2-1+1=2`.\nChoices for `d=0`: `len_0+1 = 2+1 = 3`.\nTotal `2 * 3 = 6`. This matches the count of valid chains.\n\nThe implementation will loop `d` from `1-N` to `K-N`.\nFor each `d`, calculate `first_i = max(1, 1-d)` and `last_i = min(N, K-d)`.\n`len_d = last_i - first_i + 1`.\nThe result is `(len_d + 1)`. Multiply these terms.\n\nConsider `N=1, K=3`:\n`d` from `1-1=0` to `3-1=2`.\n`d=0`: `len_0 = \\min(1, 3-0) - \\max(1, 1-0) + 1 = \\min(1,3) - \\max(1,1) + 1 = 1-1+1=1`. Choices: `1+1=2`.\n`d=1`: `len_1 = \\min(1, 3-1) - \\max(1, 1-1) + 1 = \\min(1,2) - \\max(1,0) + 1 = 1-1+1=1`. Choices: `1+1=2`.\n`d=2`: `len_2 = \\min(1, 3-2) - \\max(1, 1-2) + 1 = \\min(1,1) - \\max(1,-1) + 1 = 1-1+1=1`. Choices: `1+1=2`.\nTotal `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.\nFor `N=1`, any set `S_1` is valid. There are `2^K` choices. `2^3=8`. Matches.\n\nConsider `N=3, K=1`:\n`d` from `1-3=-2` to `1-3=-2`. Only `d=-2`.\n`d=-2`: `len_{-2} = \\min(3, 1-(-2)) - \\max(1, 1-(-2)) + 1 = \\min(3,3) - \\max(1,3) + 1 = 3-3+1=1`. Choices: `1+1=2`.\nTotal `2`.\nLet's verify: `S'_1 \\subseteq \\max(0, 1-3+1) = \\max(0,-1) = {}`. So `S'_1={}`.\n`S'_2 \\subseteq \\max(0, 1-3+2) = \\max(0,0) = {}`. So `S'_2={}`.\n`S'_3 \\subseteq \\max(0, 1-3+3) = \\max(0,1) = \\{1\\}`.\nThe only possible chain is `[{}, {}, {}]`. This is 1 chain.\nMy formula gives 2. What's wrong?\nThe issue is `len_d + 1` counts sequences like `00, 01, 11` for length 2.\nHere length 1, so `0, 1`.\nThe `j \\le K-(N-i)` condition also needs to be applied to the `1`s.\nIf `x_{j,i}=1`, then `j+(N-i) \\le K`.\nThis means `j-i \\le K-N`.\nSo if `d=j-i > K-N`, then `x_{j,i}` must be `0`.\nThis is exactly what I did.\n\nLet's trace `N=3, K=1` carefully again.\n`S'_1 \\subseteq \\{\\max(0, 1-3+1)\\} = \\{\\max(0,-1)\\} = \\{\\}`. So `S'_1 = {}`.\n`S'_2 \\subseteq \\{\\max(0, 1-3+2)\\} = \\{\\max(0,0)\\} = \\{\\}`. So `S'_2 = {}`.\n`S'_3 \\subseteq \\{\\max(0, 1-3+3)\\} = \\{\\max(0,1)\\} = \\{1\\}`. So `S'_3` can be `{}` or `{1}`.\nChain condition: `S'_i` is child of `S'_{i+1}`.\n`S'_1` is child of `S'_2`: `{}` is child of `{}`. True.\n`S'_2` is child of `S'_3`: `{}` is child of `S'_3`. True, for `S'_3={}` or `S'_3={1}`.\nSo valid chains are `[{},{},{}]` and `[{},{},{1}]`. There are 2 such chains.\nMy formula output `2`. This matches. The example output is `4`.\nWhy does the example output `4` for `N=3, K=1`?\nExample input: `3 1` output `4`.\nMy interpretation: `[S_1, S_2, S_3]` such that `{S_1, S_2, S_3}` can be permuted to `[S'_1, S'_2, S'_3]` with `S'_i` child of `S'_{i+1}`.\nValid multisets are `{ {}, {}, {} }` and `{ {}, {}, {1} }`.\nFor `{ {}, {}, {} }`: The only array is `[{}, {}, {}]`. (1 array)\nFor `{ {}, {}, {1} }`: Permutations are `[{}, {}, {1}]`, `[{}, {1}, {}]`, `[{1}, {}, {}]`. (3 arrays)\nTotal `1+3 = 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nSo the logic is correct.\n\nFinal check on constraints: `N, K <= 2 * 10^5`.\nThe loop runs `K-1` times. Each iteration involves `max`, `min`, arithmetic operations. This is `O(K)` time complexity.\n`2 * 10^5` iterations is fine.\nModulo arithmetic `998244353`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    # If K < N, then K - N + i can be negative for many i.\n    # Specifically, M_1 = K - N + 1.
