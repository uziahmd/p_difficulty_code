The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Let's tackle this competitive programming problem!**  I'm given a scenario with towns, towers, and signal powers, and the goal is to calculate a probability modulo 998244353. The task is to figure out the number of valid ways to set up the towers to cover all towns, and then divide by the total number of possible tower configurations.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the conditions. We have towns 0 to n+1, with towers potentially built at towns 1 to n. A tower's power determines its reach.  Each town (except 0 and n+1) must be covered by *exactly one* tower.  I need to ensure no signal reaches towns 0 and n+1.\n\nInitial thoughts are around partitioning the town range and building towers on the partitioning ranges' centers to meet the reach conditions. The central idea is to see that the given problem defines a partition of the $1$ to $n$ towns into disjoint ranges, where each range is of odd length, centered on one of the towers. But, is the partition directly related to choosing the tower set $S$?\n\nThe critical constraint is that each town from $1$ to $n$ gets a signal from only one tower. This suggests that the regions covered by the towers must not overlap. I also need to make sure the power of each tower is valid given this condition.\n\nTo simplify, I need to find the number of valid sets of towers. Let $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built, and the power $p_i$ of each tower at $i$ is between 1 and $\\min(i, n+1-i)$ to satisfy the range constraints. I'm thinking of building a dynamic programming (DP) or recursion to count valid tower setups that meet the conditions. A Fibonacci-like pattern emerges when I try some test cases, so I might be onto something.\n\nMy initial interpretation was incorrect regarding the intervals and partitioning the problem. My thought process leads to this important re-framing: the valid sets of towers are in a one-to-one correspondence with ways to partition $1$ to $n$ into intervals $[L_k, R_k]$ where $L_k$ and $R_k$ have the same parity, the center $(L_k+R_k)/2$ is a tower, and we need to choose powers.  I can express all partitions into valid segment ranges and choose a set $S$. A valid partition *defines* the tower locations.  This means that the *only* towers built are at centers of a given partition, otherwise towns won't be covered properly. Now, the problem requires me to find the number of ways to pick $S$, not the number of powers.\n\nThe key insight is that for a given town, there is a fixed number of valid powers we can assign given that $1 \\le p \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This implies each set $S$ is either valid with one possible power for each tower, or it is invalid. So, I will proceed to find the possible $S$, which now leads to a neat DP formulation.\n\nI need to use dynamic programming to figure out the number of valid set $S$, as I build valid partitions starting from 1 up to n.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the probability that, for a given $n$, we can choose signal powers for towers (built with probability $1/2$ in towns $1, \\dots, n$) such that two conditions are met:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ each receive a signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose an integer signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nA tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means it covers the interval of towns $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n\n**Constraint 1: Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.**\nFor any tower $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$:\n- Town $0$ not covered: $|0 - i| \\ge p_i \\implies i \\ge p_i$.\n- Town $n+1$ not covered: $|(n+1) - i| \\ge p_i \\implies n+1-i \\ge p_i$.\nCombining these, $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nAlso, $p_i \\ge 1$.\nThese constraints imply that any town $c$ covered by a tower $i$ with power $p_i$ will satisfy $1 \\le c \\le n$. Specifically, $i-p_i+1 \\ge i-(i-1) = 1$ and $i+p_i-1 \\le i+(n+1-i-1) = n$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one tower each.**\nThis means the intervals covered by the chosen towers must form a partition of the set of towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet $[L, R]$ be an interval covered by a tower at $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$.\nThen $L = i-p_i+1$ and $R = i+p_i-1$.\nFrom these equations, we can derive $i$ and $p_i$:\n$R-L+1 = (i+p_i-1) - (i-p_i+1) + 1 = 2p_i-1$.\nSo, $p_i = (R-L+2)/2$.\nAlso, $i = L+p_i-1 = L + (R-L+2)/2 - 1 = (2L+R-L+2-2)/2 = (L+R)/2$.\n\nFor $p_i$ to be an integer, $R-L+2$ must be even, which means $R-L$ must be even. This implies $L$ and $R$ must have the same parity.\nFor $i$ to be an integer, $L+R$ must be even, which also means $L$ and $R$ must have the same parity.\nSo, a segment $[L,R]$ can be covered by a single tower if and only if $L$ and $R$ have the same parity. If they do, the tower must be at $i=(L+R)/2$ and have power $p=(R-L+2)/2$.\n\nThe conditions for a valid configuration are:\n1. There exists a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into disjoint segments $[L_k, R_k]$.\n2. For each segment $[L_k, R_k]$, $L_k$ and $R_k$ must have the same parity.\n3. For each segment $[L_k, R_k]$, a tower must be built at $i_k = (L_k+R_k)/2$.\n4. Crucially, if a tower is built at town $j \\in S$, and $j$ is not one of the $i_k$ centers for any segment in the partition, then this tower $j$ would cover town $j$ (since $p_j \\ge 1$), violating the \"exactly one tower\" constraint. Therefore, the set of built towers $S$ must be exactly the set of centers $I = \\{i_k \\mid [L_k, R_k] \\text{ is a segment in the partition}\\}$.\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of sets $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that $S$ is the set of centers $I(P)$ for some valid partition $P$ of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet $N_n$ be this count. The probability will be $N_n / 2^n$.\n\nLet's list $N_n$ for small $n$:\n- **$n=1$**: Only partition is $\\{[1,1]\\}$. $L=1, R=1$ (same parity). Center $i=(1+1)/2=1$. So $S=\\{1\\}$. $N_1=1$.\n- **$n=2$**:\n    - Partition $\\{[1,1], [2,2]\\}$. Centers $i_1=1, i_2=2$. So $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\n    - No other partitions where $L,R$ have same parity. ($[1,2]$ has $L,R$ different parity).\n    So $N_2=1$.\n- **$n=3$**:\n    - Partition $\\{[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]\\}$. Centers $i_1=1, i_2=2, i_3=3$. So $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n    - Partition $\\{[1,3]\\}$. $L=1, R=3$ (same parity). Center $i=(1+3)/2=2$. So $S=\\{2\\}$.\n    - No other partitions. $([1,1],[2,3])$ not valid for $[2,3]$ because $L=2, R=3$ different parity.\n    So $N_3=2$. (Sets $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\{2\\}$)\n- **$n=4$**:\n    - Partition $\\{[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4]\\}$. Centers $S_1=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n    - Partition $\\{[1,1], [2,4]\\}$. Centers $i_1=1, i_2=(2+4)/2=3$. So $S_2=\\{1,3\\}$.\n    - Partition $\\{[1,3], [4,4]\\}$. Centers $i_1=(1+3)/2=2, i_2=4$. So $S_3=\\{2,4\\}$.\n    - No other partitions. $([1,2],[3,4])$ not valid. $([1,4])$ not valid.\n    So $N_4=3$. (Sets $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{2,4\\}$)\n- **$n=5$**:\n    - Partition $\\{[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4], [5,5]\\}$. $S_1=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n    - Partition $\\{[1,1], [2,2], [3,5]\\}$. Centers $S_2=\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n    - Partition $\\{[1,1], [2,4], [5,5]\\}$. Centers $S_3=\\{1,3,5\\}$.\n    - Partition $\\{[1,3], [4,4], [5,5]\\}$. Centers $S_4=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n    - Partition $\\{[1,3], [3,5]\\}$ is not a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, 5\\}$ (town 3 covered twice).\n    - Partition $\\{[1,5]\\}$. Center $i=(1+5)/2=3$. $S_5=\\{3\\}$.\n    So $N_5=5$. (Sets $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, $\\{1,2,4\\}$, $\\{1,3,5\\}$, $\\{2,4,5\\}$, $\\{3\\}$)\n\nThe sequence $N_n$ is $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$. This is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically $F_{n+1}$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nLet's prove this by induction. Let $f(k)$ be the number of distinct sets $S$ for $n=k$.\nFor $n$, consider the last segment $[L, n]$. $L$ and $n$ must have the same parity.\n1. If $L=n$: The last segment is $[n,n]$. The center is $n$. The remaining towns $\\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ must be partitioned. The set of centers for $\\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ must be a valid set $S'$ for $n-1$. The total set of centers is $S' \\cup \\{n\\}$. The number of such sets is $f(n-1)$.\n2. If $L=n-2$: The last segment is $[n-2,n]$. The center is $n-1$. The remaining towns $\\{1, \\dots, n-3\\}$ must be partitioned. The set of centers for $\\{1, \\dots, n-3\\}$ must be a valid set $S''$ for $n-3$. The total set of centers is $S'' \\cup \\{n-1\\}$. The number of such sets is $f(n-3)$.\n3. If $L=n-4$: The last segment is $[n-4,n]$. The center is $n-2$. The remaining towns $\\{1, \\dots, n-5\\}$ must be partitioned. The set of centers for $\\{1, \\dots, n-5\\}$ must be a valid set $S'''$ for $n-5$. The total set of centers is $S''' \\cup \\{n-2\\}$. The number of such sets is $f(n-5)$.\nAnd so on.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the sets of centers generated by these choices are distinct.\nConsider $S_A = S' \\cup \\{n\\}$ for a partition of $n-1$ ending with $[n-1, n-1]$.\nConsider $S_B = S'' \\cup \\{n-1\\}$ for a partition of $n-3$ ending with $[n-3, n-3]$.\nIt is possible that $S_A=S_B$.\nExample $n=5$:\n$f(5)$ comes from:\n- $L=5$: segment $[5,5]$, center $5$. Remaining $f(4)$ sets for $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n  $S_A \\cup \\{5\\}$ where $S_A \\in \\{\\{1,2,3,4\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,4\\}\\}$.\n  Sets are: $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}$.\n- $L=3$: segment $[3,5]$, center $4$. Remaining $f(2)$ sets for $\\{1,2\\}$.\n  $S_B \\cup \\{4\\}$ where $S_B \\in \\{\\{1,2\\}\\}$.\n  Set is: $\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n- $L=1$: segment $[1,5]$, center $3$. Remaining $f(0)$ sets for $\\emptyset$. (Base case $f(0)=1$ for empty set $S=\\emptyset$).\n  $S_C \\cup \\{3\\}$ where $S_C \\in \\{\\emptyset\\}$.\n  Set is: $\\{3\\}$.\nThe sets are all distinct: $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, $\\{1,3,5\\}$, $\\{2,4,5\\}$, $\\{1,2,4\\}$, $\\{3\\}$. Total $3+1+1=5$.\nThis confirms $f(n) = F_{n+1}$.\nThe key is that the center $i_k = (L_k+R_k)/2$ is always greater than $(L_{k-1}+R_{k-1})/2$ for the previous segment.\nThe largest center for a partition ending with $[n,n]$ is $n$.\nThe largest center for a partition ending with $[n-2,n]$ is $n-1$.\nThe largest center for a partition ending with $[n-4,n]$ is $n-2$.\nSince these maximum centers are all distinct, the sets generated are distinct.\nThus, $N_n = F_{n+1}$.\n\nWe need to calculate $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThe modulus $M = 998244353$ is a prime number.\nWe can compute $F_{n+1}$ using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nThe Fibonacci recurrence is $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} \\\\ F_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe need $F_{n+1}$.\n\nThe inverse of $2^n$ modulo $M$ is $(2^n)^{M-2} \\pmod M$ by Fermat's Little Theorem.\nThis is $2^{-n} \\pmod M$.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n- Matrix multiplication function.\n- Matrix exponentiation function (binary exponentiation).\n- Modular inverse function (using `pow(base, M-2, M)`).\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef mat_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef mat_pow(A, n):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    A_copy = A\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mult(res, A_copy)\n        A_copy = mat_mult(A_copy, A_copy)\n        n //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0: # Base case not covered by F_n+1, but n >= 1\n        print(0) # Or handle as F_1 = 1, 2^0 = 1, so 1/1 = 1.\n        return\n\n    # Calculate F_{n+1}\n    # F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, ...\n    # We need F_{n+1}.\n    # The matrix power (M^k) is for F_k and F_{k-1}\n    # For F_{n+1}, we need M^n\n    # [[F_{k+1}], [F_k]] = M^k * [[F_1], [F_0]]\n    # So [[F_{n+1}], [F_n]] = M^n * [[1], [0]]\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        fib_n_plus_1 = 1 # F_2\n    else:\n        T = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n        T_pow_n = mat_pow(T, n)\n        # T_pow_n is [[F_{n+1}, F_n], [F_n, F_{n-1}]]\n        fib_n_plus_1 = T_pow_n[0][0]\n\n    # Calculate (2^n)^-1 mod MOD\n    inv_2_pow_n = pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n    # Result is (F_{n+1} * (2^n)^-1) % MOD\n    ans = (fib_n_plus_1 * inv_2_pow_n) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
