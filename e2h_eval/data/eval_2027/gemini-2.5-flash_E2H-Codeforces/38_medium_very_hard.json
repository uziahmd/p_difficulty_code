    "thought": "**Here's my thought process on tackling this competitive programming problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to solve this graph theory problem. I need to figure out the minimum number of nodes (`n`) and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in a directed graph that satisfies certain reachability conditions. Let's break down the definitions first. We have something called a *p*-reachable graph, and it involves pairs of nodes `(u, v)` where `u` is less than `v`, and they can reach each other in both directions.  I also need to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs, which are pairs of nodes where you can go from `u` to `v` but not the other way around.\n\nMy first thought is to understand the core concept of strongly connected components (SCCs). If two nodes are reachable from each other, they belong to the same SCC. This seems fundamental to the problem. The *p*-reachable condition directly translates to having exactly `p` pairs of nodes within SCCs, where `u < v`.\n\nIf I have an SCC of size `k`, there are `k * (k - 1) / 2` such pairs.  This is a key insight. To minimize `n`, I want to create as large SCCs as possible because the function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically, so bigger SCCs are more efficient. I need to find the largest SCC size I can use and repeat this process until I have covered the target `p` reachable pairs. To determine the size of the biggest possible SCCs, a greedy approach seems natural: I'll iteratively find the largest `k` where `k * (k - 1) / 2` is still less than or equal to `p`, then subtract that amount from p and repeat. This should minimize the total number of nodes.\n\nThe next challenge is maximizing the unidirectional pairs. Intuitively, I need a structure that allows paths in one direction but not the reverse. The best way seems to be to arrange SCCs in a chain in the condensation graph. It also looks like I can construct a 'line' with SCCs. In other words,  `S1 -> S2 -> S3` is efficient, in terms of maximizing the unidirectional pairs. If I arrange the SCCs in a chain, then the unidirectional pairs become the product of the sizes of the two SCCs.\n\nI will end up with a formula: Total Unidirectional pairs equals `(N^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.  This is because `sum_{i<j} k_i*k_j = (N^2 - sum(k_i^2))/2`.\nMy algorithm will have two parts: 1) use greedy strategy to minimize `n` (the number of total nodes); 2) use my formula `(N^2 - sum(k_i^2))/2` with the SCC sizes that I got from the first step to get the answer.\n\nI need to make sure the edge cases work.  For instance, when `p=0`, my greedy algorithm from the minimization step should return `n = 0`.  But what about unidirectional pairs? The algorithm should handle those cases, too. Also, the time complexity is critical. It looks like it could be `O(p)` or close.\n\nNow, let's look at the implementation. I'll need an efficient way to find the largest `k` that satisfies `k(k-1)/2 <= current_p`. I can use a binary search or calculate it with a formula `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2)` in O(1) time complexity.  I should also test some examples and check that the intermediate values are correct. I can work out a test case like `p = 4`. The example code looks correct to me. I need to carefully implement the formulas and edge cases. With this approach, I think I've got a solution that is both correct and efficient.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with `n` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's break down the definitions:\n\n*   **Reachable from each other**: Two nodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if there is a path from `u` to `v` and a path from `v` to `u`. This means `u` and `v` belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n*   **`p`-reachable graph**: A directed graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n*   **Unidirectional pair**: An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u \\neq v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n\n### Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`\n\nIf `u` and `v` are in the same SCC of size `k`, then all `k` nodes are reachable from each other. The number of unordered pairs `{u, v}` (or ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v`) within an SCC of size `k` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`. Let's denote this function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\nIf a graph has multiple SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, the total number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` that are reachable from each other is `sum(f(k_i))` for all `i`. This is because nodes from different SCCs cannot be mutually reachable. The total number of nodes `n` is `sum(k_i)`.\n\nTo minimize `n` for a given `p`, we need to find a set of `k_i` values such that `sum(f(k_i)) = p` and `sum(k_i)` is minimized. The function `f(k)` grows quadratically. To achieve a target sum `p` with the minimum total number of nodes, we should use SCCs that are as large as possible. This is a greedy approach:\n\n1.  Initialize `current_p = p` and `total_nodes = 0`.\n2.  Maintain a list `scc_sizes` to store the sizes of SCCs.\n3.  While `current_p > 0`:\n    a.  Find the largest integer `k` such that `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p`.\n        This `k` can be found efficiently using the quadratic formula: `k^2 - k - 2 * current_p <= 0`. The positive root of `x^2 - x - 2 * current_p = 0` is `(1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2`. So, `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2)`. We must handle potential off-by-one errors due to floating-point precision: if `f(k)` calculated this way is greater than `current_p`, decrement `k`.\n    b.  Add `k` to `total_nodes`.\n    c.  Add `k` to `scc_sizes`.\n    d.  Subtract `f(k)` from `current_p`.\n4.  The minimum number of nodes `n` is `total_nodes`.\n\n**Special case for `p=0`**:\nIf `p=0`, the problem example output is `0 0`. This implies that a graph with `n=0` nodes is allowed and is the minimum for `p=0`. An empty graph has no pairs, so `p=0` and 0 unidirectional pairs. Our greedy algorithm would produce `n=0` for `p=0` if we initialize `total_nodes = 0` and the loop condition `current_p > 0` is immediately false.\n\n### Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs\n\nLet `n` be the minimum number of nodes found in Part 1, and `scc_sizes = [k_1, k_2, ..., k_m]` be the list of SCC sizes determined by the greedy algorithm.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we need to maximize paths between different SCCs in one direction only. This is achieved by arranging the SCCs in a linear chain in the condensation graph (the DAG of SCCs). For example, we can add edges such that `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m`, where `S_i` is an SCC of size `k_i`.\n\nWith this arrangement:\n*   Any node `u` in `S_i` can reach any node `v` in `S_j` if `i <= j`.\n*   If `i < j`, `u` can reach `v`, but `v` cannot reach `u` (as there is no path back from `S_j` to `S_i`).\n*   The number of unidirectional pairs `(u, v)` where `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` (with `i < j`) is `k_i * k_j`.\n\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j)`.\nThis sum can be computed more efficiently. We know that `(sum k_i)^2 = sum k_i^2 + 2 * sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`.\nSince `sum k_i = n` (the total number of nodes), we have:\n`sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j) = (n^2 - sum_{i=1 to m} k_i^2) / 2`.\n\nSo, the algorithm for the second part is:\n1.  Calculate `n` and the list `scc_sizes` using the greedy algorithm from Part 1.\n2.  Calculate `sum_k_i_sq = sum(k^2 for k in scc_sizes)`.\n3.  The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(n^2 - sum_k_i_sq) // 2`.\n\n### Example Walkthroughs\n\n**`p = 3`**:\n1.  `current_p = 3`, `total_nodes = 0`, `scc_sizes = []`.\n2.  `current_p = 3 > 0`:\n    a.  `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*3)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(25)) / 2) = floor((1 + 5) / 2) = 3`.\n    b.  `f(3) = 3 * 2 / 2 = 3`. This is not greater than `current_p`. So `k=3`.\n    c.  `total_nodes = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n    d.  `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n    e.  `current_p = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n3.  `current_p = 0`. Loop terminates.\n    Minimum nodes `n = 3`. SCC sizes `[3]`.\n    Max unidirectional pairs: `(3^2 - (3^2)) // 2 = (9 - 9) // 2 = 0`.\n    Output: `3 0`.\n\n**`p = 4`**:\n1.  `current_p = 4`, `total_nodes = 0`, `scc_sizes = []`.\n2.  `current_p = 4 > 0`:\n    a.  `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*4)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(33)) / 2) = floor((1 + 5.74...) / 2) = floor(3.37...) = 3`.\n    b.  `f(3) = 3`. This is not greater than `current_p`. So `k=3`.\n    c.  `total_nodes = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n    d.  `scc_sizes = [3]`.\n    e.  `current_p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3.  `current_p = 1 > 0`:\n    a.  `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*1)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(9)) / 2) = floor((1 + 3) / 2) = 2`.\n    b.  `f(2) = 1`. This is not greater than `current_p`. So `k=2`.\n    c.  `total_nodes = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n    d.  `scc_sizes = [3, 2]`.\n    e.  `current_p = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n4.  `current_p = 0`. Loop terminates.\n    Minimum nodes `n = 5`. SCC sizes `[3, 2]`.\n    Max unidirectional pairs: `(5^2 - (3^2 + 2^2)) // 2 = (25 - (9 + 4)) // 2 = (25 - 13) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.\n    Output: `5 6`.\n\n### Final check on `k` calculation\n\nThe formula `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2)` gives the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p`.\nThis is because `f(x) = x(x-1)/2` is an increasing function for `x >= 1`.\nThe solution `x = (1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2` is the exact value for which `f(x) = current_p`.\nSo, `floor(x)` gives the largest integer `k` such that `f(k) <= current_p`.\nNo need for a `k-1` check or iteration. Just calculate `k` this way.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    total_nodes = 0\n    scc_sizes = []\n    current_p = p\n\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p\n        # k^2 - k - 2 * current_p <= 0\n        # Roots of k^2 - k - 2 * current_p = 0 are (1 +/- sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2\n        # We need the largest integer k such that k <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2\n        \n        # Using math.isqrt for integer square root to avoid floating point issues.\n        # 1 + 8 * current_p can be up to 1 + 8 * 2e5 = 1.6e6. isqrt handles this.\n        discriminant_sqrt = math.isqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)\n        \n        # Calculate k_candidate based on the positive root\n        k_candidate = (1 + discriminant_sqrt) // 2\n        \n        # k_candidate might be slightly off due to integer square root or just being the boundary.\n        # Check k_candidate and k_candidate - 1.\n        # We want the largest k such that k*(k-1)/2 <= current_p.\n        # If k_candidate * (k_candidate - 1) / 2 > current_p, then k_candidate is too large.\n        # This can happen if 1 + 8 * current_p is not a perfect square, and (1 + sqrt(...))/2 is just under an integer.\n        # Example: current_p = 4. 1+8*4 = 33. sqrt(33) approx 5.74.
