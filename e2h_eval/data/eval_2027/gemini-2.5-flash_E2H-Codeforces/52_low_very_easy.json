Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**A Simulation Approach to the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and it's pretty clear this is going to be a simulation. My objective is to write a Python script that calculates the maximum total hours Vasily can keep his room lit, given a certain number of initial candles (`a`) and a \"recycling\" factor (`b`).\n\nThe core idea is to iteratively simulate the lighting and recycling process.  I need to keep track of a few key variables: the `total_hours` the room is lit, the `current_new_candles` Vasily has ready to burn, and the accumulated `burned_out_candles`.\n\nThe simulation steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Light Up:** I'll start by lighting all the `current_new_candles`. The `total_hours` increase by the number of candles I lit.\n2.  **Burn Out:** These candles become `burned_out_candles`.\n3.  **Recycle:**  I then check if I can make new candles from the `burned_out_candles`.  Integer division (`//`) will be crucial here to determine how many new candles I can make. The used burned-out candles are subtracted from the total, and the new candles are added to the available new candles.\n4.  **Repeat:** I repeat this process, lighting the `current_new_candles`, accumulating burned-out candles, recycling, and adding the total hours, until I no longer have any `current_new_candles` and I can't generate any new ones from the remaining burned-out candles.\n\nInitially, `total_hours` is 0, `current_new_candles` is equal to the given initial candles `a`, and `burned_out_candles` starts at 0. The loop continues as long as `current_new_candles` is greater than 0.\n\nLooking at the example with `a = 4` and `b = 2`, I can walk through the steps to make sure I understand it. In the first round, I light 4 candles adding 4 hours to the total. I then get 4 burned out candles. I recycle these to get 2 new candles. That is one full cycle. I repeat this process until there are no more usable candles. I am confident this simulation strategy will give me the correct result.\n",
