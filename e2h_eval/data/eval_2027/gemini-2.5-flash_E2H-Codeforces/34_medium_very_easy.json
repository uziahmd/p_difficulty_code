And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Sliding Window Average Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need to calculate the average sleep time over consecutive \"weeks\" defined by a sliding window of size `k` within a sleep record array `a` of length `n`. Essentially, we'll iterate through all possible windows, compute the sum of sleep times within each window, and finally average those sums.\n\nMy thought process is this: First, I read in the values of `n`, `k`, and the sleep array `a`.  A naive approach would be to iterate through all possible starting positions of the window and, for each window, compute the sum of its elements. That's `n - k + 1` windows, and calculating the sum for each takes `O(k)` time, leading to an overall `O(n*k)` or even potentially `O(n^2)` time complexity, which is too slow given the constraints. We can't afford that.\n\nThis is where the sliding window technique comes into play. I know I can avoid redundant calculations by updating the sum of a window in `O(1)` time. I'll start by calculating the sum of the initial window of size `k` using `sum(a[0:k])`. Then, as I slide the window, I subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element entering it. This is the crucial part that makes the algorithm efficient. I'm leveraging the fact that successive sums are highly related - and I don't need to re-calculate everything from scratch at each step.\n\nSo, I initialize a `TotalSum` with the sum of the first window. Then, I iterate through the remaining windows, each time updating the current window sum. With the updated sum, I'll then add the running `current_window_sum` to the `TotalSum`. In the end, I divide `TotalSum` by the total number of windows, `n - k + 1`, to get the average.\n\nI'm keeping an eye on the time and space complexity. The input/output are `O(n)`. Calculating the initial window sum is `O(k)`. The sliding window loop itself is `O(n-k)`. Each step inside that loop is `O(1)`. Overall, this should be `O(n)`, which is perfect! Space complexity is dominated by storing the `a` array, which is also `O(n)`, again fine.  I've double-checked my implementation against the given example and the logic looks sound. I also thought carefully about those edge cases such as when `k=1` or `k=n`. I'm confident in the solution.\n\nOne final thought: While I'm not explicitly using any advanced data structures, this is an elegant and efficient algorithm based on a core optimization. I'll express the result with the required floating-point format, and I think I'm good to go!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate a specific average sleep time. Polycarp has `n` daily sleep records `a1, a2, ..., an`. A \"week\" is defined as `k` consecutive days. There are `n - k + 1` such weeks. We need to find the average of the sleep times over all these weeks.\n\nLet's clarify what \"average over all weeks\" means. If we have `W` weeks, and `S_i` is the total sleep time for the `i`-th week, then the required average is `(S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_W) / W`. It's not the average of the *averages* of each week, but rather the sum of all weekly totals divided by the number of weeks.\n\nFor example, if `n=3, k=2` and `a=[3, 4, 7]`:\n1. The first week is `[3, 4]`. Its sum `S_1 = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n2. The second week is `[4, 7]`. Its sum `S_2 = 4 + 7 = 11`.\nThere are `W = n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2` weeks.\nThe total sum of sleep times over all weeks is `S_1 + S_2 = 7 + 11 = 18`.\nThe average is `18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all `n - k + 1` possible weeks, calculate the sum for each week (which takes `O(k)` time), and add it to a running total. This would result in `O((n - k + 1) * k)` time complexity. Given `n` can be up to `2 * 10^5`, this could be `O(n^2)` in the worst case (e.g., `k` around `n/2`), which is too slow (`(2 * 10^5)^2 = 4 * 10^{10}` operations).\n\nA more efficient approach uses a **sliding window** technique:\n\n1.  **Calculate the sum of the first window:**\n    The sum of the first `k` days `a[0], ..., a[k-1]` can be calculated in `O(k)` time. Let this be `current_window_sum`.\n    Initialize `total_sum_of_all_weeks` with this `current_window_sum`.\n\n2.  **Slide the window:**\n    For subsequent weeks, we can update the `current_window_sum` in `O(1)` time.\n    To get the sum for the window starting at index `i` (i.e., `a[i], ..., a[i+k-1]`) from the sum of the window starting at `i-1` (i.e., `a[i-1], ..., a[i+k-2]`):\n    `current_window_sum = current_window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n    This means we subtract the element that leaves the window from the left (`a[i-1]`) and add the new element that enters the window from the right (`a[i+k-1]`).\n\n3.  **Accumulate total sum:**\n    Perform this sliding operation for `i` from `1` to `n - k`. In each step, add the `current_window_sum` to `total_sum_of_all_weeks`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final average:**\n    The total number of weeks considered is `n - k + 1`.\n    The final average is `total_sum_of_all_weeks / (n - k + 1)`.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** `O(k)` for the initial sum + `O(n - k)` for sliding the window `n - k` times (each step `O(1)`). This results in an overall `O(n)` time complexity, which is efficient enough for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` to store the input array `a`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]):**\n\n1.  `n=3, k=2`. `a = [3, 4, 7]`.\n2.  Initial window (indices `0` to `1`): `[3, 4]`.\n    `current_window_sum = 3 + 4 = 7`.\n    `total_sum_of_all_weeks = 7`.\n3.  Loop for `i` from `1` to `n - k = 1`:\n    *   For `i = 1`:\n        The window slides from `[3, 4]` to `[4, 7]`.\n        `current_window_sum = current_window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]`\n        `current_window_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[1+2-1]`\n        `current_window_sum = 7 - 3 + a[2]`\n        `current_window_sum = 4 + 7 = 11`.\n        `total_sum_of_all_weeks = total_sum_of_all_weeks + 11 = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n4.  The loop finishes.\n5.  Number of weeks `num_weeks = n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n6.  `average = total_sum_of_all_weeks / num_weeks = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n7.
