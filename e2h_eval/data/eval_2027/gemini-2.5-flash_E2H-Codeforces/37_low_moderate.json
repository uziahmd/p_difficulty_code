    "thought": "**Tackling the Gluttony Problem: A Python Script Strategy**\n\nAlright, so I'm diving into this \"Gluttony\" problem. It's about finding a permutation `b` of an input array `a` such that the sums of elements in any non-empty subset of `a` are *different* from the sums of those same subset elements in `b`. The constraint of `n <= 22` immediately screams \"exponential complexity territory,\" which makes me lean toward techniques like meet-in-the-middle or bitmask dynamic programming. But let's start with a solid understanding of the problem space.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the edge cases. If `n=1`, there are no valid subsets to consider, so `b` is just `a` itself. For `n=2`, it's pretty straightforward: just reverse the order of elements in `a` to get `b`.\n\nThe core challenge is this: checking all `2^n - 2` subsets to verify the sum condition is computationally expensive for `n=22`. I need a more efficient way to construct `b`. The fact that `b` is just a permutation of `a` leads me to think about permutations that are easy to generate and potentially satisfy the condition.\n\nMy initial thought is to try a simple cyclic shift permutation. If `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`, will that work? Let's test it. For `n=2`, it works fine, and for `n=3` it should also work because the cyclic shift ensures that the sums of subsets are always different. I need to formally prove this to ensure it works for all `n`. It looks promising and is a good starting point for a Python script. If the cyclic shift doesn't work, I'll need to explore other permutation strategies, but I have a strong feeling that this will solve it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements of `a` at these indices is different from the sum of elements of `b` at these indices. The array `a` contains `n` distinct integers, and `n` is up to 22.\n\nLet's analyze the condition: `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]` for `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nConsider a simple permutation: sorting the array `a` and then performing a cyclic shift.\nLet `a_sorted` be the array `a` sorted in ascending order.\nLet `b_sorted` be `a_sorted` shifted cyclically to the left by one position. That is, `b_sorted[i] = a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.\nSo, if `a_sorted = [x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1}]`, then `b_sorted = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1}, x_0]`.\n\nLet's prove why this construction works.\nAssume for contradiction that there exists a non-empty proper subset of indices `S` such that `sum_{i in S} a_sorted[i] == sum_{i in S} b_sorted[i]`.\nLet `A_S = sum_{i in S} a_sorted[i]` and `B_S = sum_{i in S} b_sorted[i]`.\nThe condition is `A_S = B_S`.\n\nSince `b_sorted[i] = a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`, we can rewrite `B_S` as `sum_{i in S} a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.\nConsider the elements `a_sorted[i]` and `a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.\nFor `i < n-1`, `a_sorted[i] < a_sorted[i+1]`.\nFor `i = n-1`, `a_sorted[n-1] > a_sorted[0]` (unless `n=1` or all elements are equal, which is not the case here).\n\nLet's look at the difference `a_sorted[i] - b_sorted[i]`:\n`a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`\nFor `i = 0, ..., n-2`, this difference is `a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[i+1] < 0`.\nFor `i = n-1`, this difference is `a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0] > 0`.\n\nLet `d_i = a_sorted[i] - b_sorted[i]`.\nThen `d_i < 0` for `i = 0, ..., n-2`, and `d_{n-1} > 0`.\nThe condition `A_S = B_S` implies `sum_{i in S} (a_sorted[i] - b_sorted[i]) = 0`.\nSo, `sum_{i in S} d_i = 0`.\n\nThis means that the subset `S` must contain at least one index `i` such that `d_i < 0` and at least one index `j` such that `d_j > 0`.\nSince only `d_{n-1}` is positive, it must be that `n-1` is in `S`.\nAnd since `d_i < 0` for `i = 0, ..., n-2`, `S` must contain at least one index `k` from `{0, ..., n-2}`.\n\nSo, if `sum_{i in S} d_i = 0`, then `S` must contain `n-1`, and `S` must contain at least one index `k < n-1`.\nThis implies `d_{n-1} = - sum_{i in S, i != n-1} d_i`.\nSince `d_i < 0` for `i < n-1`, the right side `- sum_{i in S, i != n-1} d_i` is a positive sum of absolute values `|d_i|`.\n\nConsider the sum of all `d_i`:\n`sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[(i+1)%n])`\nThis is a telescoping sum:\n`(a_sorted[0] - a_sorted[1]) + (a_sorted[1] - a_sorted[2]) + ... + (a_sorted[n-2] - a_sorted[n-1]) + (a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0]) = 0`.\nSo `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i = 0`.\n\nThis implies `d_{n-1} = - sum_{i=0}^{n-2} d_i`.\nSince `d_i < 0` for `i < n-1`, `d_{n-1} = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |d_i|`.\n\nNow, if `sum_{i in S} d_i = 0` for `0 < |S| < n`:\nWe know `n-1 in S`.\nWe also know `S` cannot be `{n-1}` because `d_{n-1} > 0`.\nSo `S` must contain at least one `k < n-1`.\nThen `d_{n-1} + sum_{i in S, i != n-1} d_i = 0`.\nThis implies `d_{n-1} = - sum_{i in S, i != n-1} d_i = sum_{i in S, i != n-1} |d_i|`.\n\nBut we know `d_{n-1} = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |d_i|`.\nFor these two equations to hold simultaneously, it must be that `sum_{i in S, i != n-1} |d_i| = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |d_i|`.\nSince `S` is a proper subset of indices (i.e., `|S| < n`), the set `{i | i in S, i != n-1}` must be a proper subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nThis means there exists some `j` such that `0 <= j <= n-2` and `j` is not in `S`.\nFor such a `j`, `|d_j| > 0`.\nTherefore, `sum_{i in S, i != n-1} |d_i| < sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |d_i|`.\nThis contradicts `d_{n-1} = sum_{i in S, i != n-1} |d_i|` and `d_{n-1} = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} |d_i|`.\nThus, our initial assumption that `sum_{i in S} a_sorted[i] == sum_{i in S} b_sorted[i]` must be false.\n\nTherefore, for any `0 < |S| < n`, `sum_{i in S} a_sorted[i] != sum_{i in S} b_sorted[i]`.\nThis construction always works.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Create pairs `(value, original_index)` for each element in `a`.\n4. Sort these pairs based on `value`. This gives `(a_sorted[i], original_index_of_a_sorted[i])`.\n5. Construct the `b` array. `b` should be a permutation of the original `a`.\n   The element at `a_sorted[i]` in the sorted array should move to the position where `b_sorted[i]` would be (which is `a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`).\n   More directly, we want `b[original_index_of_a_sorted[i]] = a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.\n   So, `b[original_index_of_a_sorted[i]]` gets the value `a_sorted[(i+1)%n]`.\n6. Print the elements of `b`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem):**\n`n = 4`, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n\n1. `n = 4`\n2. `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n3. Pairs `(value, original_index)`:\n   `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n4. Sort by value:\n   `sorted_pairs = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   Let `a_sorted` be `[1, 10, 100, 1000]`.\n   Let `original_indices` be `[3, 2, 1, 0]` (meaning `a_sorted[0]` came from `a[3]`, `a_sorted[1]` from `a[2]`, etc.)\n5. Construct `b`:\n   Initialize `b` with `n` zeros: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   - `i = 0`: `a_sorted[0] = 1`. `b_sorted[0]` should be `a_sorted[1] = 10`.\n     The element `a_sorted[0]` was originally at `a[original_indices[0]] = a[3]`.\n     So, `b[original_indices[0]] = a_sorted[(0+1)%4]`.\n     `b[3] = a_sorted[1] = 10`.\n     `b = [0, 0, 0, 10]`\n   - `i = 1`: `a_sorted[1] = 10`. `b_sorted[1]` should be `a_sorted[2] = 100`.\n     The element `a_sorted[1]` was originally at `a[original_indices[1]] = a[2]`.\n     So, `b[original_indices[1]] = a_sorted[(1+1)%4]`.\n     `b[2] = a_sorted[2] = 100`.\n     `b = [0, 0, 100, 10]`\n   - `i = 2`: `a_sorted[2] = 100`. `b_sorted[2]` should be `a_sorted[3] = 1000`.\n     The element `a_sorted[2]` was originally at `a[original_indices[2]] = a[1]`.\n     So, `b[original_indices[2]] = a_sorted[(2+1)%4]`.\n     `b[1] = a_sorted[3] = 1000`.\n     `b = [0, 1000, 100, 10]`\n   - `i = 3`: `a_sorted[3] = 1000`. `b_sorted[3]` should be `a_sorted[0] = 1`.\n     The element `a_sorted[3]` was originally at `a[original_indices[3]] = a[0]`.\n     So, `b[original_indices[3]] = a_sorted[(3+1)%4]`.\n     `b[0] = a_sorted[0] = 1`.\n     `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`\n\n6. Print `b`: `1 1000 100 10`.\n   Wait, the example output is `100 1 1000 10`. This is a different permutation.\n   My derivation for `b` is `b_k` is the value `a_sorted[(idx_k+1)%n]` where `a_original[k]` is `a_sorted[idx_k]`.\n   Let's re-evaluate the construction of `b`.\n   The elements of `a` are `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n   The elements of `b` are `b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}`.\n   We want `b` to be a permutation of `a`.\n   The proof applies to `a_sorted` and `b_sorted` where `b_sorted` is a cyclic shift of `a_sorted`.\n   To map this back to the original indices:\n   Let `pos[val]` be the original index of `val` in `a`.\n   Let `val_at_sorted_idx[k]` be the value `a_sorted[k]`.\n   Then `b[pos[val_at_sorted_idx[k]]] = val_at_sorted_idx[(k+1)%n]`.\n\nLet's re-do the example with this definition:\n`a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n`n = 4`\n\n1. Create `(value, original_index)` pairs:\n   `items = [(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n2. Sort them by value:\n   `sorted_items = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   This means:\n   `a_sorted[0] = 1`, its original index was `3`.\n   `a_sorted[1] = 10`, its original index was `2`.\n   `a_sorted[2] = 100`, its original index was `1`.\n   `a_sorted[3] = 1000`, its original index was `0`.\n\n3. Construct `b` array (initialized to zeros): `b = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n   Iterate `k` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   - `k = 0`:\n     `val_at_sorted_idx[0] = 1`. Its original index is `3`.\n     The value `1` (which is `a_sorted[0]`) should be replaced by `a_sorted[(0+1)%4] = a_sorted[1] = 10`.\n     So, `b[3] = 10`.\n     `b = [0, 0, 0, 10]`\n   - `k = 1`:\n     `val_at_sorted_idx[1] = 10`. Its original index is `2`.\n     The value `10` (which is `a_sorted[1]`) should be replaced by `a_sorted[(1+1)%4] = a_sorted[2] = 100`.\n     So, `b[2] = 100`.\n     `b = [0, 0, 100, 10]`\n   - `k = 2`:\n     `val_at_sorted_idx[2] = 100`. Its original index is `1`.\n     The value `100` (which is `a_sorted[2]`) should be replaced by `a_sorted[(2+1)%4] = a_sorted[3] = 1000`.\n     So, `b[1] = 1000`.\n     `b = [0, 1000, 100, 10]`\n   - `k = 3`:\n     `val_at_sorted_idx[3] = 1000`. Its original index is `0`.\n     The value `1000` (which is `a_sorted[3]`) should be replaced by `a_sorted[(3+1)%4] = a_sorted[0] = 1`.\n     So, `b[0] = 1`.\n     `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`\n\nThis is the output `1 1000 100 10`. This is *not* the example output `100 1 1000 10`.\nHowever, the problem states \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\" So my derived answer should be valid.\n\nLet's check the example output `100 1 1000 10` for `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n`a_0=1000, a_1=100, a_2=10, a_3=1`\n`b_0=100, b_1=1, b_2=1000, b_3=10`\nThis `b` is a permutation of `a`.\nLet's see what kind of permutation this is.\n`b_0 = a_1`\n`b_1 = a_3`\n`b_2 = a_0`\n`b_3 = a_2`\nThis is a permutation `(0->1, 1->3, 2->0, 3->2)`. This is not a simple cyclic shift of indices.\nIt seems the example output sorts `a` and then applies a cyclic shift, but in a different way.\nThe example output `b` corresponds to `a_original[idx] = a_sorted[k]` and `b[idx] = a_sorted[(k+2)%n]`.\nFor `a_sorted = [1, 10, 100, 1000]` and `n=4`:\n`k=0`: `a_sorted[0]=1`. Original index `3`. `b[3] = a_sorted[2] = 100`.\n`k=1`: `a_sorted[1]=10`. Original index `2`. `b[2] = a_sorted[3] = 1000`.\n`k=2`: `a_sorted[2]=100`. Original index `1`. `b[1] = a_sorted[0] = 1`.\n`k=3`: `a_sorted[3]=1000`. Original index `0`. `b[0] = a_sorted[1] = 10`.\nResulting `b = [10, 1, 1000, 100]`. Still not the example output.\n\nThe example output `100 1 1000 10` for `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]` maps `a_original` values:\n`1000 -> 100`\n`100 -> 1`\n`10 -> 1000`\n`1 -> 10`\nThis is mapping `a_original[i]` to `b[i]`.\nThe values being mapped are:\n`a_sorted[3] -> a_sorted[2]`\n`a_sorted[2] -> a_sorted[0]`\n`a_sorted[1] -> a_sorted[3]`\n`a_sorted[0] -> a_sorted[1]`\nThis is `a_sorted[k] -> a_sorted[(k+1)%n]` but for the values at sorted indices.\nSo if `a_sorted = [x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3] = [1, 10, 100, 1000]`, then `b_values = [x_1, x_2, x_3, x_0] = [10, 100, 1000, 1]`.\nThese `b_values` are then put into `b` at the original positions of `a_sorted` elements.\n`b[original_index_of(x_0)] = x_1`\n`b[original_index_of(x_1)] = x_2`\n`b[original_index_of(x_2)] = x_3`\n`b[original_index_of(x_3)] = x_0`\n\nLet's re-apply this logic to the example:\n`a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n`sorted_items = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n`a_sorted = [1, 10, 100, 1000]`\n`original_indices = [3, 2, 1, 0]`\n\n`b = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\n- `k=0`: `a_sorted[0]=1`. Original index is `3`. `b[3]` should be `a_sorted[1]=10`.\n  `b = [0, 0, 0, 10]`\n- `k=1`: `a_sorted[1]=10`. Original index is `2`. `b[2]` should be `a_sorted[2]=100`.\n  `b = [0, 0, 100, 10]`\n- `k=2`: `a_sorted[2]=100`. Original index is `1`. `b[1]` should be `a_sorted[3]=1000`.\n  `b = [0, 1000, 100, 10]`\n- `k=3`: `a_sorted[3]=1000`. Original index is `0`. `b[0]` should be `a_sorted[0]=1`.\n  `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`\n\nThis is exactly what I derived earlier. My proof for this specific construction is sound.\nThe example output `100 1 1000 10` is also a permutation of `a`. It must satisfy the condition too.\nThe example output `b` corresponds to `b[0]=100, b[1]=1, b[2]=1000, b[3]=10`.\nOriginal `a`: `a[0]=1000, a[1]=100, a[2]=10, a[3]=1`.\nThe mapping is:\n`a[0]=1000` maps to `b[0]=100`.\n`a[1]=100` maps to `b[1]=1`.\n`a[2]=10` maps to `b[2]=1000`.\n`a[3]=1` maps to `b[3]=10`.\n\nThis mapping can be described as:\n`b[i] = value_that_was_at_original_index_p[i]`\nThe example output is `b[0]=100, b[1]=1, b[2]=1000, b[3]=10`.\nThis means:\n`b[0]` gets value `a[1]`\n`b[1]` gets value `a[3]`\n`b[2]` gets value `a[0]`\n`b[3]` gets value `a[2]`\nThis is a permutation of indices `(0->1, 1->3, 2->0, 3->2)`. This is a 2-cycle `(0 1 3 2)`.\nThis permutation `p = [1, 3, 0, 2]` means `b[i] = a[p[i]]`.\nThis is also a cyclic shift of indices, but not `(i+1)%n`. It's `(i+c)%n` for some `c` and a re-ordering of `a`.\nThe key is that for `n > 1`, the sorted array `a_sorted` and `a_sorted` cyclically shifted by 1 position (call it `b_shifted`) will always satisfy the condition `sum_{i in S} a_sorted[i] != sum_{i in S} b_shifted[i]`.\nThe construction I derived correctly implements this. Since any valid answer is fine, my construction should be accepted.\n\n**Special case `n=1`:**\nIf `n=1`, the condition `0 < k < n` means no subsets `S` need to be checked.\nSo, `b` must be a permutation of `a`. If `a = [x]`, then `b` must be `[x]`.\nMy algorithm:\n`a = [100]`\n`sorted_items = [(100, 0)]`\n`a_sorted = [100]`\n`original_indices = [0]`\n`b = [0]`\n`k=0`: `a_sorted[0]=100`.
