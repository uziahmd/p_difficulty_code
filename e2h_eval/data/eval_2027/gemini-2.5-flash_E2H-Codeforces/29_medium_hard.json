Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem. It seems like we're dealing with string manipulation and modular arithmetic – classic competitive programming fare. The core of the issue is taking a digit string `s`, applying a series of digit replacement queries, and then calculating the numerical value of the resulting string modulo a large prime. \n\nDirectly simulating the string replacements is a red flag.  The string `s` could balloon in size exponentially with each query, potentially exceeding memory constraints. So, brute-force won't cut it.  We need a more clever, memory-efficient approach.\n\n**Identifying the Key Components: Value and Length**\n\nThe goal is to compute the final number modulo `MOD`.  We don't actually need to store the entire intermediate string. Instead, the key must be to capture the essence of what each digit contributes. This points to representing each digit by its *value* and its *length* within the final expression.\n\nFor each digit `d` (0-9), we'll track two pieces of information:\n\n1.  `value[d]`:  The numerical value of the string that `d` ultimately transforms into, modulo `MOD`.\n2.  `length[d]`:  The length of that final string (modulo `MOD-1` to handle the exponents). This is crucial when we need to calculate the number value of a string by processing its characters from left to right.\n\n**Query Processing: A Crucial Twist**\n\nThe key insight is the order in which we process the queries. The order of applying the substitutions matters. A query like `di -> ti` will alter the string that digit `di` represents. If a subsequent query modifies the same target, or the new target uses that intermediate value, the earlier representation is overwritten. The logic suggests working backwards, to preserve the correct 'value' of each digit.\n\n**Reverse Order Approach**\n\nThus, the query processing is done in reverse order. Initialize `value[d]` and `length[d]` for each digit `d` (0-9). The code looks like this:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n    # Process queries from last to first\n```\n\nFor each query `di -> ti`:\n1.  Calculate a new `value[di]` and `length[di]` by iterating through `ti`. The new value is computed as: `(new_value_di * pow(10, length[c], MOD) + value[c]) % MOD`. And new length is `(new_length_di + length[c]) % (MOD-1)`.\n2.  Update the `value[di]` and `length[di]` with the newly calculated values. This captures the impact of the current replacement, using current digit values.\n\nThe `length` variable must take `MOD-1` as a modulo for exponent purposes. Otherwise, a calculation such as: `pow(10, 10000000000)` might lead to exceeding limits.\n\n**Final Calculation: Building the Number**\n\nOnce the queries are processed, calculating the final number represented by the initial string `s` is relatively straightforward.  We iterate through the characters of `s` (which are also digits):\n1.  Obtain `final_val = (final_val * pow(10, length[digit_s], MOD) + value[digit_s]) % MOD`. This is done for each character `digit_s` in string `s`.\n\n**Edge Cases and Validation**\n\nThe cases of empty strings or leading zeros are handled correctly. An empty string effectively represents 0. We must treat `007` as `7` for the final result, not as `007`.\n\nNow that we have the full strategy, it is time to write the code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The string `s` can become extremely long if we perform direct string manipulations, so we need a more efficient approach.\n\nThe key observation is that we only need the numerical value and length of the string resulting from each digit. Let `value[d]` be the numerical value (modulo 1000000007) and `length[d]` be the length (modulo 1000000006, as it will be used as an exponent for 10) of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into.\n\nWhen a query `di -> ti` is given, it means all occurrences of `di` are replaced by `ti`. If `ti` itself contains other digits `c`, those `c`s will also be eventually replaced by their respective final strings. This implies that the updates to `value[di]` and `length[di]` should depend on the *final* `value[c]` and `length[c]` for digits `c` in `ti`. This suggests processing the queries in **reverse order**.\n\nHere's the detailed algorithm:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Define `MOD = 1000000007`.\n    *   Define `MOD_EXP = MOD - 1 = 1000000006`. This is used for exponents in modular exponentiation (`pow(base, exp, mod)`) due to Fermat's Little Theorem.\n    *   Create two arrays, `value` and `length`, both of size 10 (for digits 0-9).\n    *   Initially, each digit `d` transforms into itself. So, for `d` from 0 to 9:\n        *   `value[d] = d`\n        *   `length[d] = 1`\n\n2.  **Process Queries in Reverse Order:**\n    *   Read all `n` queries and store them.\n    *   Iterate through the queries from the last one (`n-1`) down to the first one (`0`).\n    *   For each query \"di -> ti\":\n        *   Parse `di` (the digit to be replaced) and `ti` (the replacement string).\n        *   Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`. These will store the cumulative value and length for the string `ti`.\n        *   If `ti` is an empty string, `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` remain 0.\n        *   Otherwise, iterate through each character `c` in `ti` from left to right:\n            *   Convert `c` to an integer `digit_c`.\n            *   Update `new_val_di`: `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, length[digit_c], MOD) + value[digit_c]) % MOD`. This formula correctly combines the current accumulated value with the value of `digit_c`, shifted by `length[digit_c]` decimal places.\n            *   Update `new_len_di`: `new_len_di = (new_len_di + length[digit_c]) % MOD_EXP`. The total length accumulates.\n        *   After processing all characters in `ti`, update `value[di] = new_val_di` and `length[di] = new_len_di`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Result:**\n    *   Initialize `final_ans = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `c` in the initial string `s` from left to right:\n        *   Convert `c` to an integer `digit_s`.\n        *   Update `final_ans`: `final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, length[digit_s], MOD) + value[digit_s]) % MOD`. This is the standard way to compute a number from its digits, but here we use the effective `value` and `length` for each digit.\n\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   Print `final_ans`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description): `s = \"222\"`, queries: `2->0`, `0->7`**\n\n*   `MOD = 1000000007`, `MOD_EXP = 1000000006`\n*   Initial `value = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`, `length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n**Processing queries in reverse:**\n\n*   **Query 2 (index 1): `0->7`**\n    *   `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n    *   `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_len_0 = 0`\n    *   For `c = '7'`: `digit_c = 7`.\n        *   `new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, length[7], MOD) + value[7]) % MOD = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n        *   `new_len_0 = (0 + length[7]) % MOD_EXP = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\n    *   Update `value[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n    *   Current `value = [7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`, `length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n*   **Query 1 (index 0): `2->0`**\n    *   `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n    *   `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_len_2 = 0`\n    *   For `c = '0'`: `digit_c = 0`.\n        *   `new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, length[0], MOD) + value[0]) % MOD = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7` (Note: `value[0]` is now 7 from the previous query)\n        *   `new_len_2 = (0 + length[0]) % MOD_EXP = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\n    *   Update `value[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n    *   Final `value = [7,1,7,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`, `length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n**Calculate final result for `s = \"222\"`:**\n\n*   `final_ans = 0`\n*   For `c = '2'` (1st): `digit_s = 2`.\n    *   `final_ans = (0 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + value[2]) % MOD = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n*   For `c = '2'` (2nd): `digit_s = 2`.\n    *   `final_ans = (7 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + value[2]) % MOD = (7 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 77`\n*   For `c = '2'` (3rd): `digit_s = 2`.\n    *   `final_ans = (77 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + value[2]) % MOD = (77 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 777`\n\nThe final answer is 777, which matches the example output.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of `O((N_ti + |s|) * log MOD)`, where `N_ti` is the total length of all `ti` strings and `|s|` is the length of the initial string.
