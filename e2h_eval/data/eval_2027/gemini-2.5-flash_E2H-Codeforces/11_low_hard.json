A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Pythonic Plan for Soft Drinking**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. My goal is a Python script that calculates the maximum number of toasts everyone can have, given limited resources. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input. I have `n` friends, `k` bottles of drink, `l` ml per bottle, `c` limes, `d` slices per lime, and `p` grams of salt. Also, `nl` is the ml of drink each friend needs *per toast*, and `np` is the grams of salt needed *per toast*. \n\nThe core of the problem is finding the limiting resource. I need to calculate how many toasts are *possible* based on *each* resource and then take the minimum, since everyone has to have the same number of toasts.\n\nMy initial thought was to calculate the *total* possible toasts for *everyone* and then divide by the number of friends.  However, after careful re-reading the example provided in the problem, I realized the problem refers to individual toasts possible per person. So my approach will be slightly different.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking about the resources now:\n\n*   **Drink:**  The total ml of drink is `k * l`. Each friend needs `nl` ml per toast. So, the number of toasts one friend can make based on the drink is `(k * l) // nl` (using integer division).\n*   **Limes:** The total slices are `c * d`. Each friend needs one slice per toast.  So, toasts from limes is simply `c * d`.\n*   **Salt:**  We have `p` grams of salt. Each friend needs `np` grams per toast, so the individual toast limit here will be `p // np`.\n\nWith these individual limits calculated, I need to take the *minimum* of these three values. That minimum value will be the maximum number of toasts *each* friend can make, ensuring all resources are used optimally without anyone going over their allocated amount. That’s my strategy! I should be able to write this pretty quickly in Python now.\n",
