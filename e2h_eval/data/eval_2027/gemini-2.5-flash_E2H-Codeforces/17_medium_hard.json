He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down. My goal is to write a Python script to tackle the \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" competitive programming problem.**\n\nFirst, I need to really understand the problem. I'm given 2n-2 strings, which are all improper prefixes and suffixes of a mystery string 's' of length 'n'. For each length k from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one prefix and one suffix. I need to figure out how to label these strings as either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) consistently with some string 's'. Crucially, the number of 'P's and 'S's will both be n-1.\n\nMy strategy hinges on some observations:\n1.  For each length, there's a unique prefix/suffix pair.\n2.  The original string, 's', can be reconstructed from the prefix and suffix of length n-1.\n3.  The real key is this: if I take the prefix of length n-1 (P_n-1) and the suffix of length n-1 (S_n-1), I can potentially reconstruct 's'. But crucially, the last n-2 characters of P_n-1 must be equal to the first n-2 characters of S_n-1. This is the core check. If that holds, I can build 's'.\n4. I need to find these n-1 length strings. There are only two, and I'll need to try them both.\n\nHere's the algorithm:\n\n1.  Read in 'n'.\n2.  I'll store all the input strings, keeping track of their original indices. This is critical for generating the output in the correct order.\n3.  I'll separate the strings based on their lengths; this will make finding the candidate n-1 length strings easy.\n4.  There will always be at least one, and potentially two, prefixes/suffixes of length n-1. I need to identify both of these.\n\nNow comes the crucial part: I have to work through the two scenarios.\n\nIn the first attempt, I assume that one of those strings is the prefix of length n-1, and the other is the suffix of length n-1. I'll need to check if the last n-2 characters of the prefix match the first n-2 characters of the suffix. If they do, I use those strings to reconstruct 's'. I'll need to fully verify whether or not this \"s\" fits by working through an entire checklist. If all looks good, I’m done!\n\nHowever, if that doesn't work, I'll switch which string is the prefix and which is the suffix and try again. The problem guarantees a solution, so this second attempt must work.\n\n**Simplified Verification**\n\nTo simplify the verification, here's how to check if a candidate 's' is valid:\n1. Generate the prefixes and suffixes of 's' for each length k from 1 to n-1.\n2. Scan through all the input strings.\n3. If I find an input that is a prefix of my 's', I’ll mark its spot with a 'P'.\n4. Otherwise, the string is a suffix, and I'll label it as 'S'.\n\nI'll use a `check()` function, which is designed to go through this logic and return the resulting 'P'/'S' string, or `None` if the candidate string isn't valid. I should be able to make some headway using these ideas!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for each of the given `2n-2` strings, whether it is a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') of some unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that such a string `s` exists and that for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two input strings: one is the prefix of length `k`, and the other is the suffix of length `k`.\n\nThe core idea is to first reconstruct the candidate original string `s`, and then verify if this `s` is consistent with all the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\n**Step-by-step approach:**\n\n1.  **Identify strings of length `n-1`:**\n    The problem states there are `2n-2` strings in total, and for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings. This means there are two strings of length `n-1`. Let's call them `str_A` and `str_B`.\n    One of these must be the prefix of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[0...n-2]`) and the other must be the suffix of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[1...n-1]`).\n\n2.  **Formulate candidate strings `s`:**\n    There are two possibilities for `str_A` and `str_B`:\n    *   **Possibility 1:** `str_A` is the prefix `s[0...n-2]` and `str_B` is the suffix `s[1...n-1]`.\n        In this case, the full string `s` would be `str_A[0] + str_B`. For this to be valid, the last `n-2` characters of `str_A` must match the first `n-2` characters of `str_B`. That is, `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`. If this condition holds, we form `candidate_s1 = str_A[0] + str_B`.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** `str_B` is the prefix `s[0...n-2]` and `str_A` is the suffix `s[1...n-1]`.\n        Similarly, we check if `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`. If this condition holds, we form `candidate_s2 = str_B[0] + str_A`.\n\n    Since a consistent string `s` is guaranteed to exist, at least one of these two possibilities (and their corresponding consistency check, described next) must yield a valid `s`. It's possible both yield a valid `s` (e.g., for palindromes like \"aaa\" or \"ac\", \"ca\"). We can pick any valid assignment.\n\n3.  **Verify a candidate string `s`:**\n    Let's say we have a `candidate_s`. We need to check if the given `2n-2` input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of `candidate_s`.\n    *   Generate all expected prefixes of `candidate_s`: `candidate_s[0:k]` for `k=1...n-1`.\n    *   Generate all expected suffixes of `candidate_s`: `candidate_s[n-k:n]` for `k=1...n-1`.\n    *   Collect these `2n-2` expected strings into a frequency map (e.g., `collections.Counter`). This is crucial because there might be duplicate strings among prefixes and suffixes (e.g., for `s = \"ababa\"`, prefix \"a\" and suffix \"a\" are the same).\n    *   Initialize a result list `output_chars` of length `2n-2` with placeholder characters.\n    *   Iterate through the *original input strings* in their given order, along with their original indices. For each input string `current_input_str` at `original_index`:\n        *   Check if `current_input_str` is a prefix of `candidate_s` (i.e., `candidate_s.startswith(current_input_str)`).\n        *   If it is, and `current_input_str` is present in our `expected_counts` with a count greater than zero:\n            *   Assign `'P'` to `output_chars[original_index]`.\n            *   Decrement the count of `current_input_str` in `expected_counts`.\n        *   Else (it must be a suffix), and `current_input_str` is present in `expected_counts` with a count greater than zero:\n            *   Assign `'S'` to `output_chars[original_index]`.\n            *   Decrement the count of `current_input_str` in `expected_counts`.\n        *   If at any point, `current_input_str` is not found in `expected_counts` or its count is zero, then this `candidate_s` is inconsistent. Return `None` (or indicate failure).\n    *   If all input strings are successfully assigned and `expected_counts` now shows all counts as zero, then `candidate_s` is valid. Return the `''.join(output_chars)`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n*   Store the input strings in a list of tuples `(string_value, original_index)` to preserve order.\n*   Filter these strings to get the two strings of length `n-1`.\n*   Try `candidate_s1` first. If `check()` returns a valid result, print it and exit.\n*   Otherwise, try `candidate_s2`. The problem guarantees this will succeed. Print the result and exit.\n\n**Example 1: `n=5`, input strings `['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']`**\n\n1.
