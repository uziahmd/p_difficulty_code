For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Dynamic Programming**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where I need to count the ways to set these *c* values for binary strings, making sure the biggest \"beautiful\" multiset has a specific size *f*. A beautiful multiset's structure is determined by the constraints imposed by these *c* values, which are essentially bounds on the number of strings sharing a prefix.  This reminds me of a trie (prefix tree) and how the counts of strings are related to the constraints at each node.\n\nThe central concept is that the maximum size of the multiset, is determined by the maximum flow from the root of a trie to its leaves, where each node has a capacity.  Thinking about it, I see that the counts at any internal node are determined by the counts of its children. Specifically `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)`. My intuition tells me this can be modeled as a maximum flow or min-cut problem, although directly using those algorithms doesn't seem the right approach.\n\nGiven the size of possible inputs, it is obvious that I must approach this with dynamic programming. The state I want to compute is the number of valid *c* value assignments that will achieve the target maximum multiset size of *f*. The trie naturally suggests a DP approach where I work from the bottom up. So, let me define a DP state that represents the valid choices for each subtree, and build from that.\n\nMy initial idea uses DP array, `dp[d][v]`, to store the ways to assign valid `c_s` values such that maximum count value for the subtree rooted at depth `d` is exactly `v`. The base case is when we are at the leaf nodes, which just have one choice. This requires a convolution to combine subtrees. Since `n` is limited, using NTT for convolution should be okay.\n\nI will then define a convolution operation for calculating `dp` states at depth `d`. The transition will look like `dp[d][v] = sum(...) P_d[c]` such that  `min(c, N(s0) + N(s1)) = v`.  The overall objective of the problem reduces to calculating the value of the final convolution, `P_0[f]`,  representing the number of ways,  where `P_0` is the convolution of the `dp` values at level 1.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from 1 to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of strings of length exactly $n$ is exactly $f$. We need to output the answer modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the chosen $c_s$ values. Let $N(s)$ be the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix. The conditions are $N(s) \\le c_s$ for all $s$ of length 1 to $n$.\nAlso, for any string $s$ of length $L < n$, $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$, where $s0$ and $s1$ are its children in the binary string trie. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $N(s)$ is simply its multiplicity in the multiset.\nTo maximize the total size of the multiset, which is $N(0) + N(1)$ (sum over all strings starting with '0' and '1'), we can use a recursive approach. Let $\\text{max_count}(s)$ be the maximum possible value of $N(s)$ for a string $s$, given all $c_t$ values for $t$ that are $s$ or descendants of $s$.\n- If $s$ has length $n$: $\\text{max_count}(s) = c_s$. (The string $s$ itself can appear at most $c_s$ times).\n- If $s$ has length $L < n$: $\\text{max_count}(s) = \\min(c_s, \\text{max_count}(s0) + \\text{max_count}(s1))$. This is because $N(s)$ cannot exceed $c_s$, and it also cannot exceed the sum of counts of its children's subtrees. To maximize $N(s)$, we maximize its children's counts.\n\nThe problem asks for the total maximum size to be $f$. The total maximum size is $\\text{max_count}(0) + \\text{max_count}(1)$.\n\nThis structure suggests a dynamic programming approach on the levels of the trie. Since all subtrees at the same depth are symmetric, we can compute the DP for a generic subtree.\nLet `dp[d][v]` be the number of ways to choose $c_t$ values for all strings $t$ in a *generic subtree* rooted at depth $d$ (including $c_s$ for the root $s$ itself and its descendants), such that $\\text{max_count}(s) = v$. The maximum possible value for $v$ is $k$.\n\nThe DP state transitions are as follows:\n\n1.  **Base Case (`d = n`):**\n    For a string $s$ of length $n$, $\\text{max_count}(s) = c_s$. Since $c_s$ can be any integer from $0$ to $k$, there is 1 way to choose $c_s$ to be $v$.\n    So, `dp[n][v] = 1` for $0 \\le v \\le k$. All other `dp[n][v]` are 0.\n\n2.  **Iterative Step (`d = n-1` down to `1`):**\n    To compute `dp[d][v]`, we consider a generic node $s$ at depth $d$ and its children $s0, s1$ at depth $d+1$.\n    $\\text{max_count}(s) = \\min(c_s, \\text{max_count}(s0) + \\text{max_count}(s1))$.\n    Let $v_0 = \\text{max_count}(s0)$ and $v_1 = \\text{max_count}(s1)$.\n    The number of ways to achieve $v_0$ for $s0$ is `dp[d+1][v_0]`.\n    The number of ways to achieve $v_1$ for $s1$ is `dp[d+1][v_1]`.\n    Since the choices for $s0$'s subtree and $s1$'s subtree are independent, the total number of ways for $s0$ and $s1$ to result in $v_0$ and $v_1$ respectively is `dp[d+1][v_0] * dp[d+1][v_1]`.\n\n    Let $P_d$ be the convolution of `dp[d+1]` with itself. That is, $P_d[x] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=x} (\\text{dp[d+1][v_0]} \\cdot \\text{dp[d+1][v_1]})$.\n    $P_d[x]$ represents the number of ways to choose $c_t$ values for the subtrees of $s0$ and $s1$ such that $\\text{max_count}(s0) + \\text{max_count}(s1) = x$. The maximum value for $x$ is $2k$.\n    This convolution can be computed efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).\n\n    Now, we need to choose $c_s$ (from $0$ to $k$) and a sum $x = v_0 + v_1$ (from $0$ to $2k$) such that $\\min(c_s, x) = v$.\n    There are two cases for $\\min(c_s, x) = v$:\n    a. $c_s = v$ and $x \\ge v$. The number of ways for this is $P_d[v] + P_d[v+1] + \\dots + P_d[2k]$. (Since $c_s=v$ is chosen in 1 way).\n    b. $c_s > v$ and $x = v$. The number of ways for this is $(k-v) \\cdot P_d[v]$. (There are $k-v$ choices for $c_s$: $v+1, \\dots, k$).\n\n    So, `dp[d][v] = (\\sum_{j=v}^{2k} P_d[j]) + (k-v) \\cdot P_d[v]`.\n    Let `SuffP_d[v] = \\sum_{j=v}^{2k} P_d[j]` be the suffix sums of $P_d$.\n    Then, `dp[d][v] = (SuffP_d[v] + (k-v) \\cdot P_d[v]) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n    This calculation is done for $v$ from $0$ to $k$.\n\n3.  **Final Answer:**\n    After computing `dp[1]`, we need to find the number of ways such that $\\text{max_count}(0) + \\text{max_count}(1) = f$.\n    This is equivalent to computing $P_0[f]$, where $P_0$ is the convolution of `dp[1]` with itself.\n    So, compute $P_0 = \\text{convolution}(\\text{dp[1]}, \\text{dp[1]})$.\n    The final answer is $P_0[f]$. If $f > 2k$, the answer is $0$.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Each DP step (from $d+1$ to $d$) involves one NTT convolution. The polynomials have degree up to $k$, so the convolution result has degree up to $2k$. NTT takes $O(K \\log K)$ time where $K$ is the smallest power of 2 greater than $2k$.\n- There are $n-1$ such DP steps (from $d=n-1$ down to $1$).\n- The final convolution for the answer also takes $O(K \\log K)$.\n- Total time complexity: $O(n \\cdot K \\log K)$.\nGiven $n \\le 15$ and $k \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $K$ is approximately $4 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(4 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.14 \\cdot 10^8$, which is feasible within typical time limits.\n\n**NTT Implementation Details:**\n- Modulo is $998244353$. It's a prime of the form $C \\cdot 2^E + 1$.\n- Primitive root $g=3$.\n- Inverse of $g$ modulo $P$ is $g^{P-2} \\pmod P$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MOD = 998244353\n    PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n    # Precompute powers for NTT\n    # max_len for NTT will be smallest power of 2 >= 2*k + 1\n    # For k=2e5, 2k+1 = 4e5+1.
