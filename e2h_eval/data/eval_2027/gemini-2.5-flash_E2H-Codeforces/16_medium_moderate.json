Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "**Solution for Crazy Town Problem**\n\nMy task is to write a Python script that solves the \"Crazy Town\" problem, a competitive programming challenge. I need to figure out the shortest path from a home to a university on a 2D plane divided by infinite lines (roads). The problem specifies that moving between adjacent blocks (regions) requires crossing a road. The home and university are guaranteed not to be on any of the roads.\n\nThe key insight here is that each road independently acts as a barrier. If the home and the university are on opposite sides of a road, we *have* to cross that road (or effectively cross an equivalent boundary) to get to the destination. Conversely, if they're on the same side, crossing that road is unnecessary. Therefore, the minimum number of steps (road crossings) is simply the count of roads separating the home and university.\n\nTo determine if the home and university are on opposite sides of a given road `ax + by + c = 0`, I can evaluate the expression `ax + by + c` for both the home's and university's coordinates. Since neither point lies on a road, the result of this expression will always be non-zero. If the signs of the results are different (one positive, one negative), they're on opposite sides. If the signs are the same, they're on the same side. The problem boils down to efficiently counting these road separations.\n\nThe algorithm is straightforward: read the coordinates of the home and university, then read the line parameters (a, b, c) for each road. For each road, I calculate the value `ax + by + c` for both the home and university points. If the product of these values is negative, meaning different signs, I increment the step counter. Finally, I print the total step count.\n\nI have performed several example walk-throughs to ensure this logic is correct. I have also considered the constraints and edge cases, such as parallel lines and line intersections, and made sure my code handles these situations correctly. Based on my analysis, the provided Python solution efficiently and accurately solves the Crazy Town problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing home) to a destination block (containing university). A step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent block, where adjacency means sharing a common border of non-zero length.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nEach road (line) `ax + by + c = 0` divides the plane into two half-planes. For any point `(x, y)` not on the line, the expression `ax + by + c` will have a non-zero sign. Points in one half-plane will yield a positive value, and points in the other half-plane will yield a negative value.\n\nIf your home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)` are on the *same side* of a particular road, then the values `a*x1 + b*y1 + c` and `a*x2 + b*y2 + c` will have the same sign (both positive or both negative). In this case, you do not need to cross this road to get from home to university, as they are already on the same side of it.\n\nIf your home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)` are on *opposite sides* of a particular road, then the values `a*x1 + b*y1 + c` and `a*x2 + b*y2 + c` will have different signs (one positive, one negative). To move from one side of this road to the other, you *must* cross this road. Each such crossing constitutes one step.\n\nThe minimum number of steps required to get from the home's block to the university's block is simply the count of roads that separate the home and the university. That is, the number of roads for which home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the coordinates of the home `(x1, y1)`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of the university `(x2, y2)`.\n3.  Read the total number of roads `n`.\n4.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n5.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read the coefficients `a, b, c` for the current road `ax + by + c = 0`.\n    b.  Calculate `val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c`. This value indicates which side of the line the home is on.\n    c.  Calculate `val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c`. This value indicates which side of the line the university is on.\n    d.  Since it's guaranteed that neither home nor university lies on any road, `val1` and `val2` will never be zero.\n    e.  If `val1` and `val2` have different signs (i.e., their product `val1 * val2` is negative), it means the home and university are on opposite sides of this road. Increment `steps`.\n6.  Print the final `steps` count.\n\n**Example:**\nHome: (1, 1), University: (-1, -1)\nRoad 1: `0x + 1y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `y = 0`)\nFor (1, 1): `0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1`\nFor (-1, -1): `0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1`\nSigns are different (1 and -1), so `1 * -1 < 0`. This road separates them. `steps = 1`.\n\nRoad 2: `1x + 0y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `x = 0`)\nFor (1, 1): `1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1`\nFor (-1, -1): `1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1`\nSigns are different (1 and -1), so `1 * -1 < 0`. This road separates them. `steps = 2`.\n\nTotal steps = 2.\n\n**Constraints and Efficiency:**\nThe coordinates and coefficients are up to `10^6`. The calculation `a*x + b*y + c` can result in values up to `2 * 10^12 + 10^6`, which fits within standard 64-bit integers and is handled by Python's arbitrary-precision integers.\nThe number of roads `n` is up to 300. The algorithm performs a constant number of arithmetic operations and comparisons for each road. Thus, the total time complexity is O(n), which is very efficient for `n=300`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read coordinates of home (x1, y1)\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read coordinates of university (x2, y2)\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the minimum number of steps\n    steps = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read the coefficients a, b, c for the current road: ax + by + c = 0\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Evaluate the line equation for the home coordinates\n        # The sign of this value determines which side of the line (x1, y1) is on.\n        # E.g., if ax+by+c > 0, it's on one side; if < 0, it's on the other.\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        \n        # Evaluate the line equation for the university coordinates\n        # The sign of this value determines which side of the line (x2, y2) is on.\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        # If the home and university are on opposite sides of the current road,\n        # their evaluated values (val1 and val2) will have different signs.\n        # Since it's guaranteed that neither point lies on any road, val1 and val2\n        # will never be zero.
