The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Frog Jumping Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to tackle this Frog Jumping problem. Let's break down my approach. First, I need to understand the mechanics. The frog moves by either adding `a` or subtracting `b` from its current position `k`.  The crucial constraint is that every jump, and every intermediate position, needs to stay within the bounds of `[0, x]`. My goal is to determine `f(x)`, which represents the count of distinct integers the frog can reach within that interval `[0, x]`. Finally, I need to sum `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n\nSo, `f(x)` is the cardinality of the set of reachable states given the interval `[0,x]`. This feels like a reachability problem on a graph where the nodes are the integers within the interval, and the edges represent the possible jumps. Each path must satisfy the constraint of remaining in range.\n\nI'm thinking that any reachable number will be of the form `k*a - l*b`, where `k` and `l` are non-negative integers.  This means all reachable positions must be multiples of the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. Let's say `g = gcd(a, b)`.  Then the reachable positions are of the form `c*g` where `c` is a non-negative integer. But here is the catch, not every number of this form is reachable. Because it all depends on staying in range. So my idea is to use a `reachable[]` array to mark reachable positions.\n\nNow, if a number `p` is reachable, then `p + a` is reachable (provided it's within the bounds), and `p - b` is also reachable (if it's non-negative). This suggests a breadth-first search or dynamic programming approach might be suitable. I'll need to explore different reachable positions by considering the effects of adding `a` or subtracting `b` from a current state, ensuring all intermediate steps adhere to the `[0, x]` constraint. I can start at `0` and use the available jump actions to discover all reachable positions within the given range.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0` using jumps `+a` and `-b`, such that all intermediate positions on any path to a reachable integer must stay within `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any reachable position `P` must be a multiple of `g`. We can divide `a, b, x` by `g` and multiply the final `f(x)` by `g` (this is not quite right, `f(x)` is the count, not the value). Actually, if we reach `P` in `[0, x]`, then `P/g` is reachable in `[0, x/g]` with jumps `+a/g` and `-b/g`. The number of reachable points `f(x)` will be `f'(floor(x/g))`, where `f'` is for `a/g, b/g`. So, we can simplify `a, b` by dividing by `g`. After this, `gcd(a, b) = 1`. This simplifies analysis without affecting the problem logic. Let's assume `gcd(a, b) = 1` from now on.\n\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum maximum position encountered on a path from `0` to `r*a` (modulo `b`).\nMore precisely, `dist[r]` stores the minimum possible `max_val` such that `r*a` is reachable and all intermediate positions `p` on the path satisfy `0 <= p <= max_val`.\nWe are interested in positions `P` that are multiples of `g`.\nLet's define `dist[k]` as the minimum maximum value encountered on a path from `0` to `k` *if `k` is reachable*. If `k` is not reachable, `dist[k] = infinity`.\nThe starting position `0` has `dist[0] = 0`.\nWe can use a Dijkstra-like algorithm to find `dist[k]` for all `k`. The states are `k` in `[0, max(a, b)]` (or `[0, b-1]` if we consider modulo `b`).\n\nLet `dist[k]` be the minimum `max_path_val` to reach `k`.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[j] = infinity` for `j != 0`.\nUse a min-priority queue `pq` initialized with `(0, 0)`.\n\nWhen extracting `(current_max_val, u)` from `pq`:\nIf `current_max_val > dist[u]`, continue (already found a better path).\n\n1.  **Jump `+a`:**\n    `v = u + a`.\n    `new_max_val = max(current_max_val, v)`.\n    If `new_max_val < dist[v]`:\n        `dist[v] = new_max_val`.\n        Push `(new_max_val, v)` to `pq`.\n\n2.  **Jump `-b`:**\n    `v = u - b`.\n    `new_max_val = current_max_val`. (This jump decreases value, so `max_path_val` doesn't increase)\n    If `v < 0`, this jump is invalid.\n    If `new_max_val < dist[v]`:\n        `dist[v] = new_max_val`.\n        Push `(new_max_val, v)` to `pq`.\n\nThe state space for `u` can be very large. However, we are interested in reachable points `P` where `P >= 0`.\nAny reachable `P` can be written as `k*a - l*b`.\nIf `gcd(a, b) = 1`, then any sufficiently large integer can be represented as `k*a - l*b`.\nThe values `dist[k]` will eventually stabilize. We only need to compute `dist[k]` up to `max(a, b) + b` or so.\nThe maximum value `x` can be `10^9`, `a, b` up to `10^5`.\nThe values `dist[k]` can go up to `m`.\nThe crucial observation is that once we reach a state `k` with `dist[k] <= k`, we can reach `k+a` with `max_path_val = max(dist[k], k+a)`.\nIf `dist[k] <= k`, then `k` is reachable without exceeding `k` itself.\nConsider states modulo `b`. Let `min_max_val[r]` be the minimum `max_path_val` to reach any `P` such that `P % b = r`.\nThis is a standard shortest path problem on a graph with `b` nodes (0 to `b-1`).\nEdges: `u -> (u+a)%b` with weight `u+a`. (This is not quite right, the weight should be `u+a` if `u+a` is the new max, or `0` if `u+a` is not the new max and it's less than `u`).\n\nLet `dp[r]` be the minimum `max_path_val` to reach *any* number `P` such that `P \\equiv r \\pmod b` and `P \\ge 0`.\nInitialize `dp[0] = 0`, `dp[r] = infinity` for `r \\ne 0`.\nUse a `0-1` BFS / Dijkstra: a `deque` is suitable since edge weights are either `0` (for `-b` jump) or `a` (for `+a` jump, potentially increasing the max).\nActually, the edge weights are not fixed. `max(current_max_val, v)` is not a fixed edge weight.\nThis is a Dijkstra problem where the \"cost\" is `max_path_val`.\n\nLet `max_reach[k]` be the minimum `M` such that `k` is reachable and all intermediate points are in `[0, M]`.\n`max_reach[0] = 0`.\nInitialize `max_reach[i] = infinity` for `i > 0`.\nUse a `min-priority queue` storing `(M, k)`.\n`pq.push((0, 0))`.\n\nWhile `pq` is not empty:\n  `M, k = pq.pop_min()`\n  If `M > max_reach[k]`, continue.\n\n  1. Try `k+a`:\n     `next_k = k+a`\n     `next_M = max(M, next_k)`\n     If `next_M < max_reach[next_k]`:\n       `max_reach[next_k] = next_M`\n       `pq.push((next_M, next_k))`\n\n  2. Try `k-b`:\n     `next_k = k-b`\n     If `next_k >= 0`:\n       `next_M = M` (since `k-b <= k`, `max_path_val` doesn't increase)\n       If `next_M < max_reach[next_k]`:\n         `max_reach[next_k] = next_M`\n         `pq.push((next_M, next_k))`\n\nThe state space for `k` can be large.\nHowever, once `k >= b`, jumping `k-b` is always possible and reduces `k` by `b`.\nThe states we actually care about are `k` such that `max_reach[k]` is relevant.\nIf `max_reach[k] < k`, it means we can reach `k` without going as high as `k` itself.\nThis Dijkstra will find `max_reach[k]` for all `k`. The maximum `k` we need to compute this for is `m`.\nBut `m` can be `10^9`. This Dijkstra is too slow.\n\nKey Insight:\nThe values `max_reach[k]` will be non-decreasing for `k >= 0`.\nFor `k > b`, if we reach `k` with `max_reach[k]`, we can also reach `k-b` with `max_reach[k-b] = min(max_reach[k-b], max_reach[k])`.\nConsider `max_reach[k]` for `k \\in [0, b-1]`.\nWe can use Dijkstra on `b` states `0, \\dots, b-1`.\nLet `dp[r]` be the minimum `max_path_val` to reach *any* number `P` such that `P \\equiv r \\pmod b` and `P \\ge 0`.\nInitialize `dp[0] = 0`, `dp[r] = infinity` for `r \\ne 0`.\nUsing a `deque` for `0-1` BFS:\n`deque.append((0, 0))` (cost, remainder)\n\nWhile `deque` is not empty:\n  `cost, r = deque.popleft()`\n  If `cost > dp[r]`, continue.\n\n  1. Try `+a`:\n     `next_r = (r + a) % b`\n     `P_current = cost` (the value `cost` is the `max_path_val` to reach some `P` such that `P%b=r`)\n     `P_next = P_current + a` (this is not right)\n     The value `cost` is the maximum value *on a path* to some `P` such that `P \\equiv r \\pmod b`.\n     Let `P_r` be such a value. We jump `+a` to `P_r+a`. The new max_path_val is `max(cost, P_r+a)`.\n     This is not a fixed edge weight.\n\nThe values `max_reach[k]` for `k \\in [0, b+a]` are important.\nLet's use the `max_reach[k]` definition for `k` up to `b + a`.\n`max_reach` array of size `b + a + 1`.\n\n```python\nimport collections\nimport heapq\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    # If g > 1, we can scale a, b, and m.\n    # The actual reachable points are multiples of g.\n    # If we find f_prime(x_prime) for a_prime, b_prime, then f(x) = f_prime(floor(x/g)).\n    # The sum becomes sum_{i=0}^m f_prime(floor(i/g)).\n    # This sum can be rewritten as:\n    # f_prime(0) * g + f_prime(1) * g + ... + f_prime(X) * g + f_prime(X+1) * (m % g + 1)\n    # where X = floor(m/g) - 1.\n    # Let's adjust a, b, m.\n    # a_orig, b_orig = a, b\n    # a //= g\n    # b //= g\n    # m_prime = m // g # this is not correct for f(i) = f_prime(floor(i/g))\n\n    # Let's compute f(i) directly with original a, b, then scale if needed.\n    # The problem statement implies a, b are the original values.\n    # The actual set of reachable numbers is always multiples of g.\n    # So f(i) will always be 0 if i < g and no multiple of g is reachable (except 0).\n    # If g > 1, f(i) = f_orig(floor(i/g)) where f_orig is for a/g, b/g.\n    # So, sum_{i=0}^m f(i) = sum_{i=0}^m f_orig(floor(i/g)).\n    # This can be grouped:\n    # For k = 0, ..., floor(m/g):\n    #   f_orig(k) appears (g times) if k*g <= m and (k+1)*g-1 <= m.\n    #   Specifically, for values i from k*g to min(m, (k+1)*g - 1), floor(i/g) = k.\n    #   So f_orig(k) contributes (min(m, (k+1)*g - 1) - k*g + 1) * f_orig(k).\n    # This means we should compute f_orig for a/g, b/g up to m/g and then sum.\n    \n    # Let's compute for a_prime = a/g, b_prime = b/g.\n    # Then we will sum f_prime(k) * (number of i s.t. floor(i/g) = k).\n    \n    a_orig, b_orig = a, b\n    a //= g\n    b //= g\n    \n    # max_val_to_reach[k] stores the minimum maximum position encountered on a path from 0 to k\n    # such that k is reachable.\n    # We only care about k up to some limit.\n    # The maximum value that max_reach[k] can take is m.\n    # The maximum value of k we need to consider is roughly a+b.\n    # If k > a+b, max_reach[k] will be k itself or some smaller value.\n    # The states in Dijkstra are actual positions.\n    # max_reach array up to max_idx.\n    max_idx = a + b + 5 # A sufficiently large value for k where the pattern stabilizes\n                        # max(a, b) is too small, we need to consider up to a+b.\n                        # Maybe 2*b?
