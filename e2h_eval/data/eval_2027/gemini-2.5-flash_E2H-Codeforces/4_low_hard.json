The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing the Rock-Paper-Scissors Loss Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to figure out how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose in this Rock-Paper-Scissors scenario. The real kicker is that *n* can be gargantuan, meaning brute-force simulation is out of the question. I need something clever.\n\nThinking it through, the core challenge is the sheer size of *n*.  I need to exploit the cyclic nature of the players' strategies. Nikephoros's sequence, *A*, repeats every *m* moves, and Polycarpus's sequence, *B*, repeats every *k* moves.  Therefore, the combined state of their moves will also eventually cycle.\n\nThe key insight is that this combined cycle length will be the least common multiple (LCM) of *m* and *k*.  I can efficiently calculate this LCM. Importantly, since *m* and *k* are at most 1000, the LCM (and therefore the cycle length) will be manageable - at most a million rounds. That's the breakthrough!\n\nMy plan now is:\n\n1.  **Find the Cycle:** Calculate `L = lcm(m, k)`.\n2.  **Analyze a Single Cycle:**  Iterate through this cycle,  *L* rounds. In each round, I can determine the winner (and thus, who loses) based on the moves from the sequences *A* and *B*.  I'll keep a running tally of Nikephoros's losses (`n_losses_cycle`) and Polycarpus's losses (`p_losses_cycle`) within this cycle.\n3.  **Scale Up:**  Figure out how many full cycles fit into the total *n* rounds. Calculate the total losses for these full cycles by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of cycles.\n4.  **Handle the Remainder:** If there are any remaining rounds (less than *L*), I'll simulate those rounds explicitly and add the losses to the total.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.  By focusing on the cyclic behavior, I can drastically reduce the computational complexity from O(*n*) to O(*lcm(m,k)*), which is perfectly feasible given the constraints.  I'm ready to translate this into some Python code.\n",
