She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Browser\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem in competitive programming, and my goal is to come up with a Python script for it. The core of it is minimizing the time to close tabs outside a range `[l, r]`. I've got `n` tabs initially, and the cursor is at position `pos`.\n\nLet's break down the operations and their costs: Moving the cursor left or right costs 1 second each. Closing tabs to the left or right, that's also 1 second. The minimum and maximum *unclosed* tab indices are `a` and `b`. Initially, those are `1` and `n`.\n\nNow, the target is to only have tabs `[l, r]` remaining. This means closing `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\n\nI see some clear cases here:\n\n*   **Case 1: No work needed.** If `l = 1` and `r = n`, all tabs are already in the desired range. The answer is obviously 0.\n\n*   **Case 2: Just the left needs closing.** If `l > 1` and `r = n`, I need to close `[1, l-1]`. I have to figure out the best position of the cursor to reach `[1, l-1]` at the smallest cost. If the cursor is already at or past `l`, then closing those to the left is an operation of 1 second. Else, I've got to move to `l` and then I close.\n\n*   **Case 3: Just the right needs closing.** The other scenario, when `l = 1` and `r < n`, requires closing tabs `[r+1, n]`. Similar to the previous one, if the cursor is at or before `r`, the closing operation can be applied with cost 1. Else, I move to `r` and then I close.\n\nOkay, I think I have a general approach now. Let me refine this and write the code...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We start with `n` tabs, and the cursor is at `pos`.\n\nLet's analyze the operations and the goal:\n- We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (the left segment) if `l > 1`.\n- We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]` (the right segment) if `r < n`.\n- Each move of the cursor (left or right) costs 1 second.\n- Each closing operation (close all tabs to the left of the cursor, or close all tabs to the right of the cursor) costs 1 second.\n\nWe need to consider a few distinct cases based on which segments need to be closed:\n\n**Case 1: No tabs need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l = 1` and `r = n`. In this situation, the desired range `[1, n]` covers all initial tabs, so no tabs need to be closed.\nThe time taken is `0`.\n\n**Case 2: Only the left segment needs to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r = n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\nTo close tabs `[1, l-1]`, the cursor must be at tab `l` or to its right. Once the cursor is at `k >= l`, we can perform a \"close tabs to the left\" operation. This operation will close all tabs `[1, l-1]` (since `a` would be `1` initially, or `l` after closing `[1, l-1]` if `pos` was `l` and `a` was `1`).\n- If `pos >= l`: The cursor is already at or to the right of `l`. We just need 1 second for the \"close left\" operation.\n- If `pos < l`: The cursor needs to move from `pos` to `l`. This takes `l - pos` seconds. Then, 1 second for the \"close left\" operation.\nTotal time: `(l - pos) + 1` if `pos < l`, or `1` if `pos >= l`. This can be compactly written as `max(0, l - pos) + 1`.\n\n**Case 3: Only the right segment needs to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l = 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\nTo close tabs `[r+1, n]`, the cursor must be at tab `r` or to its left. Once the cursor is at `k <= r`, we can perform a \"close tabs to the right\" operation. This operation will close all tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n- If `pos <= r`: The cursor is already at or to the left of `r`. We just need 1 second for the \"close right\" operation.\n- If `pos > r`: The cursor needs to move from `pos` to `r`. This takes `pos - r` seconds. Then, 1 second for the \"close right\" operation.\nTotal time: `(pos - r) + 1` if `pos > r`, or `1` if `pos <= r`. This can be compactly written as `max(0, pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Case 4: Both left and right segments need to be closed.**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` AND `[r+1, n]`.\nWe must perform two closing operations: one for the left segment and one for the right segment. Each closing operation costs 1 second. So, there will be at least 2 seconds for closing.\nThe cursor must visit `l` (or a tab to its right) to close the left segment, and `r` (or a tab to its left) to close the right segment.\nThe path the cursor takes will involve moving to `l` (or `r`), performing a close operation, then moving to `r` (or `l`), and performing the other close operation.\n\nLet's analyze the path:\n1.  **Cursor starts at `pos`**.\n2.  **Option A: Close left first, then right.**\n    - Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)`.\n    - Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n    - Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `abs(l - r)`.\n    - Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n    Total time for Option A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`.\n3.  **Option B: Close right first, then left.**\n    - Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)`.\n    - Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n    - Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `abs(r - l)`.\n    - Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n    Total time for Option B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThe minimum time for Case 4 is `min(Option A, Option B)`.\nThis simplifies to `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nLet's summarize the logic:\n\n1.  Read `n, pos, l, r`.\n2.  Initialize `ans = 0`.\n3.  **Check if `l > 1` (left segment needs closing):**\n    If `l > 1`:\n        `ans += 1` (for the close operation itself).\n        If `pos > l`: `ans += (pos - l)` (move cursor left to `l`).\n4.  **Check if `r < n` (right segment needs closing):**\n    If `r < n`:\n        If `l > 1` (both segments need closing):\n            This is the tricky part. The current `ans` includes the cost of moving to `l` and closing the left segment. If we also need to close the right segment, we need to move from `l` to `r` and close the right segment.\n            The total cost for `l > 1` and `r < n` is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n            Let's calculate this directly:\n            `ans = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n        Else (`l = 1`, only right segment needs closing):\n            `ans += 1` (for the close operation itself).\n            If `pos < r`: `ans += (r - pos)` (move cursor right to `r`).\n            Else if `pos > r`: `ans += (pos - r)` (move cursor left to `r`).\n            This simplifies to `max(0, pos - r) + 1`.\n\nLet's refine the logic to handle all cases cleanly:\n\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nans = 0\n\n# Case 1: No tabs to close\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    ans = 0\n# Case 2: Only left segment needs closing (r == n)\nelif r == n:\n    # Need to close [1, l-1]\n    # Move cursor to l, then close\n    ans = abs(pos - l) + 1 \n# Case 3: Only right segment needs closing (l == 1)\nelif l == 1:\n    # Need to close [r+1, n]\n    # Move cursor to r, then close\n    ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n# Case 4: Both left and right segments need closing\nelse: # l > 1 and r < n\n    # We need 2 close operations (+2 seconds)\n    # We need to traverse the segment [l, r]\n    # The cursor starts at pos.\n    # It must reach l and r.\n    \n    # Option 1: Move to l, close left, then move to r, close right\n    # Cost: abs(pos - l) + 1 (close left) + abs(l - r) + 1 (close right)\n    cost1 = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    \n    # Option 2: Move to r, close right, then move to l, close left\n    # Cost: abs(pos - r) + 1 (close right) + abs(r - l) + 1 (close left)\n    cost2 = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n    \n    ans = min(cost1, cost2)\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\nLet's test with examples:\nInput: `6 3 2 4`\n`n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`\nThis is Case 4 (`l > 1` and `r < n`).\n`cost1 = abs(3 - 2) + 1 + (4 - 2) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5`\n`cost2 = abs(3 - 4) + 1 + (4 - 2) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5`\n`ans = min(5, 5) = 5`. Correct.\n\nInput: `6 3 1 3`\n`n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3`\nThis is Case 3 (`l = 1` and `r < n`).\n`ans = abs(pos - r) + 1 = abs(3 - 3) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\nInput: `5 2 1 5`\n`n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5`\nThis is Case 1 (`l = 1` and `r = n`).\n`ans = 0`. Correct.\n\nConsider an edge case for Case 2 and 3:\n`n=10, pos=1, l=5, r=10`\nThis is Case 2 (`r == n`).\n`ans = abs(pos - l) + 1 = abs(1 - 5) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.\nCorrect. Move 1->2->3->4->5 (4 moves), then close left (1 move). Total 5.\n\n`n=10, pos=10, l=1, r=5`\nThis is Case 3 (`l == 1`).\n`ans = abs(pos - r) + 1 = abs(10 - 5) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6`.\nCorrect. Move 10->9->8->7->6->5 (5 moves), then close right (1 move). Total 6.\n\nThe logic seems solid. The `max(0, ...)` simplification for Case 2 and 3 is implicitly handled by `abs(pos - target) + 1`. If `pos` is already at `target`, `abs(pos - target)` is 0, so it correctly adds only 1 for the close operation.\n\nFinal check on the `if/elif/else` structure:\n- `l == 1 and r == n` is handled first.\n- `r == n` (and `l != 1` because of the first check) is handled next.\n- `l == 1` (and `r != n` because of the first check) is handled next.\n- The `else` branch correctly covers `l > 1 and r < n`.\nThe order is correct and covers all possibilities without overlap.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed.\n    # This happens if the desired range [l, r] is already [1, n].\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        ans = 0\n    # Case 2: Only the right segment needs to be closed (l is 1, r < n).\n    # We need to close tabs [r+1, n].\n    # Cursor must move to r, then perform a close right operation.\n    elif l == 1:\n        ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    # Case 3: Only the left segment needs to be closed (l > 1, r is n).\n    # We need to close tabs [1, l-1].\n    # Cursor must move to l, then perform a close left operation.\n    elif r == n:\n        ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    # Case 4: Both left and right segments need to be closed (l > 1, r < n).\n    # We need to close tabs [1, l-1] AND [r+1, n].\n    # This requires two close operations (+2 seconds).\n    # The cursor must visit both l and r.\n    # The path involves moving from pos to one end (l or r),\n    # performing a close, then moving to the other end, and performing the second close.\n    else:\n        # Option A: Go to 'l', close left, then go to 'r', close right.\n        # Cost: (moves from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + (moves from l to r) + 1 (close right)\n        cost_via_l_then_r = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        \n        # Option B: Go to 'r', close right, then go to 'l', close left.\n        # Cost: (moves from pos to r) + 1 (close right) + (moves from r to l) + 1 (close left)\n        cost_via_r_then_l = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        \n        ans = min(cost_via_l_then_r, cost_via_r_then_l)\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
