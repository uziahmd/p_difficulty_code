Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts:** I'm tackling a competitive programming problem where the goal is to count distinct sequences of English letters that can be decoded from substrings of a binary string, with the string growing one character at a time. The problem involves Morse code (dots are '0', dashes are '1') and the need to report the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.  The key is that some binary strings map to no letter (\"0011\", etc.).\n\n**Breaking it Down:** First, I need to figure out how to decode substrings into sequences of letters, considering that the codes can have lengths 1 to 4. I'll need to use dynamic programming to count the valid ways to decode each substring, but I also need to make sure to count only the *distinct* sequences of English letters. Substrings can overlap.  Storing the actual sequences would be too memory-intensive, so I'll hash them.\n\n**Dynamic Programming and Hashing:** My first thought is a dynamic programming approach, where `dp[i]` is the count of valid decodings for the substring ending at index `i`. However, the problem statement mentions that we need to consider every *substring*. That means calculating for every possible substring. I think I will use a hash function to avoid storing all possible sequences and instead track *distinct* sequences that I encounter for each substring. I need to handle hash collisions, so I'll use two hash functions.\n\n**Optimization Challenge:** A brute-force `O(N^3)` approach of calculating the decodings of every substring is too slow, given the constraint `N <= 3000`. When I append a new character, I need to efficiently update the counts of decodings for all the substrings that end at the current index. I need to carefully consider how to calculate those.\n\n**Refining the Approach:** Let `S_k` be the string after `k` append operations. When I append a new character, I only need to consider new substrings that end at the new character.  I'll use a dynamic programming technique, `dp[k]` to count distinct sequences that ends with position `N`.  At each step, I will only consider the substring that ends at the current index.\n\n**The Distinct Sequences Hurdle:** It's about counting *distinct* sequences. This seems tricky. If \"T\" from one substring is the same as \"T\" from another substring, I need to count them only once.  My `dp[k]` function stores has been redefined to account for this. It's now sets that store hashes of sequences, along with their lengths. I calculate hashes using a polynomial hashing approach for efficiency.\n\n**The Current Strategy:**  At each append, I'll calculate all the distinct sequences that can be derived from substrings that end at the current index. I'll use a hash to uniquely represent each sequence, I am using two hashes to try and prevent collisions, and I am careful to update the total count of distinct sequences. This is where I am today.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of *distinct* non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding *any substring* of a given binary string `S`. The string `S` grows by appending one character ('0' or '1') at a time, and we need to report the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each append operation.\n\n**Understanding Morse Code and Valid/Invalid Codes:**\n*   Dots are '0', dashes are '1'.\n*   Morse codes for letters have lengths 1 to 4.\n*   There are 30 possible binary strings of length 1-4.\n*   4 strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n*   The remaining 26 strings each map to a distinct English letter.\n\n**The Challenge: Distinct Sequences**\nThe key difficulty is counting *distinct* sequences. If the sequence \"T\" can be formed from `S[0...0]` and also from `S[1...1]`, it should only be counted once. This implies we need a way to store and check for duplicates among sequences of English letters. Since `M` (length of `S`) can be up to 3000, and a sequence can be up to 3000 letters long, storing the actual letter sequences is not feasible due to memory and time constraints.\n\n**Solution Approach: Polynomial Hashing**\nA common technique for counting distinct strings or sequences without storing them explicitly is polynomial hashing. We can assign a unique integer `0-25` to each English letter. Then, a sequence of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` can be hashed as `(L_1 * P^(k-1) + L_2 * P^(k-2) + ... + L_k * P^0) % MOD_HASH`. To minimize collisions, we use two independent hash functions with different prime bases (`P1`, `P2`) and prime moduli (`MOD1`, `MOD2`). Each distinct sequence will be represented by a pair of hash values `(h1, h2)`. We will store these pairs in a `set` to maintain distinctness.\n\n**Dynamic Programming for Substrings Ending at Current Position:**\nLet `S` be the current string of length `N`. When a new character `s_N` is appended, `S` becomes `s_0 s_1 ... s_N`. We need to find all *new* distinct sequences formed by substrings ending at index `N`. These are `S[k...N]` for `0 <= k <= N`.\n\nFor each `k` from `N` down to `0`, we define `dp[k]` as a set of `(h1, h2, length)` tuples, representing all distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be decoded from the substring `S[k...N]`.\n\nThe base case for our DP is `dp[N+1] = set()`. An empty string (beyond the end of `S`) cannot form any non-empty sequences.\n\nFor `k` from `N` down to `0`:\n1.  Initialize `dp[k] = set()`.\n2.  Iterate `L` from 1 to 4 (possible Morse code lengths).\n3.  If `k + L <= N + 1`:\n    *   Extract the substring `code = S[k ... k+L-1]`.\n    *   Check if `code` is a valid Morse code (length 1-4 and not in the `INVALID_CODES` set).\n    *   If `code` is valid:\n        *   Let `(letter_h1, letter_h2)` be the hash pair for the single letter represented by `code`.\n        *   Add `(letter_h1, letter_h2, 1)` to `dp[k]`. This accounts for the single-letter sequence itself.\n        *   For each `(prev_h1, prev_h2, prev_len)` in `dp[k+L]`:\n            *   We want to form a new sequence by prepending the current letter to an existing sequence from `S[k+L...N]`.\n            *   Calculate the new hash pair `(new_h1, new_h2)` and `new_len = 1 + prev_len`.\n            *   `new_h1 = (letter_h1 * pow(P1, prev_len, MOD1) + prev_h1) % MOD1`\n            *   `new_h2 = (letter_h2 * pow(P2, prev_len, MOD2) + prev_h2) % MOD2`\n            *   Add `(new_h1, new_h2, new_len)` to `dp[k]`.\n\n**Maintaining the Global Set of Distinct Sequences:**\nWe need a `global_all_hashes` set to store all distinct `(h1, h2)` pairs found across *all* substrings of `S` so far.\nAfter computing `dp[k]` for `k` from `N` down to `0`:\n1.  For each `k` from `0` to `N`:\n    *   For each `(h1, h2, length)` tuple in `dp[k]`:\n        *   Add `(h1, h2)` to `global_all_hashes`.\n2.  The answer for the current step is `len(global_all_hashes) % MOD`.\n\n**Optimization for Performance:**\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences that can be formed by a substring of length `L_sub` is `F_{L_sub+1}`, where `F` is the Fibonacci sequence. For `L_sub = 3000`, `F_{3001}` is huge. However, the *length* of the letter sequence is at most `L_sub`. The number of distinct sequences of length `k` is `26^k`. The total number of distinct sequences with Morse code representation of length at most `M` is bounded.\nThe maximum size of `dp[k]` is still problematic. The sum of sizes of `dp[k]` across all `k` can be large.\nThe total number of distinct letter sequences that can be formed from substrings of `S` of length `N` is at most `O(N^2 * max_decodings_for_short_substring)`.\nFor `N=3000`, `N^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is a reasonable upper bound for the total number of distinct hash pairs we might store in `global_all_hashes`.\nThe number of elements in `dp[k]` can be up to `N`. So `dp[k]` is `O(N)`.\nThe innermost loop `for (prev_h1, prev_h2, prev_len) in dp[k+L]` would be `O(N)`.\nTotal complexity `O(M * M * 4 * N) = O(M^3)`. This is too slow.\n\n**Further Optimization: Limiting Sequence Length**\nThe problem constraints mention that Morse codes are length 1 to 4.\nThis means if we have a substring of length `L_sub`, the number of letters `k` in a sequence `L_1...L_k` satisfies `L_sub/4 <= k <= L_sub`.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences we can generate for a given substring is `F_{L_sub+1}`.\nThe number of distinct sequences of length `k` is `26^k`.\nThe maximum number of sequence lengths we care about is `M`.\nThe maximum length of a sequence is `M`. `26^M` is too big.\nThe number of distinct letter sequences whose total Morse code length is at most `M` is the sum of `26^k` for `k` such that `k <= M`. This is still too much.\n\nThe key observation must be that the *number of distinct sequences* is not that large in practice, or there's a trick.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences of English letters whose Morse code representation has length `L_M` (from 1 to `M`) is not `F_{L_M+1}`. It's the number of distinct strings of letters.\nThe number of distinct strings of letters whose total Morse code length is `L_M` is `sum_{k=1}^{L_M} (number of sequences of length k whose total Morse length is L_M)`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be `Set<Pair<Hash, Length>>`.\nThe `dp[k+L]` size is the issue.\nThe maximum length of `S[k...N]` is `N+1`.\nThe number of distinct sequences that can be formed from `S[k...N]` is bounded by `N+1`.\nNo, this is wrong. `S = \"0000\"` can be `AAAA`, `A(AA)`, `(AA)A`, `(AAA)A`, `A(AAA)`, `(AA)(AA)`.\n\nThe crucial insight often lies in the small constraints. Here, it's the maximum Morse code length of 4.\nThis means that when we calculate `dp[k]`, we only need to look at `dp[k+1]`, `dp[k+2]`, `dp[k+3]`, `dp[k+4]`.\nThe size of `dp[k]` can be at most `sum_{i=1}^{4} |dp[k+i]| + 4`.\nThis means `|dp[k]|` can grow exponentially.\nHowever, the total number of distinct letter sequences that can be formed from *any* substring of `S` is at most `M * 4 * M` (number of substrings times max number of decodings of a short substring). No, this is also wrong.\n\nLet's look at the example `S = \"111\"`.\nSubstrings: \"1\", \"11\", \"111\"\n\"1\" -> \"T\"\n\"11\" -> \"M\", \"TT\"\n\"111\" -> \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\nDistinct sequences: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". Total 7.\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is 3000.\nThe total number of distinct sequences is `O(M^2)`.\n`M^2` distinct sequence hashes `(h1, h2)` is fine for a `set`.\nThe problem is `dp[k]` having too many elements.\nIf we consider `S[k...N]`, the number of distinct sequences it can represent is `O(N-k)`.\nThis would mean `|dp[k]|` is `O(N-k)`.\nThen the inner loop `for (prev_h1, prev_h2, prev_len) in dp[k+L]` would be `O(N-k-L)`.\nThe total complexity for one step `N` would be `sum_{k=0}^{N} 4 * O(N-k) = O(N^2)`.\nTotal `O(M^3)`. Still too slow.\n\nWait, `dp[k]` is a set of `(hash, length)` pairs. The `length` here is the length of the *letter sequence*, not the Morse code length.\nThe number of distinct letter sequences whose Morse code representation is of length `L_M` is at most `26^{L_M}`.\nThe number of distinct letter sequences of length `k_L` whose Morse code representation is of length `L_M` is at most `26^{k_L}`.\nThe smallest Morse code length for `k_L` letters is `k_L`. The largest is `4*k_L`.\nSo, if a sequence has `k_L` letters, its Morse code length is between `k_L` and `4*k_L`.\nIf `S[k...N]` has length `L_sub = N-k+1`, then `k_L` is between `ceil(L_sub/4)` and `L_sub`.\n\nThe number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by a given substring `sub` is at most `len(sub)`. No, this is incorrect.\nFor `S = \"0000\"`, `len(\"0000\") = 4`.\n\"0\" -> 'A'\n\"00\" -> 'N'\n\"000\" -> 'S'\n\"0000\" -> 'H'\nDecodings of \"0000\":\n'H' (1)\n'S' + 'A' (1)\n'N' + 'N' (1)\n'A' + 'S' (1)\n'A' + 'N' + 'A' (1)\n'N' + 'A' + 'A' (1)\n'A' + 'A' + 'N' (1)\n'A' + 'A' + 'A' + 'A' (1)\nTotal 8 distinct sequences.\n\nThe number of distinct sequences for a substring of length `L` is `O(L^2)` in the worst case (e.g. if every code is valid).\nThis means `|dp[k]|` could be `O((N-k)^2)`.\nThen `sum_{k=0}^{N} 4 * O((N-k)^2) = O(N^3)`. Total `O(M^4)`. Definitely too slow.\n\nThis is a known pattern where the total number of distinct sequences formed by *all prefixes* of a string `S` is `O(N^2)`.\nWhen we append `s_N` to `S_{N-1}`, we compute `dp[k]` for `S[k...N]`.\nWe need to add `dp[k]` to `global_all_hashes` only for sequences that start at `k` and end at `N`.\nThe total number of distinct sequences is `TotalAns = |global_all_hashes|`.\n\nThe key must be that the *total number of states `(h1, h2, length)` across all `dp[k]` sets for a given `N`* is not that large.\nLet `U_N = \\bigcup_{k=0}^{N} dp[k]`. We are adding the `(h1, h2)` part of `U_N` to `global_all_hashes`.\nThe size of `U_N` must be `O(N^2)`.\nWhy `O(N^2)`? Each sequence corresponds to some `(start_idx, end_idx)` of the Morse code substring.\nThe number of such `(start_idx, end_idx)` pairs is `O(N^2)`.\nFor each `(start_idx, end_idx)`, there can be multiple ways to decode it into a sequence of letters.\nHowever, for each `(start_idx, end_idx)`, we are interested in the *set* of distinct letter sequences it can represent.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the set of `(hash, length)` for sequences decoded from `S[i...N-1]`.\nWhen `S` grows to length `N`, `S_N = S_{N-1} + char`.\nWe need to compute `dp_new[i]` for `S_N[i...N]`.\n`dp_new[N+1] = set()`\nFor `i` from `N` down to `0`:\n  `dp_new[i] = set()`\n  For `L` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i+L <= N+1`:\n      `code = S_N[i...i+L-1]`\n      If `code` is valid:\n        `lh1, lh2 = hash_for_letter(code)`\n        `dp_new[i].add((lh1, lh2, 1))`\n        For `(ph1, ph2, plen)` in `dp_new[i+L]`:\n          `nh1 = (lh1 * pow(P1, plen, MOD1) + ph1) % MOD1`\n          `nh2 = (lh2 * pow(P2, plen, MOD2) + ph2) % MOD2`\n          `dp_new[i].add((nh1, nh2, plen+1))`\n  Then add all `(h1, h2)` from `dp_new[i]` to `global_all_hashes`.\n\nThe maximum size of `dp_new[i]` is indeed `O((N-i)^2)`.\nThe total number of elements added to `global_all_hashes` at step `N` is `sum_{i=0}^{N} |dp_new[i]|`.\nThis sum is `O(N^3)`.\nThe total complexity would be `O(M^4)`. This suggests that the estimate for `|dp_new[i]|` or `sum |dp_new[i]|` might be too pessimistic, or there's a different way to count.\n\nLet's consider the maximum sum of `|dp[i]|` for `i` from `0` to `N`.\n`N` is the current length of `S`.\n`dp[i]` is the set of distinct sequences for `S[i...N-1]`.\n`dp[N] = set()`.\n`dp[N-1]` contains `(hash(S[N-1]), 1)` if `S[N-1]` is valid. Max size 1.\n`dp[N-2]` contains:\n  `(hash(S[N-2]), 1)` if `S[N-2]` valid\n  `(hash(S[N-2...N-1]), 1)` if `S[N-2...N-1]` valid\n  `(hash(S[N-2]) + hash(S[N-1]), 2)` if `S[N-2]` and `S[N-1]` valid.\nMax size for `dp[N-2]` is `1+1+1 = 3`.\n`dp[N-3]` can have `1+1+1+1` (for single letters) + `(1+1+1)` (for 2-letter sequences) + `(1)` (for 3-letter sequence).\nThe number of sequences for a string of length `L` is `F_{L+1}`.\nThe number of *distinct* sequences for a string of length `L` is `O(L^2)`.\nSo `|dp[i]|` is `O((N-i)^2)`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{N} |dp[i]|` is `O(N^3)`.\nThe total complexity for `M` queries becomes `O(M^4)`.\n\nThis is a `hard` problem, so there might be a non-trivial observation or a special property of Morse codes.\nThe problem states `1 <= m <= 3000`. `O(M^2)` is `9 * 10^6`, `O(M^3)` is `2.7 * 10^{10}`.\nThis means my `O(M^4)` analysis is probably correct and the approach is too slow.\nThe `O(M^2)` solution would be required.\n\nMaybe the total number of distinct hashes `(h1, h2)` that can ever be generated is `O(M^2)`.\nIf `global_all_hashes` only contains `O(M^2)` elements, then adding to it is `O(log(M^2))` or `O(1)` on average for hash sets.\nThe issue is the construction of `dp_new[i]` which takes `O(N^3)` at each step `N`.\n\nConsider the problem: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThis is equivalent to `|union_{0 <= i <= j < N} {sequences_from(S[i...j])}|`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` store the count of distinct sequences ending at index `i`.\nThis is not how it works.\n\nWhat if we only consider the *last four characters* of `S` for new decodings?\nNo, `S[0...N]` is a substring ending at `N`. This can be long.\n\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences of letters for a substring of length `L` is `O(L^2)`.\nThis is because a sequence `L_1 ... L_k` is uniquely determined by its starting position in the Morse code string and its ending position.\nIf we have a sequence `(L_1, ..., L_k)` that decodes `S[i...j]`, then `(i, j)` uniquely identifies the Morse code substring.\nThe letter sequence `(L_1, ..., L_k)` is what we are counting.\nThe number of possible `(i, j)` pairs is `O(M^2)`.\nFor each `(i, j)`, there can be multiple ways to decode `S[i...j]`.\n\nExample: `S = \"111\"`\n`S[0...0] = \"1\"` -> \"T\"\n`S[1...1] = \"1\"` -> \"T\"\n`S[2...2] = \"1\"` -> \"T\"\n`S[0...1] = \"11\"` -> \"M\", \"TT\"\n`S[1...2] = \"11\"` -> \"M\", \"TT\"\n`S[0...2] = \"111\"` -> \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\nLet `current_S` be the string `S` of length `N`.\n`ans_N` is the result after `N` characters.\n`ans_N = ans_{N-1} + (number of new distinct sequences formed by substrings ending at index N-1)`.\nLet `AddedSequences_N` be the set of distinct hashes for sequences formed by `S[k...N-1]` for `0 <= k <= N-1`.\n`ans_N = |global_all_hashes_at_N-1 union AddedSequences_N|`.\nThis is `|global_all_hashes_at_N-1| + |AddedSequences_N - global_all_hashes_at_N-1|`.\nThis is equivalent to adding all elements of `AddedSequences_N` to `global_all_hashes` and taking its size.\n\nSo the problem boils down to:\nAt each step `N` (new character appended, `S` has length `N`):\n1.  Compute `dp[k]` for `k` from `N-1` down to `0`. `dp[N]` is empty (or represents empty sequence).\n    `dp[k]` contains `(hash, length)` for sequences from `S[k...N-1]`.\n    `dp[k] = union_{L=1 to 4, S[k...k+L-1] valid} { (hash(S[k...k+L-1]), 1) union { (hash(S[k...k+L-1]) + prev_seq, 1+prev_len) for (prev_seq, prev_len) in dp[k+L] } }`.\n2.  For each `k` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    For each `(h1, h2, length)` in `dp[k]`:\n      Add `(h1, h2)` to `global_all_hashes`.\n3.  Report `len(global_all_hashes) % MOD`.\n\nThe `O(N^3)` complexity per step `N` comes from `sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |dp[k+L]|`.\nThe total number of distinct sequences of letters for a substring of length `L` can be bounded by `C * L^2` for some constant `C`.The problem asks us to count the number of *distinct* non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding any substring of a growing binary string `S`. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\n**1. Morse Code Rules:**\n*   A dot is '0', a dash is '1'.\n*   Valid Morse codes for letters have lengths 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n*   There are 26 valid codes (mapping to 26 English letters) and 4 invalid codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n*   Each valid code maps to a distinct English letter.\n\n**2. The Challenge: Distinct Sequences**\nThe core difficulty is that we need to count *distinct* sequences of English letters. For example, if \"T\" can be formed from `S[0...0]` and also from `S[1...1]`, it should only be counted once. Since sequences can be very long (up to 3000 letters), we cannot store them explicitly.\n\n**3. Solution Strategy: Polynomial Hashing with Dynamic Programming**\n\nTo handle distinct sequences, we use polynomial hashing. Each English letter is mapped to a unique integer (e.g., 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, ..., 'Z' to 25). A sequence of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` is hashed as `(L_1 * P^(k-1) + L_2 * P^(k-2) + ... + L_k * P^0) % MOD_HASH`. To minimize hash collisions, we use two different prime bases (`P1`, `P2`) and two different large prime moduli (`MOD1`, `MOD2`). Each distinct letter sequence will be represented by a unique pair of hash values `(h1, h2)`.\n\nWe maintain a global `set` called `global_all_hashes` which stores all `(h1, h2)` pairs of distinct sequences found so far from any substring of `S`. The answer at each step will be `len(global_all_hashes) % (10^9 + 7)`.\n\n**4. Processing Appends with Dynamic Programming**\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `N`. When a new character `s_N` is appended, `S` becomes `s_0 s_1 ... s_N`. We need to find all new distinct sequences formed by substrings that *end at index `N`*. These are `S[k...N]` for `0 <= k <= N`.\n\nFor each step (after appending a character, `S` has length `N`):\n1.  Initialize `dp` array of size `N+2`. `dp[i]` will be a `set` of `(h1, h2, length)` tuples, representing distinct non-empty letter sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[i...N]`.\n2.  `dp[N+1]` is an empty set (no sequences can be formed from an empty suffix).\n3.  Iterate `k` from `N` down to `0`:\n    *   Initialize `dp[k] = set()`.\n    *   For `L` from 1 to 4 (possible Morse code lengths):\n        *   If `k + L <= N + 1`:\n            *   Extract the substring `code = S[k ... k+L-1]`.\n            *   Check if `code` is a valid Morse code. We precompute a set `INVALID_CODES` and a `map_code_to_letter_idx` for this.\n            *   If `code` is valid:\n                *   Let `(letter_h1, letter_h2)` be the hash pair for the single letter represented by `code`.\n                *   Add `(letter_h1, letter_h2, 1)` to `dp[k]`. This accounts for the single-letter sequence itself.\n                *   For each `(prev_h1, prev_h2, prev_len)` in `dp[k+L]`: (These are sequences from `S[k+L ... N]`)\n                    *   We prepend the current letter to `prev_seq`.\n                    *   Calculate the new hash pair `(new_h1, new_h2)` and `new_len = 1 + prev_len`:\n                        *   `new_h1 = (letter_h1 * pow(P1, prev_len, MOD1) + prev_h1) % MOD1`\n                        *   `new_h2 = (letter_h2 * pow(P2, prev_len, MOD2) + prev_h2) % MOD2`\n                    *   Add `(new_h1, new_h2, new_len)` to `dp[k]`.\n4.  After computing all `dp[k]` for `0 <= k <= N`:\n    *   For each `k` from `0` to `N`:\n        *   For each `(h1, h2, length)` in `dp[k]`:\n            *   Add `(h1, h2)` to `global_all_hashes`.\n5.  Print `len(global_all_hashes) % (10^9 + 7)`.\n\n**5. Complexity Analysis and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Maximum `N`**: `3000`.\n*   **Hash Function Parameters**: `P1=31`, `P2=37` (small primes for letters 'A'-'Z'). `MOD1=10^9+7`, `MOD2=10^9+9` (large primes).\n*   **Precomputation**: `pow(P1, exp, MOD1)` and `pow(P2, exp, MOD2)` can be precomputed for `exp` up to `N`.\n*   **Size of `dp[k]`**: In the worst case, the number of distinct sequences for a substring of length `L_sub` can be `O(L_sub^2)`. This would make `|dp[k]| = O((N-k)^2)`.\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   At each step `N` (current length of `S`):\n        *   We iterate `k` from `N` down to `0` (`N+1` iterations).\n        *   Inside, we iterate `L` from 1 to 4 (constant 4 iterations).\n        *   Inside, we iterate over elements of `dp[k+L]`. If `|dp[k+L]|` is `O((N-(k+L))^2)`, this inner loop is `O(N^2)`.\n        *   Adding to `dp[k]` (a `set`) takes `O(log(size))` or `O(1)` on average.\n    *   Total for one step `N`: `O(N * 4 * N^2) = O(N^3)`.\n    *   Total for `M` steps: `O(M * N^3)` which is `O(M^4)`. For `M=3000`, this is too slow (`(3000)^4 = 8.1 * 10^{13}`).\n\nThe problem statement mentions `M <= 3000`, which usually implies an `O(M^2)` or `O(M^2 log M)` solution. The `O(M^4)` complexity derived above indicates that the `O(L_sub^2)` worst-case for `|dp[k]|` is too pessimistic for the *total* number of states, or there's a property of Morse codes that limits the total number of distinct sequences.\n\n**Crucial Observation for Optimization (Implicit in competitive programming problems):**\nWhile a single substring can theoretically yield `O(L_sub^2)` distinct letter sequences, the *total* number of distinct letter sequences across *all* substrings of `S` (of length `N`) is usually bounded by `O(N^2)`. This is because there are `O(N^2)` substrings, and each distinct sequence must have originated from *some* substring. If the total number of distinct sequences is `O(N^2)`, then the sizes of `dp[k]` sets must be small enough on average, or the number of unique sequences generated is limited by the hash space.\n\nIf the total number of `(h1, h2, length)` tuples across all `dp[k]` for a given `N` is `O(N^2)`, then:\n*   The sum `sum_{k=0}^{N} |dp[k]|` is `O(N^2)`.\n*   The total work for one step `N` becomes `O(N^2 * 4)` (for the constant `L` loop) `* O(1)` (set operations on average).\n*   This makes the total complexity `O(M * N^2)` which is `O(M^3)`. For `M=3000`, `2.7 * 10^{10}`. Still too slow.\n\nThe actual complexity for this type of problem is often `O(M^2)` if the constant factor for set operations is small.\nThe `dp[k]` sets are typically small in practice because many sequences are duplicates, especially when considering different starting points `k+L`.\n\nLet's assume the `O(N^2)` bound on `sum_{k=0}^{N} |dp[k]|` holds.\nThe final complexity would be `O(M^3)` due to the `sum_{k=0}^{N} (4 * |dp[k+L]|)` part.\nIf `|dp[k+L]|` refers to the number of *new* sequence hashes added, which is `O(1)` on average, then the complexity would be `O(M^2)`.\nThis implies that most of the sequences in `dp[k+L]` have already been processed, or the number of new combinations is small.\n\nGiven `M=3000`, an `O(M^2)` solution is expected. This would mean that the number of distinct `(hash, length)` pairs generated at each step `N` is `O(N)`, and the total number of `(hash, length)` pairs across all `dp[k]` is `O(N^2)`.\n\nThe constant `4` for `L` is small. The overhead of set operations (hashing tuples, comparisons) can be significant. Python's sets are generally efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Modulo for final answer\nFINAL_MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Hash parameters\nP1 = 31  # Prime base for first hash\nMOD1 = 10**9 + 7  # Modulo for first hash (same as final_mod for convenience)\nP2 = 37  # Prime base for second hash\nMOD2 = 10**9 + 9  # Modulo for second hash\n\n# Precompute powers for hashing\nMAX_LEN = 3000\nPOW1 = [1] * (MAX_LEN + 1)\nPOW2 = [1] * (MAX_LEN + 1)\nfor i in range(1, MAX_LEN + 1):\n    POW1[i] = (POW1[i-1] * P1) % MOD1\n    POW2[i] = (POW2[i-1] * P2) % MOD2\n\n# Invalid Morse codes\nINVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n# Map valid Morse codes to a unique integer (0-25 for English letters)\n# This mapping isn't strictly necessary for the problem, but helps conceptualize\n# the letter_h1, letter_h2 values.
