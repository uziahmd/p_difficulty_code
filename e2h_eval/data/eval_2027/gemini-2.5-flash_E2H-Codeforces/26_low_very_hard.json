    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Triangle Counting Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to count non-degenerate triangles. I've got integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z`, and they're bounded by these ranges: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`. The critical thing is to remember the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the conditions for a valid triangle.  We have three inequalities to satisfy:  `x + y > z`, `x + z > y`, and `y + z > x`.  Given the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, I can deduce some important facts. `x <= y` and `y <= z`. So, really only `x + y > z` needs to be enforced. Also, I know `x <= B`, `y >= B`. The smallest possible `A` is 1, so the condition `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` are guaranteed as `z` and `y` are bounded `C` and `B` respectively. That leaves me with the main inequality: `x + y > z`.\n\nNow, if I try to implement this naively with three nested loops to check all possible combinations of x, y, and z, the time complexity would be `O((B-A) * (C-B) * (D-C))`. Given the maximum value of `D` is `5 * 10^5`, this would be prohibitively slow. I need a more efficient way to count these triangles. I'll need to optimize this by iterating over `x` and `y`, then determine the valid `z` values.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` satisfying `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the triangle inequalities. For `x, y, z` to form a non-degenerate triangle, they must satisfy:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we can deduce some relationships between `x, y, z`:\n- Since `x <= B` and `B <= y`, it implies `x <= y`.\n- Since `y <= C` and `C <= z`, it implies `y <= z`.\nTherefore, we always have `x <= y <= z`.\n\nWith `x <= y <= z`, the triangle inequalities simplify:\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, we have `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= C >= 1`, we have `y + z >= x + 1 > x`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n\nSo, the only remaining condition is `x + y > z`.\n\nThus, we need to count integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `z < x + y`\n\nLet's iterate over `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C`. For each pair `(x, y)`, we need to find the number of `z` values that satisfy `C <= z <= D` and `z < x + y`.\nThe upper bound for `z` is `min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe lower bound for `z` is `C`.\nSo, for a given `(x, y)`, the number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive triple loop (or a double loop over `x, y` and calculating `z`) would be too slow given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`. The ranges for `x, y` can be up to `5 * 10^5`, leading to `(5*10^5)^2` operations, which is `2.5 * 10^11`. We need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet `S = x + y`. The condition `z < S` becomes `z <= S - 1`.\nThe range for `z` is `[C, D]`.\nSo for fixed `x, y`, we need to count `z` in `[C, D]` such that `z <= S - 1`.\nThis means `z` must be in `[C, min(D, S - 1)]`.\nThe number of such `z` values is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet's analyze the range of `S = x + y`:\n- Minimum `S`: `A + B` (when `x=A, y=B`)\n- Maximum `S`: `B + C` (when `x=B, y=C`)\nSo `S` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`.\n\nWe can iterate over possible values of `S = x + y`. For each `S`, we need to:\n1. Count how many pairs `(x, y)` exist such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = S`.\n2. For each such `S`, calculate the number of valid `z` values, which is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n3. Multiply the count from step 1 by the count from step 2, and sum these products for all `S`.\n\nLet's precompute the counts of `x` values for `x` in `[A, B]` and `y` values for `y` in `[B, C]`.\nSince `x` and `y` are integers, we can use an array (or frequency map) for this.\n`count_x[i]` = 1 if `A <= i <= B`, else 0.\n`count_y[i]` = 1 if `B <= i <= C`, else 0.\nThis is not quite right. We need to count pairs `(x,y)` that sum to `S`. This is a convolution problem.\n\nLet `freq_x[k]` be 1 if `k` is a valid `x` value (`A <= k <= B`), and 0 otherwise.\nLet `freq_y[k]` be 1 if `k` is a valid `y` value (`B <= k <= C`), and 0 otherwise.\nThe number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = S` is `sum(freq_x[k] * freq_y[S - k])` over all `k`.\n\nWe can compute this efficiently using prefix sums or by iterating through one variable.\nLet `count_S[s]` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = s`, `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\nThe maximum value `D` is `5 * 10^5`. So `S` can go up to `B + C` which is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`.\nWe can compute `count_S` by iterating `x` from `A` to `B`. For each `x`, `y` must be in `[B, C]` and `y = S - x`.\nSo, for a fixed `S`, `x` must satisfy:\n`A <= x <= B`\n`B <= S - x <= C`  => `S - C <= x <= S - B`\n\nCombining these, `x` must be in `[max(A, S - C), min(B, S - B)]`.\nThe number of `x` values for a fixed `S` is `max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`.\nLet `num_xy_sum_S[S]` store this count. We can compute `num_xy_sum_S` for all `S` from `A+B` to `B+C` in `O(B+C)` time.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Create an array `num_xy_sum_S` of size `B + C + 1` (or `2 * D + 1`). Initialize to zeros.\n3. Iterate `x` from `A` to `B`.\n   For each `x`, iterate `y` from `B` to `C`.\n   Increment `num_xy_sum_S[x + y]`.\n   This is still `O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1))`, which is too slow.\n\nA more efficient way to compute `num_xy_sum_S`:\n`num_xy_sum_S[s]` is the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = s`, `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\nFor a fixed `x`, `y` ranges from `B` to `C`. So `x+y` ranges from `x+B` to `x+C`.\nWe can use a difference array / prefix sum technique.\nFor each `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  `num_xy_sum_S[x + B]` increases by 1.\n  `num_xy_sum_S[x + C + 1]` decreases by 1.\nAfter processing all `x`, compute prefix sums on `num_xy_sum_S` to get the actual counts.\nThis takes `O(B-A+1)` for updates and `O(B+C)` for prefix sums.\nMaximum value for `B+C` is `10^6`. This is feasible.\n\nLet's refine the range for `S`: `S` varies from `A+B` to `B+C`.\n`max_S = B + C`.\n`min_S = A + B`.\n\n```python\nMAX_SUM = 2 * 5 * 10**5 + 1 # Max value for B+C is 10^6.\nnum_xy_sum_S_diff = [0] * (MAX_SUM + 2) # Difference array for sum counts\n\n# Populate difference array\nfor x in range(A, B + 1):\n    # For a fixed x, y ranges from B to C.\n    # So x+y ranges from x+B to x+C.\n    num_xy_sum_S_diff[x + B] += 1\n    num_xy_sum_S_diff[x + C + 1] -= 1\n\nnum_xy_sum_S = [0] * (MAX_SUM + 1)\ncurrent_count = 0\nfor s in range(min_S, max_S + 1): # Iterate only over relevant S values\n    current_count += num_xy_sum_S_diff[s]\n    num_xy_sum_S[s] = current_count\n```\nThe range for `s` in the prefix sum step should cover all possible `x+B` and `x+C+1` values.\n`x+B` goes from `A+B` to `B+B`.\n`x+C+1` goes from `A+C+1` to `B+C+1`.\nSo the range for `s` in the prefix sum loop should be `range(0, B + C + 2)`.\nOr more precisely, `range(A+B, B+C+2)`. The smallest index we might access is `A+B`, largest is `B+C+1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # MAX_VAL is D, which is 5 * 10^5.\n    # Max sum x+y can be B+C, which is 5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6.\n    # We need an array up to B+C+1 for the difference array.\n    max_possible_sum = B + C\n    \n    # num_xy_sum_S_diff[s] stores the change in count for sum s\n    # Size needed: up to max_possible_sum + 1 (for the decrement).\n    # Python lists automatically handle size, but pre-allocating is good.\n    num_xy_sum_S_diff = [0] * (max_possible_sum + 2)\n\n    # Calculate counts of (x,y) pairs for each sum S = x+y\n    # For each x in [A, B], y is in [B, C].\n    # This means x+y is in [x+B, x+C].\n    # We use a difference array to efficiently count this.\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        num_xy_sum_S_diff[x + B] += 1\n        num_xy_sum_S_diff[x + C + 1] -= 1\n\n    # Convert difference array to actual counts using prefix sums\n    num_xy_sum_S = [0] * (max_possible_sum + 1)\n    current_count_for_sum = 0\n    # The sums S range from A+B to B+C.\n    # The difference array updates affect indices from A+B up to B+C+1.\n    # So we need to iterate up to B+C+1 to correctly apply all decrements.\n    for s in range(0, max_possible_sum + 2): # Iterating up to max_possible_sum + 1 is enough for prefix sum\n        if s > max_possible_sum: # Prevent out of bounds access for num_xy_sum_S\n            break\n        current_count_for_sum += num_xy_sum_S_diff[s]\n        num_xy_sum_S[s] = current_count_for_sum\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n    # Iterate through possible sums S = x+y\n    # S ranges from A+B to B+C.\n    # For each S, we have num_xy_sum_S[S] pairs of (x,y).\n    # For each such (x,y) pair, we need to count valid z.\n    # z must satisfy C <= z <= D and z < S.\n    # So z must be in [C, min(D, S-1)].\n    # Number of valid z's = max(0, min(D, S-1) - C + 1).\n\n    for S in range(A + B, max_possible_sum + 1):\n        if num_xy_sum_S[S] == 0:\n            continue # No (x,y) pairs sum to S\n\n        # Calculate number of valid z values for this S\n        # z_upper_bound = min(D, S - 1)\n        # z_lower_bound = C\n        \n        # If S-1 < C, then no valid z exists.\n        # This is equivalent to S <= C.\n        # So if S <= C, then min(D, S-1) will be <= S-1 < C.\n        # This would lead to count_z = 0.\n        \n        # The number of valid z is (z_upper_bound - z_lower_bound + 1) if z_upper_bound >= z_lower_bound, else 0.\n        \n        count_z = 0\n        if S - 1 >= C: # Check if there's any overlap between [C, D] and [C, S-1]\n            # The range for z is [C, min(D, S - 1)]\n            z_upper_bound = min(D, S - 1)\n            count_z = z_upper_bound - C + 1\n            \n        if count_z > 0:\n            total_triangles += num_xy_sum_S[S] * count_z\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_triangles) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
