    "thought": "**Algorithm for Finding Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem boils down to finding the lexicographically smallest string we can get by swapping characters under specific rules. We can swap '0' and '1', or '1' and '2', but not '0' and '2'. This means '1's are our wildcard – they can move past anything, while the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n\nMy approach is to first count the '1's. Then, I extract a \"0-2 skeleton\" by removing all the '1's, preserving the relative order of '0's and '2's. Now, the key is to understand where to place those '1's. I want to put as many '0's at the beginning as possible to minimize the lexicographical value. So, any '0' that can move to the front, before any '2', I do it. '1's, being movable, should be inserted after all those movable '0's but before the first '2', if one exists, because placing a '1' before would make the string larger lexicographically. If no '2' exists, I just put all the '1's after all the '0's. This is the optimal placement for '1's to maintain lexicographical minimality. After inserting the '1's, I append the rest of the 0-2 sequence.\n\nIn short, my strategy is to group the '0's that can be moved to the beginning, put the '1's after them, and then add the rest of the '0's and the '2's from the original string in their original order.\n\nThe algorithm iterates through the input string once (O(N)), builds a string of '0's and '2's (O(N)), finds the first '2' (O(N)), and assembles the final string (O(N)). So, the overall time complexity is O(N). I also need space for the new string I'm building, so the space complexity is also O(N). The edge cases are handled correctly - an input with only 0s, 1s, or 2s all work. I'm confident this should produce the lexicographically smallest string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable from a given ternary string by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, and adjacent '1's and '2's. Swapping '0's and '2's is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can swap with an adjacent '1', and vice-versa.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can swap with an adjacent '2', and vice-versa.\n3. '0' <-> '2': Not allowed.\n\nThis set of rules has a crucial implication:\n- A '1' can move past any '0' (by swapping \"01\" <-> \"10\").\n- A '1' can move past any '2' (by swapping \"12\" <-> \"21\").\nThis means that '1's are \"mobile\" and can effectively move through the string, passing '0's and '2's. All '1's can be grouped together and placed at any position in the string, as long as they don't violate other constraints.\n\nThe critical constraint is that '0's and '2's cannot swap. This means their relative order is invariant. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it will always appear before that '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', it will always remain before that '0'.\n\nThis observation simplifies the problem significantly:\n1. The relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n2. All '1's can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's, as a block.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n1. **Separate '1's from '0's and '2's**: Iterate through the input string. Count all occurrences of '1's. Collect all '0's and '2's into a new sequence, maintaining their original relative order. Let this new sequence be `s_02_string`.\n   Example: For \"100210\", `count1 = 2`, `s_02_string = \"0020\"`.\n   Example: For \"11222121\", `count1 = 4`, `s_02_string = \"2222\"`.\n\n2. **Determine the optimal insertion point for '1's**: We have `count1` '1's to insert into `s_02_string`. To make the resulting string lexicographically smallest, we want to:\n   - Put as many '0's as possible at the very beginning. These are the '0's in `s_02_string` that appear before any '2'.\n   - Then, put all the '1's. '1' is smaller than '2', so we should put '1's before any '2's if possible.\n   - Finally, append the remaining '0's and '2's (those '0's that appeared after a '2' in the original string, and all '2's).\n\n   This means the ideal place to insert the block of '1's is right before the *first* '2' in `s_02_string`.\n   - If `s_02_string` contains no '2's (i.e., it's all '0's), then all '0's can come first, followed by all '1's.\n   - If `s_02_string` contains '2's, find the index of the first '2'. Let this be `first_2_idx`.\n     The string will be constructed as:\n     `(part of s_02_string before first '2')` + `('1' repeated count1 times)` + `(part of s_02_string from first '2' onwards)`.\n\nLet's trace \"100210\" with this strategy:\n1. Input `s = \"100210\"`.\n2. `count1 = 2`. `s_02_parts = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`.\n3. `s_02_string = \"0020\"`.\n4. Find the first '2' in \"0020\". It's at index 2 (`first_2_idx = 2`).\n5. Construct the result:\n   - `s_02_string[:2]` is \"00\".\n   - `'1' * count1` is \"11\".\n   - `s_02_string[2:]` is \"20\".\n   - Concatenate: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\".\n\nThis matches the example output. The logic is sound and covers edge cases like strings with only '0's, only '1's, or only '2's. The time complexity will be O(N) for iterating through the string and O(N) for string operations, where N is the length of the string, which is efficient enough for N up to $10^5$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Read the input string from standard input.\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    count1 = 0\n    s_02_parts = [] # To store '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\n\n    # Iterate through the input string to separate '1's from '0's and '2's.\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count1 += 1\n        else:\n            s_02_parts.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the collected '0's and '2's to form the s_02_string.\n    s_02_string = \"\".join(s_02_parts)\n\n    # Find the index of the first '2' in s_02_string.\n    # This determines where the block of '1's should be inserted.\n    # Python's str.find() returns -1 if the character is not found.\n    first_2_idx = s_02_string.find('2')\n    \n    result_parts = []\n    if first_2_idx == -1:\n        # Case 1: No '2's found in s_02_string.\n        # This means s_02_string consists only of '0's (or is empty).\n        # To be lexicographically smallest, all '0's come first, then all '1's.\n        result_parts.append(s_02_string) # All '0's\n        result_parts.append('1' * count1) # All '1's\n    else:\n        # Case 2: '2's exist in s_02_string.\n        # The optimal strategy is to place all '0's that appear before the first '2',\n        # then all '1's, then the rest of the '0's and '2's (starting from the first '2').\n        \n        # Append the prefix of s_02_string before the first '2' (these are all '0's).\n        result_parts.append(s_02_string[:first_2_idx])\n        # Append all the '1's.\n        result_parts.append('1' * count1)\n        # Append the suffix of s_02_string from the first '2' onwards.\n        result_parts.append(s_02_string[first_2_idx:])\n    \n    # Join the parts and print the final lexicographically smallest string to standard output.\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_parts) + \"\\n\")\n\n```",
