He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Approach for \"Prefixes and Suffixes\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem. Let's break this down systematically. I see the input: we've got the length of the original string, `n`, and then `2n-2` strings that are all the improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`. Each length from 1 to `n-1` is represented twice. The goal is to figure out whether each of those strings is a prefix or a suffix and represent that with a string of 'P's and 'S's. I know the number of 'P's and 'S's will be equal, each `n-1`. It's guaranteed that a consistent original string `s` exists.\n\nHere's my thought process on the core idea: If I have a string `s` of length `n`, then I know its prefixes are like `s[0]`, `s[0:2]`, etc., and its suffixes are `s[n-1]`, `s[n-2:n]`, etc. The key lies in those strings of length `n-1`. There are exactly two of those in the input. One has to be the longest proper prefix, `s[0:n-1]`, and the other the longest proper suffix, `s[1:n]`.\n\nNow, suppose I call those two strings `str1` and `str2`. Here's where the critical observation comes in. If `str1` is a prefix, and `str2` is a suffix, then I can reconstruct `s`. It's basically `str1` prepended with one character, that is `str1[0]`, and appended to `str2`, that is `str2`. The trick is that if I know `str1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `str2` is `s[1:n]`, then I can determine the full string `s`.\n\nTherefore the string `s` can also be `str1` with the last character of `str2`, `str2[n-2]` or `str2[-1]`. In this case, I will have `s` as `str1[0] + str2`. From here I can derive `s` as `str1 + str2[n-2]`.\n\nThe key is in comparing the strings of length `n-1`. I have to figure out if `str1` is prefix or suffix, and if I figure it out then I can derive `s`. The key realization is that `str1[1:]` must be equal to `str2[:-1]`. This is the crux of the problem! Once I can identify which of the length `n-1` strings is the prefix and which is the suffix, I can construct the entire string `s`. I'm starting to see a way to solve this!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for each given string, whether it's a prefix or a suffix of an unknown original string `s` of length `n`. We are given `2n-2` strings, which are all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`). It's guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to `n-1`.\n\nThe key insight is to focus on the two strings of length `n-1`. Let these be `s1_n_minus_1` and `s2_n_minus_1`. These two strings must be `s[0:n-1]` (the longest improper prefix) and `s[1:n]` (the longest improper suffix) in some order.\n\nThere are two possibilities for how `s1_n_minus_1` and `s2_n_minus_1` could correspond to the longest prefix and suffix:\n\n**Possibility 1:**\n* `s1_n_minus_1` is `s[0:n-1]` (prefix)\n* `s2_n_minus_1` is `s[1:n]` (suffix)\n\nIf this is true, then the full string `s` can be reconstructed. `s[0:n-1]` is `s1_n_minus_1`, and `s[1:n]` is `s2_n_minus_1`.\nFor these to be consistent, the substring `s[1:n-1]` must be common to both. That is, `s1_n_minus_1[1:]` must be equal to `s2_n_minus_1[:-1]`.\nIf this condition holds, then the original string `s` would be `s1_n_minus_1[0] + s2_n_minus_1`.\n\n**Possibility 2:**\n* `s2_n_minus_1` is `s[0:n-1]` (prefix)\n* `s1_n_minus_1` is `s[1:n]` (suffix)\n\nSimilarly, if this is true, then `s2_n_minus_1[1:]` must be equal to `s1_n_minus_1[:-1]`.\nIf this condition holds, then the original string `s` would be `s2_n_minus_1[0] + s1_n_minus_1`.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that a consistent string `s` exists, at least one of these two possibilities must yield a valid `s`. We can pick either one that works.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Read all `2n-2` input strings and store them, along with their original indices.\n3.  Identify the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `str_A` and `str_B`.\n4.  **Try Possibility 1:** Assume `str_A` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `str_B` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n    *   Check if `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n    *   If they match, reconstruct a candidate string `candidate_s = str_A[0] + str_B`.\n    *   Generate all prefixes and suffixes of `candidate_s` of lengths 1 to `n-1`.\n    *   Check if the multiset of generated prefixes and suffixes exactly matches the multiset of input strings. If it does, this is a valid assignment.\n5.  **If Possibility 1 failed or we want to try the other one (since any valid answer is accepted):**\n    **Try Possibility 2:** Assume `str_B` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `str_A` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n    *   Check if `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n    *   If they match, reconstruct a candidate string `candidate_s = str_B[0] + str_A`.\n    *   Generate all prefixes and suffixes of `candidate_s` of lengths 1 to `n-1`.\n    *   Check if the multiset of generated prefixes and suffixes exactly matches the multiset of input strings. If it does, this is a valid assignment.\n\nSince the problem guarantees a valid `s` exists, at least one of these will work. We can simply pick the first one that satisfies the `str_X[1:] == str_Y[:-1]` condition and proceed. It's not strictly necessary to verify all prefixes/suffixes against the input list, as the problem guarantees consistency. The problem statement implies that if `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`, then `str_A[0] + str_B` *is* a valid string `s`.\n\nLet's refine the strategy:\n1.  Store input strings along with their original indices.\n2.  Find the two strings of length `n-1`. Let `s_long_1` and `s_long_2` be these strings.\n3.  **Attempt 1:** Assume `s_long_1` is `s[0:n-1]` (prefix) and `s_long_2` is `s[1:n]` (suffix).\n    *   If `s_long_1[1:] == s_long_2[:-1]`, then `s = s_long_1[0] + s_long_2` is a candidate.\n    *   Construct the expected prefixes and suffixes from `s`.\n    *   Iterate through the *original input strings*. For each string, if it matches one of the expected prefixes that hasn't been \"used\" yet, mark it as 'P'. Otherwise, mark it as 'S'.\n    *   If this assignment results in `n-1` 'P's and `n-1` 'S's, it's a valid answer.\n4.  **Attempt 2:** If Attempt 1 didn't yield a valid `s` (or we just want to try the other valid combination), assume `s_long_2` is `s[0:n-1]` (prefix) and `s_long_1` is `s[1:n]` (suffix).\n    *   If `s_long_2[1:] == s_long_1[:-1]`, then `s = s_long_2[0] + s_long_1` is a candidate.\n    *   Repeat the assignment process as in Attempt 1.\n\nSince the problem guarantees a solution exists, one of these two attempts will succeed. The simplest way to implement the assignment is to use a `collections.Counter` or similar frequency map for the expected prefixes and suffixes.\n\nExample: `n=5`, strings: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\nTwo strings of length `n-1=4`: `abab`, `baba`.\nLet `s_long_1 = \"abab\"` and `s_long_2 = \"baba\"`.\n\n**Attempt 1:** `s_long_1` = prefix, `s_long_2` = suffix.\n`s_long_1[1:]` is `\"bab\"`. `s_long_2[:-1]` is `\"bab\"`. They match!\nCandidate `s = s_long_1[0] + s_long_2 = 'a' + \"baba\" = \"ababa\"`.\n\nNow, generate expected prefixes and suffixes for \"ababa\":\nPrefixes: `a`, `ab`, `aba`, `abab`\nSuffixes: `a`, `ba`, `aba`, `baba`\n\nWe need to assign 'P' or 'S' to the original input strings:\n`['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']`\n\nWe can use two frequency maps: `expected_prefixes = Counter({'a':1, 'ab':1, 'aba':1, 'abab':1})` and `expected_suffixes = Counter({'a':1, 'ba':1, 'aba':1, 'baba':1})`.\n\nIterate through the input strings with their original indices:\n1.  `'ba'` (index 0): Is it in `expected_prefixes`? No. Is it in `expected_suffixes`? Yes. Assign 'S', decrement `expected_suffixes['ba']`. `ans[0] = 'S'`.\n2.  `'a'` (index 1): Is it in `expected_prefixes`? Yes. Assign 'P', decrement `expected_prefixes['a']`. `ans[1] = 'P'`.\n3.  `'abab'` (index 2): Is it in `expected_prefixes`? Yes. Assign 'P', decrement `expected_prefixes['abab']`. `ans[2] = 'P'`.\n4.  `'a'` (index 3): Is it in `expected_prefixes`? No (count is 0). Is it in `expected_suffixes`? Yes. Assign 'S', decrement `expected_suffixes['a']`. `ans[3] = 'S'`.\n5.  `'aba'` (index 4): Is it in `expected_prefixes`? Yes. Assign 'P', decrement `expected_prefixes['aba']`. `ans[4] = 'P'`.\n6.  `'baba'` (index 5): Is it in `expected_prefixes`? No. Is it in `expected_suffixes`? Yes. Assign 'S', decrement `expected_suffixes['baba']`. `ans[5] = 'S'`.\n7.  `'ab'` (index 6): Is it in `expected_prefixes`? Yes. Assign 'P', decrement `expected_prefixes['ab']`. `ans[6] = 'P'`.\n8.  `'aba'` (index 7): Is it in `expected_prefixes`? No. Is it in `expected_suffixes`? Yes. Assign 'S', decrement `expected_suffixes['aba']`. `ans[7] = 'S'`.\n\nFinal `ans` string: \"SPPSPSPS\".
