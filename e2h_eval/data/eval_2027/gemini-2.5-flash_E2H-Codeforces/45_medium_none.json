There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of how to tackle this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. The core of it is figuring out the maximum number of games a single player, the eventual winner, can participate in, given a certain number of initial players (`n`). We're dealing with a knockout tournament, so one loss and you're out. The trick is the rule about opponents needing to be within one game of each other (including the winner).\n\nMy initial thought was to represent the number of games played by a player as `k`. I realized the winner plays a series of games, and for the winner to play the next game, the opponent must have either `k-1` or `k` games. Building a winning bracket, while maximizing the game counts for the champion, seems to come down to choosing the opponent with games as close as possible to the number of games the winner has, to keep the number of players down.  \n\nTo find the minimum players needed for a winner to reach `k` games, I defined `f(k)`. Initially, I thought about `dp[k]` but quickly concluded that representing `f(k)`  as the minimum number of initial players needed to guarantee a winner could reach `k` wins in this tournament. Thinking this through, I identified that the winner's \"branch\" of the tournament takes `f(k-1)` players, and the opponent's must be either `f(k-1)` or `f(k-2)`  - minimizing the total player count by selecting the most efficient number of players.  It turns out this creates a nice recurrence: `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)`.\n\nI then realized that this recurrence relationship generates the Fibonacci sequence (after slight adjustment for the offset) This allows me to use the formula and quickly determine how many players are needed for each level of `k` games.\n\nEssentially, for the winner to reach `k` games, they'll always need to beat an opponent who's played either `k-1` or `k-2` games to minimize the player requirement.  \n\nThe problem then is simply finding the largest `k` (number of games for the winner) such that the number of players `f(k)` (which is `Fib(k+2)`) is less than or equal to `n`.  I can use a loop or some Fibonacci number generator to find this `k`. I need to start with `f(1) = 2` as the minimum number of players and then build up with each increment of k. This implementation, will iterate through Fib until the number exceeds the starting players, and then the previous value of K will the desired number of games the winner could achieve. I carefully thought about the code to directly find this `k` rather than generating too many Fibonacci numbers unnecessarily. The core of the code, therefore, is an efficient Fibonacci number generation that stops when the number of players is too high.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games to continue.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of initial players required to ensure that the tournament winner plays exactly `k` games. We want to find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's establish the recurrence for `f(k)`:\nA player who wins `k` games must have won `k-1` games and then won one more game against an opponent.\nWhen the winner (let's call them `W`) plays their `k`-th game, `W` has already won `k-1` games. Let `O` be `W`'s opponent in this `k`-th game.\nAccording to the rule, if `W` has played `k-1` games and `O` has played `g_O` games, then `| (k-1) - g_O | <= 1`. This implies `k-2 <= g_O <= k`.\nHowever, `O` cannot have played `k` games, because if `O` had `k` wins, `O` would be \"ahead\" of `W` in terms of games won, which contradicts `W` eventually winning `k` games and being the tournament winner in this construction. So, `g_O` can only be `k-1` or `k-2`.\n\nTo minimize the total number of players `f(k)`, we should choose the opponent `O` such that `g_O` is as small as possible, because `f(x)` is an increasing function (more games require more players).\nThus, `W` (with `k-1` wins) should play against `O` (with `k-2` wins).\n\nThis leads to the recurrence relation:\n`f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nNow, let's determine the base cases:\n- `f(0)`: A player who has played 0 games. This player can be an opponent. We need 1 player for this. So, `f(0) = 1`.\n- `f(1)`: The winner plays 1 game. This requires 2 players (the winner and one opponent, both starting with 0 games). So, `f(1) = 2`.\n\nLet's list the sequence `f(k)`:\n- `f(0) = 1`\n- `f(1) = 2`\n- `f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n- `f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n- `f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\n- `f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`\nThis sequence corresponds to the Fibonacci numbers, specifically `f(k) = Fib(k+2)` if `Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, ...`.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`. We can find this by iteratively calculating `f(k)` values until `f(k)` exceeds `n`.\nThe input `n` can be up to `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will not be very large (e.g., `Fib(93)` is the first Fibonacci number greater than `10^18` if `Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1`). A simple loop will be efficient enough.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Handle the base case `n=2`: With 2 players, only one game can be played, so the winner plays 1 game.\n2. Initialize `f_k_minus_2 = 1` (representing `f(0)`) and `f_k_minus_1 = 2` (representing `f(1)`).\n3. Initialize `k = 1`, as 1 game is possible with `f(1)=2` players.\n4. Loop:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `f_k = f_k_minus_1 + f_k_minus_2`.\n   b. If `f_k` is greater than `n`, then `k` is the maximum number of games the winner can play. Break the loop.\n   c. Otherwise, update `f_k_minus_2 = f_k_minus_1`, `f_k_minus_1 = f_k`, and increment `k` by 1.\n5. Print the final `k`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=10):**\n- `n = 10`\n- `f_k_minus_2 = 1` (`f(0)`)\n- `f_k_minus_1 = 2` (`f(1)`)\n- `k = 1` (since `f(1)=2 <= 10`)\n\n- **Iteration 1:**\n  - `f_k = f_k_minus_1 + f_k_minus_2 = 2 + 1 = 3` (`f(2)`)\n  - `f_k (3) <= n (10)`. Condition `f_k > n` is false.\n  - Update: `f_k_minus_2 = 2`, `f_k_minus_1 = 3`, `k = 2`.\n\n- **Iteration 2:**\n  - `f_k = f_k_minus_1 + f_k_minus_2 = 3 + 2 = 5` (`f(3)`)\n  - `f_k (5) <= n (10)`. Condition `f_k > n` is false.\n  - Update: `f_k_minus_2 = 3`, `f_k_minus_1 = 5`, `k = 3`.\n\n- **Iteration 3:**\n  - `f_k = f_k_minus_1 + f_k_minus_2 = 5 + 3 = 8` (`f(4)`)\n  - `f_k (8) <= n (10)`. Condition `f_k > n` is false.\n  - Update: `f_k_minus_2 = 5`, `f_k_minus_1 = 8`, `k = 4`.\n\n- **Iteration 4:**\n  - `f_k = f_k_minus_1 + f_k_minus_2 = 8 + 5 = 13` (`f(5)`)\n  - `f_k (13) > n (10)`. Condition `f_k > n` is true. Break the loop.\n\n- Print `k` (which is 4).\n\nThis matches the example output.
