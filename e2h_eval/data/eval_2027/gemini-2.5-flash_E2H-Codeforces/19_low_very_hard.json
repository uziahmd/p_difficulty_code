The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Number Games - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Number Games\" problem, and my initial thought is, this seems like a classic tree problem with a clever twist on optimization. We've got `n` districts, a tree structure, fan counts based on district number, and we need to remove `k` contestants while keeping the remaining districts connected.  The goal is to maximize the sum of the remaining fans, which translates directly to maximizing the sum of the district numbers, given how `2^i` grows so rapidly.\n\nThe core of this problem hinges on balancing the connectivity constraint with this \"keep the biggest numbers\" strategy.  If we could just pick any `n-k` districts, the solution would be trivial – take the largest `n-k` districts.  But, the connectedness requirement complicates things.\n\nMy immediate instinct is that a greedy approach is the way to go.  We need to remove districts, so we should start by removing the ones that hurt the total fan count the least. This means removing districts with the smallest numbers, if possible, but only if that doesn't disconnect the remaining districts.\n\nI'm thinking about maintaining a set of kept districts. We start with all districts. Then, in descending order of district number, consider removing districts. If removing a district will cause the remaining districts to be disconnected, we can't remove it.  We keep doing this until we've removed exactly `k` districts. We output those numbers.\n\nIt's essentially a problem of finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` with the largest possible node values (since `2^i` is so dominant). Prioritizing high-indexed nodes seems essential.  This greedy approach should work efficiently, and the proof probably boils down to arguing that at each step, choosing to remove the smallest available district that maintains connectivity is the locally optimal choice, and ultimately leads to the globally optimal configuration. I need to formulate this precisely to get the code going.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected subgraph in the given tree structure, such that the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts `i` is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *removed*, in increasing order.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nThe function `f(i) = 2^i` grows very rapidly. For any `x`, `2^x` is greater than the sum of `2^j` for all `j < x`. This implies that to maximize the total sum of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. For example, keeping district `10` is always better than keeping any set of districts whose maximum index is less than `10`, as long as the number of kept districts is the same. This means we should try to keep the districts with the largest possible indices.\n\n**Greedy Approach:**\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. To maximize the sum `sum(2^i)`, we should try to keep the `n-k` largest district indices `n, n-1, ..., n-(n-k)+1 = k+1`. However, these districts might not form a connected component.\n\nInstead, let's consider the districts in decreasing order of their indices: `n, n-1, ..., 1`. We want to select `n-k` districts. A natural greedy strategy is to try to include as many large-indexed districts as possible.\n\nLet's start by assuming we want to keep all districts from `n` down to `1`. We need to remove `k` districts. To maximize the sum of `2^i` for the remaining districts, we should remove districts with the smallest indices.\n\nConsider iterating from district `1` up to `n`. For each district `i`, if we remove it, we save `2^i` fans from being counted. If we keep it, it contributes `2^i` fans. We want to remove `k` districts such that the sum of `2^i` for *removed* districts is minimized, subject to the connectivity constraint for the remaining `n-k` districts. This is equivalent to maximizing the sum of `2^i` for the *kept* districts.\n\nLet `S` be the set of districts we *keep*. Initially, `S` contains all `n` districts. We need to remove `k` districts.\nThe problem can be rephrased: find a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of `2^i` for its nodes.\nSince `2^i` grows so fast, this is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the lexicographical sequence of its node labels (when sorted in decreasing order). That is, we prefer a subgraph that contains `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on.\n\nThis suggests a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) approach.\nLet's root the tree arbitrarily, say at district `1`.\nWe want to keep the largest possible `n-k` districts.\nThe `n-k` districts must form a connected component. This means there must be a \"root\" district in our chosen component, and all other chosen districts must be reachable from it within the component.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts.\nThe district `n` is always a strong candidate to be kept. If we keep `n`, we then try to keep `n-1`, `n-2`, and so on, as long as they are connected to the already kept component.\n\nThis problem is a variation of finding a maximum weight connected subgraph. Given the specific weight function `2^i`, a greedy strategy works. We want to keep the `n-k` districts with the largest indices that form a connected component.\n\nLet's maintain a set of `n-k` districts that we *keep*. Initially, we don't know which ones.\nWe know we need to remove `k` districts.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Represent the tree:** Use an adjacency list.\n2.  **Initialize `removed` set:** This set will store the `k` districts we remove.\n3.  **Initialize `kept_count`:** This will track how many districts we have decided to keep.\n4.  **Initialize `parent` array:** `parent[i]` will store the parent of district `i` in the component we are building. This is crucial for checking connectivity and avoiding cycles.\n5.  **Initialize `visited` array:** To keep track of districts already processed.\n6.  **Iterate districts in decreasing order:** From `i = n` down to `1`.\n    *   If `kept_count < n-k`: We still need to select more districts to keep.\n        *   Try to keep district `i`.\n        *   If `i` is the first district we are keeping (i.e., `kept_count == 0`), then we keep it. Increment `kept_count`. Set `parent[i] = -1` (or some sentinel).\n        *   If `i` is not the first district, we need to check if it can be connected to the already kept component. This means `i` must have an adjacent node `j` that is already part of the kept component (i.e., `parent[j]` is set, or `j` is the root of the component). If such a `j` exists, we keep `i`, set `parent[i] = j` (or any such `j`), and increment `kept_count`.\n        *   If `i` cannot be connected to the current component, we cannot keep it *yet*. We might need to keep it later if it becomes connected by keeping one of its neighbors. This implies a more complex approach than simple iteration.\n\nLet's refine the greedy strategy:\nWe iterate districts `i` from `n` down to `1`. We want to keep `n-k` districts.\nWe maintain a `kept` set (or a boolean array `is_kept`).\nWe maintain a `parent` array to track the structure of the connected component we are building. `parent[u]` will store the parent of `u` in the component, or `0` if `u` is the root, or `-1` if `u` is not yet part of the component.\n\n1.  Initialize `is_kept` array to `False` for all districts.\n2.  Initialize `parent` array to `0` for all districts (meaning not yet part of the component).\n3.  Initialize `kept_count = 0`.\n4.  Initialize `removed_list = []`.\n\n5.  Iterate `u` from `n` down to `1`:\n    *   If `u` is already marked as `is_kept[u]`, continue (this shouldn't happen with this iteration order unless `u` was added as a child of a larger node, which is not how we are building it).\n    *   If `kept_count < n-k`:\n        *   We want to keep `u`. To do this, `u` must either be the first node we keep, or connected to an already kept node.\n        *   Find an adjacent node `v` of `u` such that `is_kept[v]` is `True`.\n        *   If such a `v` exists, we can keep `u`. Mark `is_kept[u] = True`, set `parent[u] = v`, increment `kept_count`.\n        *   If no such `v` exists and `kept_count == 0`, we can keep `u` as the root of our component. Mark `is_kept[u] = True`, set `parent[u] = 0`, increment `kept_count`.\n        *   If no such `v` exists and `kept_count > 0`, we cannot keep `u` *at this moment* because it's isolated from the current component. We must remove it. Add `u` to `removed_list`.\n    *   Else (`kept_count == n-k`): We have already selected `n-k` districts. Any remaining district `u` (from `n` down to `1`) that is not yet `is_kept` must be removed. Add `u` to `removed_list`.\n\nThis greedy strategy has a flaw: if we remove `u` because it's isolated, it might be that removing `u` is suboptimal. It might be better to remove a smaller-indexed node `x` if `u` could connect to the component via `x`.\n\n**Corrected Greedy Strategy (similar to Kruskal's for MST, but building a connected component):**\n\n1.  **Represent the tree:** Adjacency list `adj`.\n2.  **Initialize `removed` set:** `removed = set()`.\n3.  **Initialize `kept_count = 0`.**\n4.  **Initialize `parent` array for DSU:** `parent[i] = i` for all `i`. This will track connected components of *kept* nodes. `rank` array for union-by-rank optimization.\n5.  **Iterate districts `u` from `n` down to `1`:**\n    *   If `kept_count == n-k`: We have already selected `n-k` districts. All remaining districts (from `u` down to `1`) must be removed. Add `u` to `removed` and continue to the next `u`.\n    *   Otherwise (`kept_count < n-k`):\n        *   We try to keep district `u`.\n        *   Mark `u` as `kept`. Increment `kept_count`.\n        *   **Union `u` with its kept neighbors:** For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   If `v` is also `kept` (meaning `v` was processed earlier, `v > u`):\n                *   Perform `union(u, v)` operation on the DSU structure. This connects `u`'s component with `v`'s component.\n        *   **Check for cycles (implicitly handled by DSU and tree structure):** In a tree, adding an edge between two nodes that are already in the same component would form a cycle. Here, we are trying to build a connected component. If `u` is connected to multiple components of `kept` nodes, they all merge.\n        *   **Crucial check:** If keeping `u` causes the total number of connected components among the *kept* nodes to decrease *too much*, meaning it merges components that we *must* keep separate, this approach is tricky.\n\nThe problem is simpler: we are removing `k` nodes. The remaining `n-k` nodes must form a connected component.\nThis means we are looking for a connected subgraph of size `n-k`.\n\nLet's use a standard approach for this kind of problem:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes. This means we remove `k` nodes.\nTo maximize `sum(2^i)` for kept nodes, we should remove `k` nodes with the smallest possible `i` values, *if* doing so maintains connectivity for the remaining `n-k` nodes.\n\nConsider an arbitrary root, say node `1`.\nWe can use dynamic programming on trees, but `N=10^6` makes `O(N^2)` or `O(N log N)` DP potentially too slow if the constant factor is large. `O(N)` or `O(N log N)` is desired.\n\nLet's try a simpler greedy approach based on the largest indices.\nWe want to keep the `n-k` largest indices that form a connected component.\nStart with `n` and try to add `n-1`, `n-2`, etc.\nThis is like a modified BFS/DFS.\n\n1.  **Adjacency List:** Build `adj`.\n2.  **`is_removed` array:** `is_removed[i] = True` if district `i` is removed, `False` otherwise. Initialize all to `False`.\n3.  **`removed_count = 0`.**\n4.  **`q = deque()`:** A queue for a BFS-like traversal.\n5.  **`visited` array:** `visited[i] = True` if district `i` has been processed. Initialize all to `False`.\n\n**The core idea:** We want to keep the largest `n-k` districts. Let `max_kept_districts = n-k`.\nWe can start a \"virtual\" BFS/DFS from `n` to try to build a component of size `n-k`.\nWhat if `n` is not part of the optimal solution? This is possible if `n` is a leaf and removing it allows us to keep many other large-indexed nodes. But `2^n` is so large that it's almost always optimal to keep `n` unless `k` is very small and `n` is isolated.\n\nLet's assume the component we keep will contain district `n`. This is a very strong assumption, but `2^n` is extremely large.\nIf we keep `n`, we can then iteratively add its neighbors, then their neighbors, prioritizing larger indices, until we have `n-k` districts.\n\nThis is the standard approach for \"find a connected subgraph of size `X` with max sum of weights\":\n1.  **Initialize `removed_nodes` list.**\n2.  **Initialize `kept_nodes` set.**\n3.  **Initialize `degree` array:** `degree[i]` stores the current degree of node `i` considering only edges to *other non-removed nodes*.\n4.  **Initialize a min-priority queue `pq`:** This will store nodes that are candidates for removal. A node `u` is a candidate for removal if its current degree (among non-removed nodes) is 1 (it's a leaf) and it's not the only remaining node. We prioritize removing nodes with smaller indices.\n\n**Algorithm (Iterative Leaf Removal):**\nThis algorithm finds the \"largest\" connected subgraph of a given size.\nIt's based on the idea that if we want to keep a connected subgraph of size `X`, we must remove `N-X` nodes. To maximize the sum of `2^i` for the kept nodes, we should remove nodes with the smallest `i` values. The connectivity constraint means we can only remove \"leaf\" nodes from the current graph, or nodes that don't disconnect the graph.\n\n1.  **Build Adjacency List `adj`:** For each node `u`, `adj[u]` contains its neighbors.\n2.  **Initialize `current_degree` array:** `current_degree[u]` stores the number of neighbors `u` has in the *current* graph (initially, the full graph).\n3.  **Initialize `removed` boolean array:** `removed[u] = True` if `u` is removed, `False` otherwise.\n4.  **Initialize `removed_list`:** An empty list to store the indices of removed nodes.\n5.  **Initialize `pq` (min-priority queue):** Stores `(node_index, node_index)` for all nodes `u` where `current_degree[u] == 1`. The first element is the priority (node index), the second is the value (node index).\n6.  **`remaining_nodes = n`**.\n\n7.  **Loop while `remaining_nodes > n-k`:**\n    *   If `pq` is empty, it means the graph is a single node or a cycle, and we cannot remove more nodes without disconnecting it. This should not happen in a tree unless `n-k=1` and `n=1` (which is not allowed by `k<n`). In a tree, there's always a leaf unless `n=1`.\n    *   Extract the node `u` with the smallest index from `pq`.\n    *   Mark `removed[u] = True`.\n    *   Add `u` to `removed_list`.\n    *   Decrement `remaining_nodes`.\n    *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        *   If `v` has not been removed (`!removed[v]`):\n            *   Decrement `current_degree[v]`.\n            *   If `current_degree[v] == 1` and `remaining_nodes > n-k` (we still need to remove more nodes), add `v` to `pq`.\n            *   If `current_degree[v] == 0` and `remaining_nodes > n-k`, this implies `v` is now isolated. This should only happen if `remaining_nodes` becomes 1.\n\n8.  **Sort `removed_list`:** Sort the collected removed nodes in increasing order.\n9.  **Print `removed_list`.**\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nN=6, K=3. Remove 3 nodes. Keep 3 nodes.\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdjacency:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\nInitial `current_degree`:\n1: 1\n2: 4\n3: 1\n4: 1\n5: 1\n6: 2\n\n`remaining_nodes = 6`. Target `n-k = 3`. Need to remove `3` nodes.\n`pq`: `[(1,1), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)]`\n\n**Iteration 1:** `remaining_nodes = 6 > 3`.\n*   Pop `u=1` from `pq`.\n*   `removed[1] = True`. `removed_list = [1]`. `remaining_nodes = 5`.\n*   Neighbor of 1 is 2. `!removed[2]`.\n    *   `current_degree[2]` becomes 3.\n    *   `current_degree[2]` is not 1. Do nothing with 2 for pq.\n\n`pq`: `[(3,3), (4,4), (5,5)]`\n\n**Iteration 2:** `remaining_nodes = 5 > 3`.\n*   Pop `u=3` from `pq`.\n*   `removed[3] = True`. `removed_list = [1,3]`. `remaining_nodes = 4`.\n*   Neighbor of 3 is 2. `!removed[2]`.\n    *   `current_degree[2]` becomes 2.\n    *   `current_degree[2]` is not 1. Do nothing with 2 for pq.\n\n`pq`: `[(4,4), (5,5)]`\n\n**Iteration 3:** `remaining_nodes = 4 > 3`.\n*   Pop `u=4` from `pq`.\n*   `removed[4] = True`. `removed_list = [1,3,4]`. `remaining_nodes = 3`.\n*   Neighbor of 4 is 2. `!removed[2]`.\n    *   `current_degree[2]` becomes 1.\n    *   `current_degree[2] == 1` and `remaining_nodes = 3` is *not* `> n-k=3`. So we don't add 2 to pq. This is important: once `remaining_nodes` reaches `n-k`, we stop adding to `pq` because we don't need to remove any more nodes.\n\n`pq`: `[(5,5)]` (node 5 is still in pq, but we won't process it)\n\nLoop condition `remaining_nodes > n-k` (i.e. `3 > 3`) is `False`. Loop terminates.\n`removed_list = [1,3,4]`.\nSort `removed_list`: `[1,3,4]`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: `O(N+M)` where `M=N-1` for a tree, so `O(N)`.\n*   Initializing `current_degree` and `pq`: `O(N)`.\n*   The loop runs `k` times. In each iteration:\n    *   `heappop`: `O(log N)`.\n    *   Iterating neighbors: sum of degrees is `2(N-1)`, so each edge is processed twice in total across all iterations.\n    *   `heappush`: `O(log N)`.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(N + k log N)`. Since `k < N`, this is `O(N log N)`.\n*   Space complexity: `O(N)` for adjacency list, degrees, removed array, and priority queue.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough for `N=10^6`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    current_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Read edges and build adjacency list and initial degrees\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        current_degree[u] += 1\n        current_degree[v] += 1\n\n    # `removed` array tracks nodes that have been removed\n    is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Priority queue stores (node_index, node_index) for nodes that are leaves\n    # We prioritize removing nodes with smaller indices\n    pq = [] \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Nodes with degree 1 are leaves (candidates for removal)\n        # Handle the case of n=1 specifically if it were allowed (k<n, so n>=2)\n        # If n > 1 and a node has degree 0, it's an isolated node, which shouldn't happen in a connected tree\n        if current_degree[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (i, i)) # (priority, value)\n\n    removed_list = []\n    remaining_nodes = n\n\n    # We need to remove k nodes.\n    # Loop until we have removed k nodes, or remaining_nodes == n-k\n    while remaining_nodes > n - k:\n        # If pq is empty, it means all remaining nodes have degree > 1.\n        # This implies the remaining graph is a cycle or a single node with degree 0 (if n=1).\n        # In a tree, if remaining_nodes > 1, there must be at least two leaves.\n        # If remaining_nodes == 1, then the loop condition (remaining_nodes > n-k) will be false\n        # unless n-k is 0, which means k=n, but k < n.\n        # So pq should not become empty prematurely.\n        \n        node_to_remove_idx, node_to_remove_val = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        u = node_to_remove_val\n\n        # If the node was already processed (e.g., its degree dropped to 1, added to PQ, then a neighbor was removed\n        # causing its degree to drop to 0, but it was already in PQ), skip it.\n        # This check is technically not needed for this algorithm as nodes are only added to PQ once their degree is 1\n        # and removed once.
