You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process for this problem:**\n\nI'm tackling a competitive programming challenge where I need to figure out the fewest edges to add to an undirected graph to create a simple, odd-length cycle, and then count the number of ways to achieve that minimum.\n\nFirst, I define the core elements. I'm given a graph, G, consisting of vertices (V) and edges (E). My ultimate goal is to identify a set of vertices, C, and a set of edges, E_C, that collectively form a cycle. This cycle should be simple (no repeated vertices), and its length (|E_C|) must be odd.  I need to minimize the count of added edges (E_C \\ E).\n\n**Considering t=0: The Existing Odd Cycle Scenario**\n\nLet's begin by considering the simplest case where I *don't* have to add any edges, i.e., t=0. That implies the graph already has an odd cycle. A fundamental concept in graph theory pops into my head: a graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it's *not* bipartite.  I can efficiently check for bipartiteness using either Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) with 2-coloring. If I find an edge that connects two vertices of the same color during the coloring process, bingo – an odd cycle exists!  So, if I find an odd cycle, I know the answer is t=0.  \n\nNow, I analyze the 'w' (number of ways) component of the answer.  The problem description is subtly ambiguous. Does `w` represent *any* way or all? Based on how competitive programming questions are usually phrased, and reading the problem description with attention, the question asks \"to form *a* simple cycle\". So, if an odd cycle already exists, it implies there's just one way to achieve this: do nothing. Therefore, I'm pretty confident that, for t=0, w should be 1.  I think, I need to focus on adding edges only if there are *no* odd cycles present.\n\n**The Algorithm for t=0**\n\nSo, the algorithm for this zero-edge case is straightforward. I'll iterate through each connected component of the graph and perform a 2-coloring (BFS or DFS). If a same-color edge emerges, an odd cycle is confirmed. I set t=0 and w=1, and terminate.\n\n**Moving to t=1: Adding One Edge**\n\nNow, I'm mentally shifting gears to examine the case where I must add a single edge (t=1).  The implication is that adding this edge must \"close\" a cycle, forming an odd cycle. Consequently, if I add an edge (u, v), that edge must connect two nodes that are *already* connected. And I realized that u and v must belong to the same connected component. \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so.\n\nLet the given graph be `G = (V, E)`. We are looking for a simple cycle `C` of odd length.\n\n**1. Check for `t = 0` (Odd Cycle Already Exists)**\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. We can check this using a 2-coloring algorithm (BFS or DFS).\n- Initialize `color[v] = -1` for all `v`.\n- For each unvisited vertex `v`:\n    - Start a BFS/DFS from `v`, assigning `color[v] = 0`.\n    - When traversing an edge `(u, v)`:\n        - If `v` is uncolored, assign `color[v] = 1 - color[u]` and add `v` to the queue/stack.\n        - If `v` is colored and `color[v] == color[u]`, then we have found an odd cycle.\n            - In this case, `t = 0` and `w = 1` (there's one way to add 0 edges). We can stop and print this.\n\n**2. Check for `t = 1` (Add One Edge)**\nIf no odd cycle exists (the graph is bipartite), we need to add at least one edge.\nIf we add an edge `(u, v)`, it forms a cycle if `u` and `v` are already in the same connected component. For this cycle to be odd, `u` and `v` must have the same color in the 2-coloring.\n- After performing the 2-coloring for all connected components (and confirming no odd cycles exist), the graph is bipartite.\n- For each connected component `C_i`:\n    - If `C_i` has `N_i` vertices, let `N_i_0` be the count of vertices with color 0 and `N_i_1` be the count of vertices with color 1.\n    - Any edge added between two vertices `u, v` within `C_i` where `color[u] == color[v]` will form an odd cycle.\n    - The number of such potential edges within `C_i` is `N_i_0 * (N_i_0 - 1) / 2` (edges between two color 0 vertices) plus `N_i_1 * (N_i_1 - 1) / 2` (edges between two color 1 vertices).\n    - We must subtract existing edges from this count. However, since the graph is bipartite, all existing edges connect vertices of different colors. So, any pair of same-colored vertices `(u, v)` does *not* have an existing edge, and adding `(u, v)` is valid.\n    - Sum these counts over all connected components. This sum is `w`.\n- If `w > 0`, then `t = 1`. We print `t` and `w`.\n\n**3. Check for `t = 2` (Add Two Edges)**\nIf `t=0` and `t=1` are not possible, we need to add at least two edges.\n- If we add two edges `(u, v)` and `(x, y)`:\n    - The simplest way to form an odd cycle with two added edges is to connect two distinct connected components `C_i` and `C_j` (where `i != j`).\n    - Pick a vertex `u` from `C_i` and a vertex `v` from `C_j`. Add edge `(u, v)`.\n    - Pick another vertex `x` from `C_i` and `y` from `C_j`. Add edge `(x, y)`.\n    - Now we have a path `u -- C_i -- x` and a path `v -- C_j -- y`. The added edges are `(u, v)` and `(x, y)`. This forms a cycle `u - v - y - C_j - x - u`.\n    - For this cycle to be odd, the path length `u -- C_i -- x` and `v -- C_j -- y` must have specific parities.\n    - In a bipartite graph, the parity of the path length between two vertices `a` and `b` is `|color[a] - color[b]|`.\n    - The cycle length is `1` (for `(u, v)`) + `dist(v, y)` (in `C_j`) + `1` (for `(y, x)`) + `dist(x, u)` (in `C_i`).\n    - This simplifies to `2 + (color[v] \\oplus color[y]) + (color[x] \\oplus color[u])`.\n    - For the cycle to be odd, `(color[v] \\oplus color[y]) + (color[x] \\oplus color[u])` must be odd. This means one must be 0 and the other 1.\n    - So, `color[v] == color[y]` and `color[x] != color[u]` (or vice versa).\n    - This means `u` and `x` must have different colors within `C_i`, and `v` and `y` must have the same color within `C_j`.\n    - Let `N_i_0, N_i_1` be counts for `C_i` and `N_j_0, N_j_1` for `C_j`.\n    - Ways to pick `u, x` with different colors: `N_i_0 * N_i_1`.\n    - Ways to pick `v, y` with same colors: `N_j_0 * (N_j_0 - 1) / 2 + N_j_1 * (N_j_1 - 1) / 2`.\n    - The total number of ways to pick `(u, x)` from `C_i` and `(v, y)` from `C_j` such that `u,x` have different colors and `v,y` have same colors is `(N_i_0 * N_i_1) * (N_j_0 * (N_j_0 - 1) / 2 + N_j_1 * (N_j_1 - 1) / 2)`.\n    - Since the roles of `C_i` and `C_j` can be swapped, we also add `(N_j_0 * N_j_1) * (N_i_0 * (N_i_0 - 1) / 2 + N_i_1 * (N_i_1 - 1) / 2)`.\n    - Sum this over all pairs of distinct components `(C_i, C_j)`.\n    - This count is `w`. If `w > 0`, then `t = 2`. Print `t` and `w`.\n\n**4. Check for `t = 3` (Add Three Edges)**\nIf `t=0, 1, 2` are not possible, it means there are no two components `C_i, C_j` such that one has vertices of both colors and the other has at least two vertices of the same color. This implies that all components are either:\n    - A single vertex (`N_k_0=1, N_k_1=0` or `N_k_0=0, N_k_1=1`).\n    - A path graph where `N_k_0 * N_k_1` is 0 or 1.\nThis is a very specific scenario. The only way `t=1` is 0 is if `N_i_0 * (N_i_0 - 1) / 2 + N_i_1 * (N_i_1 - 1) / 2 = 0` for all components. This means `N_i_0 <= 1` and `N_i_1 <= 1` for all components. So each component has at most 2 vertices. If it has 2 vertices, they must have different colors (e.g., `N_i_0=1, N_i_1=1`).\nThe only way `t=2` is 0 is if for any pair of distinct components `C_i, C_j`, either `N_i_0 * N_i_1 = 0` or `N_j_0 * (N_j_0 - 1) / 2 + N_j_1 * (N_j_1 - 1) / 2 = 0`.\nCombined, this means every component has at most one vertex of each color. So `N_k_0 <= 1` and `N_k_1 <= 1` for all components.\nIn this case, all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\nTo form an odd cycle, we need at least 3 vertices. We must pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x`.\nAdd edges `(u, v)`, `(v, x)`, `(x, u)`. This forms a cycle of length 3, which is odd. This requires 3 added edges.\nThe number of ways `w` is `C(N, 3)`, where `N` is the total number of vertices in the graph.\nSo, `t = 3` and `w = N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) / 6`.\n\n**Summary of Logic:**\n1.
