    "thought": "**Analyzing Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving trailing zeroes in factorials.  My initial thought is to figure out how to efficiently count those zeroes.  It's clear that the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of factors of 10, which boils down to the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization.  Since there are always more 2s than 5s, the problem essentially becomes counting the number of 5s.\n\nLegendre's formula is the key here. `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`  It perfectly captures the idea that each multiple of 5 contributes one zero, each multiple of 25 contributes an extra zero, each multiple of 125 another, and so on.\n\nI need to find all positive integers `n` that result in `Z(n) = m`, where `m` is given as input. Now, I have to figure out how to efficiently find these `n` values given `m`.\n\nObserving the behavior of `Z(n)` is crucial.  I've sketched out a few examples: `Z(1)` to `Z(4)` is 0, `Z(5)` to `Z(9)` is 1, and so on.  It's a non-decreasing function, and it increases only when `n` is a multiple of 5.  Furthermore, the increments are not uniform. When `n` changes, the increase will not necessarily be +1, rather, depends on powers of 5. So for example `Z(25)` will not be `Z(24)+1` but rather `Z(24)+2`.\n\nI see that for a given `m`, there might be a range of `n` values that satisfy `Z(n) = m`.  The problem wants me to output the count of these `n` values (let's say `k`) and then the `k` values themselves. I also notice that the maximum value of `m` can be as large as 100,000.  This implies I need an algorithm that's reasonably efficient. Now, I'll start coding...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n` values, `k`, followed by these `n` values in increasing order.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a prime factor in its prime factorization. This can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as `5^k <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze the function `Z(n)`:\n1. `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2. `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n3. For any `n`, `Z(n) = Z(n+1) = Z(n+2) = Z(n+3) = Z(n+4)` if `n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are not multiples of 5.\n   For example, `Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1`.\n   When `n` becomes a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` increases. If `n` is a multiple of 5 but not 25, `Z(n)` increases by 1 compared to `Z(n-1)`. If `n` is a multiple of 25 but not 125, `Z(n)` increases by 2 compared to `Z(n-1)`. In general, if `n` is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`, `Z(n)` increases by `k` compared to `Z(n-1)`.\n\nThis implies that if `Z(n) = m` for some `n`, then `Z(n-1)` must be less than `m` (unless `n` is 1, 2, 3, 4 and `m` is 0, which is not relevant for positive `m`).\nSpecifically, if `Z(n) = m`, then `Z(n-1)` must be `m - X` for some `X >= 1`.\nDue to the property that `Z(n)` only increases at multiples of 5, if `Z(n_0) = m`, then for `n_0, n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4`, all these values of `n` will result in `Z(n) = m`, provided `n_0+4` is not a multiple of 5 that causes `Z(n_0+4)` to be greater than `m`.\nMore precisely, if `Z(n_0) = m` and `Z(n_0-1) < m`, then `n_0` must be a multiple of 5. In this case, `Z(n_0)=m, Z(n_0+1)=m, Z(n_0+2)=m, Z(n_0+3)=m, Z(n_0+4)=m`. The next value `Z(n_0+5)` will be greater than `m`.\nSo, if `Z(n) = m` for some `n`, then there are exactly 5 such values of `n`: `n_start, n_start+1, n_start+2, n_start+3, n_start+4`, where `n_start` is the smallest multiple of 5 such that `Z(n_start) = m`.\n\nThe strategy is:\n1. Find the smallest `n` for which `Z(n) >= m`.\n2. Check if `Z(n)` is exactly `m`.\n3. If `Z(n) = m`, then the answers are `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`. There will be `k=5` such values.\n4. If `Z(n) > m`, then there is no `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. This happens if `m` is a value that `Z(n)` \"skips\" (e.g., `Z(24)=4`, `Z(25)=6`, so `m=5` is skipped). In this case, `k=0`.\n\nTo find the smallest `n` efficiently:\nSince `Z(n)` is an increasing function, we can use binary search to find `n`.\nThe maximum value for `m` is 100,000.\nIf `n=400,000`, `Z(400,000) = 400000/5 + 400000/25 + 400000/125 + ... = 80000 + 16000 + 3200 + 640 + 128 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 99999`.\nIf `n=400,005`, `Z(400,005) = 99999 + 1 = 100000`.\nSo `n` will be around `5 * m`. A safe upper bound for `n` can be `5 * 100,000 = 500,000`. We can set the search range for `n` from 1 to `5 * m` (or a slightly larger constant like 500,000).\n\nLet's implement the `count_trailing_zeroes` function and then use binary search.\n\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n >= i:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(input())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n    # A safe upper bound for n is roughly 5 * m.\n    # For m=100_000, n is around 400_000.\n    # We can set low = 1, high = 5 * m (or a bit more, e.g., 500_000).\n    low = 1\n    high = 5 * m + 5 # A slightly larger upper bound to be safe\n    ans_n = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        if zeroes >= m:\n            ans_n = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    # After binary search, ans_n is the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n    # If no such n is found (shouldn't happen for m >= 1), ans_n remains -1.\n    # The problem implies m >= 1, so Z(n) will eventually reach m.\n\n    # Now, check if Z(ans_n) is exactly m.\n    if ans_n != -1 and count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n) == m:\n        # If Z(ans_n) == m, then ans_n must be a multiple of 5.\n        # If it's not a multiple of 5, it means Z(ans_n-1) also equals m,\n        # which contradicts ans_n being the *smallest* n such that Z(n) >= m\n        # unless ans_n-1 is less than 5 and Z(ans_n-1) = 0.\n        # Example: m=1.
