Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Colored Boots Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Colored Boots\" problem, and my initial thought is, this smells like a matching problem, specifically a bipartite matching scenario. We've got two sets of boots - left and right - and we want to pair them up based on color compatibility. The input's pretty straightforward: the number of boots, `n`, and two strings, `l` and `r`, representing the colors of the left and right boots, respectively.  The trick is the compatibility rules: exact color matches are best, then matches with a '?', and finally, two '?'s are fine.\n\nNow, the classic bipartite matching algorithms are usually a bit heavy-handed for larger inputs. And with `n` up to 150,000, I need a more efficient approach. That's when I start thinking \"greedy.\" The compatibility hierarchy suggests a prioritization strategy: get the most restrictive matches out of the way first. Exact matches (e.g., 'a' with 'a') are the most constrained; if we don't grab them immediately, they might be lost opportunities later. Then, we can move on to the '?' matches, and finally, the double '?'.\n\nTo keep track of everything, I'm thinking a data structure that allows for easy lookups of boot indices based on their color would be ideal.  A list of lists or even a dictionary, keyed by the boot color, would be perfect. I'll probably initialize lists for all the lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'), and then one for the wildcard '?'.\n\nHere's how I envision my steps:\n1. **Match the Exacts:** I start with iterating through each specific color and, as long as there's a left boot and a right boot of that exact same color, I'll pair them up.\nI'm going to grab those most restrictive pairs first, securing the best matches and preventing them from getting eaten up by later, more loose matching.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (one left, one right) and list the indices of the boots in each pair. Boot colors can be specific (lowercase letters) or indefinite ('?'). Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nThis problem can be solved with a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, as these boots have fewer potential partners. If we use a more restrictive boot for a less restrictive match, we might miss an opportunity to match another restrictive boot that only had that specific partner.\n\nHere's the greedy strategy:\n\n1.  **Store boot indices by color:**\n    First, we need to efficiently access boots of a particular color. We can use lists (or deques for O(1) pop from left) to store the 0-based indices of left and right boots for each color.\n    We'll have 27 categories: 'a' through 'z' (26 categories) and '?' (1 category).\n    `left_boots_by_color[char_code]` will store indices of left boots.\n    `right_boots_by_color[char_code]` will store indices of right boots.\n    A simple way to map characters to integers is `ord(char) - ord('a')` for specific colors, and 26 for '?'.\n\n2.  **Prioritize exact specific color matches:**\n    Iterate through all specific colors from 'a' to 'z'. For each color `c`:\n    While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`:\n        Pop an index `L_idx` from `left_boots_by_color[c]`.\n        Pop an index `R_idx` from `right_boots_by_color[c]`.\n        Form a pair `(L_idx + 1, R_idx + 1)` and add it to our results. (Remember to convert to 1-based indexing for output).\n    This step ensures that boots that *must* match a specific color are matched first, as they have no other options for specific color partners.\n\n3.  **Prioritize specific color with '?' matches:**\n    After exact specific matches, some specific-colored boots might remain (e.g., a left 'a' boot with no right 'a' boot). These can now only be matched with '?' boots.\n    Iterate through all specific colors from 'a' to 'z'.\n    For each color `c`:\n        a. While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right '?' boots:\n            Pop an index `L_idx` from `left_boots_by_color[c]`.\n            Pop an index `R_idx` from `right_boots_by_color['?']`.\n            Add `(L_idx + 1, R_idx + 1)` to results.\n        b. While there are available right boots of color `c` AND available left '?' boots:\n            Pop an index `L_idx` from `left_boots_by_color['?']`.\n            Pop an index `R_idx` from `right_boots_by_color[c]`.\n            Add `(L_idx + 1, R_idx + 1)` to results.\n    This step matches specific-colored boots with '?' boots, exhausting their remaining specific-color options before the '?' boots are used for other '?' boots.\n\n4.  **Match remaining '?' boots:**\n    Finally, any remaining '?' boots can be paired with each other.\n    While there are available left '?' boots AND available right '?' boots:\n        Pop an index `L_idx` from `left_boots_by_color['?']`.\n        Pop an index `R_idx` from `right_boots_by_color['?']`.\n        Add `(L_idx + 1, R_idx + 1)` to results.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that boots with fewer matching options are prioritized, leading to the maximum number of pairs.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`l = \"codeforces\"`, `r = \"dodivthree\"`\n`n = 10`\n\n1.  **Store indices:**\n    `left_boots_by_color`:\n    `'c': [0, 7]`, `'o': [1]`, `'d': [2]`, `'e': [3, 9]`, `'f': [4]`, `'r': [5]`, `'s': [6]`\n    `right_boots_by_color`:\n    `'d': [0, 3]`, `'o': [1]`, `'i': [2]`, `'v': [4]`, `'t': [5]`, `'h': [6]`, `'r': [7]`, `'e': [8]`\n\n2.  **Exact specific matches:**\n    - `'c'`: No right 'c'.\n    - `'d'`: Left `[2]`, Right `[0, 3]`. Pair `(2+1, 0+1) = (3, 1)`. Remaining Right `'d': [3]`.\n    - `'e'`: Left `[3, 9]`, Right `[8]`. Pair `(3+1, 8+1) = (4, 9)`. Remaining Left `'e': [9]`.\n    - `'o'`: Left `[1]`, Right `[1]`. Pair `(1+1, 1+1) = (2, 2)`.\n    - `'r'`: Left `[5]`, Right `[7]`. Pair `(5+1, 7+1) = (6, 8)`.\n    - `'s'`: Left `[6]`, No right 's'.\n    - etc. for other specific colors.\n\n    Pairs so far: `(3, 1), (4, 9), (2, 2), (6, 8)`\n\n    Remaining `left_boots_by_color`:\n    `'c': [0, 7]`, `'e': [9]`, `'f': [4]`, `'s': [6]`\n    Remaining `right_boots_by_color`:\n    `'d': [3]`, `'i': [2]`, `'v': [4]`, `'t': [5]`, `'h': [6]`\n\n3.  **Specific with '?' matches:**\n    No '?' boots in this example.\n\n4.  **'?' with '?' matches:**\n    No '?' boots in this example.\n\nThe example output is:\n`5`\n`7 8`\n`4 9`\n`2 2`\n`9 10`\n`3 1`\n\nMy trace got `(3,1), (4,9), (2,2)`. `(6,8)` is `(r,r)` match.\nThe example output has `(7,8)` which is `l[6]` 's' and `r[7]` 'r'. This is not an exact match. Ah, the example output is for `codeforces` and `dodivthree`.\nLet's re-examine the example output:\n`7 8`: `l[6]`='s', `r[7]`='r'. Not compatible. This suggests my understanding of the example output provided is wrong, or the example output is not from the provided problem description.\nWait, the example input is `['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']`.\nThe *first* example input is `10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree`.\nThe *first* example output is `5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1`.\nLet's check the indices and colors:\n`l`: c(0) o(1) d(2) e(3) f(4) o(5) r(6) c(7) e(8) s(9)\n`r`: d(0) o(1) d(2) i(3) v(4) t(5) h(6) r(7) e(8) e(9)\n\n`7 8`: `l[6]`='r', `r[7]`='r'. (Correct, exact match)\n`4 9`: `l[3]`='e', `r[8]`='e'. (Correct, exact match)\n`2 2`: `l[1]`='o', `r[1]`='o'. (Correct, exact match)\n`9 10`: `l[8]`='e', `r[9]`='e'. (Correct, exact match)\n`3 1`: `l[2]`='d', `r[0]`='d'. (Correct, exact match)\n\nAll 5 pairs are exact specific color matches. My initial trace had an error in reading `l[6]` and `l[8]`.\nThe greedy strategy is correct.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Use `collections.deque` for `left_boots_by_color` and `right_boots_by_color` for efficient `popleft()`.\n- Map characters 'a'-'z' to integers 0-25, and '?' to 26.\n- The result will be a list of `(left_idx, right_idx)` tuples.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store indices of boots by color.\n    # We'll use 0-25 for 'a'-'z', and 26 for '?'.\n    left_boots_by_color = [deque() for _ in range(27)]\n    right_boots_by_color = [deque() for _ in range(27)]\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        char_code = ord(l_str[i]) - ord('a') if l_str[i] != '?' else 26\n        left_boots_by_color[char_code].append(i)\n\n        char_code = ord(r_str[i]) - ord('a') if r_str[i] != '?' else 26\n        right_boots_by_color[char_code].append(i)\n\n    # List to store the resulting pairs (1-based indices)\n    result_pairs = []\n\n    # 1.
