Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Vanya and Cards\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem.  Let me break this down logically. The core challenge is making the final sum of the cards equal to zero. Vanya can only use cards with values between `-x` and `x`. He's given the initial cards (n of them) and their values. My task is to figure out the *minimum* number of additional cards he needs to achieve a sum of zero.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the initial sum, let's call it `S`, from the given input cards. If `S` is already zero, that's trivial; no additional cards are required, and I'll return 0.\n\nNow, if `S` isn't zero, things get interesting. I need to figure out what `S_additional` (the sum of the new cards) should be to get a total of zero.  Clearly, `S + S_additional = 0`, therefore, `S_additional = -S`.\n\nMy goal is to minimize the *number* of additional cards. To do that, I need to maximize the value of each additional card, or minimize the number. Let's think about the two scenarios:\n\n*   If `S` is positive, then I need `S_additional` to be negative.  The best strategy is to use cards with the largest *negative* value, which is `-x`. I'll divide `S` by `x` and round up (using `ceil()`) to determine how many `-x` cards are needed to reach `-S`.\n\n*   If `S` is negative, then I need `S_additional` to be positive. Similarly, I'll use cards with the largest *positive* value, `x`. I'll calculate `|S|/x` and use `ceil()` to find the required count of `x` cards to reach `-S`.\n\nIn essence, I'm finding the smallest whole number of cards that can add to the needed total. Regardless of whether `S` is positive or negative, the process boils down to:\n\n1.  Calculate `S` from the input cards.\n2.  `target_sum_additional = -S`\n3.  Calculate the number of additional cards needed: `ceil(|S| / x)`.\n\nThat logic looks pretty solid and efficient. I can translate this directly into a Python function, and I think I'm ready to code it!\n",
