They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Mushroom Strife Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem, and my first instinct is to break down the core logic. We've got `n` lawns, `m` roads, and for each road, we know the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. Our goal is to figure out the number of mushrooms on each lawn, or determine if it's impossible. Mushroom counts have to be between 1 and 10^6.\n\nThe heart of this problem hinges on the relationship between GCD and LCM. I immediately recognize the key property: `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`. That's the starting point.\n\nFor any edge between lawns `u` and `v`, with GCD `g` and LCM `l`, the above means `m_u * m_v = g * l`. Crucially, we also know that `g` must divide both `m_u` and `m_v`, and both `m_u` and `m_v` must divide `l`.\n\nNow, if we rewrite the equation using the GCD, `m_u * m_v = g * l`, we get to `(m_u / g) * (m_v / g) = l / g`. I'll define `a' = m_u / g` and `b' = m_v / g`. We can see that `a' * b' = l / g`, and importantly, `GCD(a', b') = 1`. This means `a'` and `b'` are coprime.\n\nThis is where the magic happens. Let's say we have an edge, `(u,v)` with `g = GCD` and `l = LCM`. If I know `m_u`, I can find `m_v` using `m_v = (g * l) / m_u`. However, this is just a necessary condition, we must also ensure that `GCD(m_u, m_v) = g` and `LCM(m_u, m_v) = l`. The product `m_u * m_v = g * l` will be true by our calculations.\n\nIf `m_u = k * g`, where `k` is an integer, then `m_v = l / k`. For `GCD(m_u, m_v) = g`, it needs `GCD(k, l/k) = 1`. It also means that `m_u` divides `l` and that `m_v` divides `l`.\nThe key takeaway here is: if we have an edge, with `GCD=g` and `LCM=l`, and we know `m_u`:\n\n1.  `m_u` MUST be a multiple of `g`.\n2.  `m_u` MUST divide `l`.\n3.  We can then calculate `m_v = (g * l) / m_u`.\n\nBased on the edge conditions, I'll need to develop an algorithm that processes the connections and values while checking for valid solutions at each edge.  This is a good start. I can feel the Python script coming together.\n",
