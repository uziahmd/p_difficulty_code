The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "**The Snowflake Solution: A Deep Dive**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to write a Python script for the \"Rudolf and Snowflakes (hard version)\" problem.  We're given a number *n* and need to determine if it can be represented as the sum of a geometric series, specifically in the form `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m` where *k* is an integer greater than 1, and *m* is an integer greater than or equal to 2. This represents the structure of a snowflake, and we're just trying to figure out if a given number of vertices can be represented by that formula.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the formula.  We can rewrite this geometric series as `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.  This equation has two key variables: *k* (the branching factor) and *m* (the number of layers of branches). Our input number, *n*, is constrained to be less than or equal to 10^18. This constraint will be important in optimizing our search.\n\nNow, let's strategize. I'll need to check for different values of *m* to see if there's a corresponding integer value for *k*.\n\n*   **Case 1:  m = 2:** This is the easiest case.  We're looking at `n = 1 + k + k^2`.  I can rearrange this into a quadratic equation: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.  Using the quadratic formula, I can solve for *k*.  For *k* to be an integer, the discriminant ( `4n - 3`) must be a perfect square, and the resulting *k* must be greater than 1. This condition must also result in an odd square root (to give an integer answer)\n\n*   **Iterating for m > 2:** Since we're dealing with values up to 10^18, larger values of m cause lower values of k, and this greatly effects the efficiency of my algorithm.\n\n    *   I'll iterate through possible values of *m*, starting from 3 and going up.\n    *   For each *m*, I'll use binary search to determine if there's a valid integer *k* that fits the formula `n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`. Binary search is very efficient as `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m` is monotonically increasing when *k* > 1.\n    *   I need to be very careful to avoid potential integer overflow during the calculation, especially when raising *k* to the power of *m*. I'll need to incorporate checks during the calculation to ensure the sum never exceeds *n*.\n\nA few important points to consider:\n\n*   **Finding the range for k:**  Since `n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`, we know that `k^(m+1)` must be less than `n * k`. Therefore, `k < n^(1/(m+1))` is an upper bound. This helps me narrow down the range for *k* within the binary search.\n*   **Integer Overflow:**  The input can go up to 10^18. I must be careful when calculating the power and sum to avoid overflow issues, or my algorithm will give the wrong answer.\n\nLet's summarize, I'm constructing an algorithm to solve this using these main steps:\n\n1.  Check for the *m = 2* case using the quadratic formula.\n2.  Iterate *m* values from 3 up to a reasonable limit (~58).\n3.  For each *m*, use binary search to find an appropriate *k*. Make sure to watch out for integer overflow!\n\nI think this structure will allow me to efficiently determine if a given *n* can represent the number of vertices in a snowflake with these restrictions!  Now, time to translate this into code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given integer `n` (up to `10^18`) can be represented as the total number of vertices in a snowflake graph. A snowflake is defined by a parameter `k > 1` and a number of \"layers\" `m >= 2`. The total number of vertices `n` is given by the sum of a geometric series:\n`n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`\n\nThis sum can be expressed as `n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\nWe need to find if there exist integers `k > 1` and `m >= 2` that satisfy this equation for a given `n`.\n\nLet's break down the approach:\n\n1.  **Constraints on `m`**:\n    Since `k >= 2`, the smallest possible sum for a given `m` occurs when `k=2`:\n    `n = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^(m+1) - 1`.\n    Given `n <= 10^18`, we have `2^(m+1) - 1 <= 10^18`, which implies `2^(m+1) <= 10^18 + 1`.\n    Taking `log2` on both sides: `m+1 <= log2(10^18 + 1)`.\n    `log2(10^18) = 18 * log2(10) approx 18 * 3.3219 approx 59.79`.\n    So, `m+1` can be at most 59, which means `m` can be at most 58.\n    This tells us that `m` is a small integer, ranging from 2 to 58.\n\n2.  **Case `m = 2`**:\n    For `m=2`, the equation is `n = 1 + k + k^2`.\n    This is a quadratic equation in `k`: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\n    Using the quadratic formula `k = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`:\n    `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(1^2 - 4 * 1 * (1 - n))) / 2 * 1`\n    `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(1 - 4 + 4n)) / 2`\n    `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`\n    For `k` to be an integer greater than 1:\n    *   `4n - 3` must be a perfect square. Let `4n - 3 = x^2` for some integer `x`.\n    *   Since `k > 1`, we must take the positive root: `k = (-1 + x) / 2`.\n    *   This requires `x` to be odd (so `x-1` is even) and `x > 3` (so `k = (x-1)/2 > 1`).\n    We can check this directly: calculate `val = 4n - 3`. If `val` is a perfect square `x^2`, and `x` is odd and `x > 3`, then `k = (x-1)/2` is a valid `k`.\n\n3.  **Case `m >= 3`**:\n    For `m` from 3 up to 58, we need to find if there's an integer `k > 1` such that `n = 1 + k + ... + k^m`.\n    The function `f(k) = 1 + k + ... + k^m` is strictly increasing for `k > 1`. This allows us to use binary search for `k`.\n    *   **Search range for `k`**:\n        *   Lower bound: `k_min = 2`.\n        *   Upper bound: `k^m < n`, so `k < n^(1/m)`. A safe upper bound for binary search would be `int(n**(1/m)) + 2`. For `n=10^18` and `m=3`, `k_max` is roughly `10^6`. For larger `m`, `k_max` decreases significantly.\n    *   **Binary Search**:\n        *   Initialize `low = 2`, `high = int(n**(1/m)) + 2`.\n        *   While `low <= high`:\n            *   `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n            *   Calculate `current_sum = 1 + mid + ... + mid^m`.\n                *   **Important**: Be careful about potential overflow when calculating `mid^j` or `current_sum`. If `current_sum` exceeds `n` at any point, we can stop summing and treat it as `> n`.\n            *   If `current_sum == n`, we found a solution (`k=mid, m`). Output \"YES\" and terminate.\n            *   If `current_sum < n`, we need a larger `k`, so `low = mid + 1`.\n            *   If `current_sum > n`, we need a smaller `k`, so `high = mid - 1`.\n    *   If the binary search completes without finding `n`, no `k` exists for that `m`.\n\n**Algorithm Summary:**\n\n1.  Handle `n=1`: Snowflakes require `k > 1` and `m >= 2`, so minimum vertices is `1+2+2^2 = 7`. Thus `n=1` is always \"NO\".\n2.  **Check `m=2`**:\n    *   Calculate `val = 4 * n - 3`.\n    *   If `val < 0`, no solution.\n    *   Calculate `x = round(sqrt(val))`. `math.isqrt` is preferred for integer square root.\n    *   If `x * x == val` (perfect square) AND `x % 2 == 1` (x is odd) AND `x > 3` (ensures `k > 1`), then output \"YES\".\n3.  **Check `m` from 3 to 58**:\n    *   For each `m`:\n        *   Perform binary search for `k` in range `[2, int(n**(1/m)) + 2]`.\n        *   Inside binary search, calculate `current_sum = 1 + k + ... + k^m` with overflow checks.\n        *   If `current_sum == n`, output \"YES\" and return.\n4.  If no solution is found after all checks, output \"NO\".\n\n**Helper function for sum calculation:**\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(k, m, n_target):\n    current_sum = 0\n    power_k = 1\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n        current_sum += power_k\n        if current_sum > n_target:\n            return n_target + 1 # Indicate overflow / too large\n        if _ < m: # Only multiply if not the last term\n            # Check for potential overflow before multiplication: power_k * k > n_target\n            if k > n_target // power_k: # power_k * k would exceed n_target\n                power_k = n_target + 1 # Mark as overflow\n            else:\n                power_k *= k\n    return current_sum\n```\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   `m=2` check: `O(log n)` due to `sqrt` and arithmetic with large numbers.\n*   Loop for `m`: `~56` iterations (from 3 to 58).\n*   Inside `m` loop:\n    *   Binary search for `k`: `log(n^(1/m))` iterations, which is `(1/m) * log(n)`. Max `log(10^18) approx 60` for `m=3`.\n    *   `calculate_sum` function: `m+1` iterations.
