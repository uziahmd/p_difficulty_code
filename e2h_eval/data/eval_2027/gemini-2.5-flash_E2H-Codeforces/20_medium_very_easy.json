For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Dynamic Programming with Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)**\n\nI'm tackling a challenging competitive programming problem! The goal is to count the number of ways to pick values `c_s` for binary strings `s` (length 1 to `n`), such that the maximum size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of these strings is precisely `f`. The values `c_s` range from 0 to `k`.  A beautiful multiset ensures that for any prefix `s`, the count of strings with `s` as a prefix doesn't exceed `c_s`.\n\nThe problem feels like a flow or tree-dynamic programming problem on a binary trie. I visualized a trie of depth `n` where each node represents a binary string.  The count constraint, `count(s) <= c_s`, translates to a capacity constraint. My initial thought was to use a greedy approach on this trie: for each string `s`, determine the maximum number of times it could be in the multiset (which is limited by its `c_s` value). I realized this translates to `min(c_s, sum of capacities of its children)` for each internal node. The multiset's total size would then be the root's value (the sum of its children's counts)\n\nHowever, calculating the total number of valid `c_s` assignments seems computationally expensive, because I'm basically calculating the number of ways to arrange the subtrees, limited by how many strings there can be. There are  `2(2^n-1)` binary strings, with `n=15` strings, meaning roughly 65,000 strings. So choosing `(k+1)` values for `c_s` leads to `(k+1)^65000` possibilities!  This is clearly too large.\n\nInstead of directly assigning values, I can build a dynamic programming strategy to count the number of valid `c_s` assignments. Let's define `dp[L][val]` as the number of ways to assign `c_s` values *within a single subtree* (rooted at depth L), such that the maximum multiset size within that subtree is exactly `val`. The total max multiset size for the entire problem is exactly `f`. `0 <= val <= f`. Since subtrees at same depth are structurally identical, I can focus on one subtree.\n\n*   **Base Case:** At depth `n` (leaf nodes), `dp[n][val] = 1` if `val=c_s` (so there's just one way to achieve this `val`). Else, `dp[n][val]=0`.\n*   **Recursive Step:** For depth `L < n`, `dp[L][val]` is calculated by combining results from its children at depth `L+1`. Let `Q[L+1][S]` be the number of ways to achieve a total count `S` in the two subtrees from its children.  I'm trying to calculate how many times `v0+v1 = val` given values for each subtree.  Crucially, `dp[L][val]` is derived from `min(c_s, subtree_value0 + subtree_value1)`. So I need to consider all combinations of `v0` and `v1` which result in the min `c_s` = `val`. This screams \"convolution\"!\n\nI realized that `dp[L][val]` is essentially a convolution of the `dp` table from the next level (`L+1`). Calculating `Q` efficiently requires Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), since the problem specifies modulo arithmetic. The computation for Q[L+1] takes  `f log f` time, and it needs to be done for levels 1 to n. The main loop will iterate through the trie depths.\n\nSince I am considering all combinations of child values, there will be the need to consider all values from 0 to `2f`. I will be computing intermediate suffix sums, in order to get all the counts I need. The intermediate steps, like prefix sums, will require iterating from 0 to 2\\*f.\n\nTo avoid memory limitations, I will need to iterate on this efficiently, using FFT to compute the results. Finally, I need to obtain `dp[1][f]`, and apply the modulo operation (as per constraints), for the final answer. The total complexity will be `O(n * f log f)`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the `c_s` values.\nLet `x_t` be the number of times a specific string `t` (of length `n`) appears in the multiset. The total size of the multiset is `sum(x_t)` over all `2^n` strings `t` of length `n`.\nFor any binary string `s` of length `L` (`1 <= L <= n`), the condition `count(s) <= c_s` means that the sum of `x_t` for all `t` of length `n` that have `s` as a prefix must not exceed `c_s`.\nThis structure can be modeled using a complete binary trie of depth `n`. Each node in the trie corresponds to a binary string. A node `s` at depth `L` (representing a string of length `L`) has two children `s0` and `s1` at depth `L+1`. Leaf nodes are at depth `n`.\n\nLet `dp[s]` be the maximum possible sum of `x_t` for `t` in the subtree rooted at `s`.\nIf `s` is a leaf node (length `n`), then `dp[s] = c_s`.\nIf `s` is an internal node (length `L < n`), then `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset for the entire trie is `dp[\\text{root}]` (if we consider an implicit root for the empty string), which is equivalent to `dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"]` (for strings \"0\" and \"1\" of length 1), subject to `c_0` and `c_1` respectively.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to choose `c_s` values such that `dp[\\text{root}]` (or `dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"]`) is exactly `f`.\nSince all subtrees at the same depth `L` are structurally identical, we can use dynamic programming on the depth `L`.\nLet `P[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all strings in a *specific subtree rooted at depth L* such that the maximum possible count for that subtree is `val`.\nThe values `val` are capped at `f`, because we are ultimately interested in the sum `f`. The `c_s` values are capped at `k`.\n\nBase case: `L = n`.\nFor a leaf node `s` at depth `n`, `dp[s] = c_s`. So `P[n][val]` is the number of ways to choose `c_s` such that `c_s = val`. There's only `1` way for each `val` from `0` to `k`.\nSo, `P[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k` (and `val <= f`), and `0` otherwise.\n\nRecursive step: `L < n`.\nTo compute `P[L][val]`, we consider a node `s` at depth `L` and its children `s0, s1` at depth `L+1`.\n`dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`. We iterate over possible values for `c_s` (`0` to `k`).\nLet `v0 = dp[s0]` and `v1 = dp[s1]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v0` for `s0`'s subtree is `P[L+1][v0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v1` for `s1`'s subtree is `P[L+1][v1]`.\nLet `Q[L+1][S] = sum_{v0+v1=S} P[L+1][v0] * P[L+1][v1]`. This `Q[L+1]` represents the number of ways to get a sum `S` from the two children subtrees. This is a polynomial convolution.\nFor a chosen `c_s`, we need `min(c_s, S) = val`.\n1. If `S < c_s`, then `S = val`. This means `v0+v1 = val`. This is valid if `val < c_s`.\n2. If `S >= c_s`, then `c_s = val`. This means `v0+v1 >= val`. This is valid if `c_s = val`.\n\nCombining these, for a fixed `val`:\n`P[L][val] = sum_{c_s=val+1 to k} Q[L+1][val] + sum_{c_s=val} sum_{S=val to 2f} Q[L+1][S]`\nLet `S_Q[L+1][X] = sum_{j=X to 2f} Q[L+1][j]` be the suffix sums of `Q[L+1]`.\nThen, `P[L][val] = (max(0, k - val)) * Q[L+1][val] + (S_Q[L+1][val] if val <= k else 0)`.\nAll calculations are performed modulo `998244353`.\n\nThe maximum value `val` can take is `f`. So `P[L]` arrays have size `f+1`.\nThe convolution `Q[L+1]` will have values up to `2f`.\nThe computation proceeds iteratively:\nStart with `dp_curr = P[n]`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `n-1` (to compute `P[n-1], P[n-2], ..., P[1]`):\n1. Compute `Q_next` by convolving `dp_curr` with itself: `Q_next = dp_curr * dp_curr`. This can be done efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in `O(f log f)` time. The resulting polynomial coefficients `Q_next[S]` store `Q[L+1][S]`.\n2. Compute suffix sums `S_Q_next` from `Q_next`. This takes `O(f)` time.\n3. Compute `dp_next` (which is `P[L]`) using the formula: `dp_next[val] = (max(0, k - val)) * Q_next[val] + (S_Q_next[val] if val <= k else 0)`. This takes `O(f)` time.\n4. Set `dp_curr = dp_next`.\n\nAfter `n-1` iterations, `dp_curr` will hold `P[1]`.\nThe final answer is the number of ways to achieve a total sum of `f` for the entire trie. This means `dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"] = f`. This is exactly `Q[1][f]`, where `Q[1] = P[1] * P[1]`.\nSo, one last convolution `multiply(dp_curr, dp_curr)` is performed, and the coefficient at index `f` is the answer.\n\nThe total time complexity will be `O(n * f log f)` due to `n-1` NTT operations and `O(f)` operations per level. Given `n <= 15` and `f <= 2 \\cdot 10^5`, this is roughly `15 * 2 \\cdot 10^5 * log(4 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 * 2 \\cdot 10^5 * 19 \\approx 5.7 \\cdot 10^7`, which is feasible within typical time limits for competitive programming, even in Python.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Modulo for calculations\nMOD = 998244353\n# Primitive root for NTT\nG = 3\nINV_G = pow(G, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) on list 'a'.\n    If 'invert' is True, performs inverse NTT.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(a)\n    \n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    # Iterative NTT butterfly operations\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        w_len = pow(INV_G if invert else G, (MOD - 1) // (2 * len_half), MOD)\n        for i in range(0, n, 2 * len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + len_half + j] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + len_half + j] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_len) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    # Scale by inverse of N for inverse NTT\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\n    return a\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Multiplies two polynomials (represented by lists of coefficients)\n    using NTT.\n    \"\"\"\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # The result polynomial will have degree len_a + len_b - 2,\n    # so it will have len_a + len_b - 1 coefficients.\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    # Pad to the next power of 2 for NTT\n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n\n    # Perform NTT\n    a_fft = ntt(a_padded, False)\n    b_fft = ntt(b_padded, False)\n\n    # Pointwise multiplication in frequency domain\n    c_fft = [(x * y) % MOD for x, y in zip(a_fft, b_fft)]\n    \n    # Perform inverse NTT\n    c = ntt(c_fft, True)\n    \n    # Return coefficients up to result_len\n    return c[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp_curr represents P[L][val]\n    # Initially, dp_curr = P[n], where P[n][val] = 1 for 0 <= val <= k\n    # and val <= f.\n    dp_curr = [0] * (f + 1)\n    for val in range(min(f, k) + 1):\n        dp_curr[val] = 1\n\n    # Iterate n-1 times to compute P[n-1], P[n-2], ..., P[1]\n    # Each iteration computes P[L] from P[L+1]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        # Calculate Q_next = dp_curr * dp_curr\n        # dp_curr has length f+1.
