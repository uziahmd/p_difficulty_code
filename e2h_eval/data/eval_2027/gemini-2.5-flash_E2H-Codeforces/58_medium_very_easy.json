You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment & Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, so I'm tackling a competitive programming challenge. The core is to figure out the bare minimum of edges (`t`) we have to tack onto an undirected graph to force it to have a simple odd cycle, and also the number of unique ways (`w`) of doing this. The input consists of `n` vertices, `m` edges, and I need to handle cases where the graph is disconnected or doesn't initially have any odd cycles.  No loops or parallel edges allowed when adding new edges.\n\n**Bipartite Graphs & Cycles**\n\nI quickly realize a crucial concept here: a graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it's not bipartite.  A bipartite graph's vertices can be split into two color-coded groups (U and V) where every edge neatly crosses between the groups. So, I'll need to use this bipartite property as my main tool.\n\n**Case Analysis: t = 0 (Odd Cycle Exists)**\n\nIf the graph *already* has an odd cycle, `t` is simply zero, and `w` is 1 (there's only one way to add no edges). I'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) with a 2-coloring approach to efficiently check if any component contains an odd cycle. I start coloring a vertex, and when I move to its neighbour, I check if its colour is the same.  If I find a colour conflict, bingo, an odd cycle is present!\n\n**Case Analysis: t = 1 (One Edge Creates an Odd Cycle)**\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, I check for situations where adding a single edge will force an odd cycle (`t = 1`).  To force an odd cycle, the new edge needs to connect two vertices within the *same* connected component that have the *same* color.  I can determine the number of vertices in each color class (`cnt0`, `cnt1`) within a component. The number of ways I can do this within the component is `(cnt0 * (cnt0 - 1) / 2) + (cnt1 * (cnt1 - 1) / 2)`. If I sum up these values over all the connected components, it gives me 'w', the number of ways I can add a single edge and make a cycle.\n\n**Case Analysis: t = 2 (Two Edges Needed)**\n\nIf neither `t = 0` nor `t = 1` work, then `t` must be 2. In this case, the graph is bipartite. Adding one edge doesn't produce an odd cycle, because within each connected component, there are no two vertices with the same color that aren't already connected, meaning each component can only consist of vertices with a maximum color of one (isolated vertices or single edges).  To form an odd cycle with two edges, I'll need to join different connected components together, and those components must each consist of isolated vertices or edges.\n\nSpecifically, I'm thinking about the scenario of merging two isolated vertices with the added edge; then a second added edge must form a triangle with the original vertices.\n\n**Refinement of Logic for t=2**\n\nIf `w` for `t=1` is 0, then each component has at most one of each color. This means they are either isolated vertices or single edges. We need at least 3 vertices to make this possible.  Let's consider the case where we can connect a vertex in one component to another vertex in a different component with one edge, then another connection to the original component. This creates an odd cycle. This configuration is always going to require two edges.\n\n**Finalized Solution**\n\nEssentially, the algorithm will break down into the following steps:\n\n1.  **Check for existing odd cycles:** Using 2-coloring (BFS/DFS), check all the connected components. If any conflict is found, set t=0, w=1 and exit.\n2.  **Check for t=1:** If no odd cycle, the graph is bipartite. Iterate through the components, perform 2-coloring and count vertices of each color. `w` becomes the sum of the combinations calculated within each component. If `w > 0`, output `t=1, w`.\n3.  **Calculate t=2:** If both previous conditions fail, the graph is bipartite, but we cannot create an odd cycle with 1 additional edge. Then we have to consider if we need to add 2 edges. Determine number of isolated vertices.  The logic described above applies: t = 2, w = N_iso * N_edge_comp, when N_iso >= 1 and N_edge_comp >= 1 (where N_iso is the number of isolated vertices and N_edge_comp is",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so. The graph can be disconnected, has no parallel edges or loops. Added edges must also not be loops or parallel to existing edges.\n\nAn undirected graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. Our strategy will be to check for an odd cycle, and if not found, determine the minimum `t` based on the graph's bipartite structure.\n\nWe can use a 2-coloring algorithm (e.g., BFS or DFS) to check if the graph is bipartite and to color its connected components.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialize:**\n    *   `color` array: `[-1]` for unvisited, `0` or `1` for colored.\n    *   `is_bipartite = True`.\n    *   `component_info`: A list to store `(cnt0, cnt1)` for each connected component, where `cnt0` is the count of vertices colored `0` and `cnt1` is the count of vertices colored `1`.\n\n2.  **2-Coloring and Odd Cycle Detection (t=0):**\n    *   Iterate through each vertex `i` from `1` to `n`.\n    *   If `i` is unvisited (`color[i] == -1`):\n        *   Start a BFS/DFS from `i`.\n        *   Initialize `current_cnt0 = 0`, `current_cnt1 = 0`.\n        *   Assign `color[i] = 0`. Add `i` to a queue/stack.\n        *   While the queue/stack is not empty:\n            *   Dequeue/pop `u`.\n            *   If `color[u] == 0`, increment `current_cnt0`.\n            *   Else (`color[u] == 1`), increment `current_cnt1`.\n            *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n                *   If `v` is unvisited (`color[v] == -1`):\n                    *   Assign `color[v] = 1 - color[u]`.\n                    *   Enqueue/push `v`.\n                *   Else if `color[v] == color[u]`:\n                    *   An odd cycle is found.

(An odd cycle already exists).\n\n3.  **Calculate Ways for t=1 (if graph is bipartite):**\n    *   If `is_bipartite` is `True` (the graph is bipartite):\n        *   We need to add one edge `(u, v)` such that `u` and `v` are in the same connected component and have the same color. This creates an odd cycle.\n        *   Calculate `ways1 = 0`.\n        *   For each `(cnt0, cnt1)` in `component_info`:\n            *   `ways1 += (cnt0 * (cnt0 - 1) // 2)` (ways to pick two vertices of color 0)\n            *   `ways1 += (cnt1 * (cnt1 - 1) // 2)` (ways to pick two vertices of color 1)\n        *   If `ways1 > 0`:\n            *   Output `1 ways1` and terminate.\n\n4.  **Calculate Ways for t=2 or t=3 (if t=0 and t=1 fail):**\n    *   If `t=0` and `t=1` conditions failed, it means:\n        *   The graph is bipartite.\n        *   For every connected component `C_i`, `cnt0_i < 2` AND `cnt1_i < 2`. This implies that each component is either an isolated vertex (size 1) or a single edge (size 2).\n    *   Count `num_isolated_vertices = 0` and `num_edge_components = 0`.\n    *   For each `(cnt0, cnt1)` in `component_info`:\n        *   If `cnt0 == 1` and `cnt1 == 0` (or vice versa), it's an isolated vertex. `num_isolated_vertices += 1`.\n        *   If `cnt0 == 1` and `cnt1 == 1`, it's a single edge component. `num_edge_components += 1`.\n\n    *   **Case A: t=2**\n        *   If `num_isolated_vertices >= 1` AND `num_edge_components >= 1`:\n            *   We can form an odd cycle of length 3 by picking an isolated vertex `u` and an existing edge `(v, x)` (which forms a component).\n            *   Add edges `(u, v)` and `(u, x)`. This creates a triangle `u-v-x-u`.\n            *   The number of ways `w` is `num_isolated_vertices * num_edge_components`.\n            *   Output `2 w` and terminate.\n\n    *   **Case B: t=3**\n        *   If `num_edge_components == 0` (all vertices are isolated, `m=0`):\n            *   We need at least 3 vertices to form a cycle.\n            *   If `n < 3`, no cycle is possible. The problem constraints `1 <= n <= 10^5` mean `n` can be small. However, the example `3 0` output `3 1` suggests we should handle `n >= 3` for this case. If `n < 3`, no cycle can be formed, but competitive programming problems usually guarantee valid scenarios or specify behavior. Assuming `n >= 3` for this case:\n            *   We must pick three distinct isolated vertices `u, v, x`.\n            *   Add edges `(u, v)`, `(v, x)`, and `(x, u)` to form a triangle `u-v-x-u`. This requires `t=3` edges.\n            *   The number of ways `w` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` (number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices).\n            *   Output `3 w` and terminate.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n\n*   **Input 1:** `4 4`, `1 2`, `1 3`, `4 2`, `4 3`\n    *   Graph: `1-2`, `1-3`, `4-2`, `4-3`.
