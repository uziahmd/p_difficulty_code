Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Counting Non-Degenerate Triangles with Integer Sides**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to count the number of non-degenerate triangles. The sides of these triangles, which I'll call *x*, *y*, and *z*, are integers and must satisfy some specific constraints: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the conditions for a valid non-degenerate triangle.  It's that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.  Given that we have  `x <= y <= z`, two of these inequalities are automatically satisfied.  Since `x, y, z` are positive, and since `x <= y <= z`, the two conditions `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` are always met. So, the only critical condition is `x + y > z`.\n\nNow, considering the bounds, I need to iterate over all possible values of *x* and *y* within their respective ranges.  A nested loop seems efficient here: the outer loop for *x* (from A to B) and the inner loop for *y* (from B to C).\n\nFor each pair of *x* and *y*, I need to figure out how many possible values of *z* work.  *z* has to be within the range `[C, D]` and also less than the sum of *x* and *y*. So, *z* must satisfy `C <= z < x + y`. Also,  `z <= D`.\nCombining these conditions, *z* must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.  So, for each valid pair (x, y), the count of *z* is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet me think about the efficiency. `A, B, C, D` can be as large as `5 * 10^5`. A direct, triple-nested loop would be `O((B-A+1)(C-B+1)(D-C+1))`, which could get very large. However, my approach here is to iterate over x and y and count how many z values works for each pair.  Since the constraints limit the ranges of x, y and z, this is a much more optimized approach and more manageable. I should be able to make this work efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFor a triangle with sides `x, y, z` to be non-degenerate, it must satisfy the triangle inequality:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x, y, z` being positive integers and `x <= y <= z`:\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, we have `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. This condition is always satisfied.\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= C >= B >= y >= x`, we have `y + z >= x + x = 2x > x` (as `x >= 1`). This condition is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only condition we need to check for non-degeneracy is `x + y > z`.\n\nWe need to find the number of integer triples `(x, y, z)` satisfying:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nLet's iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`.\nThe variable `x` can range from `A` to `B`.\nThe variable `y` can range from `B` to `C`.\n\nFor each pair `(x, y)`, we need to count the number of `z` values that satisfy both `C <= z <= D` and `z < x + y`.\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a fixed `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive iteration over `x` and `y` would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`. Given `D <= 5 * 10^5`, in the worst case `B-A+1` can be `5 * 10^5` and `C-B+1` can be `5 * 10^5`. This leads to `(5 * 10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^{11}` operations, which is too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let `S = x + y`.\nFor a fixed `x`, `y` ranges from `B` to `C`.\nThe sum `S = x + y` will range from `x + B` to `x + C`.\nThe maximum possible value for `S` is `B + C`, and the minimum is `A + B`.\nThe maximum value for `z` is `D`. So `x + y - 1` can be at most `D`.\nThus, `S = x + y` can be at most `D + 1`.\n\nLet's fix `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, we iterate `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThe number of valid `z` values is `min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1`.\nLet `max_z = x + y - 1`. We need to count `z` such that `C <= z <= min(D, max_z)`.\nThis is equivalent to `max(0, min(D, max_z) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe term `x + y - 1` depends on `y`.\nAs `y` increases, `x + y - 1` increases.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `x, y` is `count_z(x, y) = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nLet's rewrite the sum:\n`total_triangles = sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} count_z(x, y)`\n\nThe maximum possible value for `x + y - 1` is `B + C - 1`.\nThe maximum value for `D` is `5 * 10^5`.\nThe maximum value for `C` is `5 * 10^5`.\nThe maximum value for `x + y - 1` is `B + C - 1 <= 5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 - 1 = 10^6 - 1`.\n\nLet's iterate `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, we need to sum `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)` for `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThe term `x + y - 1` changes with `y`.\nLet `k = x + y`. Then `z` must be less than `k`.\nThe number of valid `z` for `(x, y)` is `max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThis expression for `count_z` is constant for `k - 1 >= D` (i.e., `k > D`), where it becomes `D - C + 1`.\nIt's also constant for `k - 1 <= C` (i.e., `k <= C + 1`), where it becomes `max(0, k - 1 - C + 1) = max(0, k - C)`.\nIn the range `C < k - 1 < D`, it is `k - 1 - C + 1 = k - C`.\n\nLet's define `f(k) = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\nWe need to calculate `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} f(x + y)`.\n\nThis is a sum over `x+y`. This structure often suggests a convolution or a frequency array approach.\nLet `freq_y[s]` be the number of ways `y` can be chosen such that `y=s` and `B <= s <= C`. This is 1 for `B <= s <= C` and 0 otherwise.\nLet `freq_x[s]` be the number of ways `x` can be chosen such that `x=s` and `A <= s <= B`. This is 1 for `A <= s <= B` and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe are interested in `x + y`. Let `S = x + y`.\nThe minimum sum `S_min = A + B`.\nThe maximum sum `S_max = B + C`.\nWe can precompute the number of pairs `(x, y)` that sum to `S`.\nFor a fixed `S`, the possible values for `x` are `A` to `B`.\nThe corresponding `y` value is `S - x`.\nSo `y` must satisfy `B <= S - x <= C`.\nThis means `S - C <= x <= S - B`.\nCombining with `A <= x <= B`, `x` must be in the range `[max(A, S - C), min(B, S - B)]`.\nLet `count_xy[S]` be the number of such pairs `(x, y)`.\n`count_xy[S] = max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`.\nThis `count_xy[S]` can be computed for `S` from `A+B` to `B+C`.\nThe maximum value for `B+C` is `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`.\nSo, computing `count_xy` takes `O(B+C)` time.\n\nOnce `count_xy[S]` is precomputed for all relevant `S`, the total number of triangles is:\n`total_triangles = sum_{S=A+B to B+C} count_xy[S] * f(S)`\nwhere `f(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe range of `S` is up to `10^6`. This sum can be computed in `O(B+C)` time.\nThe overall complexity will be `O(B+C)`, which is `O(max_val)`.\n`max_val = 5 * 10^5` for `D`, so `B+C` can be `10^6`. This is efficient enough.\n\nLet's trace the calculation of `count_xy[S]`:\n`count_xy[S] = max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`\nThe bounds for `x` are `x_min = max(A, S - C)` and `x_max = min(B, S - B)`.\nThe number of valid `x` values is `x_max - x_min + 1` if `x_max >= x_min`, else 0.\n\nExample 1: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4\n`x` in `[1, 2]`, `y` in `[2, 3]`, `z` in `[3, 4]`.\n`f(S) = max(0, min(4, S-1) - 3 + 1) = max(0, min(4, S-1) - 2)`.\n`S` ranges from `A+B = 1+2 = 3` to `B+C = 2+3 = 5`.\n\nLet's compute `count_xy[S]` for `S` from 3 to 5:\n- `S = 3`: `x_min = max(1, 3-3) = max(1, 0) = 1`. `x_max = min(2, 3-2) = min(2, 1) = 1`.\n  `count_xy[3] = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1`. (Pair: `x=1, y=2`)\n  `f(3) = max(0, min(4, 2) - 2) = max(0, 2 - 2) = 0`.\n  Contribution: `1 * 0 = 0`.\n- `S = 4`: `x_min = max(1, 4-3) = max(1, 1) = 1`. `x_max = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2`.\n  `count_xy[4] = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2`. (Pairs: `x=1, y=3`; `x=2, y=2`)\n  `f(4) = max(0, min(4, 3) - 2) = max(0, 3 - 2) = 1`.\n  Contribution: `2 * 1 = 2`.\n- `S = 5`: `x_min = max(1, 5-3) = max(1, 2) = 2`. `x_max = min(2, 5-2) = min(2, 3) = 2`.\n  `count_xy[5] = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`. (Pair: `x=2, y=3`)\n  `f(5) = max(0, min(4, 4) - 2) = max(0, 4 - 2) = 2`.\n  Contribution: `1 * 2 = 2`.\n\nTotal triangles = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.
