For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the competitive programming problem and my thought process for a Python solution:**\n\nI'm tasked with counting the number of ways to choose 'c' values for binary strings, given constraints on their length and how they form a \"beautiful\" multiset. The goal is to maximize the multiset size to exactly a value 'f', and the answer needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I broke down the problem.  The constraint that \"count(s) <= c_s\" for all prefixes 's' strongly suggests a trie or tree-based structure.  It reminds me of a max-flow or min-cost-max-flow, but the direct constraint on each 'c' value (0 to k) simplifies things.\n\nI realized I could define  `N(s)` as the maximum number of strings of length 'n' with prefix 's'. This leads to a dynamic programming approach on the trie: `N(s) = min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))` where s0 and s1 are s's children. The crucial insight is that the answer I seek is  `N('0') + N('1')`, the maximum size given the constraints, which has to equal `f`.\n\nThe challenge is to efficiently count the ways to set the 'c' values to achieve this maximum size of 'f'. I started thinking about trying all combinations, but that's exponential.  A dynamic programming approach seems more feasible. I want a `dp[L][val]` which is the count of ways to assign the `c_s'` values, such that  the total size of the multiset under consideration is 'val'. This 'L' represents the current length of the prefix.\n\nThe base case is simple: `dp[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`.  The key recurrence is derived from `N(s) = min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))`.  Given `N(s0) = val0` and `N(s1) = val1`, and fixed 'L',  I can have two cases, `c_s >= val0 + val1` and `c_s < val0 + val1`.\n\nThis directly suggests using convolution to efficiently compute combinations.  Let `B` be the convolution of the `dp` array at the next level, and calculate prefix sums to account for cases where `c_s` is smaller than the children's count. We need to iterate over all possible values and update. We will apply NTT to do fast convolution. The total time complexity for this looks to be about O(n*k log k), which should be fast enough.\n\nI need to apply NTT for the convolution as it offers the best performance for modular arithmetic with a specific prime modulus. I wrote out the details, I understand how NTT is implemented and how I should implement it for this problem. The code should now be a straightforward implementation of this DP strategy with NTT optimizations. The `f=0` cases and `f>2k` are taken into account. I should take care in the NTT and modular arithmetic.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of binary strings of length `n` is exactly `f`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how to calculate the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset for a given set of `c_s` values.\nLet `N(s)` be the maximum number of strings of length `n` in a beautiful multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nIf `s` has length `n`, then `N(s)` is simply `c_s`, because `s` itself is a string of length `n`, and the constraint `count(s) <= c_s` directly limits its occurrences.\nIf `s` has length `L < n`, any string `t` of length `n` having `s` as a prefix must either have `s0` as a prefix or `s1` as a prefix (where `s0` and `s1` are the two children of `s` in the binary trie). The total count of strings with prefix `s` is the sum of counts of strings with prefix `s0` and strings with prefix `s1`. However, this sum is also constrained by `c_s`. Thus, `N(s) = min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))`.\n\nThe problem specifies that `s` has length from `1` to `n`. The overall maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `N('0') + N('1')`, as strings starting with '0' and '1' are disjoint.\n\nSince all subtrees rooted at strings of the same length are structurally identical, we can use dynamic programming. Let `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` values for all strings `s'` in the subtree rooted at a generic string `s` of length `L`, such that `N(s)` (the maximum number of strings in the multiset with `s` as prefix) is `val`.\n\nThe base case is `L = n`:\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `N(s) = c_s`. Since `c_s` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, there is `1` way to choose `c_s` such that `N(s) = val` (namely, `c_s = val`), for each `val` in `[0, k]`.\nSo, `dp[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\nNow, for `L` from `n-1` down to `1`:\nTo compute `dp[L][val]`, we consider a generic string `s` of length `L`. It has two children, `s0` and `s1`, both of length `L+1`.\n`N(s) = min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))`.\nWe need to choose `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) and `c_s'` for all descendants of `s0` and `s1`.\nLet `val0 = N(s0)` and `val1 = N(s1)`.\nThe number of ways to get `N(s0) = val0` is `dp[L+1][val0]`.\nThe number of ways to get `N(s1) = val1` is `dp[L+1][val1]`.\nSince the choices for `s0`'s subtree and `s1`'s subtree are independent, the number of ways to achieve `N(s0) = val0` and `N(s1) = val1` is `dp[L+1][val0] * dp[L+1][val1]`.\n\nLet `current_dp = dp[L+1]`.\nWe need to sum `dp[L+1][val0] * dp[L+1][val1]` over various `val0, val1`. This is a convolution.\nLet `B[sum_children_N] = sum_{val0+val1 = sum_children_N} (dp[L+1][val0] * dp[L+1][val1])`.\n`B` can be computed by `current_dp * current_dp` (polynomial multiplication). The maximum possible `sum_children_N` is `2k`. So `B` will have length `2k+1`.\n\nNow, we compute `next_dp = dp[L]` for `val` from `0` to `k`:\n`N(s)` can take value `val`.\n1.  **Case 1: `N(s) = sum_children_N`**. This happens if `c_s >= sum_children_N`.\n    If `val = sum_children_N`, then `c_s` can be any value from `val` to `k`. There are `k - val + 1` choices for `c_s`.\n    This contributes `(k - val + 1) * B[val]` to `next_dp[val]`. This is valid only if `val <= k`.\n2.  **Case 2: `N(s) = c_s`**. This happens if `c_s < sum_children_N`.\n    If `val = c_s`, then `val` must be less than `sum_children_N`. For each `sum_children_N > val`, we choose `c_s = val` (1 way).\n    This contributes `B[sum_children_N]` to `next_dp[val]` for all `sum_children_N` from `val+1` up to `2k`.\n    The sum `sum_{j=val+1}^{2k} B[j]` can be efficiently calculated using suffix sums of `B`.\n    Let `S[x] = sum_{j=x}^{2k} B[j]`. Then this contribution is `S[val+1]`.\n\nCombining these:\nFor `val` from `0` to `k`:\n`next_dp[val] = ((k - val + 1) * B[val] + S[val+1]) % MOD`.\n(Note: `B[val]` is `0` if `val > 2k`, and `S[val+1]` is `0` if `val+1 > 2k`).\n\nThe maximum value for `k` is `2 * 10^5`. The arrays `dp`, `B`, `S` will have sizes proportional to `k` or `2k`. Polynomial multiplication using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) takes `O(M log M)` time, where `M` is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to the result degree (`2k+1`). For `k = 2 * 10^5`, `M` is `2^19 = 524288`.\nThere are `n-1` levels of DP calculation. So total time complexity is `O(n * k log k)`. With `n=15`, this is `14 * 2e5 * log(2e5) approx 5 * 10^7`, which is feasible.\n\nFinally, after computing `dp[1]`, the total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `N('0') + N('1')`. We need this sum to be exactly `f`.\n`N('0')` can be `val0` in `dp[1][val0]` ways.\n`N('1')` can be `val1` in `dp[1][val1]` ways.\nWe need `val0 + val1 = f`.\nThe total number of ways is `sum_{val0+val1=f} dp[1][val0] * dp[1][val1]`.\nThis is `(dp[1] * dp[1])[f]`, another polynomial multiplication.\n\nThe modulus `998244353` is a prime suitable for NTT, as it is of the form `c * 2^p + 1` (`119 * 2^23 + 1`).\n\nExample `n=1, k=42, f=2`:\n`L=n=1`. `current_dp = dp[1] = [1, 1, ..., 1]` (length `k+1 = 43`).\nFinal answer is `(dp[1] * dp[1])[f] = (dp[1] * dp[1])[2]`.\n`B = dp[1] * dp[1]` is a convolution.\n`B[val_sum]` is the number of pairs `(val0, val1)` such that `0 <= val0, val1 <= k` and `val0 + val1 = val_sum`.\nFor `val_sum = 2`: `(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)`. So `B[2] = 3`.
