Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Solution to the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this competitive programming problem. The goal is to determine if a pile of letters can perfectly form the combined name of a guest and a host.  My first instinct is to analyze the core requirement: the *counts* of each character must match exactly.  No extra letters, no missing letters. That's key.\n\nThe input is straightforward: three strings. Concatenating the guest and host names is simple enough. I'm thinking, \"character counting.\"  A dictionary seems appropriate, but for efficiency, `collections.Counter` in Python is perfect for this. It's built for counting frequencies. I'll create a `Counter` for the combined names and another for the pile.\n\nThe algorithm is clear:\n1.  Read the input strings.\n2.  Combine the guest and host names.\n3.  Count character frequencies using `collections.Counter`.\n4.  Compare the two `Counter` objects.  If they're equal, print \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO.\"\n\nThe implementation is pretty direct. I'll read the input, concatenate the names, create the `Counter` objects, and then compare them with `==`. That comparison is concise and efficient.  I remember that in competitive programming, the `collections.Counter` approach is often ideal.\n\nI'm making sure to handle the edge cases.  The problem states that the lines aren't empty and only contain uppercase Latin letters, which are helpful constraints.\n\nLet's do a mental check. If `combined_counts == pile_counts` is true, then all characters are present in the same quantity and type, precisely what the problem requires.  A mismatch means that the solution should be \"NO\" - that's correct. I'll use `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for potentially faster I/O since I'm trying to optimize.  Finally, after removing any unnecessary comments, I'm confident my solution is ready to submit.\n",
