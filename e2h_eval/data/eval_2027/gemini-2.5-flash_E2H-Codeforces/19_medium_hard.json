The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Elaboration: Maximizing Fan Count in a Tree**\n\nMy understanding of this problem, from an expert perspective, revolves around optimizing the selection of districts (nodes) in a tree, with the goal of maximizing the total \"fan count\" represented by these districts. The fan count is directly tied to the district's numerical index (i), with each district having 2<sup>i</sup> fans.  Essentially, I want to form a connected component with a high sum of district numbers, given that a fixed number (k) of districts must be removed, rendering them impassable.  This boils down to finding the best subgraph of size (n-k) that forms a connected component.\n\nMy initial approach considers a greedy strategy, where keeping high-indexed nodes seems beneficial.  However, connectivity is crucial.  Removing nodes doesn't just reduce the sum of indices, but it can potentially split the graph into unconnected components, which is not allowed.  My focus shifted to \"remove\" nodes instead.  I aim to remove the k nodes with the smallest indices such that the remaining n-k nodes maintain a connected path.\n\nI considered rooting the tree at the highest-indexed node ('n'), hoping to use that as a base and iteratively explore its neighbours. The core idea is that any connected component will need the high-indexed node, and a greedy selection process (always selecting the highest indexed neighbor) to grow the connected subgraph that I will keep.  I formulate this as a greedy, iterative algorithm rooted at node 'n' which is built into a \"keep\" list, and the remaining nodes are 'remove' candidates. I try a node in, and if the connectivity remains, the node is added. The iteration stops when (n-k) nodes are added. If it cannot work at any step, the node is not included.\n\nI settled on a refined greedy approach rooted in the highest indexed node, starting at 'n'. I prioritize nodes with higher indices when expanding the connected component. To do this efficiently, I utilize a priority queue (implemented with a min-heap, tricking it into a max heap by using the negative). This data structure lets me efficiently pick nodes to connect to the \"keep\" subgraph, and the visited node list removes duplication in processing node neighbors.  For any potential node, I add all of its neighbors to the candidate node list.  I initialize the list with the neighbors of `n`.  I remove candidates from the priority queue in decreasing index order to minimize the removal's impact on keeping a connected graph.\n\nThe key to this algorithm is to ensure the connectivity condition is met while the number of remaining nodes meets the (n-k) requirement. I iterate from node 'n' downward, greedily choosing a neighbor to include, provided the total number of included nodes will not exceed n-k. The time complexity analysis indicates that this approach will be `O(N log N)`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the sum of fan counts of their contestants is maximized. The fan count for district `i` is `2^i`. Since `2^i` is a strictly increasing function of `i`, maximizing the sum of `2^i` is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the district numbers `i` for the selected `n-k` districts.\n\nThis is a classic problem of finding a maximum weight connected subgraph of a given size in a tree. A greedy approach works for this specific variant. The strategy is to prioritize districts with higher numbers.\n\n**Greedy Strategy:**\n1.  **Start with the highest-numbered district:** The district `n` has the largest fan count (`2^n`). We should always try to include it in our connected component, as it contributes the most.\n2.  **Expand greedily:** From the current connected component of selected districts, we want to add `n-k - (current_size)` more districts. To maximize the sum of district numbers, at each step, we should choose the unselected district that is adjacent to our current component and has the largest district number.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  **Adjacency List:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list.\n2.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Create a set `kept_nodes_set` to store the districts we decide to keep. Initialize it with district `n`.\n    *   Create a min-priority queue `pq` (using Python's `heapq` module). To simulate a max-priority queue (prioritizing larger district numbers), store elements as `(-district_number, district_number)`.\n    *   Create a boolean array `visited_for_pq` to keep track of districts that have either been added to `kept_nodes_set` or pushed into `pq`. This prevents duplicate entries in the `pq` and ensures efficient processing. Mark `n` as visited.\n3.  **Populate Initial Priority Queue:** Add all neighbors of district `n` to the `pq`, marking them as visited.\n4.  **Greedy Expansion:**\n    *   While the number of districts in `kept_nodes_set` is less than `n-k` and the `pq` is not empty:\n        *   Extract the district with the largest number (`current_node`) from `pq`.\n        *   Add `current_node` to `kept_nodes_set`.\n        *   For each neighbor `neighbor` of `current_node`:\n            *   If `neighbor` has not been visited (`visited_for_pq[neighbor]` is `False`):\n                *   Add `neighbor` to `pq` (as `(-neighbor, neighbor)`).\n                *   Mark `neighbor` as visited (`visited_for_pq[neighbor] = True`).\n5.  **Identify Removed Districts:** After the loop, `kept_nodes_set` will contain `n-k` districts that form a connected component with the maximum possible sum of district numbers. The districts to be removed are all districts from `1` to `n` that are *not* in `kept_nodes_set`.\n6.  **Output:** Print the removed districts in increasing order.\n\n**Correctness Justification (Informal):**\nThis greedy strategy works because of the tree structure and the objective of maximizing the sum of distinct positive integers. By always picking the largest available district number that maintains connectivity to the existing component, we ensure that we are making the locally optimal choice. If there were an optimal solution that included a smaller-numbered district `u` where our greedy algorithm picked a larger-numbered district `v` (and `v` was available when `u` was picked), we could potentially swap `u` for `v` to get a better or equally good solution, which contradicts the optimality of the original solution if `v > u`. This type of exchange argument confirms the greedy choice.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: `O(N)` for `N-1` edges.\n*   Initialization: `O(degree(n))` for adding neighbors to `pq`, which is `O(N)` in the worst case. Each `heapq.heappush` is `O(log N)`.\n*   Main loop: It runs `n-k` times (to select `n-k` nodes).\n    *   Each `heapq.heappop` takes `O(log N)`.\n    *   Each node and its edges are processed at most once. The total number of edges examined across all nodes is `2 * (N-1)`. Each `heapq.heappush` takes `O(log N)`.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\n*   `N` up to `10^6`, so `N log N` (`10^6 * log_2(10^6) approx 2 * 10^7`) is efficient enough.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n*   Adjacency list: `O(N + M)` where `M = N-1` edges, so `O(N)`.\n*   `kept_nodes_set`: `O(N)`.\n*   `pq`: `O(N)` in the worst case (all neighbors of a high-degree node might be added).\n*   `visited_for_pq`: `O(N)`.\n*   Total space complexity: `O(N)`.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # kept_nodes_set will store the districts we decide to keep.\n    kept_nodes_set = set()\n    \n    # pq stores candidate districts to add to kept_nodes_set.\n    # Elements are (-district_number, district_number) to use heapq as a max-heap,\n    # prioritizing districts with larger numbers.\n    pq = []\n    \n    # visited_for_pq tracks districts that have been added to pq or already kept.\n    # This prevents adding duplicates to pq and processing districts multiple times.\n    visited_for_pq = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Start with the highest indexed district, n.\n    # It's guaranteed to be part of the optimal solution as it contributes the most.\n    kept_nodes_set.add(n)\n    visited_for_pq[n] = True\n\n    # Add neighbors of n to the priority queue as initial candidates.\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        if not visited_for_pq[neighbor]:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n            visited_for_pq[neighbor] = True\n\n    # Greedily add districts until we have n-k districts in our component.\n    # We want to keep n-k districts in total.\n    while len(kept_nodes_set) < n - k and pq:\n        # Extract the district with the largest number from the priority queue.\n        _, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        \n        # Add the current_node to our set of kept districts.\n        kept_nodes_set.add(current_node)\n\n        # Add unvisited neighbors of current_node to the priority queue as new candidates.\n        for neighbor in adj[current_node]:\n            if not visited_for_pq[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n                visited_for_pq[neighbor] = True\n\n    # Collect the districts to be removed.\n    # These are all districts from 1 to n that are not in kept_nodes_set.\n    removed_nodes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in kept_nodes_set:\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n    \n    # Print the removed districts, space-separated and in increasing order.\n    # Since we iterate from 1 to n, removed_nodes will already be in increasing order.\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, removed_nodes)) + \"\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program.\nsolve()\n\n```",
