There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's the breakdown of my thought process for solving the \"Tennis Championship\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out the maximum number of games a winner can play in a knockout tennis tournament with a specific rule: players can only compete if the difference in their previously played games is at most one. The core challenge is to *maximize* the winner's game count.\n\nLet's call the number of games the winner plays 'k'.  We need to determine the *minimum* number of players required to support a winner who plays 'k' games, and then use that to find the *maximum* possible 'k' for a given number of players.  I'm thinking of this as a function P(k), the *minimum* number of players required for the winner to play *k* games.\n\nTo build the tournament maximizing the winner's games, I need to understand the constraints of the game-count rule. I figured out that if the winner has played 'i-1' games in a particular match, the opponent must have played either 'i-2', 'i-1', or 'i' games. However, since the opponent must have won all their previous games, they can't have played 'i' games or be just starting out with 0 games. This implies a strategy to minimize player counts and to maximize the game counts of the winner, and that the winner can play a new player who has had 0 games.\n\nAnalyzing some small cases (k=1, k=2, k=3) revealed an interesting pattern. k=1 requires 2 players, k=2 requires 3 players, k=3 requires 5 players, etc. It looks suspiciously like the Fibonacci sequence! This suggests that the minimum number of players needed for the winner to reach 'k' games might be related to Fibonacci numbers.\n\nI realized that the Fibonacci-like structure of the number of players comes from the necessity of \"building up\" opponents who can satisfy the game-count rule.  To make a player with k wins, you are adding players from either a pool of k-1 wins or k-2 wins, but these can't be fresh players from k games.\n\nSpecifically, P(k) is exactly a shifted Fibonacci number (F_(k+2)). Using this recurrence, I wrote out a little iterative solution that checks how many games (k) can be played, given a starting number of players.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` players and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games the winner plays. We want to maximize `k`.\nLet `P(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games, adhering to the given rule.\n\nLet's analyze the `P(k)` sequence:\n\n*   **P(0)**: A player who hasn't played any games yet, but is available to play. This requires 1 player. So, `P(0) = 1`.\n*   **P(1)**: The winner plays 1 game. This means the winner (who has played 0 games) plays against an opponent (who also has played 0 games). The rule `|0 - 0| <= 1` is satisfied. The winner wins, having played 1 game. This requires 2 players in total. So, `P(1) = 2`.\n*   **P(k) for k >= 2**: Consider the winner `W` playing their `k`-th game. At this point, `W` has already won `k-1` games. Let `Opp` be `W`'s opponent in this `k`-th game. `Opp` must have won `j` games. The rule states `|(k-1) - j| <= 1`. This means `j` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`. However, if `j=k`, `Opp` would also be a winner who played `k` games, which is impossible if `W` is the sole winner of `k` games (as `Opp` loses this game). So `j` can be `k-2` or `k-1`.\n    To minimize the total number of players `P(k)`, we should choose `Opp` to have played the maximum possible number of games that satisfies the rule, but without requiring more players than necessary for `Opp`'s sub-tournament.\n    *   If `Opp` has played `k-1` games: Both `W` and `Opp` would have played `k-1` games. `W` comes from a sub-tournament of `P(k-1)` players, and `Opp` comes from another sub-tournament of `P(k-1)` players. Total players: `P(k-1) + P(k-1) = 2 * P(k-1)`.\n    *   If `Opp` has played `k-2` games: `W` has played `k-1` games, `Opp` has played `k-2` games. `W` comes from a sub-tournament of `P(k-1)` players. `Opp` comes from a sub-tournament of `P(k-2)` players. Total players: `P(k-1) + P(k-2)`.\n\n    Since `P(k-2) < P(k-1)` (the number of players required increases with `k`), `P(k-1) + P(k-2)` will always be less than `2 * P(k-1)`. Therefore, to minimize players for `W` to play `k` games, `W` should face an opponent who has played `k-2` games in the final match (or the last match where this choice matters).\n    This leads to the recurrence relation: `P(k) = P(k-1) + P(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nLet's list the `P(k)` values:\n*   `P(0) = 1`\n*   `P(1) = 2`\n*   `P(2) = P(1) + P(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n*   `P(3) = P(2) + P(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n*   `P(4) = P(3) + P(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\n*   `P(5) = P(4) + P(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`\nAnd so on.\n\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...` is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically, if we use the standard definition `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`, then `P(k) = F_{k+2}`.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `P(k) <= n`.\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers until `F_{k+2}` exceeds `n`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will not be very large (approximately `k+2 <= 90` for `n=10^18`). We can simply iterate.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `a = 1` (representing `P(0)` or `F_2`).\n2.  Initialize `b = 2` (representing `P(1)` or `F_3`).\n3.  Initialize `k_games = 1` (representing the number of games played for `P(1)`).\n4.  Loop while `b <= n`:\n    a.  Increment `k_games` by 1.\n    b.  Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `next_fib = a + b`.\n    c.  Update `a = b`.\n    d.  Update `b = next_fib`.\n5.  When the loop terminates, `b` (which is `P(k_games)`) will be greater than `n`. This means the maximum `k` was the value of `k_games` *before* the last increment. So, the result is `k_games - 1`.\n\n**Example Trace (n=10):**\n1.  Initialize `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `k_games = 1`.\n2.  **Loop 1**: `b=2 <= n=10` is True.\n    *   `k_games = 2`.\n    *   `next_fib = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    *   `a = 2`.\n    *   `b = 3`.\n3.  **Loop 2**: `b=3 <= n=10` is True.\n    *   `k_games = 3`.\n    *   `next_fib = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n    *   `a = 3`.\n    *   `b = 5`.\n4.  **Loop 3**: `b=5 <= n=10` is True.\n    *   `k_games = 4`.\n    *   `next_fib = a + b = 3 + 5 = 8`.\n    *   `a = 5`.\n    *   `b = 8`.\n5.  **Loop 4**: `b=8 <= n=10` is True.\n    *   `k_games = 5`.\n    *   `next_fib = a + b = 5 + 8 = 13`.\n    *   `a = 8`.\n    *   `b = 13`.\n6.  **Loop 5**: `b=13 <= n=10` is False. Loop terminates.\n7.  Print `k_games - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # P(k) represents the minimum number of players required for the winner\n    # to play exactly k games, following the given rule.\n    # The recurrence relation is P(k) = P(k-1) + P(k-2) for k >= 2.\n    # Base cases:\n    # P(0) = 1 (A single player, who hasn't played yet, but is available)\n    # P(1) = 2 (Winner plays 1 game, needs 2 players: W and Opponent, both 0 games played)\n\n    # We want to find the maximum k such that P(k) <= n.\n\n    # 'a' will store P(current_k - 1)\n    # 'b' will store P(current_k)\n    # 'k_games' will store the current number of games the winner can play\n\n    # Initialize for k=1: P(0)=1, P(1)=2.\n    a = 1  # Corresponds to P(0)\n    b = 2  # Corresponds to P(1)\n    k_games = 1 # The number of games for which 'b' is the player count (i.e., for P(1))\n\n    # Iterate to find the largest k_games such that P(k_games) does not exceed n.\n    # The loop continues as long as the current player count 'b' (for k_games)\n    # is less than or equal to n.\n    while b <= n:\n        # If P(k_games) <= n, it means a winner can play k_games.\n        # We try to see if they can play k_games + 1.\n        k_games += 1\n        \n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number (P(k_games))\n        next_P = a + b\n        \n        # Update 'a' and 'b' for the next iteration\n        a = b\n        b = next_P\n    \n    # When the loop finishes, 'b' is the first P(k_games) value that is > n.\n    # This means the maximum number of games possible was for the previous 'k_games' value.\n    # Since 'k_games' was incremented one last time before 'b' became too large,\n    # we need to subtract 1 from 'k_games' to get the correct answer.\n    print(k_games - 1)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
