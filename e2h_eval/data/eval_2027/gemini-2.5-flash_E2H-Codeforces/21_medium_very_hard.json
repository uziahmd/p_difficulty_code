The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Approach to the Chest and Key Problem**\n\nI'm tackling this competitive programming problem and need to build a Python script to handle the input, process the data, and generate the output. The core of the problem involves maximizing the number of chests that can be opened given a set of chests with numbers and a set of keys with numbers, with a specific rule: a key can open a chest only if the sum of their numbers is odd.\n\nThe fundamental idea that strikes me is to analyze the parity (whether a number is even or odd). For a sum to be odd, one number must be odd and the other even. I'll need to count the odd and even chests, as well as the odd and even keys. This allows me to establish two distinct pairings: odd chests with even keys and even chests with odd keys.  To maximize the openings, I'll pair as many chests and keys as possible in these two ways. The pairing is limited by the number of resources - if there are 5 odd chests and 3 even keys, only 3 odd chests can be paired with even keys. This leads to the `min(chests_odd, keys_even) + min(chests_even, keys_odd)` formula.\n\nI’m running through several examples to test the formula. I'll need to double check the constraints to make sure the algorithm is efficient. The problem states `n, m <= 10^5`, and a single iteration through the chest and key arrays fits this time complexity requirement. The values `a_i, b_j <= 10^9`, but since I'm only concerned with parity, the `a_i % 2` check will suffice.\n\nI'll be walking through the code implementation with specific steps. I'll be sure to handle edge cases like when n or m equals 1, or when all the chest or key numbers are of the same parity. Finally, I will double-check everything and remove any uneccessary comments.\n",
