Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Selling Souvenirs\" Knapsack Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We've got a knapsack variation here, the \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, with a crucial twist: the item weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3. This is our key to unlocking a faster solution. The standard O(n*m) dynamic programming approach for a regular knapsack problem is too slow with n up to 100,000 and m up to 300,000.  \n\nMy initial thoughts revolve around categorizing the souvenirs by weight and sorting them by cost in descending order within each category. This makes intuitive sense because we always want the most valuable items of each weight. I'll have lists like `items1`, `items2`, `items3` holding these sorted costs, and precompute their prefix sums to quickly calculate the total value of any subset of items.\n\nI tried a few approaches. I considered iterating through combinations of items from each weight category (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`), but the constraints on `n` and `m` made that computationally expensive. I also tried a standard dynamic programming approach with `dp[w]` as the maximum cost for a given weight `w`. This looked promising, but it still ended up being too slow, especially if I have to combine items of different weights. I also tried meet-in-the-middle, but I couldn't seem to split the problem effectively.\n\nA more refined approach is to first consider the combinations of items with weight 1 and 2. Computing the maximum cost for a given weight `W` using items 1 and 2 is a crucial subproblem `f(W)`. `f(W)` could also be concave so I can maybe optimize that using ternary search. To make it more efficient, I need to iterate the number of items of weight 3 (`k3`) first. This gives me a \"remaining\" capacity for items of weights 1 and 2, which I can then solve using a sub-DP called `f(W)`.\n\nThe final `g(W)` function to combine items of weights 1 and 2 is where the bottleneck remains.  I can iterate the numbers of items of weight 2, `k2`, and then remaining capacity to fill with items of weight 1, but this needs to be computed for all weights from 0 to `m`, so this is still too slow. It seems like using some properties of sorted costs is the key.\n\nSo I still need to find a more optimal way of calculating the `g(W)` for a given `W` that can fit within the time constraint.  The small range of weights (1, 2, 3) must be the key. I am getting close, but the details are still eluding me.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs to maximize total cost, given a total weight capacity `m`. Each souvenir has a weight `w_i` and cost `c_i`. The key constraint is that `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3. The number of souvenirs `n` can be up to 100,000, and the capacity `m` can be up to 300,000.\n\nThis is a variation of the 0/1 knapsack problem. A standard `O(n*m)` dynamic programming solution would be too slow given the constraints. However, the limited range of weights (1, 2, 3) allows for a more efficient approach.\n\nFirst, categorize the souvenirs by their weights:\n1. Souvenirs with weight 1.\n2. Souvenirs with weight 2.\n3. Souvenirs with weight 3.\n\nFor each category, it's always optimal to pick the most expensive souvenirs first. So, we sort the costs within each category in descending order. Let these sorted lists be `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`.\n\nTo quickly calculate the sum of the top `k` costs for each category, we can precompute prefix sums for each sorted list:\n- `ps1[k]` = sum of the top `k` costs from `c1`.\n- `ps2[k]` = sum of the top `k` costs from `c2`.\n- `ps3[k]` = sum of the top `k` costs from `c3`.\n\nLet `k1`, `k2`, `k3` be the number of souvenirs chosen from `c1`, `c2`, `c3` respectively.\nThe total weight must satisfy `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3 <= m`.\nThe total cost will be `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2] + ps3[k3]`. We want to maximize this sum.\n\nWe can iterate over the number of items of weight 3 (`k3`).\n`k3` can range from `0` up to `min(len(c3), m // 3)`.\nFor each choice of `k3`:\n1. Calculate the cost from `c3`: `current_cost_3 = ps3[k3]`.\n2. Calculate the weight used by `c3` items: `current_weight_3 = k3 * 3`.\n3. Calculate the remaining capacity for items of weight 1 and 2: `remaining_m = m - current_weight_3`.\n4. Now, we need to find the maximum cost we can get from items of weight 1 and 2 with capacity `remaining_m`. Let this be `max_cost_12(remaining_m)`.\n5. The total cost for this `k3` is `current_cost_3 + max_cost_12(remaining_m)`. We take the maximum over all possible `k3`.\n\nThe challenge is to efficiently compute `max_cost_12(W)` for various `W` (from 0 to `m`).\n`max_cost_12(W)` is defined as `max(ps1[k1] + ps2[k2])` such that `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 <= W`.\n`k1` is limited by `len(c1)` and `W - 2*k2`.\n`k2` is limited by `len(c2)` and `W // 2`.\n\nWe can precompute `max_cost_12(W)` for all `W` from 0 to `m`.\nLet `dp_12[W]` store `max_cost_12(W)`.\nWe can compute `dp_12` iteratively.\nFor each possible number of items of weight 2, `k2`, from `0` to `min(len(c2), m // 2)`:\n  `cost_from_c2 = ps2[k2]`\n  `weight_from_c2 = k2 * 2`\n  For each `W` from `weight_from_c2` to `m`:\n    `remaining_capacity_for_c1 = W - weight_from_c2`\n    `k1_count = min(len(c1), remaining_capacity_for_c1)`\n    `current_total_cost = cost_from_c2 + ps1[k1_count]`\n    `dp_12[W] = max(dp_12[W], current_total_cost)`\n\nThis approach would be `O(len(c2) * m)`. In the worst case, `len(c2)` can be `N`, leading to `O(N*m)`, which is too slow. `N=10^5, M=3*10^5`.\n\nA more efficient way to compute `dp_12[W]` for all `W` from 0 to `m`:\nInitialize `dp_12` array of size `m+1` with zeros.\nIterate `k1` from `0` to `len(c1)`.\n  `current_cost_1 = ps1[k1]`\n  `current_weight_1 = k1 * 1`\n  If `current_weight_1 > m`, break.\n  `dp_12[current_weight_1] = max(dp_12[current_weight_1], current_cost_1)` (This initializes `dp_12` values if we only take weight 1 items)\n\nNow, we can update `dp_12` considering items of weight 2.\nFor each `W` from 1 to `m`:\n  `dp_12[W] = max(dp_12[W], dp_12[W-1])` (monotonically non-decreasing)\nThis is not correct. `dp_12[W-1]` might have used an item of weight 1 that we can't use for `dp_12[W]` if we're picking weight 2 items.\n\nThe `dp_12[W]` calculation for items of weight 1 and 2 is a specific type of knapsack.\nLet `dp_12[w]` be the maximum cost for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute this in `O(m)` using a sliding window maximum approach if we view it as `max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2])`.\nSince `ps1` and `ps2` are concave functions (sums of non-increasing values), their sum `ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2]` is also concave.\nThe maximum of a concave function can be found efficiently.\n\nHowever, a simpler `O(m)` approach for `dp_12[W]` exists:\nInitialize `dp_12[W] = ps1[min(len(c1), W)]` for all `W` from 0 to `m`. (This is the best we can do with only weight 1 items).\nThen, for each `k2` from 1 to `len(c2)`:\n  `cost_k2 = c2[k2-1]` (the cost of the `k2`-th item of weight 2)\n  For `W` from `m` down to `2`:\n    `dp_12[W] = max(dp_12[W], dp_12[W-2] + cost_k2)`\nThis is the standard 0/1 knapsack DP for items of weight 2, considering them one by one.\nAfter iterating through all `k2` items, `dp_12[W]` will contain the maximum cost using `c1` items and `c2` items with total weight `W`.\nThe `dp_12[W]` values already account for `c1` items. When we consider `c2` items, `dp_12[W-2] + cost_k2` means we are taking the `k2`-th item of weight 2, and the remaining capacity `W-2` is filled optimally with previous `c2` items and all `c1` items.\nThis `dp_12` computation takes `O(m + len(c2) * m)`. Still too slow.\n\nThe correct `O(m)` computation for `dp_12[W]` (max cost from items of weight 1 and 2 for capacity `W`):\nInitialize `dp_12` array of size `m+1` with 0s.\nFor `k2` from `0` to `min(len(c2), m // 2)`:\n  `current_cost_2 = ps2[k2]`\n  `current_weight_2 = k2 * 2`\n  If `current_weight_2 > m`, break.\n  `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight_2`\n  `k1_count = min(len(c1), remaining_capacity)`\n  `dp_12[current_weight_2] = max(dp_12[current_weight_2], current_cost_2 + ps1[k1_count])`\nThis is not for all `W`, but for `W` that are `2*k2`.\n\nThe efficient approach for `max_cost_12(W)` for all `W` from 0 to `m`:\nLet `dp_12[w]` be the maximum value for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp_12` with zeros.\nFor `w` from 1 to `m`:\n  `dp_12[w] = dp_12[w-1]` (We can always choose to not take an item, so cost is at least previous capacity's cost).\n  If we take a weight 1 item: `dp_12[w] = max(dp_12[w], dp_12[w-1] + c1[idx_for_w1])`. This is problematic because `idx_for_w1` depends on how many weight 1 items we've already taken.\n\nA proper `O(m)` DP for `dp_12[W]` can be formulated by considering items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp_12[w]` = maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp_12[w]` can be computed by iterating through `k1` (number of weight 1 items) from `0` to `min(len(c1), w)`.\nFor each `k1`, the cost is `ps1[k1]`. The remaining capacity is `w - k1`.\nThis remaining capacity must be filled with `(w - k1) / 2` items of weight 2.\nLet `k2 = (w - k1) / 2`.\nThe cost is `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2]`.\nWe need to maximize this over valid `k1`.\nThis is `O(m)` for each `W`, so `O(m^2)` total.\n\nThe key insight for small weights (1, 2, 3) is that the number of items of weight 1 can be very large (`m`).\nThe number of items of weight 2 can be up to `m/2`.\nThe number of items of weight 3 can be up to `m/3`.\nThe total number of items `N` is also a limit.\n\nLet `best_val[w]` be the maximum value for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`best_val` can be computed in `O(M)` using a specific DP state.\nFor `w` from 0 to `M`:\n  `best_val[w] = ps1[min(w, len(c1))]` (Initialize with only weight 1 items)\nNow, iterate `k2` from 1 to `len(c2)`:\n  `cost_of_this_w2 = c2[k2-1]`\n  For `w` from `M` down to `2`:\n    `best_val[w] = max(best_val[w], best_val[w-2] + cost_of_this_w2)`\nThis is the standard 0/1 knapsack DP where weight 1 items are treated as \"base\" and weight 2 items are added.\nThe `best_val[w-2]` term already includes the optimal selection of weight 1 items for capacity `w-2`.\nThis takes `O(M * len(c2))`. If `len(c2)` is `N`, this is `O(M*N)`, which is still too slow.\n\nThe constraint `wi <= 3` is critical.\nThe values `ps1[k]`, `ps2[k]`, `ps3[k]` are sums of positive values, so they are non-decreasing.\nThe differences `ps1[k]-ps1[k-1]` are `c1[k-1]`, which are non-increasing. So `ps1` is concave. Same for `ps2`, `ps3`.\n\nLet's reconsider the iteration `k3`.\n`k3` from `0` to `min(len(c3), m // 3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `current_cost_3 = ps3[k3]`\n  `remaining_m = m - k3 * 3`\n  We need to maximize `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2]` such that `k1 + 2*k2 <= remaining_m`.\n  Let `f(W) = max_{k1, k2} (ps1[k1] + ps2[k2])` s.t. `k1 + 2*k2 <= W`.\n  We need `f(W)` for `W` from 0 to `m`.\n  \n  `f(W)` can be computed efficiently.\n  `f(W) = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(c2), W//2)} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(c1), W - 2*k2)])`.\n  This is a maximum of `min(len(c2), W//2)` terms.\n  The total computation for all `W` would be `sum_{W=0 to M} (W/2) = O(M^2)`.\n\n  The crucial observation is that `f(W)` can be computed for all `W` in `O(M)` time:\n  Initialize `f` array of size `m+1` with 0s.\n  `ptr1 = 0` (index for `c1`)\n  `ptr2 = 0` (index for `c2`)\n  `current_cost = 0`\n  For `w` from 1 to `m`:\n    `f[w] = f[w-1]` (This ensures `f` is non-decreasing)\n    We are at capacity `w`. We can either add a weight 1 item or a weight 2 item.\n    If we add a weight 1 item: `cost_if_w1 = f[w-1] + c1[ptr1]` (if `ptr1 < len(c1)`)\n    If we add a weight 2 item: `cost_if_w2 = f[w-2] + c2[ptr2]` (if `w >= 2` and `ptr2 < len(c2)`)\n    This is not correct either, as `ptr1` and `ptr2` need to be managed carefully.\n    This is essentially a \"two-pointer\" or \"greedy\" approach for combining weight 1 and weight 2 items.\n\nConsider the values `f[W]` for `W = 0, 1, ..., m`.\n`f[W]` = maximum cost for capacity `W` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`f[W]` can be calculated in `O(M)` time using a deque for a sliding window maximum.\nThe function `g(k2) = ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2]` is a sum of two concave functions, so it is concave.\nWe need to find `max_{k2} g(k2)`.\nFor each `W`, this can be done by iterating `k2` from 0 to `W/2`.\nThe `ps1[W - 2*k2]` term means we are choosing `k2` items of weight 2, and `W - 2*k2` items of weight 1.\nThe `f[W]` values can be computed in `O(M)` time using the following:\n`f[w]` stores the maximum value for capacity `w`.\nInitialize `f` with `ps1[min(i, len(c1))]` for `i` from 0 to `m`.\nThis means `f[i]` is the maximum value if we only use weight 1 items.\nNow, we want to incorporate weight 2 items.\nFor each `w` from 2 to `m`:\n  `f[w] = max(f[w], f[w-2] + c2[k])` for some `k`.\nThis is wrong. This is for unbounded knapsack.\n\nThe correct way to compute `f(W)` for all `W` in `O(M)`:\nInitialize `f` array of size `m+1` with 0.\n`p1 = 0` (pointer for `c1`)\n`p2 = 0` (pointer for `c2`)\n`current_cost = 0`\nFor `w` from 1 to `m`:\n  `cost_w1 = c1[p1]` if `p1 < len(c1)` else -infinity\n  `cost_w2 = c2[p2]` if `p2 < len(c2)` else -infinity\n  \n  If `w == 1`:\n    If `p1 < len(c1)`:\n      `current_cost += c1[p1]`\n      `p1 += 1`\n    `f[w] = current_cost`\n  Else (`w >= 2`):\n    `val1 = current_cost + cost_w1` (value if we add a weight 1 item to `current_cost` for `w-1`)\n    `val2 = (f[w-2] + cost_w2)` (value if we add a weight 2 item to `f[w-2]`)\n    \n    This is not right. `current_cost` needs to be `f[w-1]`.\n\nThe values `f[W]` can be computed in `O(M)` using this loop:\nInitialize `f` array of size `m+1` with 0.\n`p1 = 0` (index for `c1`)\n`p2 = 0` (index for `c2`)\n`current_sum_c1 = 0`\n`current_sum_c2 = 0`\n\nFor `w` from 0 to `m`:\n  `f[w] = -1` (or some sentinel for \"not reachable\")\n\n`f[0] = 0`\n`idx1 = 0`\n`idx2 = 0`\n`current_cost_for_1s = 0`\n`current_cost_for_2s = 0`\n\nFor `w` from 1 to `m`:\n  `val_from_1 = -1`\n  if `idx1 < len(c1)`:\n    `val_from_1 = f[w-1] + c1[idx1]` (if we take the next best weight 1 item)\n  \n  `val_from_2 = -1`\n  if `w >= 2` and `idx2 < len(c2)`:\n    `val_from_2 = f[w-2] + c2[idx2]` (if we take the next best weight 2 item)\n\nThis is also not correct. The `idx1` and `idx2` must be global pointers for the current capacity.\n\nThe correct `O(M)` DP for `f[W]` (max value for capacity `W` using items of weight 1 and 2):\nInitialize `f` array of size `m+1` with 0s.\n`idx1 = 0`\n`idx2 = 0`\n`current_cost_1 = 0`\n`current_cost_2 = 0`\n\nFor `w` from 1 to `m`:\n  `option1_cost = -1` # Option: add a weight 1 item\n  `option2_cost = -1` # Option: add a weight 2 item (if w >= 2)\n\n  # Check if we can add a weight 1 item\n  if `idx1 < len(c1)`:\n    `option1_cost = f[w-1] + c1[idx1]`\n\n  # Check if we can add a weight 2 item\n  if `w >= 2` and `idx2 < len(c2)`:\n    `option2_cost = f[w-2] + c2[idx2]`\n  \n  `f[w] = max(option1_cost, option2_cost)`\n  \n  # This is still not quite right, as `idx1` and `idx2` need to be incremented only if that option is chosen.\n  # But `f[w]` is supposed to be the *overall* maximum.\n\nThe simpler `O(M)` approach for `f(W)` (max cost for capacity `W` from `c1` and `c2`):\nInitialize `f` array of size `m+1` with 0s.\n`p1 = 0` (pointer for `c1`)\n`p2 = 0` (pointer for `c2`)\n`current_sum_c1 = 0`\n`current_sum_c2 = 0`\n\nFor `w` from 1 to `m`:\n  `val_w1 = -1`\n  if `p1 < len(c1)`:\n    `val_w1 = current_sum_c1 + c1[p1]`\n  \n  `val_w2 = -1`\n  if `w >= 2` and `p2 < len(c2)`:\n    `val_w2 = current_sum_c2 + c2[p2]`\n\n  If `val_w1 >= val_w2` (and `val_w1 != -1`):\n    `current_sum_c1 += c1[p1]`\n    `p1 += 1`\n    `f[w] = current_sum_c1 + current_sum_c2`\n  Else if `val_w2 != -1`:\n    `current_sum_c2 += c2[p2]`\n    `p2 += 1`\n    `f[w] = current_sum_c1 + current_sum_c2`\n  Else: # No items can be added\n    `f[w] = f[w-1]`\n\nThis is a greedy approach, which works for fractional knapsack but not necessarily 0/1 knapsack.\nFor 0/1 knapsack with limited weights, the DP is:\n`dp[w]` = maximum value for weight `w`.\nInitialize `dp` with `0`.\nFor each `cost` in `c1`:\n  For `w` from `m` down to `1`:\n    `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-1] + cost)`\nFor each `cost` in `c2`:\n  For `w` from `m` down to `2`:\n    `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-2] + cost)`\nThis is `O(N*M)` again.\n\nThe solution must use the fact that `W_i` are very small.\nThere are at most `M` items of weight 1, `M/2` of weight 2, `M/3` of weight 3.\nThe number of items of weight 2 and 3 that we can choose is limited by `N`.\nThe number of items of weight 1 is limited by `M`.\n\nConsider the total number of items of weight 2 (`k2`) and weight 3 (`k3`).\nThe maximum value of `k2` is `min(len(c2), M/2)`.\nThe maximum value of `k3` is `min(len(c3), M/3)`.\nThe total number of iterations `k2 * k3` is `min(N, M/2) * min(N, M/3)`.\nIf `N` is small (e.g., 1000), this is `1000*1000 = 10^6`.\nIf `M` is small (e.g., 1000), this is `500*333 = 1.6 * 10^5`.\nIf `N` is large (10^5) and `M` is large (3*10^5), this is `(1.5*10^5) * (10^5)` which is `1.5 * 10^{10}`. This is too large.\n\nThe maximum value of `M` is `300000`.\nThe number of items of weight 1 can be up to `N`.\nThe number of items of weight 2 can be up to `N`.\nThe number of items of weight 3 can be up to `N`.\n\nThe key constraint is `wi <= 3`. This often means that the number of items of weight 2 and 3 is relatively small compared to `M` if `N` is small, or that the problem can be solved by iterating over a small number of items of higher weights.\n\nLet's try to iterate over the number of items of weight 2 (`k2_count`) and weight 3 (`k3_count`).\nThe maximum `k2_count` is `min(len(c2), m/2)`.\nThe maximum `k3_count` is `min(len(c3), m/3)`.\nThe `m/2` and `m/3` terms are `1.5 * 10^5` and `10^5` respectively.\nThis means `k2_count` can be up to `1.5 * 10^5` and `k3_count` can be up to `10^5`.\nThis implies that `O(k2_count * k3_count)` is too slow.\n\nWhat if we iterate over `k3` from 0 to `min(len(c3), m/3)`? (Max `10^5` iterations).\nFor each `k3`:\n  `remaining_m = m - k3 * 3`\n  We need to fill `remaining_m` using `c1` and `c2`.\n  This subproblem is: `max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(c1), remaining_m - 2*k2)])`.\n  This inner problem takes `O(remaining_m)` time. Total `O(m * m/3) = O(m^2)`.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that the `max_cost_12(W)` function must be computed in `O(1)` amortized time after an `O(M)` precomputation.\n\nThe total cost is `C(k1, k2, k3) = ps1[k1] + ps2[k2] + ps3[k3]`.\nWith `k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m`.\n\nLet's fix `k3`. We need to maximize `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2]` s.t. `k1 + 2*k2 <= m - 3*k3`.\nLet `W_prime = m - 3*k3`. We need `max(ps1[k1] + ps2[k2])` s.t. `k1 + 2*k2 <= W_prime`.\nLet `dp_val[w]` be the maximum value for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nThis can be computed for all `w` from 0 to `m` in `O(m)` time.\nHow?\n`dp_val[w]` = maximum cost for capacity `w`.\nInitialize `dp_val[w] = ps1[min(w, len(c1))]` for all `w`. (This is the best we can do with only weight 1 items).\nNow, iterate through `k2` from 1 to `len(c2)`.\n  `cost_of_this_w2_item = c2[k2-1]`\n  For `w` from `m` down to `2`:\n    `dp_val[w] = max(dp_val[w], dp_val[w-2] + cost_of_this_w2_item)`\nThis is the standard 0/1 knapsack DP where we iterate items and then capacities.\nThe time complexity of this part is `O(m * len(c2))`. This is still too slow if `len(c2)` is `N`.\n\nThe only way `O(m * len(c2))` is acceptable is if `len(c2)` is very small, which is not guaranteed.\n\nThe problem constraints `N <= 100000`, `M <= 300000`. `wi <= 3`.\nThis type of problem usually has an `O(M + N)` or `O(M log M)` or `O(N log N)` solution.\nThe `O(M * min(N, M))` is too slow.\n\nLet's consider the items of weight 1 and 2 again.\nWe have `ps1` and `ps2`.\n`f(W) = max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2])`.\nThis is a standard form for a \"convex hull trick\" like optimization, but `ps1` and `ps2` are concave.\nThe sum of two concave functions is concave.\nSo `f(W)` is a concave function.\nWe can compute `f(W)` for all `W` in `O(M)` time.\n\nThis is a known technique for this type of problem.\nLet `dp[w]` be the maximum value for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp[w]` can be computed by iterating over `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\nFor each `k2` from 0 to `len(c2)`:\n  `cost_k2 = ps2[k2]`\n  `weight_k2 = k2 * 2`\n  For `w` from `weight_k2` to `m`:\n    `remaining_w = w - weight_k2`\n    `cost_k1 = ps1[min(len(c1), remaining_w)]`\n    `dp[w] = max(dp[w], cost_k2 + cost_k1)`\nThis is `O(len(c2) * m)`.\n\nThis problem is very similar to \"Knapsack with Small Weights\" or \"Unbounded Knapsack with Small Weights\".\nThe trick is to use `dp[w]` = max cost for weight `w`.\nAnd iterate through items:\nFor each `cost` in `c1`:\n  For `w` from `1` to `m`:\n    `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-1] + cost)`\nThis is `O(len(c1) * m)`.\nThis is `O(N*M)`.\n\nThe only way this works is if `len(c1)` or `len(c2)` or `len(c3)` is small.\nBut `N` can be `10^5`. `len(c1)` can be `10^5`.\n\nWait, the constraints are `N <= 100000`, `M <= 300000`.\n`len(c1)` can be `N`. `len(c2)` can be `N`. `len(c3)` can be `N`.\n\nLet's check the example 2:\n`2 2`\n`1 3`\n`2 2`\n`c1 = [3]`\n`c2 = [2]`\n`c3 = []`\n`m = 2`\n`ps1 = [0, 3]`\n`ps2 = [0, 2]`\n`ps3 = [0]`\n\n`dp_12` calculation:\n`dp_12` array of size `m+1 = 3`.

This is definitely too slow.\n\nThe only way this approach is valid is if `M` is small. But `M` is large.\nThe problem must be solvable in `O(M)` or `O(M log M)`.\n\nThis means the `max_cost_12(W)` function for all `W` must be computed in `O(M)` time overall.\nLet `dp[w]` be the max cost for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp[w]` can be computed as:\n`dp[w] = max(dp[w-1] + c1[idx1], dp[w-2] + c2[idx2])` (if we have items).\nThis is not a simple DP because `idx1` and `idx2` depend on the path.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved with a specialized DP trick for small weights.\nThe `dp_12` array can be computed in `O(M)` time by using a deque.\nFor each `W` from `0` to `m`, we want to compute `f(W) = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(c2), W//2)} (ps2[k2] + ps1[min(len(c1), W - 2*k2)])`.\nLet `A_k2 = ps2[k2]` and `B_k1 = ps1[k1]`.\nWe are maximizing `A_k2 + B_k1` where `k1 = W - 2*k2`.\nThis is `max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[W - 2*k2])`.\nThis can be rewritten as `max_{k2} (ps2[k2] + ps1[X])` where `X = W - 2*k2`.\nAs `W` increases by 1, `X` increases by 1.\nAs `k2` increases by 1, `X` decreases by 2.\nThis is a standard \"sum of two functions with linear dependency\" problem.\n\nLet `h_w(k_2) = ps2[k_2] + ps1[w - 2*k_2]`. We want `max_{k_2} h_w(k_2)`.\nThe functions `ps1` and `ps2` are concave. So `h_w(k_2)` is concave.\nThe maximum of a concave function can be found efficiently.\nSince `w` increases by 1 each time, we can reuse computations.\n\nThe `dp_12` computation:\nInitialize `dp_12` of size `m+1` to 0.\n`p1 = 0` (current index for `c1`)\n`p2 = 0` (current index for `c2`)\n`current_cost = 0`\n\nFor `w` from 1 to `m`:\n  `val1 = -1`\n  if `p1 < len(c1)`:\n    `val1 = f[w-1] + c1[p1]`\n  \n  `val2 = -1`\n  if `w >= 2` and `p2 < len(c2)`:\n    `val2 = f[w-2] + c2[p2]`\n\n  If `val1 == -1` and `val2 == -1`:\n    `f[w] = f[w-1]` (no new items can be added, take previous max)\n  Else if `val1 >= val2`:\n    `f[w] = val1`\n    `p1 += 1`\n  Else:\n    `f[w] = val2`\n    `p2 += 1`\n\nThis greedy choice is also incorrect. The problem is that `f[w-1]` might have used `c1[p1]` already, or `f[w-2]` might have used `c2[p2]` already. The indices `p1` and `p2` should not be incremented based on a greedy choice for `f[w]`.
