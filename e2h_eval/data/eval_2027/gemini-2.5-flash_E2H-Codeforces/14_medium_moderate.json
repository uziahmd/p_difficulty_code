He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the plan for tackling this problem.**\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many trailing zeroes are in `n!`. It boils down to counting how many times 5 appears as a prime factor, because there will always be more 2s than 5s. Legendre's formula will come in handy here.\n\nNext, I'll observe the behavior of the trailing zeroes function, `Z(n)`. It's non-decreasing, and it jumps up when `n` is a multiple of 5, especially when it's a higher power of 5 (25, 125, etc.). I need to analyze how those jumps affect the potential solutions. It looks like if there's an `n` with `Z(n) = m`, then the next four numbers will also work, but the next multiple of 5 won't.\n\nNow for the strategy: First, I'll use binary search to find the smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= m`.  The search range will be [1, 500000] (based on the rough estimate that the answer will be around 4 times the input `m`). After the binary search, I need to verify that `Z(n)` is *exactly* equal to `m`, not just greater. If it is, then the five consecutive integers will all have `m` trailing zeroes.\n\nI'll write a Python script for this. I can read `m` from the standard input. The binary search and `Z(n)` calculation will be inside the code, and I need to print the output as directed by the problem: The number of solution integers, or 0 if no solution, followed by the integers themselves if any.\n\nLooks like I've got a good handle on this one. Let's start coding.\n",
