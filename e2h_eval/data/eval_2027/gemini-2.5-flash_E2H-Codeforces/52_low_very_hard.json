Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to tackle this \"New Year Candles\" challenge. Let's see... it's about maximizing the total lit hours, given some initial candles and a recycling factor. Essentially, it's a simulation problem.\n\nI've got the core idea: I'll need to keep track of three things – the total hours lit, the current new candles I have, and the burned-out candles. The process will be iterative. In each round, I'll light all the current candles, update the total, and then check how many new candles I can make from the burned-out ones. The key part is that the burning process and the recycling happen simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the trace of the example `a=4`, `b=2`, it all becomes clear. First, all the candles are burned. The burnt ones are then transformed to a number of new candles. You can keep doing this until no more new candles can be made. \n\nSo it's a matter of iterating and updating variables. I just need to write that down in code. Simple enough.\n",
