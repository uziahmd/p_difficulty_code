The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My plan for this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem is pretty straightforward.** I've got two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each have a repeating strategy.  Nikephoros' strategy is based on a sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus' is based on sequence `B` of length `k`. The game runs for `n` rounds.  My goal is to figure out how many times each player loses.\n\nSince the strategies repeat, directly simulating all `n` rounds would be inefficient, especially since `n` can be huge.  I need to find a pattern. The key realization is that the pair of choices, (`Nikephoros's choice`, `Polycarpus's choice`) will repeat every `lcm(m, k)` rounds. That `lcm` is the least common multiple of the lengths of the two sequences.\n\nI'll calculate `L = lcm(m, k)`.  This is the length of one complete cycle of repeating game states.  I can simulate the first `L` rounds to count losses within that cycle. Then, I can figure out how many full cycles fit into `n` rounds and calculate losses in full cycles.  Finally, I simulate any remaining rounds after the full cycles.\n\nTo determine the winner of each round, I'll use a `who_wins` function.  It takes the two choices and returns 1 if the first player wins, -1 if the second player wins, and 0 for a draw. I've thought about optimizing it by using a dictionary, but for now, the basic `if/elif` structure is clear.\n\nThe only potentially tricky part is calculating `lcm`.  I'll either use Python's built-in `math.lcm` and `math.gcd` or implement my own, especially if I'm worried about the Python version on the target platform. I need to be careful to use integer division `//` to avoid floating-point issues when calculating the number of cycles.\n\nI'll initialize the number of losses for both players to zero. Then, I'll loop through each cycle, count the losses for each player, calculate losses from full cycles, then calculate the remaining rounds, and count the additional losses. Finally, I'll print the total losses for both players.\n\nI'll use some example cases to debug the `who_wins` function and test my cycle detection logic.  I'm confident I can handle the case where `n` is large because of the cyclic nature of the game. I also know that if the sequences `A` and `B` have a GCD greater than 1, there'll be many repeats. The lcm calculation will take care of this repetition.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of losses for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, over `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each player uses a cyclic strategy based on a predefined sequence of moves. Nikephoros uses sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus uses sequence `B` of length `k`.\n\nThe key observation is that the choices of both players repeat cyclically. Nikephoros's choices repeat every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's choices repeat every `k` rounds. This means the pair of choices made in each round `(Nikephoros's choice, Polycarpus's choice)` will repeat every `lcm(m, k)` rounds, where `lcm` is the least common multiple.\n\nGiven that `n` can be very large (up to `2 * 10^9`), but `m` and `k` are relatively small (up to `1000`), a direct simulation of `n` rounds would be too slow. Instead, we can use the cyclic nature of the game.\n\nHere's the approach:\n1.  **Calculate the cycle length:** Determine `L = lcm(m, k)`. This is the number of rounds after which the entire game state (i.e., the pair of moves chosen by both players) repeats. We can calculate `lcm(m, k)` using the formula `(m * k) // gcd(m, k)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.\n2.  **Simulate one full cycle:** Iterate `i` from `0` to `L - 1`. In each round `i`:\n    *   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n    *   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n    *   Determine the winner of the round. If Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a loss. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a loss. Draws result in no losses for either player.\n    *   Keep a running count of Nikephoros's losses (`nikephoros_losses_in_cycle`) and Polycarpus's losses (`polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`) within this `L`-round cycle.\n3.  **Calculate losses from full cycles:** Divide `n` by `L` to find out how many full `L`-round cycles occur: `num_full_cycles = n // L`. Multiply the losses per cycle by `num_full_cycles` to get the total losses from these full cycles.\n    *   `nikephoros_total_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_in_cycle`\n    *   `polycarpus_total_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`\n4.  **Simulate remaining rounds:** Calculate the number of rounds remaining after the full cycles: `remaining_rounds = n % L`. Simulate these `remaining_rounds` (from `i = 0` to `remaining_rounds - 1`) using the same logic as step 2, adding any new losses to the `nikephoros_total_losses` and `polycarpus_total_losses`.\n5.  **Print the results:** Output `nikephoros_total_losses` and `polycarpus_total_losses`.\n\n**Helper Functions:**\n*   `gcd(a, b)`: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.\n*   `lcm(a, b)`: Calculates the least common multiple using `(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.\n*   `who_wins(c1, c2)`: Takes two choices (`c1` for player 1, `c2` for player 2) and returns `1` if `c1` wins, `-1` if `c1` loses, and `0` if it's a draw. This can be efficiently implemented using a dictionary mapping each move to the move it beats (e.g., `{'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}`).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n = 7`, `A = \"RPS\"`, `B = \"RSPP\"`\n`m = 3`, `k = 4`\n\n1.  **Cycle length:** `gcd(3, 4) = 1`. `lcm(3, 4) = (3 * 4) // 1 = 12`. So, `cycle_len = 12`.\n2.  **Simulate `n=7` rounds directly (since `n < cycle_len`):**\n    *   Round 0: N='R' (A[0]), P='R' (B[0]). Draw. (N_losses=0, P_losses=0)\n    *   Round 1: N='P' (A[1]), P='S' (B[1]). N='P' loses to P='S'. (N_losses=1, P_losses=0)\n    *   Round 2: N='S' (A[2]), P='P' (B[2]). N='S' wins against P='P'. (N_losses=1, P_losses=1)\n    *   Round 3: N='R' (A[0]), P='P' (B[3]). N='R' loses to P='P'. (N_losses=2, P_losses=1)\n    *   Round 4: N='P' (A[1]), P='R' (B[0]). N='P' wins against P='R'. (N_losses=2, P_losses=2)\n    *   Round 5: N='S' (A[2]), P='S' (B[1]). Draw. (N_losses=2, P_losses=2)\n    *   Round 6: N='R' (A[0]), P='P' (B[2]). N='R' loses to P='P'. (N_losses=3, P_losses=2)\n3.  **Final totals:** Nikephoros has 3 losses, Polycarpus has 2 losses.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Custom GCD function (Euclidean algorithm)\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\n# Custom LCM function\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        return 0\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef who_wins(c1, c2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the winner of a single Rock-Paper-Scissors round.\n    Args:\n        c1 (str): Choice of player 1 ('R', 'P', or 'S').\n        c2 (str): Choice of player 2 ('R', 'P', or 'S').\n    Returns:\n        1 if c1 wins against c2.\n        -1 if c1 loses against c2 (meaning c2 wins against c1).\n        0 if it's a draw.\n    \"\"\"\n    if c1 == c2:\n        return 0 # Draw\n\n    # Dictionary mapping an item to the item it beats\n    beats = {\n        'R': 'S', # Rock beats Scissors\n        'S': 'P', # Scissors beats Paper\n        'P': 'R'  # Paper beats Rock\n    }\n\n    if beats[c1] == c2:\n        return 1 # c1 wins\n    else:\n        # If it's not a draw and c1 doesn't beat c2, then c2 must beat c1\n        return -1 # c1 loses\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input()\n    B = input()\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Calculate the length of the cycle for the sequence of (Nikephoros's choice, Polycarpus's choice).\n    # This sequence repeats every lcm(m, k) rounds.\n    cycle_len = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Count losses for each player within one full cycle\n    nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 0\n    polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(cycle_len):\n        nikephoros_choice = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_choice = B[i % k]\n\n        result = who_wins(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice)\n        if result == 1: # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_losses_in_cycle += 1\n        elif result == -1: # Nikephoros loses, so Polycarpus wins\n            nikephoros_losses_in_cycle += 1\n    \n    # Calculate total losses based on the number of full cycles completed\n    num_full_cycles = n // cycle_len\n    nikephoros_total_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_in_cycle\n    polycarpus_total_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_in_cycle\n\n    # Calculate losses for the remaining rounds (the partial cycle)\n    remaining_rounds = n % cycle_len\n    for i in range(remaining_rounds):\n        nikephoros_choice = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_choice = B[i % k]\n\n        result = who_wins(nikephoros_choice, polycarpus_choice)\n        if result == 1: # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_total_losses += 1\n        elif result == -1: # Nikephoros loses, so Polycarpus wins\n            nikephoros_total_losses += 1\n\n    # Print the final counts of red spots (losses) for Nikephoros and Polycarpus\n    print(f\"{nikephoros_total_losses} {polycarpus_total_losses}\")\n\n# Call the solver function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
