They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Playoff\" Problem: Identifying Winning Integers**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle this \"Playoff\" problem. The core of it seems to be figuring out which skill levels, which I'll call \"winning integers,\" *could* win the tournament given a specific set of rules encoded in string `s`.  Let's break it down methodically.\n\nFirst, I see the tournament structure: $2^n$ teams, each with a unique skill level from $1$ to $2^n$. The tournament is a bracket format, with $n$ phases. Each phase halves the number of teams until a single champion remains. The twist is the game rules change per phase, determined by the `s` string â€“ `s[i] = '0'` means the lower skill wins in that phase, and `'1'` means the higher skill wins.\n\nMy goal is not to *simulate* the tournament with a particular permutation `p`, but to find which initial skill levels *could* be the winner, for *some* permutation `p`.\n\nThinking about the implications: a winning team has to win *n* games, one in each phase. Each game involves comparing skills. So, the string `s` directly controls how each game is decided. If `s_i = '0'`, the lower skill always progresses; if `s_i = '1'`, the higher skill advances.\n\nTo be a potential champion, a team with skill level X needs to win all of their matches. The logic gets more interesting when trying to *guarantee* this. We have to work *backwards* from the final game. Let's trace it out.\n\nThe champion will have to be in the last game (phase n). Say the opponent's skill is Y. If s[n-1] is '0', X < Y. If s[n-1] is '1', X > Y.\n\nTo generalise this for any phase, for a team with skill X to progress, the skill of X must have the correct relationship to the opponents it faces at all n levels. I think my Python script needs to essentially analyze the constraints implied by each `s_i` character, and build up rules about which skill levels are even *possible* champions.\n\nLet's assume there are k phases where lower skill wins and n-k phases where higher skill wins. I have to express the relationship of the champion against the opponents in each of the phases to build up a set of winning integers. The task, then, is to formalize these conditions into a Python program that can effectively determine if an integer can be a champion, for all such integers from $1$ to $2^n$.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ that can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ that dictates the rules for each phase. There are $2^n$ teams with skill levels being a permutation of $1, \\dots, 2^n$.\n\nThe tournament proceeds in $n$ phases. In phase $i$ (1-indexed), $2^{n-i}$ games are played. The character $s_i$ determines the rule for phase $i$:\n- If $s_i = '0'$, the team with the lower skill level wins.\n- If $s_i = '1'$, the team with the higher skill level wins.\n\nA team must win $n$ games to become the champion. Let's analyze the properties required for a team with skill $X$ to win.\n\nConsider the $n$ games a champion must play. Let $X$ be the skill of the champion.\nFor each game in phase $i$, $X$ plays against some opponent $Y$.\n- If $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must win by having $X < Y$.\n- If $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must win by having $X > Y$.\n\nTo maximize the range of possible winning skills, we should assume the most favorable permutation $p$ for $X$. This means that $X$'s opponents in its $n$ games should have skill levels that allow $X$ to win, and these skill levels should be chosen from the remaining available numbers in a way that is also favorable to $X$.\n\nLet's count how many phases require $X$ to be smaller than its opponent and how many require $X$ to be larger.\nLet $k_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$. These are the phases where $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\nLet $k_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$. These are the phases where $X$ must be larger than its opponent.\nClearly, $k_0 + k_1 = n$.\n\nFor $X$ to win $k_0$ games by being smaller, it needs $k_0$ opponents with skill levels greater than $X$. The smallest possible skill levels for these opponents would be $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+k_0$.\nFor $X$ to win $k_1$ games by being larger, it needs $k_1$ opponents with skill levels smaller than $X$. The largest possible skill levels for these opponents would be $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-k_1$.\n\nAll these $k_0+k_1=n$ opponents must have distinct skill levels, and none of them can be $X$.\nSo, for a team with skill $X$ to win, it must be possible to find $n$ distinct skill levels for its opponents such that:\n1. For $k_0$ opponents $Y_j$, $Y_j > X$.\n2. For $k_1$ opponents $Z_j$, $Z_j < X$.\n\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $1$. If $X=1$, it can only win games where it needs to be smaller than its opponent ($s_i = '0'$). If $k_1 > 0$, $X=1$ cannot win because it needs an opponent with skill less than 1, which is impossible. So, if $k_1 > 0$, $X$ must be at least $k_1+1$ to have $k_1$ distinct opponents with smaller skill levels (namely $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$).\nTherefore, $X \\ge k_1+1$.\n\nThe largest $X$ can be is $2^n$. If $X=2^n$, it can only win games where it needs to be larger than its opponent ($s_i = '1'$). If $k_0 > 0$, $X=2^n$ cannot win because it needs an opponent with skill greater than $2^n$, which is impossible. So, if $k_0 > 0$, $X$ must be at most $2^n - k_0$ to have $k_0$ distinct opponents with larger skill levels (namely $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$).\nTherefore, $X \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nCombining these, any winning skill $X$ must satisfy:\n$k_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nLet's verify if all integers in this range are indeed winning.\nConsider an integer $X$ such that $k_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - k_0$.\nWe need to construct a permutation $p$ such that the team with skill $X$ wins.\nThe $n$ opponents $X$ faces will have $k_1$ skill levels smaller than $X$ and $k_0$ skill levels larger than $X$.\nThe smallest $k_1$ available numbers are $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nThe largest $k_0$ available numbers are $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$.\nThe numbers $k_1+1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0$ are available for other teams or for $X$ itself.\nSince $X \\ge k_1+1$ and $X \\le 2^n-k_0$, $X$ falls within this range of \"middle\" numbers.\n\nWe can assign the $k_1$ smallest available numbers ($1, \\dots, k_1$) to be the opponents $X$ beats by being larger.\nWe can assign the $k_0$ largest available numbers ($2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$) to be the opponents $X$ beats by being smaller.\nThis selection of opponents works for any $X$ in the range $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$, because $X$ is distinct from these $k_0+k_1=n$ numbers.\nThe total number of teams is $2^n$. We've used $n+1$ skill levels (X and its $n$ opponents). The remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skill levels can be assigned to the other $2^n - (n+1)$ teams in any way that ensures they don't interfere with $X$'s path to victory. For example, we can assign them to teams that $X$ will not play against, or to teams that lose early to $X$'s opponents.\n\nThe crucial observation is that the specific structure of the tournament bracket (which team plays which) does not restrict the set of winning skills beyond what's determined by the counts $k_0$ and $k_1$. Any team can, in principle, be placed in any \"slot\" in the initial $2^n$ positions. By carefully constructing the initial permutation $p$, we can ensure that $X$ meets its chosen $n$ opponents at the correct phases, and that all other teams are assigned skill values such that $X$ wins all its games. For example, all teams not involved in $X$'s path can be assigned skills that are not $X$ or its $n$ opponents, and arranged to lose early.\n\nSo, the winning integers are precisely those $X$ such that $k_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nLet's calculate $k_0$ and $k_1$:\n$k_0 = s.count('0')$\n$k_1 = s.count('1')$\n\nThe minimum winning skill is $k_1 + 1$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - k_0$.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$k_0 = s.count('0') = 1$\n$k_1 = s.count('1') = 2$\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$\nMin winning skill: $k_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nMax winning skill: $2^n - k_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nWait, the example output is `4 5 6 7`. What went wrong?\n\nLet's re-evaluate the range.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X < Y$. $X$ needs $k_0$ distinct values greater than $X$. The smallest $k_0$ values are $X+1, \\dots, X+k_0$. So $X+k_0 \\le 2^n$. This implies $X \\le 2^n - k_0$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X > Y$. $X$ needs $k_1$ distinct values smaller than $X$. The largest $k_1$ values are $X-1, \\dots, X-k_1$. So $X-k_1 \\ge 1$. This implies $X \\ge k_1 + 1$.\n\nThe values $X-k_1, \\dots, X-1$ are the $k_1$ values smaller than $X$.\nThe values $X+1, \\dots, X+k_0$ are the $k_0$ values larger than $X$.\nThese two sets of values must be disjoint.\nThe largest value in the first set is $X-1$.\nThe smallest value in the second set is $X+1$.\nThey are always disjoint.\nThe total number of values used by $X$ and its opponents is $1 + k_1 + k_0 = 1 + n$.\nThese $n+1$ values must be distinct and within $[1, 2^n]$.\n\nLet's check the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_0 = 1, k_1 = 2$.\n$2^n = 8$.\nMin $X$: $k_1+1 = 2+1=3$.\nMax $X$: $2^n-k_0 = 8-1=7$.\nThe range is $[3, 7]$. The example output is $[4, 7]$. There is a mismatch.\n\nThe problem statement implies that $p$ is a permutation of $1, \\dots, 2^n$.\nLet's consider the number of teams that have skill levels less than $X$ and greater than $X$.\nFor $X$ to win, it needs $k_1$ opponents with skill $<X$ and $k_0$ opponents with skill $>X$.\nThe number of available skill levels less than $X$ is $X-1$. So we must have $X-1 \\ge k_1$. This means $X \\ge k_1+1$.\nThe number of available skill levels greater than $X$ is $2^n-X$. So we must have $2^n-X \\ge k_0$. This means $X \\le 2^n-k_0$.\n\nThis logic seems sound and leads to $k_1+1 \\le X \\le 2^n-k_0$.\nWhy does the example output differ?\nExample 1: `3`, `101` -> `4 5 6 7`\nMy calculation: $k_0=1, k_1=2$. Range $[2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example output excludes $3$.\n\nLet's trace the example `s=\"101\"`. $n=3$.\nPhase 1: $s_1='1'$ (higher skill wins). $2^{3-1}=4$ games.\nPhase 2: $s_2='0'$ (lower skill wins). $2^{3-2}=2$ games.\nPhase 3: $s_3='1'$ (higher skill wins). $2^{3-3}=1$ game (final).\n\nLet $X$ be the champion.\nGame 1 (Phase 1): $X$ vs $Y_1$. $s_1='1' \\implies X > Y_1$.\nGame 2 (Phase 2): $X$ vs $Y_2$. $s_2='0' \\implies X < Y_2$.\nGame 3 (Phase 3): $X$ vs $Y_3$. $s_3='1' \\implies X > Y_3$.\n\nSo, $X$ needs two opponents ($Y_1, Y_3$) with skill less than $X$, and one opponent ($Y_2$) with skill greater than $X$.\nThus, $k_1=2$ and $k_0=1$.\nThe smallest possible $X$ is $1+k_1 = 1+2 = 3$.\nThe largest possible $X$ is $2^n-k_0 = 8-1=7$.\nThe range is $X \\in [3, 7]$.\n\nThe example output `4 5 6 7` suggests that $X=3$ is not possible.\nLet's try to make $X=3$ win.\n$X=3$.\nIt needs two opponents $<3$: these must be $1, 2$.\nIt needs one opponent $>3$: this could be $4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. Let's pick $4$.\nSo, $X=3$ needs to play against $1, 2, 4$.\nThe set of skills used for $X$ and its opponents is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nLet's assign these skills to teams in the bracket.\nSuppose the initial teams are $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_8$.\nThe winner of $(P_1, P_2)$ plays winner of $(P_3, P_4)$ in phase 2.\nThe winner of $(P_5, P_6)$ plays winner of $(P_7, P_8)$ in phase 2.\nThen the two winners of phase 2 play in phase 3.\n\nLet $P_1$ be the team with skill $3$.\nPhase 1: $P_1$ (skill 3) plays $P_2$ (skill $Y_1$). $s_1='1'$, so $3 > Y_1$. $Y_1$ must be $1$ or $2$. Let $P_2$ have skill $1$. $3$ wins.\nNow $P_1$ (skill 3) proceeds.\nAnother phase 1 game: $P_3$ (skill $A$) vs $P_4$ (skill $B$).\nThe winner of this game, say $W_{34}$, will play $P_1$ in phase 2.\nPhase 2: $P_1$ (skill 3) vs $W_{34}$ (skill $Y_2$). $s_2='0'$, so $3 < Y_2$. $Y_2$ must be $>3$. Let $W_{34}$ have skill $4$. $3$ wins.\nThis means $W_{34}$ must have skill $4$. So one of $P_3, P_4$ must have skill $4$. Let $P_3$ have skill $4$.\nFor $P_3$ (skill 4) to win against $P_4$ (skill $B$), in phase 1 ($s_1='1'$), $4 > B$. $B$ can be any unused skill $<4$. E.g., $B=2$.\nSo far, skills used: $P_1=3, P_2=1, P_3=4, P_4=2$.\nThe remaining skills are $5, 6, 7, 8$.\nThe right half of the bracket needs to produce an opponent for $P_1$ in phase 3 (the final).\nLet $W_{5678}$ be the winner of the right half.\nPhase 3: $P_1$ (skill 3) vs $W_{5678}$ (skill $Y_3$). $s_3='1'$, so $3 > Y_3$.\nThis means $Y_3$ must be less than $3$.\nBut $Y_1=1$ and $Y_3=2$ are already used as opponents of $X=3$.\nThis is the problem! The $n$ opponents $Y_1, \\dots, Y_n$ must be distinct.\nIn my initial argument, I said \"The $k_1$ smallest available numbers ($1, \\dots, k_1$) to be the opponents $X$ beats by being larger.\" This implies that $X$ needs $k_1$ distinct opponents with skill less than $X$.\nAnd \"The $k_0$ largest available numbers ($2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$) to be the opponents $X$ beats by being smaller.\" This implies $X$ needs $k_0$ distinct opponents with skill greater than $X$.\n\nThese sets of opponents are:\n$S_{<X} = \\{1, \\dots, k_1\\}$\n$S_{>X} = \\{2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$\nFor $X$ to win, $X$ must be greater than all skills in $S_{<X}$, so $X > k_1$. This means $X \\ge k_1+1$.\nFor $X$ to win, $X$ must be smaller than all skills in $S_{>X}$, so $X < 2^n-k_0+1$. This means $X \\le 2^n-k_0$.\n\nThis is what I derived. The problem with $X=3$ in example 1 is that its opponents $Y_1, Y_3$ must be distinct and both less than $3$. The only numbers less than $3$ are $1$ and $2$. So $Y_1$ and $Y_3$ must be $1$ and $2$ in some order.\nOne opponent, $Y_2$, must be greater than $3$. For example, $Y_2=4$.\nSo the set of opponents is $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$.\nThe skills used are $X=3$ and its opponents $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$.\n\nNow, we need to place these values into the tournament bracket.\n$P_1=3$. $P_2=1$. $3$ wins Phase 1 match ($s_1='1'$). (Used skills: 1, 3)\n$P_3=4$. $P_4=A$. $4$ wins Phase 1 match ($s_1='1'$). $A$ must be $<4$.\nThe winner of $(P_1, P_2)$ is $3$. The winner of $(P_3, P_4)$ is $4$.\nPhase 2: $3$ vs $4$. $s_2='0'$, so $3$ wins. (Used skills: 1, 3, 4, $A$)\nSo far $A$ must be chosen from $\\{2,5,6,7,8\\}$. Let $A=2$.\nRemaining skills: $5, 6, 7, 8$.\nThe right half of the bracket needs to produce an opponent $Y_3$ for $3$ in the final.\nThis opponent $Y_3$ must satisfy $3 > Y_3$ (since $s_3='1'$).\nBut $Y_3$ must be distinct from $1, 2, 4$.\nAnd $Y_3$ must be less than $3$. There are no remaining skills less than $3$ that are not $1$ or $2$.\n$1$ and $2$ are already used by $P_2$ and $P_4$.\nThis means $X=3$ cannot win.\n\nThe issue is that the $k_1$ opponents that $X$ beats by being larger must be available when $X$ plays them. Similarly for $k_0$ opponents.\nCrucially, the skill levels of $X$'s opponents are not just any $k_1$ numbers less than $X$ and $k_0$ numbers greater than $X$. They must be specific numbers that are *available* in the bracket positions for $X$'s opponents.\n\nLet's re-examine the argument.\nThe $k_1$ opponents $X$ beats by being larger must have distinct values from $1$ to $X-1$.\nThe $k_0$ opponents $X$ beats by being smaller must have distinct values from $X+1$ to $2^n$.\nThe key insight is that the opponents $X$ beats must come from different parts of the bracket.\nThe $n$ opponents $X$ plays against are distinct teams, and thus must have distinct skill levels.\nThe lowest possible skill $X$ can have is $1$. If $X=1$, it can only win if $s_i='0'$ for all $i$. So $k_1=0$. In this case, $X=1$ needs $k_0=n$ opponents $Y_j > 1$. These can be $2, \\dots, n+1$. So $1 \\le 2^n - n$. This means $n+1 \\le 2^n$. This is true for all $n \\ge 1$.\nThe highest possible skill $X$ can have is $2^n$. If $X=2^n$, it can only win if $s_i='1'$ for all $i$. So $k_0=0$. In this case, $X=2^n$ needs $k_1=n$ opponents $Y_j < 2^n$. These can be $2^n-n, \\dots, 2^n-1$. So $2^n \\ge n+1$. This is true for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe problem is that the skills $1, \\dots, k_1$ and $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$ are the *extrema* of available skills.\nWhen $X$ plays a game, its opponent has already won some number of games, or is playing its first game.\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skills.\nThe minimum skill value that can win is $1 + (\\text{count of '1's})$. This is $1+k_1$.\nThe maximum skill value that can win is $2^n - (\\text{count of '0's})$. This is $2^n-k_0$.\nThis is the range $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\n\nThe example output `4 5 6 7` for `n=3, s=\"101\"` suggests that the minimum is $k_1+1$ where $k_1$ is the number of '1's *before* the first '0' (inclusive), or something similar.\nLet's look at the string $s$.\n`s = \"101\"`\n$s_1='1'$: $X > Y_1$.\n$s_2='0'$: $X < Y_2$.\n$s_3='1'$: $X > Y_3$.\nThe number of '1's is $k_1=2$. The number of '0's is $k_0=1$.\nThe minimum skill $X$ must have is $1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s)$. This is $1+k_1$.\nThe maximum skill $X$ can have is $2^n - (\\text{number of '0's in } s)$. This is $2^n-k_0$.\n\nThis is $k_1$ opponents that $X$ must beat by being larger, and $k_0$ opponents that $X$ must beat by being smaller.\nThe total number of skills $X$ must be larger than is $k_1$.\nThe total number of skills $X$ must be smaller than is $k_0$.\nSo $X$ must be larger than $k_1$ distinct skills and smaller than $k_0$ distinct skills.\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $k_1+1$. This allows $X$ to beat $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nThe largest $X$ can be is $2^n-k_0$. This allows $X$ to be beaten by $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$.\n\nThe key must be in the \"availability\" of these opponents.\nThe $k_1$ opponents $X$ beats by being larger must come from the set $\\{1, \\dots, X-1\\}$.\nThe $k_0$ opponents $X$ beats by being smaller must come from the set $\\{X+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nThis requires $X-1 \\ge k_1$ and $2^n-X \\ge k_0$.\nThis leads to $X \\ge k_1+1$ and $X \\le 2^n-k_0$.\n\nLet's consider the values of $k_1$ and $k_0$ in the example.\n$s = \"101\"$.\n$k_1 = 2$ (indices 0 and 2).\n$k_0 = 1$ (index 1).\nThe minimum $X$ is $1+k_1 = 1+2 = 3$.\nThe maximum $X$ is $2^3-k_0 = 8-1 = 7$.\nThe range is $[3, 7]$. Output is $[4, 7]$.\n\nThis suggests that the $k_1$ and $k_0$ counts are not just total counts, but related to some relative positions in $s$.\nLet's consider the smallest possible winning skill.\nTo win, a team $X$ must defeat $k_1$ opponents smaller than $X$ and $k_0$ opponents larger than $X$.\nThe $k_1$ opponents must have skills chosen from $\\{1, \\dots, X-1\\}$.\nThe $k_0$ opponents must have skills chosen from $\\{X+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nThese $n$ opponents must be distinct.\n\nConsider the $k_1$ games where $X$ needs to be larger. The opponents for these games must be distinct.\nConsider the $k_0$ games where $X$ needs to be smaller. The opponents for these games must be distinct.\nAll $n$ opponents must be distinct.\n\nThe critical insight from similar problems is that the actual structure of the bracket is usually not important, only the total number of games and the distinctness of opponents.\nHowever, if the example differs, there must be a subtle point.\n\nWhat if the number of '1's in $s$ is $k_1$, and the number of '0's in $s$ is $k_0$.\nThe problem states \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\".\nThe crucial part is \"in each match\". This means all matches in phase $i$ follow the rule $s_i$.\nThis doesn't change my logic.\n\nLet's consider the minimum skill $X$ can have.\n$X$ needs to beat $k_1$ opponents by being larger. The smallest $k_1$ distinct skills are $1, \\dots, k_1$.\nSo $X$ must be at least $k_1+1$. This is $X_{min} = k_1+1$.\nLet's consider the maximum skill $X$ can have.\n$X$ needs to beat $k_0$ opponents by being smaller. The largest $k_0$ distinct skills are $2^n-k_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$.\nSo $X$ must be at most $2^n-k_0$. This is $X_{max} = 2^n-k_0$.\n\nThe range is $[X_{min}, X_{max}]$.\nExample 1: `3`, `101`\n$k_1=2, k_0=1$. $X_{min}=2+1=3$. $X_{max}=8-1=7$. Range $[3, 7]$.\nOutput: `4 5 6 7`.\nThe output implies $X_{min}$ is actually $4$. Why?\n\nWhat if the minimum winning skill is related to the number of '1's in a *prefix* of $s$?\nNo, that doesn't make sense. The rules apply to phases.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\".\nThis applies to *all* matches in that phase.\nThis is the standard interpretation.\n\nCould it be that the number of '1's in $s$ is not $k_1$, but rather the number of '1's that are \"active\"?\nConsider the string $s$. The '0's means lower skill wins. The '1's means higher skill wins.\nLet $N_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$.\nLet $N_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nThe champion $X$ must win $N_0$ games where its skill is lower than its opponent, and $N_1$ games where its skill is higher than its opponent.\nTo achieve this, $X$ needs $N_0$ distinct opponents with skill $>X$ and $N_1$ distinct opponents with skill $<X$.\nThe smallest $N_1$ values are $1, \\dots, N_1$. So $X$ must be at least $N_1+1$.\nThe largest $N_0$ values are $2^n-N_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$. So $X$ must be at most $2^n-N_0$.\nThis leads to the range $[N_1+1, 2^n-N_0]$.\n\nLet's check the example cases with this logic:\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n   $N_0 = 1$ (for $s_2$)\n   $N_1 = 2$ (for $s_1, s_3$)\n   Min winning skill: $N_1+1 = 2+1=3$.\n   Max winning skill: $2^3 - N_0 = 8-1=7$.\n   Predicted range: $[3, 7]$. Example output: `4 5 6 7`. Still a mismatch.\n\n2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$\n   $N_0 = 0$\n   $N_1 = 1$ (for $s_1$)\n   Min winning skill: $N_1+1 = 1+1=2$.\n   Max winning skill: $2^1 - N_0 = 2-0=2$.\n   Predicted range: $[2, 2]$. Example output: `2`. Matches.\n\n3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$\n   $N_0 = 1$ (for $s_1$)\n   $N_1 = 1$ (for $s_2$)\n   Min winning skill: $N_1+1 = 1+1=2$.\n   Max winning skill: $2^2 - N_0 = 4-1=3$.\n   Predicted range: $[2, 3]$. Example output: `2 3`. Matches.\n\nIt seems my logic is correct for examples 2 and 3, but not for example 1.\nWhat is special about example 1? $s=\"101\"$.\nThe string is length $n=3$. $s_0=1, s_1=0, s_2=1$.\nMy $k_0, k_1$ counts are based on 0-indexed string, problem description 1-indexed phases.\n$s_1$ (first char) -> phase 1\n$s_2$ (second char) -> phase 2\n$s_3$ (third char) -> phase 3\nSo $s[0]$ is $s_1$, $s[1]$ is $s_2$, $s[2]$ is $s_3$.\nThe counts are correct. $s[0]='1', s[1]='0', s[2]='1'$. So $N_1=2, N_0=1$.\n\nCould it be related to the number of '1's *before* the last '0', and '0's *after* the first '1'?\nThis problem is surprisingly tricky if my simple counting argument is wrong for one case.\nThe only way my logic for $X_{min}$ or $X_{max}$ could be wrong is if the \"availability\" of opponents is restricted by the tournament structure in a way that is not immediately obvious.\n\nLet's reconsider the $X=3$ case for $s=\"101\"$.\n$X=3$ needs to beat two opponents $Y_1, Y_3 < 3$ and one opponent $Y_2 > 3$.\n$Y_1, Y_3$ must be $1, 2$. $Y_2$ could be $4$.\nSo, skills $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ are used.\n$P_1=3$.\n$P_2=1$. $3$ wins (Phase 1, $s_1='1'$). $W_{12}=3$.\n$P_3=4$.\n$P_4=2$. $4$ wins (Phase 1, $s_1='1'$). $W_{34}=4$.\n$W_{12}=3$ plays $W_{34}=4$ in Phase 2. $s_2='0'$, so $3$ wins. $W_{1234}=3$.\nNow $3$ proceeds to the final (Phase 3). Its opponent $W_{5678}$ must have skill $Y_3 < 3$.\nThe available skills for $W_{5678}$ are from $\\{5,6,7,8\\}$. None of these are less than $3$.\nSo $X=3$ cannot win. This confirms the example output.\n\nThe issue is that $Y_1$ and $Y_3$ must be distinct AND available.\n$Y_1$ is an opponent in phase 1. $Y_3$ is an opponent in phase 3.\nThe opponent in phase 1 ($Y_1$) is some team $P_j$ (e.g., $P_2$).\nThe opponent in phase 3 ($Y_3$) is the champion of the \"other half\" of the bracket ($W_{5678}$).\nThis $W_{5678}$ needs to win $n-1$ games to reach the final.\nIn the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$X=3$.\n$Y_1$ is $P_2$. $Y_1 \\in \\{1,2\\}$. Let $P_2=1$.\n$Y_2$ is $W_{34}$. $Y_2 \\in \\{4, \\dots, 8\\}$. Let $W_{34}=4$.\n$Y_3$ is $W_{5678}$. $Y_3 \\in \\{1,2\\}$ (distinct from $Y_1$). So $Y_3=2$.\nSo $W_{5678}$ must have skill $2$.\nFor $W_{5678}$ to have skill $2$, it must win 2 games.\nPhase 1 for $W_{5678}$: $s_1='1'$, so $2$ needs to beat $Z_1 < 2$. $Z_1$ must be $1$.\nBut $1$ is already $Y_1$. So $1$ is not available for $Z_1$.\nThis is the full explanation of why $X=3$ fails. The skills $1, \\dots, k_1$ need to be distributed among $X$'s opponents and $X$'s opponents' opponents, etc.\n\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be greater than is $k_1$.\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be smaller than is $k_0$.\nThe problem is that the $k_1$ \"smaller\" opponents and $k_0$ \"larger\" opponents are not just any $n$ values. They are specific values that win their way to meet $X$.\nA team with skill $Y_3=2$ must win its way to the final.\nTo win its phase 1 game ($s_1='1'$), $Y_3=2$ needs to beat an opponent $Z_1 < 2$. The only such skill is $1$.\nSo $Z_1=1$.\nThen $Y_3=2$ wins its phase 1 game.\nThen $Y_3=2$ needs to win its phase 2 game ($s_2='0'$). It needs to beat an opponent $Z_2 > 2$.\nSo $Z_2$ must be some skill from $\\{3,4, \\dots, 8\\}$ and $Z_2 \\ne 1$.\nBut $X=3$ is already in the other half of the bracket.\nThe opponent $Y_2$ for $X=3$ in phase 2 was $4$.\nSo $Z_2$ could be $5$.\nSo for $Y_3=2$ to win, it needs to beat $1$ (in phase 1) and $5$ (in phase 2).\nSo skills $\\{1,2,5\\}$ are used in the path of $Y_3$.\nAnd skills $\\{1,3,4\\}$ are used in the path of $X$.\nThe common skill $1$ cannot be used by both paths. $Y_1$ for $X$ is $1$, and $Z_1$ for $Y_3$ is $1$. This is the conflict.\n\nThe total number of teams that $X$ must be greater than in the entire tournament (including $X$'s opponents, and their opponents, etc.) is $2^{k_1}-1$.\nSimilarly, the total number of teams that $X$ must be smaller than is $2^{k_0}-1$.\nThis is incorrect. This is if $X$ always plays against the highest/lowest skill available.\n\nLet's re-examine $s_i$.\nIf $s_i=0$, the winner of the match is $\\min(A,B)$.\nIf $s_i=1$, the winner of the match is $\\max(A,B)$.\n\nLet $L$ be the set of teams with skill levels $1, \\dots, 2^n$.\nA team $X$ wins.\nThe maximum number of teams $X$ must be greater than is $2^{k_1}-1$.\nThe maximum number of teams $X$ must be smaller than is $2^{k_0}-1$.\nThis is if $k_1$ is the number of '1's in $s$, and $k_0$ is the number of '0's in $s$.\nThis is a standard competitive programming trick for this type of problem.\nThe champion $X$ effectively needs to be \"larger\" than $2^{N_1}-1$ other skill values (which are eliminated by $X$ or by teams $X$ beats).\nAnd $X$ needs to be \"smaller\" than $2^{N_0}-1$ other skill values (which are eliminated by $X$ or by teams $X$ beats).\nThe \"larger\" values are $X$'s skill and all values $X$ beats (or values beaten by teams $X$ beats).\nThe \"smaller\" values are $X$'s skill and all values $X$ is beaten by (or values that beat teams $X$ beats).\nNo, this is not right.\n\nConsider the values that can possibly win.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winner is the minimum. If $s_i = '1'$, the winner is the maximum.\nLet's count the number of '0's ($c_0$) and '1's ($c_1$) in $s$.\nFor the champion to win, it must win $c_0$ games by being smaller, and $c_1$ games by being larger.\nLet $X$ be the champion's skill.\nTo win $c_1$ games by being larger, $X$ needs to be greater than $c_1$ distinct opponents.\nThe minimum possible value for $X$ is $c_1+1$.\nTo win $c_0$ games by being smaller, $X$ needs to be smaller than $c_0$ distinct opponents.\nThe maximum possible value for $X$ is $2^n-c_0$.\nThis is the range $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0]$.\nThis is exactly what I derived earlier.\n\nThe example output difference must be due to a specific interpretation of $s_i$.\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;\"\n\"if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\nThis is standard.\n\nWhat if the number of '1's in $s$ is $k_1$, and '0's is $k_0$.\nThe problem states that $s$ has length $n$.\nThe minimum skill an eventual winner can have is $1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s)$.\nThe maximum skill an eventual winner can have is $2^n - (\\text{number of '0's in } s)$.\n\nThis is the standard interpretation.\nThe example output for `n=3, s=\"101\"` is `4 5 6 7`.\nMy calculation for `n=3, s=\"101\"` is $N_0=1, N_1=2$. Range $[2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe problem statement's example could have a typo, or there's a very subtle point I'm missing.\nGiven that the logic works for two of the three examples, it's highly likely that the logic is correct and the first example output has a subtle difference or a mistake.\n\nLet's consider another angle.\nHow many teams can reach the final? Only one.\nHow many teams are eliminated? $2^n-1$.\nEach game eliminates one team.\nThe specific structure of the bracket is fixed, i.e., team 1 vs 2, then winner vs winner(3 vs 4).\nThis means that if team $X$ is in position $P_i$, it will play a fixed sequence of opponents from fixed parts of the bracket.\nE.g., if $X$ is $P_1$:\nPhase 1 opponent is $P_2$.\nPhase 2 opponent is winner of $(P_3, P_4)$.\nPhase 3 opponent is winner of $(P_5, P_6, P_7, P_8)$.\nThis is the crucial part. My previous reasoning assumed that $X$ could pick any $n$ distinct opponents from the $2^n-1$ other teams. But it can't. It plays specific teams in specific parts of the bracket.\n\nLet $f(s, \\text{skill range})$ be the set of possible winning skills.\nThis means we need to find the range of skills for the champion.\nLet $N_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nLet $N_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nA team with skill $X$ wins.\nThe team needs to win $N_1$ games by having higher skill and $N_0$ games by having lower skill.\nThe smallest possible skill for $X$ is $1$. The largest is $2^n$.\nThe minimum number of skills that $X$ must be greater than is $N_1$.\nThe minimum number of skills that $X$ must be smaller than is $N_0$.\n\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than its opponent. This means $X$ must be greater than $N_1$ distinct values.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent. This means $X$ must be smaller than $N_0$ distinct values.\n\nThe total number of teams that $X$ must be greater than (directly or indirectly) is $2^{N_1}-1$.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ must be smaller than (directly or indirectly) is $2^{N_0}-1$.\nThis is a common pattern for \"winner of a sub-bracket\" problems.\nLet $k_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nLet $k_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nThe minimum skill $X$ can have is $1 + (2^{k_1}-1)$. No, this is not right.\nThe $2^{k_1}-1$ teams are eliminated by $X$ or by teams $X$ beats in the $k_1$ phases where $s_i='1'$.\nThe $2^{k_0}-1$ teams are eliminated by $X$ or by teams $X$ beats in the $k_0$ phases where $s_i='0'$.\n\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is $c_1$. The number of '0's in $s$ is $c_0$.\nThe winner $X$ must be greater than $c_1$ opponents.\nThe winner $X$ must be smaller than $c_0$ opponents.\nThe minimum skill value that can win is $1 + c_1$.\nThe maximum skill value that can win is $2^n - c_0$.\n\nThe crucial part is that the $c_1$ opponents $X$ beats by being larger must be distinct. And the $c_0$ opponents $X$ beats by being smaller must be distinct. And all $c_0+c_1=n$ opponents must be distinct.\nThis is what I started with.\n\nLet's re-read the problem very carefully.\n\"The skill level of the $i$-th team is $p_i$, where $p$ is a permutation of integers $1, 2, \\dots, 2^n$.\"\n\"Find all winning integers $x$. An integer $x$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $p$ such that the team with skill $x$ wins the tournament.\"\nThis means we can choose any $p$. The bracket is fixed, but the skills are assigned.\n\nThe number of skills that are strictly smaller than $X$ is $X-1$.\nThe number of skills that are strictly larger than $X$ is $2^n-X$.\nFor $X$ to win $c_1$ games by being larger, it needs to find $c_1$ distinct opponents with skill levels less than $X$. This requires $X-1 \\ge c_1$, so $X \\ge c_1+1$.\nFor $X$ to win $c_0$ games by being smaller, it needs to find $c_0$ distinct opponents with skill levels greater than $X$. This requires $2^n-X \\ge c_0$, so $X \\le 2^n-c_0$.\n\nSo the range of winning skills is $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0]$.\nThis is the only logical conclusion from the problem statement.\nThe first example output `4 5 6 7` for `n=3, s=\"101\"` is the only one that doesn't fit this.\nThe problem statement gives $n=3$, $s=\"101\"$.\n$c_1 = 2$ (for $s_1, s_3$). $c_0 = 1$ (for $s_2$).\nMy range: $[2+1, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nExample range: $[4, 7]$.\n\nThis means $X=3$ is not a winning skill for $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\nWhy is $X=3$ not a winning skill?\n$X=3$ needs to beat two opponents (say $O_1, O_2$) with skills $<3$. These must be $1, 2$.\n$X=3$ needs to beat one opponent (say $O_3$) with skill $>3$. This could be $4, \\dots, 8$. Let's try $O_3=4$.\nSo $X=3$ must be set up to defeat $1, 2, 4$.\nThe path of $X=3$ in the tournament:\n1. $X=3$ vs $O_1=1$ in phase 1 ($s_1='1'$, $3>1$, $X$ wins).\n2. $X=3$ vs $O_3=4$ in phase 2 ($s_2='0'$, $3<4$, $X$ wins).\n3. $X=3$ vs $O_2=2$ in phase 3 ($s_3='1'$, $3>2$, $X$ wins).\n\nNow, the problem. $O_1=1$ is the team $X$ plays in phase 1. $O_3=4$ is the team $X$ plays in phase 2. $O_2=2$ is the team $X$ plays in phase 3.\nFor $O_3=4$ to reach phase 2 to play $X=3$, $O_3=4$ must win its phase 1 game.\nIn phase 1, $s_1='1'$. So $O_3=4$ must beat an opponent $O_{3,1} < 4$. $O_{3,1}$ could be $2$.\nSo, $P_1=3, P_2=1$. $P_3=4, P_4=2$.\nWinner of $(P_1,P_2)$ is $3$. Winner of $(P_3,P_4)$ is $4$.\nThen $3$ plays $4$ in phase 2. $s_2='0'$, $3<4$, so $3$ wins.\nNow, for $O_2=2$ to reach phase 3 to play $X=3$, $O_2=2$ must win its phase 1 and phase 2 games.\nIn phase 1, $s_1='1'$. $O_2=2$ must beat an opponent $O_{2,1} < 2$. The only option is $1$.\nBut $1$ is already assigned to $P_2$. So $O_{2,1}$ cannot be $1$.\nThis is the problem. $1$ is used by $P_2$ to lose to $X=3$.\nAnd $1$ is needed by $O_2=2$ to win its first game.\nThis is the conflict. The $n$ opponents of $X$ cannot be arbitrary values. They must be values that can *also* win their way to meet $X$.\n\nSo, for $X$ to win, the $c_1$ opponents it beats by being larger must be available and can lose to $X$.\nThe $c_0$ opponents it beats by being smaller must be available and can lose to $X$.\nThe values $1, \\dots, c_1$ are the smallest possible values.\nThe values $2^n-c_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$ are the largest possible values.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ beats $Y$. $Y$ must be smaller than $X$.\nIf $s_i='0'$, $X$ beats $Y$. $Y$ must be larger than $X$.\n\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be strictly greater than is $2^{c_1}-1$.\nThe number of teams that $X$ must be strictly smaller than is $2^{c_0}-1$.\nThis is a standard pattern for problems like this.\n$c_1$ is the count of '1's in $s$.\n$c_0$ is the count of '0's in $s$.\nThe minimum winning skill is $1 + (2^{c_1}-1) = 2^{c_1}$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n\nLet's test this new formula:\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n   $c_0 = 1, c_1 = 2$.\n   Min winning skill: $2^{c_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n   Max winning skill: $2^3 - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 8 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\n   Predicted range: $[4, 7]$. Example output: `4 5 6 7`. This matches!\n\n2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$\n   $c_0 = 0, c_1 = 1$.\n   Min winning skill: $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   Max winning skill: $2^1 - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\n   Predicted range: $[2, 2]$. Example output: `2`. Matches.\n\n3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$\n   $c_0 = 1, c_1 = 1$.\n   Min winning skill: $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   Max winning skill: $2^2 - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 4 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\n   Predicted range: $[2, 3]$. Example output: `2 3`. Matches.\n\nThis formula seems to be correct for all examples.\nThe logic behind it is:\nFor $X$ to win $c_1$ games by being larger, it needs to be the highest skill among $2^{c_1}$ teams that form its \"sub-bracket\" for those $c_1$ games. In these $c_1$ phases, $X$ will always win if it has the highest skill among its current sub-bracket. To ensure $X$ wins these $c_1$ games, $X$ must be at least $2^{c_1}$ (i.e., $X$ must be the largest among $2^{c_1}$ values, which means it must be at least $2^{c_1}$ if the smallest values are $1, \\dots, 2^{c_1}$). The smallest value $X$ can take is $2^{c_1}$ (by assigning $1, \\dots, 2^{c_1}-1$ to the other teams in its $2^{c_1}$-team sub-bracket).\n\nSimilarly, for $X$ to win $c_0$ games by being smaller, it needs to be the lowest skill among $2^{c_0}$ teams that form its \"sub-bracket\" for those $c_0$ games. To ensure $X$ wins these $c_0$ games, $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1)$ (i.e., $X$ must be the smallest among $2^{c_0}$ values, which means it must be at most $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$ if the largest values are $2^n-2^{c_0}+1, \\dots, 2^n$).\n\nThe minimum $X$ can be is $2^{c_1}$.\nThe maximum $X$ can be is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\nThe set of winning integers $x$ is $[2^{c_1}, 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1]$.\n\nLet's quickly verify for $n=1, s=\"0\"$.\n$c_0=1, c_1=0$.\nMin: $2^{0} = 1$.\nMax: $2^1 - 2^1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1$.\nRange $[1, 1]$. So $X=1$ wins. This makes sense: $s=\"0\"$, lower skill wins. $1$ is the lowest skill, so it can always win.\n\nThis logic seems solid and matches all examples.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count occurrences of '0' in $s$, let it be $c_0$.\n4. Count occurrences of '1' in $s$, let it be $c_1$.\n5. Calculate $min\\_x = 2^{c_1}$.\n6. Calculate $max\\_x = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n7. Print all integers from $min\\_x$ to $max\\_x$ inclusive, in ascending order.\n\nExample $n=18$. $2^{18}$ is $262144$.\n$c_0, c_1$ can be up to $18$.\n$2^{18}$ is within integer limits.\nThe range can be empty if $min\\_x > max\\_x$. This can happen if $2^{c_1} > 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\nFor example, if $n=1, s=\"01\"$. This is not possible. $n=1$, $s$ has length 1.\nIf $n=1, s=\"0\"$, $c_0=1, c_1=0$. Min $2^0=1$. Max $2^1-2^1+1=1$.

There are $2^n$ teams whose skill levels are a permutation of integers $1, \\dots, 2^n$. The tournament has $n$ phases. The character $s_i$ (for the $i$-th phase) determines the rule for all matches in that phase: if $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill team wins; if $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill team wins.\n\nLet $X$ be the skill level of the champion. For $X$ to win the tournament, it must win $n$ consecutive games. Let's count how many of these games require $X$ to have a higher skill and how many require $X$ to have a lower skill.\n\nLet $c_1$ be the number of '1's in the string $s$. These are the phases where $X$ must win by having a higher skill.\nLet $c_0$ be the number of '0's in the string $s$. These are the phases where $X$ must win by having a lower skill.\nNote that $c_1 + c_0 = n$.\n\nConsider the games where $X$ must win by having a higher skill ($s_i = '1'$). For $X$ to win all $c_1$ such games, $X$ must be the highest skill among a certain group of teams. In the most favorable scenario, we can construct the permutation $p$ such that $X$ is placed in a sub-bracket with $2^{c_1}-1$ other teams whose skills are all less than $X$. To ensure $X$ can win all $c_1$ such games, $X$ must be at least $2^{c_1}$ (if the skills are $1, 2, \\dots, 2^{c_1}$). Thus, the minimum possible value for a winning skill $X$ is $2^{c_1}$.\n\nConsider the games where $X$ must win by having a lower skill ($s_i = '0'$). For $X$ to win all $c_0$ such games, $X$ must be the lowest skill among a certain group of teams. In the most favorable scenario, we can construct the permutation $p$ such that $X$ is placed in a sub-bracket with $2^{c_0}-1$ other teams whose skills are all greater than $X$. To ensure $X$ can win all $c_0$ such games, $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1)$. This is because if $X$ is the lowest among $2^{c_0}$ skills, and these skills are chosen from the highest available values, then $X$ would be $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$. Thus, the maximum possible value for a winning skill $X$ is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, any winning skill $X$ must satisfy:\n$2^{c_1} \\le X \\le 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n\nIt can be shown that for any integer $X$ within this range, it is possible to construct a permutation $p$ such that the team with skill $X$ wins the tournament. This is because the skills $1, \\dots, 2^{c_1}-1$ can be assigned to teams that $X$ must be greater than, and the skills $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 2, \\dots, 2^n$ can be assigned to teams that $X$ must be smaller than. Since $X$ is in the specified range, it will not conflict with these assignments, and the remaining skills can be filled arbitrarily.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Count the number of '0's ($c_0$) and '1's ($c_1$) in the input string $s$.\n2. Calculate the minimum winning skill: `min_winning_skill = 2**c1`.\n3. Calculate the maximum winning skill: `max_winning_skill = (2**n) - (2**c0) + 1`.\n4. Generate all integers from `min_winning_skill` to `max_winning_skill` (inclusive) and print them in ascending order.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$c_0 = 1$ (for $s_2$)\n$c_1 = 2$ (for $s_1, s_3$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$\n`min_winning_skill = 2**2 = 4`\n`max_winning_skill = 8 - (2**1) + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7`\nThe winning integers are $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$\n$c_0 = 0$\n$c_1 = 1$\n$2^n = 2^1 = 2$\n`min_winning_skill = 2**1 = 2`\n`max_winning_skill = 2 - (2**0) + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2`\nThe winning integer is $2$.\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$\n$c_0 = 1$\n$c_1 = 1$\n$2^n = 2^2 = 4$\n`min_winning_skill = 2**1 = 2`\n`max_winning_skill = 4 - (2**1) + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3`\nThe winning integers are $2, 3$.\n\nAll examples match this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # c0 is the count of '0's in the string s.\n    # These are the phases where the team with the lower skill level wins.\n    c0 = s.count('0')\n\n    # c1 is the count of '1's in the string s.\n    # These are the phases where the team with the higher skill level wins.\n    c1 = s.count('1')\n\n    # The minimum skill level a champion can have is 2^c1.\n    # To win c1 games by having a higher skill, the champion must be able to defeat\n    # 2^c1 - 1 other teams in those specific sub-brackets where '1' rule applies.\n    # The smallest possible skill for the champion that can achieve this is 2^c1\n    # (by assigning skills 1 through 2^c1-1 to the opponents in these sub-brackets).\n    min_winning_skill = 2**c1\n\n    # The maximum skill level a champion can have is 2^n - 2^c0 + 1.\n    # To win c0 games by having a lower skill, the champion must be able to defeat\n    # 2^c0 - 1 other teams in those specific sub-brackets where '0' rule applies.\n    # The largest possible skill for the champion that can achieve this is 2^n - 2^c0 + 1\n    # (by assigning skills 2^n-2^c0+2 through 2^n to the opponents in these sub-brackets).\n    max_winning_skill = (2**n) - (2**c0) + 1\n\n    # All integers within this range [min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill] are winning integers.\n    # For any X in this range, we can construct a permutation p such that X wins.\n    \n    winning_integers = []\n    # The range function in Python is exclusive of the end value, so we add 1.\n    for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1):\n        winning_integers.append(str(x))\n\n    print(\" \".join(winning_integers))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
