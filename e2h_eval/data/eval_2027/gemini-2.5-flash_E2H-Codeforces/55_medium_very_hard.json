    "thought": "**Understanding Lexicographically Smallest Ternary Strings with Swaps**\n\nAlright, so the task is to figure out the smallest string we can get by swapping characters around, given some rules. The crux of the problem is realizing the implications of the swaps:  '01' <-> '10' and '12' <-> '21'. What does this mean? Basically, '1's are super flexible. They can move past '0's and '2's, which means any '1' can end up in any position.  However, '0's and '2's are special. The swap rules prevent us from changing their relative order. If a '0' comes before a '2' in the original string, it must always stay before that '2' in any final arrangement.\n\nSo, the strategy becomes clear. We have to view the '0's and '2's as the fixed \"scaffold\".  All the '1's are just free agents that can move around. To get the smallest string, we want to put '0's first, then '1's, and finally '2's.  But we must respect the fixed order of the '0's and '2's.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Count the '1's**: Figure out how many '1's we have.\n2.  **Extract the scaffold**: Get the original order of '0's and '2's (the subsequence of '0's and '2's).\n3.  **Find the critical point**: Find the first occurrence of '2' in the subsequence. This is the place where we have to insert the '1's (or at the end if no 2).\n4.  **Construct the final string**: We put all the '0's before the first '2', then all the '1's, and then we put what's left.\n\nThis approach gives us the lexicographically smallest string. It's O(N) because it only requires one pass through the string, so it's good for large inputs! The key insight is this : because the order of the '0's and '2's is fixed, the '1's should go immediately after all the '0's before the first '2'.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by applying specific swaps: '01' <-> '10' and '12' <-> '21'. The key restriction is that '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1.  **'0' and '1' swaps**: '01' <-> '10'. This means a '0' can move past a '1' to its right, and a '1' can move past a '0' to its left.\n2.  **'1' and '2' swaps**: '12' <-> '21'. This means a '1' can move past a '2' to its right, and a '2' can move past a '1' to its left.\n\nThe crucial observation is about what *cannot* be swapped: '0' and '2'. This implies that the relative order of '0's and '2's in the string is invariant. For example, if we have a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j` with `i < j` in the original string, then this specific '0' must always appear before this specific '2' in any reachable string. The same applies if `i > j`.\n\nThis means that if we extract all '0's and '2's from the original string and form a subsequence (let's call it `s_02`), this subsequence must be preserved in the final string. For example, if the original string is \"100210\", `s_02` would be \"0020\". Any valid transformation of \"100210\" must have \"0020\" as its subsequence of '0's and '2's.\n\nNow, let's consider the '1's.\n*   A '1' can move past a '0' ('01' <-> '10').\n*   A '1' can move past a '2' ('12' <-> '21').\nThese two rules together imply that a '1' can move freely past any '0' or '2'. Furthermore, '1's can also move past other '1's (e.g., '011' -> '101' -> '110'). This means all '1's in the string can be grouped together into a single contiguous block.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to: we have a fixed subsequence of '0's and '2's (`s_02`), and a block of all '1's. We need to insert this block of '1's into `s_02` to form the lexicographically smallest string.\n\nTo make a string lexicographically smallest, we want to place '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nGiven `s_02`, we cannot change the relative order of its characters.\nIf `s_02` is \"0020\" and we have two '1's:\n*   We want to put '0's first. So, we should put any '0's from `s_02` that appear before the first '2'. In \"0020\", these are \"00\".\n*   After these initial '0's, we have a choice: either place the block of '1's or the first '2' from `s_02`. Since '1' < '2', placing the '1's next will result in a lexicographically smaller string.\n*   After placing all '1's, we append the rest of `s_02`, which starts from the first '2' and includes any subsequent '0's and '2's.\n\nThis leads to the following strategy:\n1.  Count all occurrences of '1' in the input string `s`. Let this be `count_ones`.\n2.  Construct a new string `s_02` by removing all '1's from `s`, preserving the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n3.  Find the index of the first '2' in `s_02`. If no '2' exists, this index can be considered the end of `s_02`.\n4.  The final lexicographically smallest string will be formed by concatenating three parts:\n    *   The prefix of `s_02` up to (but not including) the first '2'. (These are all '0's that appear before any '2's.)\n    *   A string consisting of `count_ones` '1's.\n    *   The suffix of `s_02` starting from the first '2' to the end. (This includes the first '2' and all subsequent '0's and '2's.)\n\n**Example:** `s = \"100210\"`\n1.  `count_ones = 2` (from '1' at index 0 and '1' at index 4).\n2.  `s_02 = \"0020\"` (removing '1's from \"100210\").\n3.  The first '2' in `s_02` is at index 2.\n4.  Constructing the result:\n    *   `s_02[0:2]` = \"00\"\n    *   `'1' * 2` = \"11\"\n    *   `s_02[2:]` = \"20\"\n    Concatenating these gives \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\".\n\nThis approach is efficient, running in O(N) time where N is the length of the input string, as it involves a single pass to count '1's and build `s_02`, and then string manipulations (slicing and joining) which are also linear in complexity.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    s_02_chars = [] # To store characters '0' and '2' in their original relative order\n\n    # Iterate through the input string to separate '1's from '0's and '2's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_02_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the collected '0's and '2's into a string\n    s_02 = \"\".join(s_02_chars)\n\n    # Find the index of the first '2' in the s_02 string\n    # s.find() returns -1 if the character is not found\n    first_two_idx = s_02.find('2')\n    \n    # If no '2' is found, all '0's and '2's are effectively '0's (or there are none).\n    # In this case, all '1's should be placed at the very end to minimize lexicographically\n    # after all '0's.
