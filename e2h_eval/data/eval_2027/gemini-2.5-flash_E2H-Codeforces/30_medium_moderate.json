Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Core of the \"TV Game\" Problem: Dynamic Programming with a Twist**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. This \"TV Game\" problem screams dynamic programming to me, but with a slight wrinkle.  We have two players, Homer and Marge, each vying for the biggest possible numbers, which are built digit by digit by taking the leftmost digit from the original number. The size of the number is small enough that dynamic programming is efficient. We're maximizing the *sum* of their numbers, not Homer's number or Marge's number, separately, which simplifies the process!\n\nI've broken it down:\n\n*   **Understanding the Setup:** Two players, `n` turns each, a `2n`-digit number `A`.  They append the leftmost digit of `A` to their own number (which is what makes the numbers different for Homer and Marge). We have a sequence of moves (the output).\n*   **Key Insight:** The digit's *position* determines its contribution to the final sum. The first digit a player takes becomes the most significant digit in their final number. The `k`-th digit a player takes will be the `k`-th from the left (0-indexed). Homer's contribution is `digit * 10^(n-1-k)`, and Marge's is `digit * 10^(n-1-k)`.  This is CRUCIAL for the dynamic programming part.\n*   **Dynamic Programming State:** I'm going to use a memoized DP approach. The state will be `dp(index, h_taken, m_taken)`.\n    *   `index`: The current digit to consider in `A`.\n    *   `h_taken`: How many digits Homer has already taken.\n    *   `m_taken`: How many digits Marge has already taken.\n    *   The value will be the maximum total prize from here to the end.\n\n*   **Recursion:** At each `index`, we have two choices: Homer takes the digit, or Marge takes it (if and only if they've not used all moves). I'll calculate the value of each move, add the recursive result, and pick the *maximum*. It also looks like a good idea to store the results of solved subproblems for quick reference.\n*   **Base Case:** When `index` reaches `2n`, there are no more digits. The prize is 0.\n\n*   **Implementation:** I'll use a 3D memoization table to store the `dp` values. I'll need to reconstruct the path (sequence of moves) by keeping track of the best decision at each step.\n\n*   **Constraints:** The constraints give `2n <= 36`. This means the state space is manageable, and memoization is feasible.\n\n*   **Edge cases:** I'll carefully check that Homer and Marge don't take more digits than `n`.\n*   **Path Reconstruction:** To build the sequence of moves (e.g., \"HHMM\"), I'll backtrack through the memoization table, at each step choosing the option (Homer or Marge) that led to the optimal result and adding it to the path string.\n\n* **Further optimization:** I've carefully considered the time and space complexity, and it appears the proposed DP approach should be efficient for `n` up to 18. I'll need to double check the arithmetic in case any large values could cause overflow. However, it will fit in python's arbitrary size integers.\n\nI am confident this approach will efficiently provide the optimal solution. I just need to translate this logic into the Python code. I am ready to implement the code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer and Marge to maximize their total prize (S1 + S2), where S1 and S2 are numbers formed by digits they take from a 2n-digit number A. Each player must make exactly n moves.\n\n**Understanding the Game Mechanics:**\nWhen a player takes the leftmost digit from A, they append it to their own number (S1 for Homer, S2 for Marge). This means the first digit a player takes becomes the most significant digit (leftmost) of their final n-digit number, the second digit they take becomes the next most significant, and so on.\n\nLet `n` be the number of moves each player makes.\nIf Homer takes a digit `d` as his `k`-th move (0-indexed, so `k` ranges from `0` to `n-1`), this digit `d` will contribute `d * 10^(n - 1 - k)` to S1.\nSimilarly, if Marge takes a digit `d` as her `k`-th move, it will contribute `d * 10^(n - 1 - k)` to S2.\n\nThe total prize is the sum of S1 and S2. We need to decide for each of the `2n` digits in A, who takes it, such that both players make exactly `n` moves and the total prize is maximized.\n\n**Dynamic Programming Approach:**\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We need to keep track of:\n1. The current digit being considered from A (`index`).\n2. The number of moves Homer has made so far (`h_taken`).\n3. The number of moves Marge has made so far (`m_taken`).\n\nLet `dp(index, h_taken, m_taken)` be the maximum total prize that can be obtained from the digits `A[index]` through `A[2n-1]`, given that Homer has already taken `h_taken` digits and Marge has taken `m_taken` digits.\n\n**State Definition:**\n* `index`: The 0-based index of the current digit in `A` that is being considered. Ranges from `0` to `2n`.\n* `h_taken`: The number of digits Homer has chosen so far. Ranges from `0` to `n`.\n* `m_taken`: The number of digits Marge has chosen so far. Ranges from `0` to `n`.\n\n**Base Case:**\n* If `index == 2n`: All digits have been processed. The contribution from remaining digits is 0. So, `dp(2n, h_taken, m_taken) = 0`.\n\n**Recursive Step:**\nAt `dp(index, h_taken, m_taken)`, we have two choices for digit `A[index]`:\n\n1. **Homer takes `A[index]`:**\n   This choice is valid only if `h_taken < n` (Homer hasn't made all his `n` moves yet).\n   The value contributed by `A[index]` to S1 is `int(A[index]) * (10**(n - 1 - h_taken))`.\n   The total prize for this choice would be `int(A[index]) * (10**(n - 1 - h_taken)) + dp(index + 1, h_taken + 1, m_taken)`.\n\n2. **Marge takes `A[index]`:**\n   This choice is valid only if `m_taken < n` (Marge hasn't made all her `n` moves yet).\n   The value contributed by `A[index]` to S2 is `int(A[index]) * (10**(n - 1 - m_taken))`.\n   The total prize for this choice would be `int(A[index]) * (10**(n - 1 - m_taken)) + dp(index + 1, h_taken, m_taken + 1)`.\n\nWe choose the option that yields the maximum total prize:\n`dp(index, h_taken, m_taken) = max( (prize if Homer takes A[index]), (prize if Marge takes A[index]) )`\nWe use memoization (a dictionary or a 3D array) to store the results of `dp` calls to avoid redundant computations.\n\n**Constraints and Complexity:**\n* `n <= 18`.\n* `index` goes up to `2n` (max 36).\n* `h_taken` goes up to `n` (max 18).\n* `m_taken` goes up to `n` (max 18).\nThe number of states is approximately `(2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1)`. For `n=18`, this is `37 * 19 * 19`, which is about `13,357` states. Each state computation takes constant time. This makes the DP solution efficient enough.\n\n**Reconstructing the Path:**\nAfter computing all DP values by calling `dp(0, 0, 0)`, we can reconstruct the sequence of moves. We iterate from `index = 0` to `2n-1`, and for each `(index, h_taken, m_taken)` state, we compare the maximum prize achievable by Homer taking `A[index]` versus Marge taking `A[index]`. We append 'H' or 'M' to our result path based on which choice led to the maximum value (preferring 'H' in case of a tie, as per problem requirement \"output any of them\").\n\n**Python Implementation Details:**\n* Use a dictionary `memo` for memoization: `memo = {}`.\n* Convert the input string `A` into a list of integers `A_digits` for easier access and type conversion.\n* The `pow()` function or `**` operator can be used for `10` raised to a power.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    A_digits = [int(d) for d in A_str]\n\n    memo = {}\n\n    def dp(index, h_taken, m_taken):\n        # Base case: All digits processed\n        if index == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n\n        # Check memoization table\n        state = (index, h_taken, m_taken)\n        if state in memo:\n            return memo[state]\n\n        res_h = -1  # Max prize if Homer takes current digit\n        res_m = -1  # Max prize if Marge takes current digit\n\n        # Option 1: Homer takes A[index]\n        if h_taken < n:\n            # Contribution of A[index] to Homer's score\n            # It's the (h_taken)-th digit Homer takes (0-indexed),\n            # so it's at position h_taken in his n-digit number.\n            # Its value is digit * 10^(n - 1 - h_taken)\n            val_h_contribution = A_digits[index] * (10**(n - 1 - h_taken))\n            res_h = val_h_contribution + dp(index + 1, h_taken + 1, m_taken)\n\n        # Option 2: Marge takes A[index]\n        if m_taken < n:\n            # Contribution of A[index] to Marge's score\n            # Similar logic as Homer's contribution\n            val_m_contribution = A_digits[index] * (10**(n - 1 - m_taken))\n            res_m = val_m_contribution + dp(index + 1, h_taken, m_taken + 1)\n\n        # Determine the maximum prize for the current state\n        current_max_prize = -1\n        if res_h != -1 and res_m != -1:\n            current_max_prize = max(res_h, res_m)\n        elif res_h != -1: # Only Homer can move\n            current_max_prize = res_h\n        else: # Only Marge can move (res_m must be != -1 as total moves is 2n)\n            current_max_prize = res_m\n        \n        memo[state] = current_max_prize\n        return current_max_prize\n\n    # Fill the memoization table by calling dp from the initial state\n    dp(0, 0, 0)\n\n    # Reconstruct the path\n    path = []\n    current_index = 0\n    current_h_taken = 0\n    current_m_taken = 0\n\n    while current_index < 2 * n:\n        # Calculate the prize if Homer takes A[current_index]\n        prize_if_homer_takes = -1\n        if current_h_taken < n:\n            val_h_contribution = A_digits[current_index] * (10**(n - 1 - current_h_taken))\n            # Get the pre-calculated DP value for the next state\n            prize_if_homer_takes = val_h_contribution + memo[(current_index + 1, current_h_taken + 1, current_m_taken)]\n\n        # Calculate the prize if Marge takes A[current_index]\n        prize_if_marge_takes = -1\n        if current_m_taken < n:\n            val_m_contribution = A_digits[current_index] * (10**(n - 1 - current_m_taken))\n            # Get the pre-calculated DP value for the next state\n            prize_if_marge_takes = val_m_contribution + memo[(current_index + 1, current_h_taken, current_m_taken + 1)]\n\n        # Decide who makes the move based on maximum prize\n        # Prefer Homer in case of a tie\n        if prize_if_homer_takes != -1 and (prize_if_marge_takes == -1 or prize_if_homer_takes >= prize_if_marge_takes):\n            path.append('H')\n            current_h_taken += 1\n        else: # Marge takes the digit (either Homer can't, or Marge's move is strictly better)\n            path.append('M')\n            current_m_taken += 1\n        \n        current_index += 1\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(path) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
