The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Neko Finds Grapes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Neko Finds Grapes\" problem. Let me break this down.  We've got `n` chests and `m` keys. The key to cracking this, I think, lies in understanding that whether a key opens a chest depends *only* on the parity - whether the sum of the key and chest values is odd or even.\n\nI can represent this using modular arithmetic, focusing on the remainder when divided by 2. `a_i + b_j` is odd, meaning it's congruent to 1 modulo 2.  That tells me one must be even and the other odd.  If a chest value (`a_i`) is even, the key (`b_j`) needs to be odd. And if the chest value is odd, the key needs to be even. It's a matching problem, plain and simple.\n\nNow, because each key and each chest can only be used once, the key insight is to count the even and odd chests, and the even and odd keys separately.  I'll call them `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`.  Think of it this way: to maximize the number of opened chests, I want to pair as many even chests with odd keys *and* as many odd chests with even keys as possible.\n\nLet's rephrase this: I can open `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` chests of the first type and `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` chests of the second type. That sum will be my solution. This feels right because matching an even chest with an odd key doesn't block me from matching an odd chest with an even key. It's an independent problem! The resource constraint (one key and one chest use) is distinct based on their parities.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of chests Neko can open. A key $b_j$ can open a chest $a_i$ if and only if $a_i + b_j$ is an odd number.\n\nThe condition $a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ means that one of $a_i$ and $b_j$ must be even, and the other must be odd.\nThere are two scenarios for a valid match:\n1.  The chest number $a_i$ is even, and the key number $b_j$ is odd.\n2.  The chest number $a_i$ is odd, and the key number $b_j$ is even.\n\nEach key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once. We want to maximize the total number of opened chests.\n\nLet's count the number of even and odd chests, and even and odd keys:\n*   `chests_even`: number of chests with an even number.\n*   `chests_odd`: number of chests with an odd number.\n*   `keys_even`: number of keys with an even number.\n*   `keys_odd`: number of keys with an odd number.\n\nTo form matches of type 1 (even chest with odd key), we have `chests_even` available even chests and `keys_odd` available odd keys. The maximum number of such matches we can make is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nTo form matches of type 2 (odd chest with even key), we have `chests_odd` available odd chests and `keys_even` available even keys. The maximum number of such matches we can make is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince a key of a certain parity can only open chests of the opposite parity, and similarly for chests, the two types of matches (even chest + odd key, and odd chest + even key) draw from completely separate pools of resources based on their parity. For example, an odd key used for an even chest cannot be used for an odd chest, and an even chest opened by an odd key cannot be opened by an even key. Therefore, the number of matches of type 1 does not affect the number of matches of type 2.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximum matches from these two independent scenarios:\n`total_opened_chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. Iterate through them and count `chests_even` and `chests_odd`.\n    *   `a_i % 2 == 0` means `a_i` is even.\n    *   `a_i % 2 != 0` means `a_i` is odd.\n3.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. Iterate through them and count `keys_even` and `keys_odd`.\n4.  Calculate `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n5.  Calculate `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n6.  Sum these two minimums and print the result.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n = 5, m = 4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1.  **Chests:**\n    *   `9` (odd), `14` (even), `6` (even), `2` (even), `11` (odd)\n    *   `chests_even = 3`\n    *   `chests_odd = 2`\n2.  **Keys:**\n    *   `8` (even), `4` (even), `7` (odd), `20` (even)\n    *   `keys_even = 3`\n    *   `keys_odd = 1`\n3.  **Matches:**\n    *   Even chests with odd keys: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n    *   Odd chests with even keys: `min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n4.  **Total:** `1 + 2 = 3`\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Maximize matches:\n    # 1.
