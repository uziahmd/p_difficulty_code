She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Browser\" Problem - My Python Script Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem, and here's my thought process.  I need a Python script to efficiently determine the minimum time to close tabs. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the parameters: the total tabs (`n`), the starting cursor position (`pos`), and the target range of open tabs `[l, r]`. The core challenge lies in the allowable actions: moving the cursor left or right, and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.  `a` and `b` track the unclosed tabs range, initially `[1, n]`.\n\nI immediately recognize the edge case: if the target range *is* the entire set of tabs (l=1 and r=n), then the answer is 0.\n\nFor the general case, the strategy clicks. I need to close the tabs *outside* the target range: `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.  To efficiently close `[1, l-1]`, I have to move the cursor to position `l` and then perform the \"close left\" operation, because that action updates `a`.  Similarly, closing `[r+1, n]` necessitates moving the cursor to `r` and using the \"close right\" operation, and updating `b`.\n\nThe key is realizing that the problem essentially boils down to two \"close\" operations, preceded by cursor movements.  Therefore, I'll calculate the time as: time to move to the 'l' position (if needed) + 1 second to close left + time to move from the current position (either 'l' or the initial 'pos') to 'r' + 1 second to close right. This simplifies the updating of the `a` and `b` values.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. Each operation (moving cursor or closing tabs) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the edge cases first:\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed:** If `l=1` and `r=n`, all tabs are within the desired range. No operations are needed. The time is 0.\n\nNow, consider the cases where tabs need to be closed. We essentially need to perform two \"close\" operations:\n*   Close tabs to the left of `l` (i.e., `[1, l-1]`). This operation must be done when the cursor is at tab `l` (or any tab `i > l-1` if `a=1`). The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `l` and then close.\n*   Close tabs to the right of `r` (i.e., `[r+1, n]`). This operation must be done when the cursor is at tab `r` (or any tab `i < r+1` if `b=n`). The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `r` and then close.\n\nLet `ans` be the total time.\n\n**Case 1: Only tabs to the left need to be closed (`l > 1`, `r = n`)**\nWe need to close `[1, l-1]`.\n1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. This takes 1 second.\nTotal time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**Case 2: Only tabs to the right need to be closed (`l = 1`, `r < n`)**\nWe need to close `[r+1, n]`.\n1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. This takes 1 second.\nTotal time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Case 3: Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l > 1`, `r < n`)**\nWe need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two \"close\" operations, each taking 1 second.\nThe total time will be `(movement time) + 2`.\n\nTo minimize movement time, we should consider the order of closing:\n*   **Option A: Close left first, then right.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Time: `abs(pos - l)`.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Time: `1`.\n    3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Time: `abs(l - r)`.\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Time: `1`.\n    Total time for Option A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1`.\n*   **Option B: Close right first, then left.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Time: `abs(pos - r)`.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Time: `1`.\n    3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Time: `abs(r - l)`.\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Time: `1`.\n    Total time for Option B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1`.\n\nThe minimum time for Case 3 is `min(Option A total time, Option B total time)`.\nNotice that `abs(l - r)` is the same as `abs(r - l)`. Let's call this `dist_lr = r - l`.\nSo, the total time is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + dist_lr + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these observations:\n\n1.  **Check if `l=1` and `r=n`:**\n    If `l == 1` and `r == n`:\n        `ans = 0`\n2.  **Check if only left side needs closing (`r=n` but `l > 1`):**\n    Else if `r == n`:\n        `ans = abs(pos - l) + 1`\n3.  **Check if only right side needs closing (`l=1` but `r < n`):**\n    Else if `l == 1`:\n        `ans = abs(pos - r) + 1`\n4.  **Both sides need closing (`l > 1` and `r < n`):**\n    Else (`l > 1` and `r < n`):\n        If `pos` is to the left of `l` (`pos < l`):\n            We must move right to `l` to close left tabs. Then continue to `r` to close right tabs.\n            `ans = (l - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n        If `pos` is to the right of `r` (`pos > r`):\n            We must move left to `r` to close right tabs. Then continue to `l` to close left tabs.\n            `ans = (pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n        If `pos` is between `l` and `r` inclusive (`l <= pos <= r`):\n            We can choose to go to `l` first, then to `r`, or go to `r` first, then to `l`.\n            To `l` first: `(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n            To `r` first: `(r - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n            `ans = min(pos - l, r - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\nLet's simplify the `l <= pos <= r` case. The movement from `pos` to one end (`l` or `r`) and then to the other end (`r` or `l`) will always cover the full range `[l, r]`. So, the total distance traveled within `[l, r]` will be `(r - l) + min(pos - l, r - pos)`.\nThe total movement cost is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l)`.\nSo, for `l > 1` and `r < n`: `ans = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThis consolidated logic covers all cases:\n*   If `l == 1` and `r == n`: `0`\n*   If `l == 1` (only right needs closing): `abs(pos - r) + 1`\n*   If `r == n` (only left needs closing): `abs(pos - l) + 1`\n*   If `l > 1` and `r < n` (both sides need closing): `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are within the desired range [l, r].
