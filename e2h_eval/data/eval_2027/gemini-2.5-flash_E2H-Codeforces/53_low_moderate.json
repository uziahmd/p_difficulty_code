Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Longest Repeating Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the longest substring that repeats at least twice within a given string.  It's a classic string manipulation task. The string only contains lowercase letters and is fairly short, a maximum of 100 characters.\n\nMy initial approach is a brute-force one, which I think will be perfectly acceptable given the constraints. I'll need to generate all possible substrings. Let's start with breaking this down into steps. I need to iterate through every possible substring and count its occurrences. If the substring appears at least twice, I'll update the maximum length I've seen so far.\n\nNow, let's think about how to define these substrings mathematically.  A substring is determined by its starting position, `i`, and its length, `L`. For a string `S` of length `N`, `i` can range from 0 to `N-1`, and the length `L` from 1 up to `N-i`.  So, the substring in question will be `S[i:i+L]`.\n\nCounting occurrences is the next challenge. For a substring `sub = S[i:i+L]`, I need to check if it appears elsewhere in `S`. The overlap is perfectly fine. I can iterate through all possible starting positions, `j` (where `j` doesn't necessarily have to be different from `i`), and see if `S[j:j+L]` equals `sub`.  If it does, I increment a counter. If the counter reaches 2 or more, I've found a valid substring.\n\nI'm confident a nested loop will do the trick.  Since the string length is capped at 100, the brute force approach shouldn't be too slow. Let's see... I'll have an outer loop for the substring length `L` (from 1 to N-1), a second nested loop for the starting index `i` of the substring, and a third nested loop to find matches using a starting index `j`.\n\nThinking about the code structure, I would start with `max_len = 0`.  Then, I'd have the loops to construct and check. My outermost loop would iterate the possible lengths of the substrings, starting from 1 up to N-1.  The next loop covers the starting position of substrings of each current length.  Finally, the innermost loop checks for the repetitions of each substring using starting position `j`. As soon as I find a substring with a count of at least two occurrences, I'll update `max_len`.\n\nLet's quickly analyze the complexity. The outermost loop iterates `N` times (for the length of the substring). The second loop also iterates `N` times (the starting index of the substring), and the innermost loop also iterates `N` times (for finding repetitions). So that gives me `N * N * N`.  However, inside the innermost loop, when I'm comparing the substring slices of length `L`, that operation takes `O(L)` time. Thus, the overall complexity would be roughly `O(N * N * N * L) = O(N^4)` since the substring length, `L`, in the worst case can be N.\n\nThis should be a workable solution, and I'll go ahead and build it out. It's clean and should meet the requirements. It might even be worth considering if there is a more efficient solution given the length contraints, but for now, this will get the job done.\n",
