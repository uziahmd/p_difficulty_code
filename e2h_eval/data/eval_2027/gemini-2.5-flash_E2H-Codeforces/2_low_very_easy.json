Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through an \"X\" Pattern Checker**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to validate an \"X\" pattern within an *n x n* character grid. The rules are pretty straightforward: the diagonals must all share the same character, and the remaining cells must all share a different character. The size *n* will always be an odd number.\n\nFirst, I'll need to read in the grid's dimensions, *n*, and then read in the grid itself, probably as a list of strings or a list of lists of characters. I'll need to figure out which cells are on the main diagonals (where the row and column indices are equal) and the anti-diagonal (where the sum of the row and column indices equals *n* - 1).\n\nI'll start by taking the character from `grid[0][0]` as the `diag_char`, and initializing another character variable, `other_char`, to something like `None`.  I'll then iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either diagonal, I need to verify that its character matches `diag_char`. If a cell is *not* on a diagonal, I'll check: if it's the first non-diagonal cell I've encountered, I'll set its character to `other_char`. Otherwise, I'll make sure the current non-diagonal character matches `other_char`.\n\nIf, at any point, a character check fails (either a diagonal doesn't match `diag_char` or a non-diagonal doesn't match `other_char`), I can immediately print \"NO\" and exit.\n\nAfter iterating through the whole grid, I have to ensure `diag_char` and `other_char` are actually different characters. If they're the same, it's not a valid \"X\", so \"NO\" is printed. Otherwise, if all checks pass, I'll confidently output \"YES.\"\n\nThe constraint that *n* is between 3 and 299 shouldn't be a problem computationally, even with nested loops. That's at most approximately 90,000 operations, which is easily manageable.\n\nLooking at the example with *n* = 3, it should become clear how the character checking would proceed. I have to think carefully about edge cases, to make sure this is a rigorous validation process.\n",
