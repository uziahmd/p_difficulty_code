    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts:** I'm tackling a problem about \"good\" edge-weighted trees, which seems to require a deep dive into tree properties and clever combinatorial counting. The goal is to find the sum of path lengths between vertices 1 and *n* (d(1, n)) across all good trees, modulo a large prime.\n\n**Breaking it Down:** A \"good\" tree is an edge-weighted tree with *n* vertices where edge weights are restricted to 1 or -1 and, for each vertex, the product of weights of its incident edges is -1. The total number of trees can be formed by considering all possible tree structures. But the number of trees is huge, so we need a clever counting method or a useful observation.\n\n**Key Observation:** The good tree condition has a critical implication: *n* must be even. This is because, when we take the product of the good condition over all vertices and simplify, we find that the condition implies 1=(-1)<sup>n</sup>.\n\n**The Strategy:** My first step will be to test *n* being odd or even. If *n* is odd, the answer is immediately 0, since no good trees exist. Otherwise, when *n* is even, I'll need to somehow count the good trees and the value of *d(1,n)* for each. For each tree structure, the good weight assignment is *unique*.\n\n**The Challenge:** The core challenge now is computing the sum of path lengths *d(1,n)* over all these good trees. I'm considering fixing an edge, and working out how many trees include this edge, and how this affects the path between 1 and *n*. The standard Cayley's formula is coming to mind but I can't quite see how it helps. Maybe a generating function approach, or a clever edge-based sum will be needed. The trick is to find an efficient way to sum over all trees and calculate *d(1,n)* without brute-force enumeration.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of $d(1, n)$ over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo $998244353$.\nA tree is \"good\" if:\n1.  It has $n$ vertices, numbered $1$ to $n$.\n2.  Each edge weight is either $1$ or $-1$.\n3.  For each vertex $i$, the product of the weights of all edges incident to $i$ is $-1$.\n\nLet $w_e$ be the weight of an edge $e$. The third condition can be written as $\\prod_{e \\text{ incident to } i} w_e = -1$ for each vertex $i$.\n\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n$\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\prod_{e \\text{ incident to } i} w_e \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (-1) = (-1)^n$.\nOn the left side, each edge $e=(u,v)$ is incident to exactly two vertices ($u$ and $v$), so its weight $w_e$ appears twice in the product. Thus, the left side is $\\prod_{e \\in E} w_e^2$.\nSince $w_e \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, $w_e^2 = 1$ for any edge $e$. So, $\\prod_{e \\in E} w_e^2 = 1$.\nEquating the two sides, we get $1 = (-1)^n$. This condition implies that $n$ must be an even number.\nIf $n$ is odd, there are no good trees, and thus the sum of $d(1, n)$ over all good trees is $0$.\n\nNow, assume $n$ is even.\nLet's determine how many ways there are to assign weights to a fixed tree structure $T$ to make it good.\nLet $x_e = 0$ if $w_e = 1$ and $x_e = 1$ if $w_e = -1$. Then $w_e = (-1)^{x_e}$.\nThe condition $\\prod_{e \\text{ incident to } i} w_e = -1$ becomes $\\sum_{e \\text{ incident to } i} x_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ with $n-1$ variables (one for each edge).\nThe sum of all $n$ equations is $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{e \\text{ incident to } i} x_e \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThe left side is $\\sum_{e \\in E} 2x_e \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. The right side is $n \\pmod 2$.\nSo, $0 \\equiv n \\pmod 2$. Since $n$ is even, this holds. This means the $n$ equations are linearly dependent. Specifically, the sum of all rows of the incidence matrix is the zero vector.\nFor a tree, the rank of its incidence matrix (over $\\mathbb{F}_2$) is $n-1$. Since there are $n-1$ variables ($x_e$), and $n-1$ independent equations, there is a unique solution for $(x_e)_{e \\in E}$.\nTherefore, for any fixed tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign weights to its edges such that it is a good tree.\nThe total number of good trees is $n^{n-2}$ (number of tree structures) $\\times 1$ (unique weight assignment for each structure).\n\nWe need to calculate $S = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d(1, n, T)$, where $d(1, n, T)$ is the sum of edge weights on the path from $1$ to $n$ in tree $T$.\nLet $w_e^*(T)$ be the unique good weight for edge $e$ in tree $T$.\n$S = \\sum_{T} \\sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_e^*(T)$.\nWe can swap the summation order: $S = \\sum_{e=(u,v)} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_e^*(T)$.\nThe sum is over all possible edges $(u,v)$ between any two distinct vertices $u,v \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nFor a fixed edge $(u,v)$, how many trees $T$ contain $(u,v)$ and have it on the path $P_{1,n}(T)$?\nIf $(u,v)$ is on $P_{1,n}(T)$, then removing $(u,v)$ splits $T$ into two components, one containing $1$ and $u$, the other containing $n$ and $v$ (or vice versa).\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices where a specific edge $(u,v)$ is on the path between $1$ and $n$ is $n^{n-3}$ for any $u \\ne v$. This is a known result (or can be derived using Prüfer sequences).\nThis formula holds even if $u$ or $v$ is $1$ or $n$. For example, if $u=1, v=n$, there are $n^{n-3}$ trees where edge $(1,n)$ is present (and thus on the path $P_{1,n}$). If $n=2$, $2^{2-3} = 2^{-1}$ which is not an integer. This formula is for $n \\ge 3$.\nFor $n=2$, there is only one tree: $1-2$. The edge is $(1,2)$. It's on path $P_{1,2}$. $2^{2-3}$ is not applicable.\nLet's handle $n=2$ separately. $n=2$ is even. The only tree is $1-2$. The condition for vertex 1 is $w(1,2)=-1$. Condition for vertex 2 is $w(1,2)=-1$. Unique good tree has $w(1,2)=-1$. $d(1,2)=-1$. So for $n=2$, answer is $-1 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nFor $n \\ge 3$:\nFor each edge $(u,v)$, there are $n^{n-3}$ trees where $(u,v)$ is on the path $P_{1,n}(T)$.\nLet $N_{u,v} = n^{n-3}$ be this count.\nSo the sum $S = \\sum_{u \\ne v} N_{u,v} \\cdot w_{(u,v)}^*(T_{u,v})$, where $T_{u,v}$ represents any tree where $(u,v)$ is on $P_{1,n}$, and $w_{(u,v)}^*(T_{u,v})$ is its unique good weight.\nHowever, $w_e^*(T)$ depends on the entire tree $T$, not just the edge $e$. So we cannot simply multiply $N_{u,v}$ by some $w_e$.\nInstead, we need to find a way to determine $w_e^*(T)$ for a specific edge $e=(u,v)$ in a specific tree $T$.\n\nLet's consider the $\\mathbb{F}_2$ system: $\\sum_{e \\text{ incident to } i} x_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nLet $e_0=(u,v)$ be an arbitrary edge. We want to find $x_{e_0}$.\nRoot the tree at an arbitrary vertex, say $1$.\nFor any vertex $i \\ne 1$, let $p_i$ be its parent. The edge $(i, p_i)$ is the unique edge connecting $i$ to its parent.\nThe condition for vertex $i \\ne 1$ is $x_{(i,p_i)} + \\sum_{j \\text{ child of } i} x_{(i,j)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nSumming this over all $i \\in V \\setminus \\{1\\}$ gives:\n$\\sum_{i \\ne 1} x_{(i,p_i)} + \\sum_{i \\ne 1} \\sum_{j \\text{ child of } i} x_{(i,j)} \\equiv \\sum_{i \\ne 1} 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThe left side is $\\sum_{e \\ne e_r} x_e$, where $e_r$ is the edge incident to root $1$.\nSo $\\sum_{e \\ne e_r} x_e \\equiv n-1 \\pmod 2$.\nSince $n$ is even, $n-1$ is odd. So $\\sum_{e \\ne e_r} x_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nAlso, the condition for vertex $1$ is $\\sum_{j \\text{ child of } 1} x_{(1,j)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nLet $e=(u,v)$ be any edge. If we cut $e$, the tree splits into two components, $C_u$ (containing $u$) and $C_v$ (containing $v$).\nThe sum of conditions for all vertices in $C_u$ (excluding $v$ if $v \\in C_u$):\n$\\sum_{i \\in C_u} \\sum_{e' \\text{ incident to } i} x_{e'} \\equiv |C_u| \\pmod 2$.\nEach edge within $C_u$ appears twice. The edge $e=(u,v)$ appears once.\nSo $x_e + \\sum_{e' \\in E(C_u)} 2x_{e'} \\equiv |C_u| \\pmod 2$.\nThis implies $x_e \\equiv |C_u| \\pmod 2$.\nSimilarly, $x_e \\equiv |C_v| \\pmod 2$.\nSince $|C_u| + |C_v| = n$ and $n$ is even, $|C_u|$ and $|C_v|$ must have the same parity.\nSo $x_e \\equiv |C_u| \\pmod 2$ gives the unique weight $w_e = (-1)^{|C_u|}$.\nThis means $w_e = -1$ if the component containing $u$ (when $e$ is removed) has an odd number of vertices, and $w_e = 1$ if it has an even number of vertices.\n\nWe need to calculate $\\sum_{T} \\sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} (-1)^{|C_u(e,T)|}$, where $C_u(e,T)$ is the component containing $u$ when $e=(u,v)$ is removed from $T$.\nLet's consider an edge $e=(u,v)$ on the path $P_{1,n}(T)$. Removing $e$ splits $T$ into two components. One component, say $T_1$, contains $1$ and $u$. The other, $T_n$, contains $n$ and $v$.\nThe weight of $e$ is $w_e = (-1)^{|T_1|}$.\nThe sum becomes $\\sum_T \\sum_{e \\in P_{1,n}(T)} (-1)^{|T_1(e,T)|}$.\nBy symmetry, we can assume $u$ is closer to $1$ than $v$. Then $T_1$ is the component containing $u$ (and $1$).\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices where $e=(u,v)$ is on $P_{1,n}$ and $T_1$ (component containing $u$ and $1$) has size $k$ is given by a formula involving $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nSpecifically, the number of trees on $n$ vertices where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and $n$ is in a component of size $n-k$ after removing edge $(u,v)$ is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is for specific $u,v$. Summing over all $u,v$ for fixed $k$:\nThere are $n(n-1)$ choices for $u,v$.\nThe number of trees where $e=(u,v)$ is on $P_{1,n}$ and the component containing $1$ has size $k$ is $k(n-k)n^{n-4}$. This is a known result.\nThis formula works for $n \\ge 3$.\nSo, for a fixed $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, the number of trees where an edge $e$ on $P_{1,n}$ separates $1$ into a component of size $k$ is $k(n-k)n^{n-4}$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\cdot k(n-k)n^{n-4}$.\nThe sum is $n^{n-4} \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k k(n-k)$.\nLet $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k k(n-k)$.\n$S_n = n \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k k - \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k k^2$.\nLet $A_m = \\sum_{k=1}^m (-1)^k k$ and $B_m = \\sum_{k=1}^m (-1)^k k^2$.\n$A_m = (-1)^m \\lceil m/2 \\rceil$.\n$B_m = (-1)^m \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\nFor $m=n-1$:\nSince $n$ is even, $n-1$ is odd.\n$A_{n-1} = (-1)^{n-1} \\lceil (n-1)/2 \\rceil = - (n/2)$.\n$B_{n-1} = (-1)^{n-1} \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} = - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nSo, $S_n = n \\cdot (-n/2) - (-n(n-1)/2) = -n^2/2 + n(n-1)/2 = (-n^2 + n^2 - n)/2 = -n/2$.\nThe total sum is $n^{n-4} \\cdot (-n/2) = -n^{n-3}/2$.\nThis formula is valid for $n \\ge 3$.\nSince we need to compute modulo $998244353$, we need to calculate $n^{n-3} \\cdot (-1/2) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$-1/2 \\equiv -1 \\cdot 2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$2^{-1} \\equiv (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nSo $-1/2 \\equiv -499122177 \\equiv 499122176 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nFinal formula for $n \\ge 3$ and $n$ even:\nAnswer is $(n^{n-3} \\cdot 499122176) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's check the examples:\n$n=1$: odd. Output: 0. Correct.\n$n=2$: even. Output: $998244352 \\equiv -1$. Correct.\n$n=4$: even. $n \\ge 3$.\nAnswer should be $(4^{4-3} \\cdot 499122176) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$4^1 \\cdot 499122176 = 4 \\cdot 499122176 = 1996488704$.\n$1996488704 \\pmod{998244353} = 1996488704 - 2 \\cdot 998244353 = 1996488704 - 1996488706 = -2$.\nThe example output for $n=4$ is $998244343 \\equiv -10$. My formula gives $-2$. There is a mismatch.\n\nLet's re-examine the $k(n-k)n^{n-4}$ part.\nThis is the number of trees where a specific edge $(u,v)$ is on the path $P_{1,n}$, and $u$ is in the component of size $k$ containing $1$, and $v$ is in the component of size $n-k$ containing $n$.\nThe sum is over *all* edges $(u,v)$.\nThe factor $k(n-k)$ comes from choosing $u$ from the $k$ vertices in $C_1$ and $v$ from the $n-k$ vertices in $C_n$.\nThis means the sum $S_n$ already accounts for specific $u,v$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{u \\ne v} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. } e=(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_e^*(T)$.\nThis is $\\sum_{u \\ne v} \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\mathbb{I}(\\text{edge } (u,v) \\text{ is on } P_{1,n} \\text{ and } |C_u|=k) \\cdot (-1)^k$.\nThe number of trees where edge $(u,v)$ is on $P_{1,n}$ and $C_u$ has size $k$ is $n^{n-4} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$ if $u,v \\notin \\{1,n\\}$.\nThis seems to be the source of my error.\n\nLet's use a different approach. The total sum is $S = \\sum_T \\sum_{e=(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_e^*(T)$.\nLet $P_n = 998244353$.\nThe number of good trees is $n^{n-2}$ for $n$ even.\nFor each vertex $i$, the product of incident edge weights is $-1$.\nConsider the path $P_{1,n} = (1=v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_L=n)$.\n$d(1,n) = \\sum_{j=0}^{L-1} w(v_j, v_{j+1})$.\nThis problem is a variant of a known result from a contest (e.g., Codeforces 1709D \"Sum of Path Weights\").\nThe sum of $d(u,v)$ over all trees is $0$ if $u=v$.\nFor $u \\ne v$, the sum of $d(u,v)$ over all trees on $n$ vertices with edge weights $1$ is $n^{n-2} \\cdot \\text{avg path length}$.\nHere we have specific weights.\n\nA common technique for path sums is to use generating functions or matrix tree theorem variants.\nLet $A_{ij}$ be the adjacency matrix of a tree, with $A_{ij}=w(i,j)$ if $(i,j)$ is an edge, and $0$ otherwise.\nThen $d(u,v)$ is the $(u,v)$ entry of $A+A^2+\\dots+A^k$ where $k$ is path length. This is complex.\n\nWhat if we consider the effect of operations on the weights?\nLet $x_e \\in \\{0,1\\}$ such that $w_e = (-1)^{x_e}$.\nThe condition is $\\sum_{e \\text{ incident to } i} x_e \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nWe found that $x_e \\equiv |C_u| \\pmod 2$ where $C_u$ is the component containing $u$ when $e=(u,v)$ is removed.\nLet's consider the number of vertices $k$ in the component containing vertex $1$ when an edge $e=(u,v)$ on the path $P_{1,n}$ is removed.\nThe weight of $e$ is $(-1)^k$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\cdot (\\text{number of trees where } P_{1,n} \\text{ has an edge that splits } 1 \\text{ into a component of size } k)$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices where vertex $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and vertex $n$ is in a component of size $n-k$ (after removing some edge on the path $P_{1,n}$) is given by $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1}$.\nThis is a standard result for counting trees with specific properties.\nSo the sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis looks like a more promising formula.\nLet $N_k = \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k N_k$.\nThis sum is a known identity related to tree enumeration.\nFor $n \\ge 3$, this sum evaluates to $-(n-2)n^{n-4}$.\nLet's check this identity for $n=4$:\n$\\sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^k \\binom{2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (4-k)^{4-k-1}$\n$k=1: (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{0} 1^0 3^2 = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 = -9$.\n$k=2: (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{1} 2^1 2^1 = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\n$k=3: (-1)^3 \\binom{2}{2} 3^2 1^0 = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 = -9$.\nSum $= -9+8-9 = -10$.\nUsing the formula $-(n-2)n^{n-4}$: $-(4-2)4^{4-4} = -2 \\cdot 4^0 = -2 \\cdot 1 = -2$.\nThere is a factor of $n^{n-3}$ vs $n^{n-4}$ difference.\nThe identity for $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$ is $(n-2)n^{n-3}$.\nWith the $(-1)^k$ factor, the identity is $-(n-2)n^{n-4}$ only if the $k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$ terms are for rooted trees.\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices where $1$ and $n$ are in different components after removing an edge $(u,v)$ is $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1}$.\nThis is the number of trees where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and $n$ is in a component of size $n-k$.\nThe sum is over all $k$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nFor $n=4$, this sum is $-10$. This matches the example output for $n=4$.\nSo the answer for $n \\ge 3$ and $n$ even is this sum.\n\nCalculation of $N_k = \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to precompute factorials and inverse factorials for combinations.\nWe also need modular exponentiation for $k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.
