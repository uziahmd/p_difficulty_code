The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solution to Neko Finds Grapes Problem**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this problem.  We've got chests and keys.  A key opens a chest if their sum is odd, meaning they have different parities (one even, one odd).  The goal is to maximize the *number* of opened chests, given that keys and chests are unique and can only be used once.\n\nMy strategy is to look at this as a matching problem. I need to figure out the largest possible pairs of (chest, key) that satisfy the parity condition.  I'm going to count the even and odd chests and keys.\n\nLet's call even chests `chests_even`, odd chests `chests_odd`, even keys `keys_even`, and odd keys `keys_odd`. Now, the pairings are: an even chest *needs* an odd key, and an odd chest needs an even key. We want to maximize these pairings, so the number of opened chests will be the total of valid pairs of the two types.\n\nThe maximum number of matches of the first type is limited by the minimum of the even chests and odd keys available ( `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`). The same for the second, the minimum of the odd chests and even keys ( `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`).\n\nSince these pairings are *independent* (even chests are only matched with odd keys, and vice versa), the total maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of these two minimums: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. I'm confident in this approach.\n\nThis O(N+M) solution should work fine based on constraints in the problem. The input/output reading and modulo operation will be in the Python implementation, and I'll test it against a few test cases to make sure it functions properly, including edge cases. Finally, I'll submit it once the algorithm is implemented in Python, and the code should be free of any unecessary comments, given that it's a competitive programming setting.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. This condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` implies that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities. That is, one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\nWe can categorize chests and keys by their parity:\n1.  **Even chests:** Chests with an even number `a_i`.\n2.  **Odd chests:** Chests with an odd number `a_i`.\n3.  **Even keys:** Keys with an even number `b_j`.\n4.  **Odd keys:** Keys with an odd number `b_j`.\n\nFor a chest and a key to form a valid pair (sum is odd), there are two possibilities:\n*   An **even chest** must be paired with an **odd key**.\n*   An **odd chest** must be paired with an **even key**.\n\nSince one key can be used for at most one chest and one chest can be opened at most once, we want to maximize the number of such valid pairs. These two types of pairings (even chest + odd key, and odd chest + even key) are completely independent in terms of the resources they consume. An even chest cannot be opened by an even key, and an odd chest cannot be opened by an odd key. Similarly, an odd key cannot open an odd chest, and an even key cannot open an even chest.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the maximum number of pairings for each type independently and sum them up:\n\n1.  **Maximum pairings of (even chest, odd key):** This is limited by the number of available even chests and the number of available odd keys. So, `min(count_of_even_chests, count_of_odd_keys)`.\n2.  **Maximum pairings of (odd chest, even key):** This is limited by the number of available odd chests and the number of available even keys. So, `min(count_of_odd_chests, count_of_even_keys)`.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of these two values.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Read the list of chest numbers `a`.\n3.  Read the list of key numbers `b`.\n4.  Initialize `chests_even = 0` and `chests_odd = 0`. Iterate through `a` to count even and odd chests.\n5.  Initialize `keys_even = 0` and `keys_odd = 0`. Iterate through `b` to count even and odd keys.\n6.  Calculate `matches = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7.  Print `matches`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(N + M) for reading input and counting parities, which is efficient enough for the given constraints (`N, M <= 10^5`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m from the first line\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the chest numbers\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Read the key numbers\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Count even and odd chests\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    # Count even and odd keys\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of pairings\n    # 1.
