He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Let's break down this competitive programming problem.** My goal is to write a Python script that finds the number of positive integers `n` whose factorial (`n!`) ends with exactly `m` zeroes, and then list those `n`'s in increasing order.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` hinges on how many times 10 appears as a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 is 2 * 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the key is counting the factors of 5. I'll use Legendre's formula to do this efficiently. The function `Z(n)` will represent the count of trailing zeroes, calculated as the sum of `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` as long as the powers of 5 are less than or equal to `n`.\n\nNow, the trick is to understand `Z(n)`'s behavior. It's non-decreasing; it either stays the same or goes up as `n` increases. Crucially, it only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. This means `Z(n)` skips some integer values. For instance, there's no `n` where `Z(n)` equals 5, because `Z(24) = 4` and `Z(25) = 6`.\n\nI'll leverage this property. My strategy: find the smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= m` using binary search. Since `Z(n)` is roughly `n/4`, I can estimate an upper bound for the binary search. The binary search will give me a candidate (`n_min`). If `Z(n_min)` is *exactly* `m`, then I have my starting point, and I know that the next four consecutive integers (`n_min+1`, `n_min+2`, `n_min+3`, `n_min+4`) will also satisfy `Z(n)=m` (unless a multiple of 5 pops up). But if `Z(n_min)` is greater than `m`, then I know `m` is an unreachable \"skipped\" value.\n\nMy `count_trailing_zeroes` function will compute `Z(n)`. I'll use binary search with a range from 1 up to approximately `5*m` (a safe upper bound).\n\nIn the `solve()` function, I'll take input `m`, run binary search to find `n_min`, check if `Z(n_min)` is equal to `m`, and print the result based on the conditions. The output will be the count of solutions (either 0 or 5), followed by the list of `n`s in increasing order. I've designed the code to be efficient, taking into account the constraints of the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then list them in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 × 5, we count the number of pairs of (2, 5) factors. In any `n!`, the number of factors of 2 will always be greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes is simply the total count of factors of 5 in `n!`.\n\nLegendre's formula provides an efficient way to calculate this:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as `5^k <= n`.\n\n**Properties of Z(n)**\n\nLet `Z(n)` denote the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.\n1. `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2. `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n3. If `n` is not a multiple of 5, then `Z(n) = Z(n-1)`.\n4. If `n` is a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` increases. For example, `Z(4)=0`, `Z(5)=1`. `Z(9)=1`, `Z(10)=2`. `Z(24)=4`, `Z(25)=6`.\n   Notice that `Z(n)` does not take on all integer values. For instance, there is no `n` such that `Z(n)=5`.\n5. Due to the nature of `Z(n)` only increasing at multiples of 5, if `Z(n_0) = m` for some `n_0`, then `Z(n_0+1), Z(n_0+2), Z(n_0+3), Z(n_0+4)` will also be equal to `m` (unless `n_0` itself is a multiple of 5, which would mean `n_0+1` to `n_0+4` are not multiples of 5). The next value `Z(n_0+5)` will be greater than `m`. This means that if `m` is a value `Z(n)` can take, there will always be exactly 5 consecutive integers `n` for which `Z(n) = m`.\n\n**Solution Strategy**\n\n1.  **`count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function:** Implement Legendre's formula to calculate `Z(n)`. This function will be called repeatedly.\n    For `n` up to `5 * 10^5` (the approximate maximum value for `n` when `m=10^5`), this function will involve summing at most `log_5(5 * 10^5) ≈ 9` terms, making it very fast.\n\n2.  **Binary Search for `n_min`:** Since `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to find the smallest positive integer `n_min` such that `Z(n_min) >= m`.\n    *   The search range for `n` can be set from `1` to `5 * m + 5`. A rough estimate `Z(n) ≈ n/4` suggests `n ≈ 4m`. `5m+5` is a safe upper bound. For `m=100000`, `n` will be around `400000` to `500000`.\n    *   The binary search will find the smallest `n_min` that satisfies `Z(n_min) >= m`.\n\n3.  **Check and Output Results:**\n    *   After finding `n_min`, calculate `current_zeroes = Z(n_min)`.\n    *   If `current_zeroes == m`: This means `m` is a valid number of trailing zeroes. As discussed, there will be exactly 5 such integers. These are `n_min, n_min+1, n_min+2, n_min+3, n_min+4`. Print `5` and then these 5 integers.\n    *   If `current_zeroes > m`: This means `m` is a \"skipped\" value (e.g., `Z(24)=4`, `Z(25)=6`, so `m=5` is skipped). In this case, there are no integers `n` for which `Z(n) = m`. Print `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=1)**\n\n1.  `count_trailing_zeroes(n)`:\n    *   `Z(4) = 0`\n    *   `Z(5) = 1`\n    *   `Z(9) = 1`\n    *   `Z(10) = 2`\n\n2.  Binary search for smallest `n_min` such that `Z(n_min) >= 1`:\n    *   Search range `[1, 5*1+5] = [1, 10]`.\n    *   `mid = 5`. `Z(5) = 1`. Since `1 >= 1`, `n_min = 5`, search `[1, 4]`.\n    *   `mid = 2`. `Z(2) = 0`. Since `0 < 1`, search `[3, 4]`.\n    *   `mid = 3`. `Z(3) = 0`. Since `0 < 1`, search `[4, 4]`.\n    *   `mid = 4`. `Z(4) = 0`. Since `0 < 1`, search `[5, 4]`. Loop terminates.\n    *   `n_min = 5`.\n\n3.  Check `Z(n_min)`:\n    *   `Z(5) = 1`. This is equal to `m`.\n    *   The solutions are `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.\n    *   Output: `5\\n5 6 7 8 9`.\n\n**Time Complexity**\n\n*   The `count_trailing_zeroes` function runs in `O(log_5 n)` time.\n*   The binary search performs `O(log(5m))` iterations.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(log(5m) * log_5(5m))`. Given `m <= 10^5`, `5m` is at most `5 * 10^5`. `log_2(5 * 10^5)` is about 19. `log_5(5 * 10^5)` is about 8. The total operations are roughly `19 * 8`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Function to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in n!\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    power_of_5 = 5\n    while n >= power_of_5:\n        count += n // power_of_5\n        power_of_5 *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n_min such that count_trailing_zeroes(n_min) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n.
