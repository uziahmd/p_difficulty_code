He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Prefixes and Suffixes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem and my first thought is, this seems solvable with a bit of clever observation. The core of it, from what I gather, is that we're given a bunch of strings – `2n-2` of them to be exact – which represent the *improper* prefixes and suffixes of a hidden string, `s`, of length `n`. My goal is to figure out whether each of those input strings is a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') of this unknown string.\n\nThe input structure is pretty straightforward: we get `n`, the length of `s`, followed by the `2n-2` strings. I know that each length from `1` up to `n-1` has exactly one prefix and one suffix represented. This is key, and it gives me a good starting point.\n\nNow, the crucial insight. Consider the *longest* improper prefixes and suffixes, those of length `n-1`. Let's say these are `P_n-1` and `S_n-1`. Since we are guaranteed to have them in the input, let's call the two input strings of length `n-1` `str1` and `str2`. One of them *has* to be `P_n-1` and the other `S_n-1`.\n\nThis gives me two potential scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:** `str1` is the prefix (`P_n-1`) and `str2` is the suffix (`S_n-1`). In this case, `s` would have to be constructed by combining these two strings somehow, such that the overlapping section is the middle of the string. So, if `str1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `str2` is `s[1:n]`, I can form a candidate string `s` from those. The crucial part here is the overlapping part. `s` would be `str1 + str2[-1]`, *if and only if* `str1[1:]` is equal to `str2[:-1]`. If this condition holds, I have my first candidate, `s_candidate1`.\n\n**Scenario 2:**  `str2` is the prefix (`P_n-1`) and `str1` is the suffix (`S_n-1`). Applying the same reasoning as above, the check remains the same. If `str2[1:]` is equal to `str1[:-1]`, I can construct `s` as `str2 + str1[-1]` and have another candidate, `s_candidate2`.\n\nThis is my core logic. Once I can deduce the composition of the complete string `s`, everything falls into place. Once I determine the candidate string `s` from any of the scenarios. I know I have to check the rest of the strings. If one of the scenarios matches, that would be my solution, and I can then go through all the original strings, labeling them with 'P' or 'S' depending on whether they are prefixes or suffixes of my candidate `s`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify `2n-2` given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings: one is the prefix of length `k` and the other is the suffix of length `k`. We need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's corresponding to the input order. Any valid classification is acceptable.\n\nThe key insight lies in the two strings of length `n-1`. These must be the prefix of length `n-1` (let's call it `P_{n-1}`) and the suffix of length `n-1` (let's call it `S_{n-1}`).\n\nLet the unknown string be `s = c_0 c_1 ... c_{n-1}`.\nThen `P_{n-1} = c_0 c_1 ... c_{n-2}`.\nAnd `S_{n-1} = c_1 c_2 ... c_{n-1}`.\n\nNotice that `P_{n-1}[1:]` (the substring of `P_{n-1}` from the second character to the end) is `c_1 ... c_{n-2}`.\nAnd `S_{n-1}[:-1]` (the substring of `S_{n-1}` from the first character to the second-to-last) is `c_1 ... c_{n-2}`.\nTherefore, `P_{n-1}[1:]` must be equal to `S_{n-1}[:-1]`. This is the core condition for a pair of strings to be `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`.\n\nWe can find the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. Let's call them `str_A` and `str_B`. There are two possibilities for how they map to `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}`:\n\n**Case 1: `str_A` is `P_{n-1}` and `str_B` is `S_{n-1}`.**\n   - Check if `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n   - If this condition holds, we can reconstruct a candidate string `s_candidate1 = str_A + str_B[-1]`.\n   - We then verify if all other input strings are consistent with `s_candidate1`. That is, for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, we must find exactly one string that is `s_candidate1[0:k]` and exactly one string that is `s_candidate1[n-k:n]`.\n\n**Case 2: `str_B` is `P_{n-1}` and `str_A` is `S_{n-1}`.**\n   - Check if `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n   - If this condition holds, we can reconstruct a candidate string `s_candidate2 = str_B + str_A[-1]`.\n   - We then verify if all other input strings are consistent with `s_candidate2`.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that a valid solution exists, at least one of these two cases will lead to a valid `s_candidate` and a consistent classification.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:**\n    *   Read `n`.\n    *   Store all `2n-2` input strings in a list, preserving their original order.\n    *   Separate the strings by length into a dictionary or list of lists for easier access. Also, identify `str_A` and `str_B` (the two strings of length `n-1`).\n\n2.  **Attempt Case 1:**\n    *   Let `P_candidate_n_minus_1 = str_A` and `S_candidate_n_minus_1 = str_B`.\n    *   If `P_candidate_n_minus_1[1:] == S_candidate_n_minus_1[:-1]`:\n        *   Form `s_candidate = P_candidate_n_minus_1 + S_candidate_n_minus_1[-1]`.\n        *   **Verify `s_candidate`:**\n            *   Create a set of expected prefixes: `{s_candidate[0:k] for k in range(1, n)}`.\n            *   Create a set of expected suffixes: `{s_candidate[n-k:n] for k in range(1, n)}`.\n            *   For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n                *   Count how many input strings of length `k` are in the `expected_prefixes` set. It must be exactly 1.\n                *   Count how many input strings of length `k` are in the `expected_suffixes` set. It must be exactly 1.\n            *   If all counts are correct, `s_candidate` is valid. Proceed to step 4.\n\n3.  **Attempt Case 2 (if Case 1 failed verification):**\n    *   Let `P_candidate_n_minus_1 = str_B` and `S_candidate_n_minus_1 = str_A`.\n    *   If `P_candidate_n_minus_1[1:] == S_candidate_n_minus_1[:-1]`:\n        *   Form `s_candidate = P_candidate_n_minus_1 + S_candidate_n_minus_1[-1]`.\n        *   **Verify `s_candidate`:** (Same verification as in Case 1).\n        *   If `s_candidate` is valid, proceed to step 4.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Once a valid `s_candidate` is found, iterate through the original list of input strings.\n    *   For each input string `original_str[i]`:\n        *   If `original_str[i]` is equal to `s_candidate[0:len(original_str[i])]`, it's a prefix. Append 'P' to the result.\n        *   Else, it must be a suffix. Append 'S' to the result.\n    *   Print the resulting 'P'/'S' string.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings (original order): `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\n\n1.  **Identify strings of length `n-1 = 4`:** `abab`, `baba`.\n    `str_A = \"abab\"`, `str_B = \"baba\"`. (Let's say `str_A` is the first one encountered in the input, `str_B` the second).\n\n2.  **Attempt Case 1: `P_{n-1} = \"abab\"`, `S_{n-1} = \"baba\"`**\n    *   Check `P_{n-1}[1:] == S_{n-1}[:-1]`:\n        `\"bab\"` == `\"bab\"`. This is true.\n    *   Form `s_candidate = \"abab\" + \"baba\"[-1] = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\"`.\n    *   **Verify \"ababa\":**\n        *   Expected prefixes: `a, ab, aba, abab`\n        *   Expected suffixes: `a, ba, aba, baba`\n        *   Input strings grouped by length:\n            *   len 1: `a`, `a`\n            *   len 2: `ba`, `ab`\n            *   len 3: `aba`, `aba`\n            *   len 4: `abab`, `baba`\n        *   Verification:\n            *   Len 1: `a` (prefix), `a` (suffix).
