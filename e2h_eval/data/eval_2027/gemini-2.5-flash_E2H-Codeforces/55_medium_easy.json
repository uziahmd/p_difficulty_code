    "thought": "**The Core Insight: Fixed Relative Order of '0's and '2's**\n\nOkay, so I've been wrestling with this problem, and I *think* I finally understand the key. It's all about the relative positioning of '0's and '2's. We can't swap them directly if they're next to each other, but the presence of '1's changes everything. It's almost like the '1's act as bridges, allowing the '0's and '2's to effectively \"swap\" positions with each other.\n\nAt first, I thought that meant we could just sort everything, but that turned out to be wrong. The '0's and '2's *do* maintain their original relative order. So, if we have a \"0...2\" in the input string, the '0' will *always* stay to the left of the '2' in the final string, even if '1's move around. It's the '1's that are the truly mobile elements.\n\n**The Algorithm**\n\nHere's my thought process on building the algorithm:\n\n1. **Extract and Preserve:** I need to build a new string where I keep the '0's and '2's in their initial relative order.  I'll call this `s_02`.\n2. **Count the '1's:** I have to keep track of how many '1's are in the original string, as those are the mobile guys.\n3. **Find the Insertion Point:**  The trick is figuring out *where* to insert the '1's. Since we want a lexicographically smallest string, the '1's always go after the '0's and before the '2's (if there are any). To do this, I need to find the first occurrence of '2' in `s_02` or consider the end if no '2'.\n4. **Construct the Result:** Now, I just create the new string. The process goes: the '0's (left side of the first '2'), the '1's, and finally, the '2's (right side of the '1's) – always respecting the initial relative positioning of '0's and '2's!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by repeatedly swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Swapping '0's and '2's directly is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' <-> '1' (e.g., \"01\" becomes \"10\" or \"10\" becomes \"01\")\n2. '1' <-> '2' (e.g., \"12\" becomes \"21\" or \"21\" becomes \"12\")\n3. '0' <-> '2' is explicitly disallowed.\n\nThis type of problem often involves identifying which characters can change their relative order and which cannot.\n\nConsider the characters '0', '1', and '2':\n- '0's and '1's can swap their positions if they are adjacent. This means a '0' can effectively move past any '1', and vice-versa.\n- '1's and '2's can swap their positions if they are adjacent. This means a '1' can effectively move past any '2', and vice-versa.\n\nWhat about '0's and '2's?\nThe problem states they cannot swap directly. This is a crucial constraint. If a '0' is at index `i` and a '2' is at index `j`, and they are not adjacent, can they still swap positions indirectly?\nLet's test with \"012\":\n\"012\" --(swap '0' and '1')--> \"102\" --(swap '1' and '2')--> \"120\".\nIn \"120\", the '2' (originally at index 2) is now at index 1, and the '0' (originally at index 0) is now at index 2. The '0' has moved to the right of the '2'.\nSimilarly, for \"210\":\n\"210\" --(swap '1' and '0')--> \"201\" --(swap '2' and '0' is not allowed, but '2' and '1' are not adjacent)\nAh, the \"201\" step is incorrect. \"201\" -> (swap '0' and '1') -> \"210\".\nLet's retry \"210\":\n\"210\" --(swap '2' and '1')--> \"120\" --(swap '1' and '0')--> \"102\" --(swap '1' and '2')--> \"012\".\nThis also shows that '0' and '2' can swap positions.\nThis implies that if there is at least one '1' in the string, '0's and '2's can effectively swap positions by using '1's as intermediaries.\n\nHowever, the example outputs contradict this full swappability.\nInput: \"100210\"\nMy \"fully sorted\" (all '0's, then all '1's, then all '2's) output would be \"000112\".\nBut the example output is \"001120\".\nThe '0' at the end of \"001120\" indicates that not all '0's can move past all '2's.\n\nThe key insight, as confirmed by the example outputs, is that the '1's are completely mobile relative to '0's and '2's. That is, any '1' can be moved to any position in the string. However, '0's and '2's maintain their *original relative order*. This means if an original '0' appears before an original '2', that '0' will always appear before that '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if an original '2' appears before an original '0', it will always stay that way.\n\nThis leads to the following strategy:\n1. Identify all '0's and '2's in the original string. Preserve their relative order to form a subsequence of '0's and '2's.\n2. Count all '1's in the original string.\n3. To construct the lexicographically smallest string:\n    - All '0's should come first.\n    - All '1's should come after all '0's.\n    - All '2's should come after all '1's.\n    - However, due to the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's, we can't always move all '0's before all '2's.\n    - The most optimal placement for the '1's is right after all '0's that appear in the '0'/'2' subsequence and before all '2's that appear in the '0'/'2' subsequence.\n\nLet's illustrate with \"100210\":\n1. Original string `s = \"100210\"`.\n2. Extract '0's and '2's while maintaining relative order:\n   - `s[0] = '1'` (skip)\n   - `s[1] = '0'` -> subsequence: `['0']`\n   - `s[2] = '0'` -> subsequence: `['0', '0']`\n   - `s[3] = '2'` -> subsequence: `['0', '0', '2']`\n   - `s[4] = '1'` (skip)\n   - `s[5] = '0'` -> subsequence: `['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n   So, the combined '0'/'2' subsequence is `0020`.\n3. Count '1's: There are two '1's in \"100210\".\n4. Construct the result:\n   We have `0020` and two '1's. To make it lexicographically smallest, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\n   The '1's can be inserted anywhere into `0020`. To minimize the string, we should insert them after all initial '0's and before any '2's in the `0020` subsequence.\n   In `0020`, the first '2' appears at index 2.\n   So, we take the part before the first '2': `00`.\n   Then insert all '1's: `11`.\n   Then append the rest of the '0'/'2' subsequence: `20`.\n   Result: `00` + `11` + `20` = `\"001120\"`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach correctly solves all given examples.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Initialize an empty list, `zero_two_chars`, to store '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\n2. Initialize a counter `ones_count = 0`.\n3. Iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s`:\n   - If `char` is '0' or '2', append `char` to `zero_two_chars`.\n   - If `char` is '1', increment `ones_count`.\n4. Find the insertion point for the '1's in `zero_two_chars`. This is the index of the first '2'.\n   - Initialize `insert_idx = len(zero_two_chars)`. (This handles cases where there are no '2's, placing '1's at the end).\n   - Iterate from `i = 0` to `len(zero_two_chars) - 1`:\n     - If `zero_two_chars[i]` is '2', set `insert_idx = i` and break the loop.\n5. Construct the final string:\n   - Convert `zero_two_chars` to a string.\n   - Insert `ones_count` '1's at `insert_idx`.\n   - `result = \"\".join(zero_two_chars[:insert_idx]) + ('1' * ones_count) + \"\".join(zero_two_chars[insert_idx:])`\n\n**Example: \"11222121\"**\n1. `zero_two_chars = []`, `ones_count = 0`\n2. Iterate:\n   - '1': `ones_count = 1`\n   - '1': `ones_count = 2`\n   - '2': `zero_two_chars = ['2']`\n   - '2': `zero_two_chars = ['2', '2']`\n   - '2': `zero_two_chars = ['2', '2', '2']`\n   - '1': `ones_count = 3`\n   - '2': `zero_two_chars = ['2', '2', '2', '2']`\n   - '1': `ones_count = 4`\n   Final: `zero_two_chars = ['2', '2', '2', '2']`, `ones_count = 4`\n3. Find `insert_idx`:\n   - First '2' is at index 0. `insert_idx = 0`.\n4. Construct result:\n   `\"\".join(zero_two_chars[:0])` is `\"\"`.\n   `'1' * 4` is `\"1111\"`.\n   `\"\".join(zero_two_chars[0:])` is `\"2222\"`.\n   Result: `\"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\"`. Matches example.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n- Time Complexity: O(N) because we iterate through the input string once to separate characters and count '1's, and then iterate through the `zero_two_chars` list once to find the insertion point. String concatenation operations in Python can be O(N) in total if done efficiently (e.g., building a list of characters and then joining).\n- Space Complexity: O(N) to store `zero_two_chars` and the final result string.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    s = input()\n\n    zero_two_chars = []\n    ones_count = 0\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Separate '0's and '2's, count '1's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            ones_count += 1\n        else:\n            zero_two_chars.append(char)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # '1's should be placed after all '0's and before all '2's in the zero_two_chars sequence.\n    # This means finding the first '2' in zero_two_chars.\n    insert_idx = len(zero_two_chars) # Default to end if no '2's are found\n\n    for i in range(len(zero_two_chars)):\n        if zero_two_chars[i] == '2':\n            insert_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    # Step 4: Construct the final string\n    # Join characters before the insertion point\n    result_list = zero_two_chars[:insert_idx]\n    \n    # Add all '1's\n    result_list.extend(['1'] * ones_count)\n    \n    # Add characters after the insertion point\n    result_list.extend(zero_two_chars[insert_idx:])\n    \n    print(\"\".join(result_list))\n\n# The problem statement implies multiple test cases in the input example,\n# but competitive programming problems usually provide one string per run.\n# Given the example format, it's safer to assume the input is one string per execution.\n# If multiple strings were given on separate lines, a loop would be needed.\n# For typical competitive programming setup, we just call solve() once.\nsolve()\n\n```",
