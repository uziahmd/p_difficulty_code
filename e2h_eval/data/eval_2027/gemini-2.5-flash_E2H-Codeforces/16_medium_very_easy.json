Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Algorithm Derivation for \"Crazy Town\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and the goal is to figure out the minimum number of moves to get from a home to a university on a 2D plane divided by lines. Here's how I'm thinking about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic setup. I've got a home, a university, and a bunch of lines (roads). The plane is cut into blocks by these lines, and I can only move from one block to an adjacent one.  The problem says home and university aren't on any lines.\n\nThe key insight is that moving to an adjacent block means crossing a single line. So, if my home and university are on the same side of a line, I don't need to cross it. If they are on opposite sides, I *do* need to cross it to get from one to the other. And it's guaranteed that both places aren't on any of the lines.\n\nLet's say a line is represented as `ax + by + c = 0`.  I can plug in the home coordinates `(x1, y1)` and the university coordinates `(x2, y2)` to the line equation. Let `f(x,y) = ax + by + c`.  If `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)` have the same sign (both positive or both negative), the points are on the same side of the line. If they have opposite signs, they are on opposite sides.  I can quickly check this using the product:  if `f(x1, y1) * f(x2, y2) < 0`, the points are on opposite sides, and I have to step across that line.\n\nSo, the algorithm becomes simple. I need to iterate through each line. For each line, I'll calculate `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)`. If their product is negative, I increment a `steps` counter.  After checking all the lines, the `steps` variable will hold the minimum number of moves.\n\nI'll read the input: `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and the number of lines `n`. Then, for each of the `n` lines, read the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`, do the math, and update the step count.  Finally, print the total number of steps.\n\nI'm confident this will work. I've considered edge cases and this logic captures the minimum number of steps. I'll code it up and test it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing home) to a target block (containing university). A step involves moving from one block to an adjacent block, which means crossing a single road (line). The minimum number of steps is therefore equal to the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nTwo points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are separated by a line `ax + by + c = 0` if they lie on opposite sides of the line. We can determine which side of the line a point `(x, y)` is on by evaluating the expression `f(x, y) = ax + by + c`.\n* If `f(x, y) > 0`, the point is on one side.\n* If `f(x, y) < 0`, the point is on the other side.\n* If `f(x, y) = 0`, the point is on the line itself.\n\nThe problem guarantees that neither the home nor the university is located on any road, so `f(x, y)` will never be zero for these points. Therefore, two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on opposite sides of the line `ax + by + c = 0` if and only if `(a*x1 + b*y1 + c)` and `(a*x2 + b*y2 + c)` have different signs. A simple way to check if two numbers have different signs is to see if their product is negative.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Read the coordinates of the home `(x1, y1)` and the university `(x2, y2)`.\n2. Initialize a counter `steps` to 0.\n3. Read the total number of roads `n`.\n4. For each of the `n` roads:\n    a. Read the coefficients `a, b, c` for the line `ax + by + c = 0`.\n    b. Calculate `val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n    c. Calculate `val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n    d. If `val1 * val2 < 0`, it means the home and university are on opposite sides of this road. Increment `steps`.\n5. Print the final value of `steps`.\n\nThis approach correctly counts the number of lines that must be crossed, which directly corresponds to the minimum number of steps required. The maximum values of coordinates and coefficients ensure that intermediate calculations `a*x + b*y + c` and their products fit within standard integer types (Python handles large integers automatically).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read coordinates of home (x1, y1)\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read coordinates of university (x2, y2)\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the number of roads (lines)\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Initialize the counter for steps (lines crossed)\n    steps = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read the coefficients a, b, c for the current line: ax + by + c = 0\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the home coordinates.\n        # The sign of ax + by + c indicates which side of the line the point (x, y) is on.\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the university coordinates.\n        val_university = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val_home and val_university have different signs, it means the home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this particular line.
