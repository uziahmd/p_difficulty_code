The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need a Python script to figure out the total number of losses for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game runs for *n* rounds, but here's the twist: the players use cyclic strategies. Nikephoros has a repeating sequence *A* of length *m*, and Polycarpus has a sequence *B* of length *k*.\n\nMy initial thought is that simulating *n* rounds directly would be a brute-force approach and far too slow, especially since *n* can be huge. The key insight here is the cyclic nature of the strategies. We only need to figure out the behavior within a cycle.\n\nSince both players have cyclic moves, the combined game state will also cycle. The length of this combined cycle is the least common multiple (LCM) of *m* and *k*.  I'll use the formula `LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // GCD(m, k)` because the inputs are integers and the double slash is important for integer division. Calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) using `math.gcd` is the best method to calculate the LCM.\n\nThe largest `LCM(m, k)` can be is when `m` and `k` are each 1000, so the LCM is at most 1,000,000.  That's manageable to simulate in an efficient manner.\n\nHere's my strategy:\n\n1. **Calculate the LCM (cycle_length):** Determine the length of the repeating cycle, `cycle_length`.\n2. **Simulate one cycle:** Run the game for `cycle_length` rounds, keeping track of Nikephoros's losses (`losses_N_cycle`) and Polycarpus's losses (`losses_P_cycle`) during this single cycle.  I'll use a `get_outcome` function to determine the winner of each round.\n3. **Handle full cycles:** Calculate how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds (*n*). Multiply the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles.\n4. **Handle remaining rounds:** Figure out how many rounds are left over after the full cycles are completed. Simulate these remaining rounds separately, incrementing the loss counters.\n5. **Sum the losses:**  Total Nikephoros's losses and total Polycarpus's losses are calculated by `total_losses_N = (n // cycle_length) * losses_N_cycle + remaining_losses_N`, and `total_losses_P = (n // cycle_length) * losses_P_cycle + remaining_losses_P`.\n\nThe `get_outcome` function will be a helper function that returns 1 if Nikephoros wins, -1 if Polycarpus wins, and 0 for a draw. It's essential to define this function, using the standard rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors:\n\n*   Rock beats Scissors.\n*   Scissors beats Paper.\n*   Paper beats Rock.\n\nI will use 'R', 'S', and 'P' to represent rock, scissors, and paper respectively.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, the program will need:\n\n*   Input: `n`, `A`, and `B`.\n*   A `get_outcome()` function.\n*   The logic for computing the number of full cycles and remaining rounds.\n*   The code to simulate those rounds, including modulo operations to handle cycling through `A` and `B`.\n\nNo optimization is needed here as the worst-case `cycle_length` of a million will be handled very quickly. I'll need to remember to import `math` for `gcd` and use `sys.stdin.readline` for faster input. The plan is sound, and I'm ready to write the code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of losses (red spots) for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, over `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Nikephoros follows a cyclic strategy using sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus uses sequence `B` of length `k`.\n\nThe key challenge is that `n` can be very large (up to 2 * 10^9), making a direct simulation of `n` rounds too slow. However, the sequence lengths `m` and `k` are small (up to 1000).\n\n**Understanding the Cyclic Nature:**\nNikephoros's moves repeat every `m` rounds.\nPolycarpus's moves repeat every `k` rounds.\nThe combined state of the game (which moves Nikephoros and Polycarpus play) will repeat every `L` rounds, where `L` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.\nThe LCM can be calculated as `(m * k) / gcd(m, k)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.\nSince `m, k <= 1000`, the maximum value for `L` is `1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000`. This length is small enough to simulate one full cycle.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Calculate `L` (cycle length):**\n    Determine `m = len(A)` and `k = len(B)`.\n    Compute `L = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)`.\n\n2.  **Simulate one full cycle:**\n    Iterate `i` from `0` to `L-1`. In each round `i`:\n    *   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n    *   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n    *   Determine the winner using the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:\n        *   Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n        *   Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n        *   Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n        *   If both play the same item, it's a draw.\n    *   If Nikephoros loses, increment `losses_N_cycle`.\n    *   If Polycarpus loses, increment `losses_P_cycle`.\n    These `losses_N_cycle` and `losses_P_cycle` represent the losses accumulated by each player over one complete cycle of `L` rounds.\n\n3.  **Calculate losses from full cycles within `n` rounds:**\n    Determine how many full `L`-round cycles fit into `n` rounds: `num_full_cycles = n // L`.\n    Multiply the losses per cycle by `num_full_cycles`:\n    `total_losses_N = num_full_cycles * losses_N_cycle`\n    `total_losses_P = num_full_cycles * losses_P_cycle`\n\n4.  **Simulate remaining rounds:**\n    Calculate the number of rounds remaining after the full cycles: `remaining_rounds = n % L`.\n    Simulate these `remaining_rounds` starting from the beginning of the sequences (round `0` relative to the cycle).\n    For `i` from `0` to `remaining_rounds - 1`:\n    *   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n    *   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n    *   Update `total_losses_N` and `total_losses_P` based on the outcome of these individual rounds.\n\n5.  **Print the result:**\n    Output `total_losses_N` and `total_losses_P`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n = 7`, `A = \"RPS\"` (`m=3`), `B = \"RSPP\"` (`k=4`)\n\n1.  **Calculate `L`:**\n    `math.gcd(3, 4) = 1`\n    `L = (3 * 4) // 1 = 12`\n\n2.  **Simulate one cycle (12 rounds):**\n    After simulating 12 rounds:\n    `losses_N_cycle = 5` (Nikephoros loses in rounds 1, 3, 6, 7, 9)\n    `losses_P_cycle = 4` (Polycarpus loses in rounds 2, 4, 8, 10)\n\n3.  **Calculate losses from full cycles:**\n    `num_full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0`\n    `total_losses_N = 0 * 5 = 0`\n    `total_losses_P = 0 * 4 = 0`\n\n4.  **Simulate remaining rounds:**\n    `remaining_rounds = 7 % 12 = 7`\n    Simulate the first 7 rounds:\n    *   R1: N:R, P:R -> Draw\n    *   R2: N:P, P:S -> Polycarpus wins (N loses) -> `total_losses_N = 1`\n    *   R3: N:S, P:P -> Nikephoros wins (P loses) -> `total_losses_P = 1`\n    *   R4: N:R, P:P -> Polycarpus wins (N loses) -> `total_losses_N = 2`\n    *   R5: N:P, P:R -> Nikephoros wins (P loses) -> `total_losses_P = 2`\n    *   R6: N:S, P:S -> Draw\n    *   R7: N:R, P:P -> Polycarpus wins (N loses) -> `total_losses_N = 3`\n\n5.  **Print result:**\n    `3 2`\n\nThis approach correctly handles the large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the game.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef get_outcome(move_N, move_P):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the outcome of a single round of Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n    Args:\n        move_N (str): Nikephoros's move ('R', 'P', 'S')\n        move_P (str): Polycarpus's move ('R', 'P', 'S')\n    Returns:\n        1 if Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses)\n        -1 if Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses)\n        0 if it's a draw\n    \"\"\"\n    if move_N == move_P:\n        return 0  # Draw\n    \n    # Nikephoros's winning conditions\n    if (move_N == 'R' and move_P == 'S') or \\\n       (move_N == 'S' and move_P == 'P') or \\\n       (move_N == 'P' and move_P == 'R'):\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses)\n    \n    # Otherwise, Polycarpus wins\n    return -1 # Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros loses)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Calculate LCM of m and k.
