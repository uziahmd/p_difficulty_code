On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "**Reflecting on \"A Twisty Movement\" and My Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to find the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a subsegment of a sequence of 1s and 2s. The sequence's length is up to 2000, so computational complexity is key. My initial thought is to precompute prefix and suffix counts of 1s and 2s because those are so important to LNDS of just 1s and 2s.\n\nIt seems like the LNDS must be in the form of `1...12...2`.  The reversal introduces complexity, so it can make an index in the original array now become the source of either 1s or 2s. Thus, I need to consider three parts: the prefix before the reversed segment, the reversed segment itself, and the suffix after the reversed segment.\n\nMy first impulse was to consider picking 1s from the prefix, then reversed segment and suffix, then 2s from those as well, leading to many subproblems. It's becoming quickly apparent that this approach will lead to complicated logic.\n\nInstead, I decided to look at an elegant solution that splits at an index, *k*, and try to pick as many 1s as possible before index *k* and as many 2s as possible after index *k*. I can compute the number of 1s before *k* and the number of 2s after *k* and try to maximize them. This is `O(N^3)` because there are N^2 pairs of intervals to reverse, and N possible indexes *k*. This is too slow for 2000.\n\nI need a way to precompute the counts to reduce the time complexity. I figured I can precompute prefix sums (`pref1`, `pref2`) and suffix sums (`suff1`, `suff2`) of 1s and 2s. This seems like a great start for a dynamic programming problem.\n\nFixing `l` and `r` to reverse, I realize the new array `b` is formed by prefix, reversed segment, and suffix. To calculate LNDS, you need to iterate `k` where you count 1s from `b[1..k]` and 2s from `b[k+1..n]`.\n\nI am now focusing on efficiently calculating the LNDS for a fixed `l` and `r`. The sequence b is the original array with the interval `[l, r]` reversed. I realize that the 1s and 2s can come from three parts and therefore, can maximize the total sum based on the positions of the 1s and 2s. This led me to three cases, based on where *k* (my split point) falls in relation to the reversed subsegment:\n\n1.  *k* is before `l`:  The problem is now reduced to finding the maximum `pref1[k] - pref2[k]` for `k` from 0 to `l-1`.  I can use a precomputed array (`max_pref_diff`) to solve.\n\n2.  *k* is after `r`: This is calculating maximum sum from both pref and suffix. Easy to find with an array that stores the sums.\n\n3.  *k* is in the reversed segment `[l, r]`. This case looks complicated as *k* moves. I have to express `j` the original index of *k*. In this case, `max_mid_diff` is the key for the subarray.  This results in an `O(N^2)` algorithm.\n\nFor the three cases, by precomputing, I can calculate subcase 1 and 2 in O(1). Subcase 3 will still loop N times for range max query, which takes N time. This leads to O(N^2).\n\nMy next step is to use the existing precomputed values and reduce the complexity of the range max query. Segment trees or sparse tables for range maximum query can do this efficiently, with `O(N log N)` or `O(N)` precomputation, and `O(1)` query, but that's overkill. I can iterate over `[l-1, r-1]` to get the max. Thus, I realize O(N^2) might be acceptable, and therefore I will submit with O(N^2).\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a single contiguous subsegment `a[l...r]` of the original sequence `a`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s.\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. Its length is the total count of 1s and 2s. To maximize this length, we need to find an optimal \"split point\" `k`. All elements chosen for the LNDS at or before index `k` must be 1s, and all elements chosen after index `k` must be 2s. The length would then be `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`, where `b` is the modified sequence and indices are 0-based. We need to maximize this sum over all possible `k` and all possible `l, r` reversals.\n\nLet `n` be the length of the sequence. We'll use 0-indexed arrays for implementation convenience.\n`a = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`.\nThe reversal interval `[l, r]` will correspond to indices `[l-1, r-1]`.\n\nFirst, precompute prefix and suffix counts of 1s and 2s:\n- `pref1[i]`: count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`. `pref1[0]=0`.\n- `pref2[i]`: count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`. `pref2[0]=0`.\n- `suff1[i]`: count of 1s in `a[i...n-1]`. `suff1[n]=0`.\n- `suff2[i]`: count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `suff2[n]=0`.\nThese can be computed in `O(N)` time.\n\nThe maximum LNDS length for a sequence `b` is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count_ones(b[0...k-1]) + count_twos(b[k...n-1]))`.\nLet's iterate over all possible `l` and `r` (`0 <= l <= r < n`). There are `O(N^2)` such pairs.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`, the sequence `b` is:\n`a[0...l-1]`, then `a[r...l]` (reversed), then `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n\nWe need to calculate `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count_ones(b[0...k-1]) + count_twos(b[k...n-1]))`.\nLet `current_max_lnds` be this value for the current `l, r`.\n\nThe split point `k` can fall into three regions:\n1. `k <= l`: The split is in the prefix `a[0...l-1]`.\n   `count_ones(b[0...k-1]) = pref1[k]`.\n   `count_twos(b[k...n-1]) = (pref2[l] - pref2[k]) + (pref2[r+1] - pref2[l]) + suff2[r+1]`.\n   The `(pref2[r+1] - pref2[l])` part is the count of 2s in `a[l...r]`, which remains the same after reversal.\n   So, `count_twos(b[k...n-1]) = pref2[r+1] - pref2[k] + suff2[r+1]`.\n   Total: `pref1[k] - pref2[k] + pref2[r+1] + suff2[r+1]`.\n   We need to maximize `pref1[k] - pref2[k]` for `0 <= k <= l`.\n   Let `max_diff_prefix[i] = max_{0 <= j <= i} (pref1[j] - pref2[j])`. Precompute this in `O(N)`.\n   This case contributes `max_diff_prefix[l] + pref2[r+1] + suff2[r+1]`.\n\n2. `k > r+1`: The split is in the suffix `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n   `count_ones(b[0...k-1]) = pref1[l] + (pref1[r+1] - pref1[l]) + (pref1[k] - pref1[r+1]) = pref1[k]`.\n   `count_twos(b[k...n-1]) = suff2[k]`.\n   Total: `pref1[k] + suff2[k]`.\n   We need to maximize `pref1[k] + suff2[k]` for `r+1 <= k <= n`.\n   Let `max_sum_suffix[i] = max_{i <= j <= n} (pref1[j] + suff2[j])`. Precompute this in `O(N)`.\n   This case contributes `max_sum_suffix[r+1]`.\n\n3. `l <= k <= r+1`: The split is within the reversed segment `a[l...r]`.\n   Let `k'` be the original index corresponding to the split point `k`.\n   `k` is the number of elements from the beginning of `b`.\n   The elements `b[0...l-1]` are `a[0...l-1]`.\n   The elements `b[l...k-1]` are `a[r...r-(k-l-1)]`.\n   So, `count_ones(b[0...k-1]) = pref1[l] + (pref1[r+1] - pref1[r-(k-l-1)])`.\n   The elements `b[k...r]` are `a[r-(k-l-1)-1...l]`.\n   The elements `b[r+1...n-1]` are `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n   So, `count_twos(b[k...n-1]) = (pref2[r-(k-l-1)] - pref2[l]) + suff2[r+1]`.\n   Let `j = r-(k-l-1)`. As `k` goes from `l` to `r+1`, `j` goes from `r+1` down to `l`.\n   Total: `pref1[l] + pref1[r+1] - pref1[j] + pref2[j] - pref2[l] + suff2[r+1]`.\n   We need to maximize `pref2[j] - pref1[j]` for `l <= j <= r+1`.\n   This is `pref1[l] + pref1[r+1] - pref2[l] + suff2[r+1] + max_{l <= j <= r+1} (pref2[j] - pref1[j])`.\n   The term `max_{l <= j <= r+1} (pref2[j] - pref1[j])` can be computed in `O(r-l+1)` time for each `(l, r)` pair.\n\nThe overall complexity would be `O(N^2)` for `l, r` loops, and `O(N)` for the inner maximization for Case 3, leading to `O(N^3)`. With `N=2000`, `N^3 = 8 \\cdot 10^9`, which is too slow.\n\nWe need to optimize the `max_{l <= j <= r+1} (pref2[j] - pref1[j])` part.\nLet `val[j] = pref2[j] - pref1[j]`. We need `max(val[j])` for `j` in `[l, r+1]`.\nThis is a Range Maximum Query. Since `N` is up to 2000, we can use a simpler `O(N^2)` precomputation:\nLet `range_max_val[i][j] = max_{i <= k <= j} (pref2[k] - pref1[k])`.\n`range_max_val[i][j] = max(range_max_val[i][j-1], pref2[j] - pref1[j])`.\nThis takes `O(N^2)` time.\n\nWith this precomputation, Case 3 also becomes `O(1)`.\nTotal time complexity:\n- Precomputing `pref1, pref2, suff1, suff2`: `O(N)`\n- Precomputing `max_diff_prefix`: `O(N)`\n- Precomputing `max_sum_suffix`: `O(N)`\n- Precomputing `range_max_val`: `O(N^2)`\n- Iterating `l, r` and calculating `current_max_lnds`: `O(N^2)`\nOverall complexity: `O(N^2)`.\nWith `N=2000`, `N^2 = 4 \\cdot 10^6`, which is acceptable.\n\nLet's refine index handling for `range_max_val`:\n`max_val_in_range[i][j]` will store `max_{i <= k <= j} (pref2[k] - pref1[k])`.\n`max_val_in_range[i][j]` can be computed as `max(max_val_in_range[i][j-1], pref2[j] - pref1[j])` for `j > i`, and `max_val_in_range[i][i] = pref2[i] - pref1[i]`.\nThe indices `j` for `pref2[j]-pref1[j]` range from `l` to `r+1`.\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS length is `n` (if all elements are 1s or all are 2s, or they can be rearranged to `1...12...2`).
