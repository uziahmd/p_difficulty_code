He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Polycarp's Practice\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python solution. The core of it seems to be figuring out the best way to split the problems into days to maximize the total profit. Let's break this down from a competitive programming perspective.\n\nFirst off, I've got an input with `n` problems and `k` days. The difficulty of each problem is given in the list `a`. The constraints are pretty standard: solve them in order, contiguous segments per day, and at least one problem per day. The \"profit\" is the sum of the maximum difficulty solved on each day. The goal is to maximize this total profit and output the split.\n\nNow, the critical insight is clear: to get the *maximum* total profit, I have to make the *daily* maximum as large as possible. This means I want to grab the `k` highest difficulties from the `n` problems and make *those* the daily \"profits\". If I can arrange things so each of the `k` largest values become the max for one of the `k` days, I've nailed the global optimum. Proving why this is true is simple, any other choice can only lead to a sum less than or equal to `sum(d_j)` where `d_j` is the list of `k` largest difficulties in the array `a`.\n\nThe strategy then becomes pretty straightforward. I need to:\n\n1.  Identify the `k` largest difficulty problems. I'll make difficulty-index pairs, sort them, and select the top `k`.\n2.  Calculate the maximum total profit, which is simply the sum of these `k` largest difficulties.\n3.  Determine *how* to split the problems. The indices of the largest difficulties become the splitting points. Sorting these indices in ascending order will tell me where to cut the problem list. Segment 1 goes from 0 to the first sorted index, segment 2 goes from the first sorted index + 1 up to the second sorted index, and so on. The daily counts are easy to compute from these indices.\n\nIt seems I should start implementing this and write some test cases to ensure that the code works correctly. It's a classic greedy approach that makes intuitive sense once the key insight is figured out. Let's get to it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given as a list of difficulties `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, into `k` contiguous segments (representing `k` days of practice). Each day must solve at least one problem, and all `n` problems must be solved. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We want to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` values (the daily profits), we should choose the `k` largest possible values. The largest possible values for these daily profits are simply the `k` largest problem difficulties from the entire list `a`. If we can ensure that each of these `k` largest difficulties becomes the maximum for one of the `k` days, then their sum will be the maximum possible total profit.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Find the `k` largest difficulties:**\n    *   Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems.\n    *   Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty.\n    *   Take the first `k` elements from this sorted list. These are the `k` largest difficulties.\n    *   The sum of these `k` difficulties is our maximum total profit.\n\n2.  **Determine the split points for days:**\n    *   From the `k` largest difficulties identified in step 1, extract their original indices.\n    *   Sort these `k` indices in ascending order. These sorted indices `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_k` will be the *last* problem solved on day 1, day 2, ..., day `k` respectively, with a slight adjustment for the last day.\n    *   Specifically, `idx_1` will be the index of the problem that ends the first day's practice.\n    *   `idx_2` will be the index of the problem that ends the second day's practice, and so on.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of problems per day (`t_j`):**\n    *   Let the sorted indices be `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k`.\n    *   The first day solves problems from index `0` up to `s_1`. So, it solves `s_1 + 1` problems.\n    *   The second day solves problems from index `s_1 + 1` up to `s_2`. So, it solves `s_2 - (s_1 + 1) + 1 = s_2 - s_1` problems.\n    *   In general, for day `j` (where `j > 1`), it solves problems from index `s_{j-1} + 1` up to `s_j`. This means it solves `s_j - s_{j-1}` problems.\n    *   This pattern works for `k-1` days. The `k`-th day will solve all remaining problems from index `s_{k-1} + 1` up to `n-1`. The number of problems for the `k`-th day will be `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)`.\n\n    A simpler way to think about the `t_j` values:\n    The `k` sorted indices `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k` represent the *end points* of the first `k-1` segments, and `s_k` is just one of the chosen large-difficulty problems. We need to define `k-1` split points to create `k` segments.\n    The `k-1` split points will be `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{k-1}`.\n    *   Day 1: Problems `0` to `s_1`. Count: `s_1 + 1`.\n    *   Day 2: Problems `s_1 + 1` to `s_2`. Count: `s_2 - s_1`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `k-1`: Problems `s_{k-2} + 1` to `s_{k-1}`. Count: `s_{k-1} - s_{k-2}`.\n    *   Day `k`: Problems `s_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`. Count: `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)`.\n\n    Let's refine the split points. We have `k` indices `p_1, p_2, ..., p_k` (sorted).\n    The number of problems for each day will be:\n    `t_1 = p_1 + 1`\n    `t_2 = p_2 - p_1`\n    ...\n    `t_{k-1} = p_{k-1} - p_{k-2}`\n    `t_k = n - p_{k-1} - 1` (This is incorrect. It should be `n - (p_{k-1} + 1) + 1 = n - p_{k-1}`. Wait, `p_k` is one of the selected indices. The `k` problems with largest difficulty are at indices `p_1, p_2, ..., p_k` (sorted). The segments must end at these indices to guarantee these values are segment maximums.\n    No, the chosen indices `s_1, ..., s_k` are just the positions of the problems that *will be* the maximums of their respective days. We need to pick `k-1` split points. The most natural split points are *after* `s_1`, *after* `s_2`, ..., *after* `s_{k-1}`.\n\n    A better way to define `t_j`:\n    Let `indices = [original_index for difficulty, original_index in top_k_problems_sorted_by_difficulty]`.\n    Sort `indices` in ascending order: `sorted_indices`.\n    `t = []`\n    `prev_idx = -1`\n    For `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        `current_idx = sorted_indices[j]`\n        `t.append(current_idx - prev_idx)`\n        `prev_idx = current_idx`\n    For the last day (`k`-th day):\n        `t.append(n - 1 - prev_idx)`\n    This ensures all `n` problems are covered and each day has at least one problem.\n\n    Example: `n=8, k=3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n    1.  Difficulties with indices: `(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)`\n    2.  Sort by difficulty (descending), take top `k=3`: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`\n    3.  Max total profit: `9+6+5 = 20`.\n    4.  Original indices of these problems: `6, 3, 0`.\n    5.  Sort indices ascending: `[0, 3, 6]`. These are `s_0, s_1, s_2`.\n    6.  Calculate `t_j`:\n        *   `prev_idx = -1`\n        *   Day 1 (j=0): `current_idx = s_0 = 0`. `t.append(0 - (-1)) = 1`. `prev_idx = 0`.\n        *   Day 2 (j=1): `current_idx = s_1 = 3`. `t.append(3 - 0) = 3`. `prev_idx = 3`.\n        *   (Loop ends for `k-2=1`)\n        *   Day 3 (last day): `t.append(n - 1 - prev_idx) = 8 - 1 - 3 = 4`.\n        *   Resulting `t`: `[1, 3, 4]`.\n        *   This corresponds to `[5], [4,2,6], [5,1,9,2]`. Profits: `5, 6, 9`. Sum: `20`. This is a valid solution.\n\n    The example output is `3 2 3`. Let's re-evaluate.\n    `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]`\n    Profits: `5, 6, 9`. Sum: `20`.\n    Indices of profit-making problems: `a[0]=5`, `a[3]=6`, `a[6]=9`.\n    These are exactly the indices `0, 3, 6`.\n\n    My calculation for `t_j` was `[1, 3, 4]`.\n    The example's `t_j` is `[3, 2, 3]`.\n    Both are valid. The problem says \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\"\n\n    My current logic for `t_j` is:\n    `t_1`: problems `0` to `s_0`. Count `s_0 + 1`.\n    `t_2`: problems `s_0 + 1` to `s_1`. Count `s_1 - s_0`.\n    ...\n    `t_k`: problems `s_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`. Count `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)`.\n\n    Let's re-apply to `[0, 3, 6]` for `n=8, k=3`:\n    `s_0 = 0`\n    `s_1 = 3`\n    `s_2 = 6`\n    `t_1 = s_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    `t_2 = s_1 - s_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`\n    `t_3 = n - (s_1 + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 8 - 4 = 4` (This is `n - 1 - s_{k-2}` if `s` is 0-indexed and `k-1` is the last index of `s` used for splits)\n    This gives `[1, 3, 4]`. This is correct.\n\n    The example's `[3, 2, 3]` uses split points after index `2` and after index `4`.\n    `[5, 4, 2]` (max 5, index 0)\n    `[6, 5]` (max 6, index 3)\n    `[1, 9, 2]` (max 9, index 6)\n    The indices of the maximums are `0, 3, 6`.\n    The split points are `2` and `4`.\n    `t_1 = 2 - (-1) = 3`\n    `t_2 = 4 - 2 = 2`\n    `t_3 = 8 - 1 - 4 = 3`\n    This gives `[3, 2, 3]`.\n\n    This means we need to use `k-1` *distinct* indices from the `k` largest problem indices as split points.\n    We have `k` special indices `s_0, s_1, ..., s_{k-1}`. We need to create `k` segments.\n    The segments are `[0 ... p_0]`, `[p_0+1 ... p_1]`, ..., `[p_{k-2}+1 ... n-1]`.\n    We need to choose `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}` from `s_0, ..., s_{k-1}` such that each `s_i` falls into one of these segments and becomes its maximum.\n    The simplest way to guarantee this is to make sure `s_0` is in the first segment, `s_1` in the second, ..., `s_{k-1}` in the `k`-th segment.\n    This means `p_0 >= s_0`, `p_1 >= s_1`, ..., `p_{k-2} >= s_{k-2}`.\n    Also, `p_0 < s_1`, `p_1 < s_2`, etc.\n\n    The simplest approach that works and satisfies the problem constraints (any valid answer is fine) is to use `s_0, s_1, ..., s_{k-1}` as the *end points* of the first `k` segments, effectively.\n    No, this is wrong. `s_0, s_1, ..., s_{k-1}` are the indices of the problems that *are* the maximums.\n    We need `k-1` split points. The indices `s_0, ..., s_{k-1}` are the locations of the high-value problems.\n    We can choose the first `k-1` of these sorted indices as the last problem of the first `k-1` days.\n    So, if `sorted_indices = [idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{k-1}]`:\n    Day 1 ends at `idx_0`.\n    Day 2 ends at `idx_1`.\n    ...\n    Day `k-1` ends at `idx_{k-2}`.\n    Day `k` ends at `n-1`.\n\n    Let's try this for `[0, 3, 6]` with `n=8, k=3`:\n    `idx_0 = 0`, `idx_1 = 3`, `idx_2 = 6`.\n    Split points are after `idx_0` and after `idx_1`.\n    Day 1: `[0 ... idx_0]`. Problems: `idx_0 - (-1) = 1`. (`[5]`)\n    Day 2: `[idx_0+1 ... idx_1]`. Problems: `idx_1 - idx_0 = 3`. (`[4,2,6]`)\n    Day 3: `[idx_1+1 ... n-1]`. Problems: `(n-1) - (idx_1+1) + 1 = n - (idx_1+1)`. This is `8 - (3+1) = 4`. (`[5,1,9,2]`)\n    This yields `[1, 3, 4]`. This is still my previous result.\n\n    The example output `[3, 2, 3]` corresponds to split points `2` and `4`.\n    The crucial observation is that the maximum problem for a day *must* be one of the `k` largest problems.\n    So, for day 1, `a[s_0]` must be the max. For day 2, `a[s_1]` must be the max, etc.\n    This means the split points `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}` must satisfy:\n    `s_0 <= p_0 < s_1`\n    `s_1 <= p_1 < s_2`\n    ...\n    `s_{k-2} <= p_{k-2} < s_{k-1}` (This is not quite right, `s_{k-1}` should be in the last segment).\n\n    Let the sorted indices of the `k` largest values be `I = [i_0, i_1, ..., i_{k-1}]`.\n    We need to output `k` lengths `t_1, ..., t_k`.\n    The sum of `t_j` must be `n`.\n    `t_j >= 1`.\n    The simplest way to ensure `k` segments and that each of `a[i_j]` is a maximum of a segment:\n    The first segment takes problems up to `i_0`.\n    The second segment takes problems from `i_0+1` up to `i_1`.\n    ...\n    The `k`-th segment takes problems from `i_{k-1}+1` up to `n-1`.\n    This would be `t_1 = i_0 + 1`, `t_2 = i_1 - i_0`, ..., `t_k = (n-1) - i_{k-1}`.\n    This is `k` segments. But `i_0` is the max of the first, `i_1` is the max of the second, etc.\n    Wait, `i_0` is the *first* of the `k` largest indices. It might not be the maximum of its segment if there's a larger value before it.\n    This logic is flawed.\n\n    The correct logic for determining `t_j` is:\n    The `k` largest values `v_0, v_1, ..., v_{k-1}` (sorted by value descending) are chosen. Their sum is the max profit.\n    Their original indices are `idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{k-1}`.\n    We sort these indices: `s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_{k-1}`.\n    These `k` problems *must* be the maximums of their respective days.\n    This means we need to make `k-1` cuts. The cuts must be placed such that each `s_j` is in a different segment.\n    The easiest way to do this is to make cuts *immediately after* the first `k-1` of these sorted indices.\n    So, cuts are made after `s_0`, `s_1`, ..., `s_{k-2}`.\n    Day 1: problems `0` to `s_0`. Length `s_0 + 1`.\n    Day 2: problems `s_0+1` to `s_1`. Length `s_1 - s_0`.\n    ...\n    Day `k-1`: problems `s_{k-3}+1` to `s_{k-2}`. Length `s_{k-2} - s_{k-3}`.\n    Day `k`: problems `s_{k-2}+1` to `n-1`. Length `(n-1) - (s_{k-2}+1) + 1 = n - (s_{k-2}+1)`. This is `n - 1 - s_{k-2}` if `s` is 0-indexed.\n\n    Let's re-apply to `n=8, k=3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n    1.  `k` largest difficulties: `9, 6, 5`. Total profit: `20`.\n    2.  Original indices of these difficulties: `6, 3, 0`.\n    3.  Sorted indices: `s = [0, 3, 6]`.\n    4.  `k-1 = 2` cuts. We make cuts after `s_0` and `s_1`.\n        *   Day 1: problems `0` to `s_0=0`. Length `t_1 = s_0 - (-1) = 0 - (-1) = 1`.\n        *   Day 2: problems `s_0+1=1` to `s_1=3`. Length `t_2 = s_1 - s_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n        *   Day 3 (last day): problems `s_1+1=4` to `n-1=7`. Length `t_3 = (n-1) - s_1 = 7 - 3 = 4`.\n    5.  Resulting `t` list: `[1, 3, 4]`.\n\n    This is a perfectly valid solution. The example output `[3, 2, 3]` is also valid. My approach is simpler and guaranteed to work because each `s_j` falls into its own segment and is the maximum of that segment (since it's one of the `k` largest values overall).\n\n    Let's double check the `t_k` calculation:\n    `t_k` is the length of the segment from `s_{k-2}+1` to `n-1`.\n    Length is `(n-1) - (s_{k-2}+1) + 1 = n - s_{k-2} - 1`.\n    This is `n - (s_{k-2} + 1)` which is the number of problems from `s_{k-2}+1` to the end.\n\n    Let's use a `current_start_index` variable.\n    `t = []`\n    `current_start_index = 0`\n    For `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        `end_index = sorted_indices[j]`\n        `t.append(end_index - current_start_index + 1)`\n        `current_start_index = end_index + 1`\n    For the last day (`k`-th day):\n        `t.append(n - current_start_index)`\n\n    Example: `n=8, k=3, sorted_indices = [0, 3, 6]`\n    `t = []`\n    `current_start_index = 0`\n    `j=0`: `end_index = sorted_indices[0] = 0`. `t.append(0 - 0 + 1) = 1`. `current_start_index = 0 + 1 = 1`. `t = [1]`\n    `j=1`: `end_index = sorted_indices[1] = 3`. `t.append(3 - 1 + 1) = 3`. `current_start_index = 3 + 1 = 4`. `t = [1, 3]`\n    Loop ends.\n    Last day: `t.append(n - current_start_index) = 8 - 4 = 4`. `t = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\n    This logic is sound and correctly produces one of the valid answers.\n\n**Constraints Check:**\n*   `1 <= k <= n <= 2000`: Sorting `n` elements takes `O(N log N)`.
