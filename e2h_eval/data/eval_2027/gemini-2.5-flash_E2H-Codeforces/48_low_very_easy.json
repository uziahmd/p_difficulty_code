            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Base Conversion in Python**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to handle base conversion, which is pretty straightforward conceptually, but the devil is in the details, especially handling different input formats and edge cases.  The user wants something robust and efficient.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input.  I'll read the base inputs, `a` and `b`, then the number `c`.  I'll have to validate that `a` and `b` are within the constraints, and also account for the special 'R' value for Roman numerals. I'll need to remember the length constraint on `c`, too.\n\nThe core of this is going to be two parts: converting the input number, `c`, from base `a` to base 10, then converting that base-10 value to base `b`.\n\n### Converting from Base `a` to Base 10\n\nThe input `c` is a string.  Since `a` can be greater than 10, the string might contain letters as digits.  I'll definitely need a helper function, `char_to_int(char)`, to handle these cases.  That function will convert characters like 'A', 'B', etc., to their corresponding integer values (10, 11, and so on).\n\nI can convert to base 10 using either of two methods. The iterative method, where I process digits from left to right, would look like `decimal_value = decimal_value * a + char_to_int(digit)`. I think this is a good choice for efficiency.\n\n### Converting from Base 10 to Base `b`\n\nNow, this is where it gets a little more complex because `b` could be an integer (between 2 and 25) or 'R'.\n\n#### Integer Base Conversion\n\nIf `b` is an integer, I'll use the standard repeated division algorithm. I'll also need another helper function, `int_to_char(val)`, to convert integer values back to characters (0-9 and A-Z). I'll also need to handle the case where the base 10 value is 0 or potentially leading zeros that must be omitted from the output based on the prompt.\n\n#### Roman Numeral Conversion\n\nIf `b` is 'R', that's a whole different beast. I'll convert the integer from the previous part and then do a dedicated function for base 10 to Roman numeral conversion. I know I have a limit of 3000 here, so I will have to account for that.\n\nFinally, I need to put it all together and make sure the leading zeros are correctly handled, which means an output of '0' for the only case when the input number in any base is `0`. I will probably write a main function that orchestrates the overall process, calling the necessary functions for each step, and then print the result.\n",
