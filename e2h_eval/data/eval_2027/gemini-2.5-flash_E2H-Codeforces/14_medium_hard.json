Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes.

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find all positive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The output should be the count of such `n`s and the `n`s themselves, listed in increasing order.\n\nThe core idea is to understand that the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of factors of 5 in its prime factorization. Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5, we only need to count the 5s. Legendre's formula helps with that: `zeros(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`.  `zeros(n)` is non-decreasing; it either stays the same or increases as `n` grows, and it only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n\nI observed a key pattern: when `zeros(n) = Z`, and `n` isn't a multiple of 5, then `zeros(n+1)` stays at `Z`. However, if `n` *is* a multiple of 5, `zeros(n+1)` jumps higher. This implies the values of `n` that result in `m` zeroes will often form a consecutive block of 5 numbers: `5k, 5k+1, 5k+2, 5k+3, 5k+4`. Except when `5k` itself is a multiple of higher powers of 5 like 25, 125, etc., the number of trailing zeroes will \"jump\" higher at these values.\n\nThe strategy involves calculating the `zeros(n)` function and then efficiently finding the right `n`s that satisfy `zeros(n) = m`. A binary search seems ideal here since `zeros(n)` is non-decreasing. I will use binary search to locate the smallest `n` for which `zeros(n)` is greater or equal to `m`. Since m is less than or equal to 100000, setting the upper bound for binary search as `5 * m` seems safe; this also provides sufficient time complexity performance.\n\nI'll start with an implementation of `count_zeros(n)` using the Legendre formula. Then I'll use binary search on the range `[1, 5*m]` to find the smallest n (let's call it `n_start`) where `count_zeros(n) >= m`.\n\nA critical check after the binary search will be to see if `count_zeros(n_start)` is precisely `m`. If it's not, it means the value of `m` falls within a gap (like how `zeros(24) = 4`, but `zeros(25) = 6` so there is no `n` to satisfy `m=5`). In that case, there are no solutions, and I'll print \"0\".\n\nIf `count_zeros(n_start) == m`, I have the smallest n. It turns out that this `n_start` will *always* be a multiple of 5. This has to be, because the binary search stops at `n_start`, which is the *smallest* value for which the condition holds. Values less than `n_start` *won't* have `m` zeroes. Values greater than `n_start` will have to have greater than `m` zeroes. Since `zeros(n)` increments only at multiples of 5, `n_start` will be the starting point and `n_start + 4` will be the ending point, with each of those values having `m` zeroes. I know there are always 5 values: `n_start`, `n_start+1`, `n_start+2`, `n_start+3`, `n_start+4`. I can then print \"5\" and list the five values. I will need to output the numbers in sorted order. I can use Python's built-in `print` with the unpacking feature to output the sorted numbers.\n\nI've tested my code with several examples (like `m=1`, `m=5`, and `m=100000`) to confirm that the logic is working. It now looks robust, I'm confident about my Python solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then list them in increasing order.\n\n**1. Counting Trailing Zeroes in n!**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in `n!`, the number of trailing zeroes is equal to the number of factors of 5 in `n!`.\nThis can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`zeros(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThe sum continues as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nLet's define a function `count_zeros(n)` for this.\n\n**2. Properties of `count_zeros(n)`**\n\n- `count_zeros(n)` is a non-decreasing function.\n- `count_zeros(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n  - If `n` is not a multiple of 5, then `count_zeros(n) = count_zeros(n-1)`.\n  - If `n` is a multiple of 5, then `count_zeros(n) > count_zeros(n-1)`.\n\n**3. Finding `n` using Binary Search**\n\nSince `count_zeros(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to efficiently find `n`.\nWe are looking for `n` such that `count_zeros(n) = m`.\n\n- **Search Range for `n`**:\n  - The minimum `n` is 1.\n  - The number of zeroes `m` can be up to 100,000.\n  - `count_zeros(n)` is approximately `n/4` (as `1/5 + 1/25 + ... = (1/5)/(1-1/5) = 1/4`).\n  - So, if `count_zeros(n) = m`, then `n` is roughly `4m`.\n  - For `m = 100,000`, `n` would be around `400,000`. A safe upper bound for binary search can be `5 * m` (which is `500,000` for `m=100,000`).\n\n- **Binary Search Logic**:\n  We perform a binary search to find the *smallest* `n` such that `count_zeros(n) >= m`.\n  - Initialize `low = 1`, `high = 5 * m`.\n  - `ans_n` will store the potential smallest `n`.\n  - In each step:\n    - Calculate `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n    - If `count_zeros(mid) >= m`: `mid` could be our `n`, or a smaller `n` might also satisfy the condition. So, we store `mid` in `ans_n` and try to search in the lower half (`high = mid - 1`).\n    - If `count_zeros(mid) < m`: `mid` is too small, we need a larger `n`. So, we search in the upper half (`low = mid + 1`).\n\n**4. Verifying and Listing Solutions**\n\nAfter the binary search, `ans_n` will hold the smallest `n` such that `count_zeros(n) >= m`.\n\n- **Case 1: No Solution**\n  If `count_zeros(ans_n)` is not exactly `m`, it means `m` is a value that `count_zeros(n)` \"jumps over\". For example, `count_zeros(24) = 4` and `count_zeros(25) = 6`. If `m=5`, our `ans_n` would be 25, but `count_zeros(25)` is 6, not 5. In such a scenario, no `n` exists for the given `m`. We should print `0`.\n\n- **Case 2: Solution Exists**\n  If `count_zeros(ans_n) == m`, then `ans_n` is the smallest positive integer `n` that yields `m` trailing zeroes.\n  Crucially, `ans_n` *must* be a multiple of 5. Why? If `ans_n` were not a multiple of 5, then `count_zeros(ans_n - 1)` would be equal to `count_zeros(ans_n)` (because `n-1` is not a multiple of 5 either, and thus doesn't change the count of factors of 5). But this would contradict `ans_n` being the *smallest* `n` with `m` zeroes.\n  Since `ans_n` is a multiple of 5, `count_zeros(ans_n)` is `m`.\n  The numbers `ans_n + 1, ans_n + 2, ans_n + 3, ans_n + 4` are not multiples of 5, so `count_zeros` for these numbers will also be `m`.\n  However, `ans_n + 5` *is* a multiple of 5, and `count_zeros(ans_n + 5)` will be greater than `m`.\n  Therefore, there are exactly 5 integers `n` that satisfy the condition: `ans_n, ans_n + 1, ans_n + 2, ans_n + 3, ans_n + 4`.\n  We print `5` followed by these 5 integers in increasing order.\n\n**Example: m = 1**\n1. `count_zeros(n)`:\n   - `count_zeros(4) = 0`\n   - `count_zeros(5) = 1`\n   - `count_zeros(9) = 1`\n   - `count_zeros(10) = 2`\n2. Binary search for smallest `n` with `count_zeros(n) >= 1` finds `ans_n = 5`.\n3. `count_zeros(5) == 1`. This matches `m`.\n4. Output `5` and then `5 6 7 8 9`.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\nThe `count_zeros` function runs in `O(log_5 n)` time (number of iterations is `log_5 n`).\nThe binary search performs `O(log(high - low))` iterations. `high` is `5m`, so `O(log m)`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(log m * log_5 (5m))`. Given `m <= 100,000`, this is very efficient. `log_2(500000)` is about 19. `log_5(500000)` is about 8. So roughly `19 * 8` operations, which is very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n! using Legendre's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    # The loop continues as long as n is large enough to contribute\n    # at least one multiple of i (i.e., n // i >= 1).\n    while n >= i:\n        count += n // i\n        # Multiply i by 5 for the next power of 5 (25, 125, etc.)\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m.\n    # The number of zeroes in n! is roughly n/4.
