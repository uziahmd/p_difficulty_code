There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Tennis Championship\" problem and my expert instincts are immediately kicking in. The large input constraint, `n <= 10^18`, screams \"logarithmic or constant-time solution\" at me, or possibly dynamic programming with careful memoization if the state space is manageable, but that's unlikely given the sheer scale. Standard DP's probably not going to cut it.\n\nThe rules are pretty straightforward: knockout tournament, a player's out after a loss, and the pairing constraint – the difference in games played between two players can't exceed one. The core challenge is maximizing the *winner's* games.\n\nI'm thinking, let's trace this out. Start with a winner who has played `k` games. That winner always starts at zero, of course. For game one, they play someone else at zero games. The constraint is met. Good. As they rack up games, the constraint of the difference in games played by both players being at most one is key to their continued play.\n\nNow, how do we maximize this? I'm picturing a function, `f(k)`, that represents the *minimum* number of players required for a player to win `k` games. Let's see...\n\n*   `f(1)` is easy. Two players, one game. `f(1) = 2`.\n*   `f(2)` is where it gets interesting. I can see two main scenarios.\n    *   Either a 3-player situation: P1 vs P2, then P1 vs P3.\n    *   Or, the 4-player situation: P1 vs P2, then P3 vs P4 and P1 vs P3 or P4.\n\nSince we want to maximize the games for a fixed `N` (number of players), minimizing the number of players needed for a specific `k` is the right strategy. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just about finding the absolute minimum players for `k` games; it's about the *maximum* games a winner can play *given* `N`. I need to figure out how `N` constrains the maximum `k`. I bet there's a pattern, maybe Fibonacci-esque, related to how quickly players are eliminated or how games are accumulated. Okay, time to start exploring that pattern.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the tournament winner can play, given `n` players and a specific rule for pairing: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games a player has won so far.\nA player starts with `k=0` games.\n\nTo maximize the winner's games, we want to construct a tournament structure where the winner always finds an eligible opponent. The pairing rule `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1` is crucial.\n\nConsider the number of players required to produce a winner who has played `x` games.\nLet `P(x)` be the minimum number of players needed to produce a winner who has played `x` games.\n\n*   **x = 0:** A player who hasn't played any game. This doesn't make sense for a winner.\n*   **x = 1:** The winner plays 1 game. This requires 2 players (P1 vs P2). P1 wins. `P(1) = 2`.\n*   **x = 2:** The winner plays 2 games.\n    *   P1 (0 games) vs P2 (0 games). P1 wins (1 game).\n    *   Now P1 has 1 game. P1 can play against:\n        *   A new player P3 (0 games): `abs(1-0)=1`. P1 wins (2 games). Total players: 3.\n        *   A winner of another match, say P3 (1 game): `abs(1-1)=0`. This requires P3 to have played a match (P3 vs P4). Total players: 4.\n    To minimize players for `x` games, we always prefer the option that uses fewer new players. So, for `x=2`, we can have P1 beat P2, then P1 beat P3. Total 3 players. `P(2) = 3`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the structure. To achieve `x` wins, the final winner must beat an opponent. This opponent must have `x-1` or `x-2` wins (to satisfy `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1`). To minimize players, we want the opponent to have `x-1` wins.\nSo, to play `x` games, the winner (W) must have beaten an opponent (O) who had `x-1` games.\nFor W to have `x` games, they must have played `x-1` games, and then beat O.\nFor O to have `x-1` games, they must have played `x-2` games, and then beat some other player.\n\nThis structure looks like Fibonacci numbers.\nLet `F(k)` be the minimum number of players required to have a player win `k` games, where `F(0)=1` (a player who hasn't played yet) and `F(1)=2` (a player who wins one game).\nTo win `k` games, the winner must have played `k-1` games and then beat an opponent.\nAccording to the rule, this opponent could have played `k-1` or `k-2` games.\nTo minimize the total number of players, we want to bring together two \"sub-tournaments\" that produce winners with `k-1` and `k-2` games respectively.\nThe winner of the `k-1` game sub-tournament (W_k-1) has `k-1` wins.\nThe winner of the `k-2` game sub-tournament (W_k-2) has `k-2` wins.\nThey can play against each other because `abs((k-1) - (k-2)) = 1`.\nIf W_k-1 wins this match, they will have `(k-1) + 1 = k` wins.\nThe total number of players needed for this scenario is `F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\nBase cases:\n`F(0) = 1` (A single player who hasn't played yet)\n`F(1) = 2` (Two players required for one game, one winner)\n\nLet's list the values:\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2`\n`F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n`F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n`F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\n`F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`\n...\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...` is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically, `F(k)` here corresponds to `fib(k+2)` if `fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1`. Or, if we define `fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1`, then `F(k)` here is `fib(k+2)`. A more common definition `fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, fib(4)=3, fib(5)=5, ...`, then `F(k)` here is `fib(k+3)`. Let's use `fib_sequence[0]=1, fib_sequence[1]=2, ...`.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can play given `n` players. This means we need to find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need an efficient way to find `k`. We can generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until we find one that exceeds `n`.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # F[k] = minimum players needed for a winner to play k games\n    # F[0] = 1 (a player who hasn't played)\n    # F[1] = 2 (player wins 1 game, needs 2 initial players)\n    # F[k] = F[k-1] + F[k-2] for k >= 2\n\n    # We need to find the largest k such that F[k] <= n.\n    # Let's track the current Fibonacci numbers.\n    # a represents F[k-2] (or F[i-2] in loop)\n    # b represents F[k-1] (or F[i-1] in loop)\n    # c represents F[k] (or F[i] in loop)\n\n    a = 1  # Corresponds to F[0]\n    b = 2  # Corresponds to F[1]\n    \n    # max_games will store the 'k' value.\n    # If n=2, max_games=1.\n    # If n=3, max_games=2 (F[2]=3).\n    # If n=4, max_games=2 (F[2]=3).\n    # If n=5, max_games=3 (F[3]=5).\n    max_games = 1 \n\n    # We start checking from k=2\n    # The loop condition is `c <= n`.
