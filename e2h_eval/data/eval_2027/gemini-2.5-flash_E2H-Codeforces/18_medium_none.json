The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Let's tackle this \"Frog Jumping\" problem.** My initial thought is to devise a Python script. Breaking it down, we have a frog hopping around, starting at zero. It can jump forward by *a* or backward by *b*, where *a* and *b* are positive integers. The real crux is this *f(x)* function, which tells us how many unique positions the frog can reach without ever going outside the bounds of zero to *x*. This *[0, x]* constraint means that any jump that lands the frog outside these bounds is off-limits.\n\nThinking about *f(x)* more deeply, it seems a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) would be a good approach to identify the reachable points within the given range. Imagine a set, *R<sub>x</sub>*, holding all the numbers the frog can land on. Zero is always in it. If we can reach a spot, *k*, and a forward jump (k+a) or backward jump (k-b) keeps us inside the bounds, then those jumps open up new reachable spots. The definition boils down to *p* being reachable if *p* is a combination of *a* jumps and *b* jumps, all staying within the *[0, x]* boundary during the process.\n\nThe crucial \"don't leave the interval\" condition makes *f(x)* non-decreasing as *x* grows. As we increase *x*, we simply add more possible spots that the frog might be able to reach. Conceptually, it's like a connected component in a graph where nodes are numbers from 0 to *x*, and edges represent the possible jumps.\n\nNow, let's explore the structure of reachable points more. We realize that any point reachable is always related to the greatest common divisor, *g*, of *a* and *b*. If *g* is greater than 1, only multiples of *g* can be reached. This means we can normalize the problem by dividing *a*, *b*, and *x* by *g*.\n\nHowever, the problem statement focuses on \"distinct integers,\" so we must remember to account for that. Let's keep the original *a* and *b*. If *k* is reachable, *k* must be some combination of *a* and *b*, thus be a multiple of *g*. But, the constraint *[0, x]* complicates the situation. A dynamic programming approach may be helpful. We can consider `dp[k]` as the minimum number of `+a` jumps needed to reach `k`. The constraint `[0, x]` makes the structure of reachable points different for each *x*.\n\nAs we analyze further, the reachable points form a segment of multiples of *g*. The crucial element is the BFS-like process to build up the reachable set for a given *x*. We'll keep adding values to the set if reachable through adding or subtracting *a* and *b*, but if the intermediate point is outside *[0,x]*, we don't. This BFS method might be too slow for extremely large values.\n\nHere's the issue: we're dealing with values up to 10^9. While *a* and *b* are small (10^5), the *x* values are vast. The *f(x)* function probably exhibits a regular or linear behavior when *x* is very big. Let's try simplifying by assuming *a* and *b* are co-prime, and divide the values by *g*. But no matter how we twist it, the size of *x* is a problem. The standard shortest-path BFS or DFS can not solve this for large values of *x*.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `S = sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0` by jumping `+a` or `-b`, provided all intermediate positions remain within `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable positions must be multiples of `g`.\nLet `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`. If a frog can reach `p` within `[0, x]` using jumps `+a, -b`, then `p` must be a multiple of `g`. Let `p = p'g`. The path `0=p_0, p_1, ..., p_k=p` with `0 <= p_j <= x` becomes `0=p'_0 g, p'_1 g, ..., p'_k g = p'g` with `0 <= p'_j g <= x`. This is equivalent to `0=p'_0, p'_1, ..., p'_k = p'` with `0 <= p'_j <= floor(x/g)` using jumps `+a', -b'`.\nTherefore, `f(x)` for `(m, a, b)` is equal to `f(floor(x/g))` for `(floor(m/g), a/g, b/g)`.\nWe can normalize `a, b` by dividing by `g`, and `m` by dividing by `g`. The final sum `S` will be the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `floor(m/g)` using `a/g, b/g`. Let's assume `gcd(a, b) = 1` from now on.\n\nLet `min_max_path_val[p]` be the smallest `X` such that `p` is reachable from `0` with all intermediate positions in `[0, X]`.\nIf `p` is not reachable (even with `X` arbitrarily large), `min_max_path_val[p]` is infinity.\n`f(x)` is the count of `p` such that `min_max_path_val[p] <= x`.\nThe maximum value `p` can take is `m`. But `m` can be `10^9`, so `min_max_path_val` array cannot be that large.\nHowever, `a, b <= 10^5`. Let `L = a + b`.\nThe `min_max_path_val` values can be computed using a Dijkstra-like algorithm.\nInitialize `min_max_path_val[0] = 0` and all other `min_max_path_val[p] = infinity`.\nUse a priority queue `pq` storing `(max_val, current_pos)`. Start with `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\nWhen extracting `(current_max_val, u)` from `pq`:\n1. If `u + a` is a valid jump:\n   Let `v = u + a`. `new_max_val = max(current_max_val, v)`.\n   If `new_max_val < min_max_path_val[v]`: update `min_max_path_val[v] = new_max_val` and push `(new_max_val, v)` to `pq`.\n2. If `u - b` is a valid jump:\n   Let `v = u - b`. `new_max_val = max(current_max_val, u)`. (Since `v < u`, `u` is the maximum unless `v` goes below 0, which is handled by `v >= 0`).\n   If `new_max_val < min_max_path_val[v]`: update `min_max_path_val[v] = new_max_val` and push `(new_max_val, v)` to `pq`.\n\nThis Dijkstra computes `min_max_path_val[p]` for all `p` up to the maximum `p` that can be reached. What is this maximum `p`?\nSince `gcd(a,b)=1`, any sufficiently large integer `p` can be written as `k_1 a - k_2 b`.\nSpecifically, any integer `p >= (a-1)(b-1)` can be written as `k_1 a + k_2 b`.\nFor `k_1 a - k_2 b`, if `p >= b`, we can always make a `-b` jump to `p-b`. If `p-b` is reachable, then `p-b+a` is reachable (if `p-b+a` is not too large).\nThe crucial observation is that for `p` large enough, `min_max_path_val[p+g]` might be related to `min_max_path_val[p] + g`.\nMore generally, for `p >= C_0 = max(a,b) * 2` (or some other constant related to `a,b`), if `p` is reachable, then `p+g` is also reachable with `min_max_path_val[p+g] = min_max_path_val[p] + g`.\nA tighter bound for `C_0` is `a+b`. For `p >= a+b`, `min_max_path_val[p]` becomes `p`.\nThis is because if `p >= b` and `p` is reachable, then `p-b` is reachable. If `p-b` is reachable, then `p-b+a` is reachable.\nIf `p >= b` and `min_max_path_val[p] = p`, then `p-b` is reachable with `min_max_path_val[p-b] <= p`.\nIf `p-b+a >= 0` and `p-b+a <= p+a`, then `p-b+a` is reachable with `min_max_path_val[p-b+a] <= max(p, p-b+a)`.\nIf `min_max_path_val[k] = k` for all `k` in `[0, p]`, then `min_max_path_val[p+a] = p+a`.\nThe point where `min_max_path_val[p] = p` for all `p` beyond it is often around `a+b`.\nLet's compute `min_max_path_val[p]` for `p` up to `2 * max(a, b)`. Let `MAX_P_CALC = 2 * max(a, b)`.\nThe Dijkstra will run on `MAX_P_CALC` states. This is `2 * 10^5`.\n`O(MAX_P_CALC * log(MAX_P_CALC))` time complexity.\n\nAfter computing `min_max_path_val[p]` for `p` up to `MAX_P_CALC`:\nWe need to sum `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.\n`f(i)` is the count of `p` such that `min_max_path_val[p] <= i`.\nLet `vals = sorted([v for v in min_max_path_val if v != infinity])`.\n`f(i)` is the count of elements in `vals` that are `<= i`.\nThis is equivalent to `bisect_right(vals, i)`.\n\nThe sum `sum(f(i) for i in range(m+1))` can be broken into two parts:\n1. For `i` from `0` to `MAX_P_CALC`:\n   Calculate `f(i)` using the `min_max_path_val` array.\n   `f(i)` is the number of `p` such that `min_max_path_val[p] <= i`.\n   We can precompute `f(i)` for `i` up to `MAX_P_CALC`.\n   Let `count_le_i[k]` be the number of `p` such that `min_max_path_val[p] = k`.\n   `f(i) = sum(count_le_i[k] for k <= i)`.\n   This is `prefix_sum(count_le_i)`.\n   The sum for this part is `sum(f(i) for i in range(MAX_P_CALC + 1))`.\n\n2. For `i` from `MAX_P_CALC + 1` to `m`:\n   For `p > MAX_P_CALC`, if `p` is reachable, then `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\n   This is because if `p >= b`, `p-b` is reachable. And if `p-b` is reachable, `p-b+a` is reachable.\n   If `min_max_path_val[k] = k` for all `k < p` (and `k` reachable), then for `p` to be reachable, it must come from `p-a` or `p+b`.\n   If `p-a` is reachable, then `min_max_path_val[p] = max(min_max_path_val[p-a], p) = max(p-a, p) = p`.\n   If `p+b` leads to `p`, this path would be `... -> p+b -> p`. `min_max_path_val[p]` would be `max(min_max_path_val[p+b], p+b)`.\n   The crucial part is that for `p >= a+b` (or some similar bound), if `p` is reachable, then `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\n   Let `K_0` be the smallest integer such that for all `p >= K_0` where `p` is reachable, `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\n   `K_0` is typically `max(a, b)` or `a+b`.\n   For `i > K_0`, `f(i)` will be `f(K_0)` plus the count of reachable `p` in `(K_0, i]` such that `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\n   Since `gcd(a, b) = 1`, all integers `p >= K_0` are reachable (if `K_0` is large enough, e.g., `(a-1)(b-1)`).\n   So for `i` large enough (e.g., `i >= (a-1)(b-1)`), `f(i)` becomes `i+1`.\n   Let `K_f` be the smallest integer such that `min_max_path_val[p] = p` for all `p >= K_f`.\n   The `min_max_path_val` array will contain values up to `MAX_P_CALC`.\n   Let `max_p_with_special_val` be the maximum `p` such that `min_max_path_val[p] != p`.\n   Let `max_val_in_table = max(p for p in range(MAX_P_CALC + 1) if min_max_path_val[p] != infinity)`.\n   For `i > max_val_in_table`, `f(i)` will be `max_val_in_table + 1`. This is only true if all `p <= max_val_in_table` are reachable.\n   If `gcd(a,b)=1`, then for `p >= (a-1)(b-1)`, `p` is reachable.\n   The value `(a-1)(b-1)` can be up to `10^{10}`. This is too large.\n\nThe key must be that `min_max_path_val[p] = p` for `p` beyond a certain threshold.\nThe threshold is around `a+b`. For `p >= a+b`, `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\nLet's verify this. If `p >= a+b`, then `p-b >= a`. If `p-b` is reachable, then `p-b+a` is reachable.\nIf `min_max_path_val[k] = k` for all `k < p` (and `k` reachable), then consider `p`.\nIf `p` is reachable via `p-a`, then `min_max_path_val[p] = max(min_max_path_val[p-a], p) = max(p-a, p) = p`.\nIf `p` is reachable via `p+b`, then `min_max_path_val[p] = max(min_max_path_val[p+b], p+b)`. This is not `p`.\nHowever, `min_max_path_val[p]` represents the smallest `X` such that `p` is reachable within `[0, X]`.\nIf `p` is reachable, it means there is a path `0=p_0, ..., p_k=p` with `0 <= p_j <= min_max_path_val[p]`.\nIf `p >= a+b`, then `p-a >= b`.\nIf `p` is reachable, then `p-b` is reachable (if `p-b >= 0`). `min_max_path_val[p-b] <= min_max_path_val[p]`.\nIf `p >= a+b`, then `p-b >= a`.\nThen `p-b` is reachable, and `p-b+a` is reachable. `p-b+a = p+(a-b)`.\nThis argument is tricky.\n\nLet `max_val = max(a, b)`.\nThe Dijkstra should run up to `max_val + b` (or `max_val + a`).\nLet `MAX_P = max(a, b) + a + b`. This is a safe upper bound for `p` where `min_max_path_val[p]` might not be `p`.\nSo, the Dijkstra runs for `p` up to `MAX_P`. `MAX_P` is about `3 * 10^5`.\n`min_max_path_val` array size `MAX_P`.\nAfter `p > MAX_P`, if `p` is reachable, then `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\nThis is because if `p >= MAX_P`, then `p-b` is a large positive number. Any path to `p` that goes through `p-b` would have `min_max_path_val[p] = max(min_max_path_val[p-b], p)`.\nIf `p-b` is large enough such that `min_max_path_val[p-b] = p-b`, then `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\nWe need to find a `K_0` such that for all `p >= K_0`, if `p` is reachable, then `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\nThis `K_0` is `max(a, b)`. If `p >= max(a,b)`, then `p-b >= 0` and `p-a >= 0`.\nIf `p >= max(a,b)`, and `p` is reachable, then it must be reachable from `p-a` or `p+b`.\nIf `p` is reachable from `p-a`, then `min_max_path_val[p] = max(min_max_path_val[p-a], p)`.\nIf `p-a >= max(a,b)` and `min_max_path_val[p-a] = p-a`, then `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\nBy induction, `min_max_path_val[p] = p` for `p >= max(a,b)`.\nSo we can run Dijkstra up to `p = max(a,b)`. Let `K = max(a,b)`.\nThe `min_max_path_val` array will be of size `K+1`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a,b)`.\n`a_norm = a // g`, `b_norm = b // g`.\n`m_norm = m // g`.\n`K = max(a_norm, b_norm)`.\nRun Dijkstra up to `K`. `dist[p]` stores `min_max_path_val[p]`.\n`dist` array size `K+1`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`, `dist[0] = 0`, others `inf`.\nWhen `(d, u)` is popped:\n  If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n  `v1 = u + a_norm`. If `v1 <= K`:\n    `nd1 = max(d, v1)`. If `nd1 < dist[v1]`, `dist[v1] = nd1`, `pq.push((nd1, v1))`.\n  `v2 = u - b_norm`. If `v2 >= 0`:\n    `nd2 = max(d, u)`. If `nd2 < dist[v2]`, `dist[v2] = nd2`, `pq.push((nd2, v2))`.\n  \nAfter Dijkstra, `dist[p]` contains `min_max_path_val[p]` for `p` up to `K`.\nFor `p > K`, `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\n\nNow we need to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m_norm + 1))`.\n`f(i)` is the count of `p` such that `min_max_path_val[p] <= i`.\nLet `values = sorted([v for v in dist if v != float('inf')])`. These are the `min_max_path_val[p]` for `p <= K`.\n`f(i)` for `i <= K`: `f(i) = bisect_right(values, i)`.\n`total_sum = 0`.\n`for i in range(min(m_norm, K) + 1):`\n  `total_sum += bisect_right(values, i)`\n\nFor `i > K`:\n  `f(i)` = (count of `p <= K` with `min_max_path_val[p] <= i`) + (count of `p > K` with `min_max_path_val[p] <= i`).\n  The first part is `bisect_right(values, i)`. Since `i > K >= max(values)`, this will be `len(values)`.\n  The second part: for `p > K`, `min_max_path_val[p] = p`. So we need to count `p` such that `K < p <= i`. This count is `i - K`.\n  So for `i > K`, `f(i) = len(values) + (i - K)`.\n  This formula holds as long as `p` up to `i` are reachable. Since `gcd(a_norm, b_norm)=1`, all `p >= (a_norm-1)(b_norm-1)` are reachable.\n  The condition `min_max_path_val[p] = p` for `p > K` means that any `p > K` is reachable and its `min_max_path_val` is `p`.\n  So `f(i) = len(values) + (i - K)` for `i > K`.\n  \n  `num_items_in_values = len(values)`.\n  `if m_norm > K:`\n    `# Sum f(i) for i from K+1 to m_norm`\n    `# f(i) = num_items_in_values + (i - K)`\n    `# Sum = sum_{i=K+1}^{m_norm} (num_items_in_values + i - K)`\n    `# Let j = i - K. Sum = sum_{j=1}^{m_norm-K} (num_items_in_values + j)`\n    `count_terms = m_norm - K`\n    `sum_constant_part = count_terms * num_items_in_values`\n    `sum_arith_part = (count_terms * (count_terms + 1)) // 2`\n    `total_sum += sum_constant_part + sum_arith_part`\n\nFinal check on `K = max(a_norm, b_norm)`:\nIf `a_norm=1, b_norm=1`, `K=1`. `dist[0]=0, dist[1]=1`. `values=[0,1]`. `len(values)=2`.\n`f(0)=1`. `f(1)=2`.\nFor `i > 1`, `f(i) = 2 + (i-1) = i+1`.\n`sum_{i=0}^m f(i) = f(0) + sum_{i=1}^m (i+1) = 1 + sum_{j=2}^{m+1} j = sum_{j=1}^{m+1} j = (m+1)(m+2)/2`.\nThis matches example 2: `m=10^9, a=1, b=2019`. `g=1`. `a_norm=1, b_norm=2019`. `K=2019`.\nFor `i <= 2019`, `f(i) = i+1`. (e.g., `f(0)=1, f(1)=2, ..., f(2019)=2020`).\nFor `i > 2019`, `f(i) = len(values) + (i - K)`.

So `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` are all reachable. `f(7)=8`).\nMy `f(6)` and `f(7)` values are wrong.\nThe problem is `K=max(a_norm, b_norm)` is not always the point where `min_max_path_val[p] = p` for all `p` beyond it.\nThe actual threshold `K_0` can be larger.\nThe maximum value `p` can reach is `m`. The maximum `min_max_path_val[p]` can be `m`.\nThe `dist` array should go up to `m` if `m` is small, or up to `a+b` or `a*b` for larger `m`.\nThe number of states in Dijkstra should be `a+b`.\nLet `MAX_DIST_CALC = a_norm + b_norm`.\nRun Dijkstra up to `MAX_DIST_CALC`.\n`dist` array size `MAX_DIST_CALC + 1`.\nExample 1: `a_norm=5, b_norm=3`. `MAX_DIST_CALC = 5+3 = 8`.\nDijkstra for `p` up to `8`:\n`dist = [inf] * 9`. `dist[0] = 0`. `pq = [(0,0)]`.\n1.

Skip.\n`dist` array: `[0, 7, 5, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8]` (for indices `0` to `8`).\n`values = sorted([0, 7, 5, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8]) = [0, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8]`. `len(values) = 9`.\n\nSum for `i` from `0` to `min(m_norm, MAX_DIST_CALC) = min(7,8) = 7`.\n`i=0: f(0) = bisect_right(values, 0) = 1`. `total_sum = 1`.\n`i=1: f(1) = bisect_right(values, 1) = 1`. `total_sum = 2`.\n`i=2: f(2) = bisect_right(values, 2) = 1`. `total_sum = 3`.\n`i=3: f(3) = bisect_right(values, 3) = 1`. `total_sum = 4`.\n`i=4: f(4) = bisect_right(values, 4) = 1`. `total_sum = 5`.\n`i=5: f(5) = bisect_right(values, 5) = 3`. `total_sum = 8`.\n`i=6: f(6) = bisect_right(values, 6) = 3`. `total_sum = 11`.\n`i=7: f(7) = bisect_right(values, 7) = 8`. `total_sum = 19`.\nThis matches the example output!\n\nThe threshold for `min_max_path_val[p] = p` is `max(a_norm, b_norm)`.\nBut for `p` to be reachable, it needs to be `p >= (a_norm-1)(b_norm-1)`.\nThe `min_max_path_val[p]` values for `p` up to `max(a_norm, b_norm) + a_norm + b_norm` seems to be the correct range for Dijkstra.\nLet `MAX_P_DIJKSTRA = a_norm + b_norm`.\nFor `p > MAX_P_DIJKSTRA`, if `p` is reachable, then `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\nThis is because `p-a_norm >= b_norm` and `p-b_norm >= a_norm` for `p` large enough.\nThe set of reachable points for `p > MAX_P_DIJKSTRA` is `[MAX_P_DIJKSTRA+1, m_norm]`. This is because `gcd(a_norm, b_norm)=1`.\nSo the logic for `i > MAX_P_DIJKSTRA` should be:\n`f(i) = len(values) + (i - MAX_P_DIJKSTRA)` if all points in `[0, MAX_P_DIJKSTRA]` are reachable.\nIf some `p <= MAX_P_DIJKSTRA` is not reachable (i.e., `dist[p] == inf`), then `len(values)` is the count of reachable points up to `MAX_P_DIJKSTRA`.\nAnd for `p` from `MAX_P_DIJKSTRA+1` to `i`, all points are reachable, and `min_max_path_val[p] = p`.\nSo the formula `f(i) = len(values) + (i - MAX_P_DIJKSTRA)` is correct for `i > MAX_P_DIJKSTRA`.\n\nThe maximum value of `a_norm + b_norm` is `2 * 10^5`. Dijkstra is efficient enough.\nThe total sum calculation is also efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_norm = a // g\n    b_norm = b // g\n    m_norm = m // g\n\n    # MAX_P_DIJKSTRA defines the upper bound for p for which we explicitly compute min_max_path_val[p]\n    # For p > MAX_P_DIJKSTRA, if p is reachable, min_max_path_val[p] = p.\n    # A safe upper bound for this transition point is a_norm + b_norm.\n    MAX_P_DIJKSTRA = a_norm + b_norm \n    \n    # If m_norm is smaller than MAX_P_DIJKSTRA, we only need to compute up to m_norm.\n    limit_p = min(m_norm, MAX_P_DIJKSTRA)\n\n    # dist[p] stores the minimum X such that p is reachable within [0, X]\n    dist = [float('inf')] * (limit_p + 1)\n    dist[0] = 0\n\n    pq = [(0, 0)] # (min_max_val_on_path, current_pos)\n\n    while pq:\n        d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        if d > dist[u]:\n            continue\n\n        # Try jumping +a_norm\n        v1 = u + a_norm\n        if v1 <= limit_p:\n            nd1 = max(d, v1)\n            if nd1 < dist[v1]:\n                dist[v1] = nd1\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (nd1, v1))\n        # If v1 > limit_p, it means p > limit_p.
