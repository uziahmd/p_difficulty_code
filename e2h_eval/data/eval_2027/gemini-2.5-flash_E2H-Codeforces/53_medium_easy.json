Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My approach to this problem is quite straightforward.** Given a string of lowercase letters, and knowing its length is at most 100, a brute-force approach seems feasible. I'll iterate through possible substring lengths, starting with the longest possible and working down to 1. For each length, I'll examine every possible starting position within the string. Then, I'll use Python's built-in `str.find()` method to efficiently check if that substring appears elsewhere in the string, starting after its first occurrence (to allow overlapping matches). If a repeating substring is found, I'll return its length immediately because, having started with the largest length, it's guaranteed to be the longest repeating substring. If no such substring is found after checking all lengths, I'll return 0, indicating that no substring repeats. I considered possible time complexities. For a string length n, nested loops and `str.find()` within them would lead to O(n^3) or potentially O(n^4), but given the small input size, this is likely acceptable. This direct approach offers a clear and reasonably performant solution for this \"easy\" problem. I took special note about the overlapping, thus started to find substrings from after the first appearance.\n",
