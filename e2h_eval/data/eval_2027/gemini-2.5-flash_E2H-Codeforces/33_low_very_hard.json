You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for \"Replacing Digits\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The input is a number `a` as a string, and a pool of digits `s`, also as a string. The goal is to maximize the value of `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from `s`, with each digit from `s` usable only once. I can only replace each position in `a` once. Sounds like a classic greedy approach is in order.\n\nTo maximize the number, the most significant digits need to be as large as possible. That means I need to iterate through `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I need to find the largest digit in `s` that's bigger than the current digit in `a`, if such a digit exists and it hasn't already been used.\n\nMy plan:\n\n1.  **Input:** Read `a` and `s` as strings.\n2.  **Conversion:** Convert `a` into a list of characters for in-place modifications.\n3.  **Digit Frequency:**  This is key for efficiency. I'll create a frequency array `s_counts` of size 10 to store the count of each digit from 0 to 9 in `s`. This avoids repeatedly searching through `s`.\n4.  **Iteration and Replacement:**  I'll iterate through each digit of `a` from left to right. For each digit `a[i]`:\n    *   I'll convert `a[i]` to an integer and store it as `current_a_digit`.\n    *   Then, I'll search from 9 down to `current_a_digit + 1` for the largest possible digit `d`.\n        *   If `s_counts[d]` is greater than zero, I can use this digit.\n        *   I replace `a[i]` with the string representation of `d`.\n        *   I decrement `s_counts[d]` because I've used this digit.\n        *   I break out of the inner loop since I've found the best replacement.\n5.  **Output:** Finally, I'll join the modified character list back into a string and return it.\n\nUsing the frequency count array will speed things up significantly, especially when `s` is large. I like this approach; it's clean, efficient, and leverages the problem's inherent greedy nature. I'm ready to write the code.\n",
