There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out. We need to find the maximum number of games a single player can win in a knockout tennis tournament, given a certain number of participants (`n`).  The key rule is that players can only play each other if the difference in games they've already won is at most one. The winner must win all their games.  \n\nThe core of this problem is about the *minimum* number of players required for a winner to reach a certain number of wins (`k`). I realize that this minimum number of players follows a Fibonacci-like pattern.  \n\nLet me explain the reasoning:\n\n*   **Base Cases:** For the winner to play one game (k=1), we need two players: the winner and an opponent. For two games (k=2), the winner defeats one opponent with zero games and a second opponent with either zero or one game won. That means we need three players.\n*   **Fibonacci Recurrence:**  To extend the number of games the winner plays, the winner needs to always maximize their opponents. Each game, the winner could play against an opponent whose number of wins is either one less or the same as the winner. This helps minimize the growth of players. If the winner has won *k* games, to play game *k+1*, they can play an opponent who has won *k* or *k-1* games. The minimum number of players arises when we choose *k-1* games won if available, because this creates the least new \"dependencies\". The total players needed to have the *k* wins are then the number of players needed for the *k-1* wins and *k-2* wins, so `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)`.  \n*   **Fibonacci Connection:** This number of players, `f(k)`, starts to become the Fibonacci sequence. The minimum players required to get *k* wins is, actually, the (k+2)th Fibonacci number (where F_0 = 0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2...).\n\nSo, the plan is to:\n\n1.  Calculate Fibonacci numbers until we find one that's greater than `n` (the total number of players).\n2.  The index of that Fibonacci number, minus 2, is the maximum number of games the winner can possibly take part in.\n\nWith this, I am now confident to code a Python solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` players and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to allow a specific player (the eventual winner) to play `k` games according to the rules.\n\nLet's deduce the values of `f(k)`:\n- `f(0)`: A player who has played 0 games. This requires 1 player (the player themselves). So, `f(0) = 1`.\n- `f(1)`: A player needs to win 1 game. This player (0 games won) plays against an opponent (0 games won). The winner plays 1 game. This requires 2 players in total. So, `f(1) = 2`.\n- `f(2)`: A player needs to win 2 games.\n    - Game 1: Winner (0 games) vs Opponent1 (0 games). Winner wins. Winner has 1 game won.\n    - Game 2: Winner (1 game) vs Opponent2. According to the rule, Opponent2 must have played either 0 games or 1 game.\n        - To minimize total players, the winner should play against an opponent who required fewer players to reach their current state. An opponent with 0 games won requires only 1 player. An opponent with 1 game won requires 2 players (that opponent and their first opponent).\n        - So, Winner (1 game) plays Opponent2 (0 games). Winner wins. Winner has 2 games won.\n    - Total players: Winner + Opponent1 + Opponent2 = 3 players. So, `f(2) = 3`.\n\nNow, let's establish a recurrence for `f(k)`. Suppose a player `P` has won `k-1` games and is about to play their `k`-th game. Their opponent `O` must have won either `k-1` games or `k-2` games.\nTo minimize the total number of players for `P` to win `k` games:\n1. `P` (with `k-1` wins) plays against `O` (with `k-1` wins).\n   - `P`'s path to `k-1` wins requires `f(k-1)` players.\n   - `O`'s path to `k-1` wins also requires `f(k-1)` players.\n   - Since `P` and `O` are distinct, their paths must involve distinct sets of players (except for `P` and `O` themselves). The total players would be `f(k-1) + (f(k-1) - 1)` if we consider `O`'s path to be a sub-tournament, or simpler `2 * f(k-1)` if we consider two independent structures that merge.\n2. `P` (with `k-1` wins) plays against `O` (with `k-2` wins).\n   - `P`'s path to `k-1` wins requires `f(k-1)` players.\n   - `O`'s path to `k-2` wins requires `f(k-2)` players.\n   - The total players would be `f(k-1) + f(k-2)`.\n\nTo minimize `f(k)`, we choose the option that requires fewer players. Since `f(k-2)` is always less than `f(k-1)` (for `k >= 2`), `f(k-1) + f(k-2)` will always be less than `2 * f(k-1)`.\nTherefore, the recurrence relation is `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence!\nLet's list `f(k)` values:\n- `f(0) = 1`\n- `f(1) = 2`\n- `f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n- `f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n- `f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\nAnd so on.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\nWe need to find the largest `k` for which the minimum number of players required, `f(k)`, does not exceed the given `n`.\n\nSince `n` can be as large as `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large numbers naturally. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so the number of iterations will be small (around 90 for `10^18`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `f(0)`) and `b = 2` (representing `f(1)`).\n2. Initialize `k_val = 1` (representing that `b` is the number of players needed for 1 game).\n3. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `next_f = a + b`.\n   b. Update `a` to `b` (the previous `f(k)` value).\n   c. Update `b` to `next_f` (the current `f(k+1)` value).\n   d. Increment `k_val` (since `b` now represents `f(k_val)`).\n4. When the loop terminates, `b` is `f(k_val)` and `b > n`. This means `k_val` games are not possible with `n` players. The maximum number of games possible is `k_val - 1`.\n5. Print `k_val - 1`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4):**\n- `n = 4`\n- `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `k_val = 1`\n\n1. **Loop 1:** `b (2) <= n (4)` is true.\n   - `next_f = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3`\n   - `a = b = 2`\n   - `b = next_f = 3`\n   - `k_val = 1 + 1 = 2`\n   (Now `a=f(1)=2`, `b=f(2)=3`, `k_val=2`. This means 2 games are possible with 3 players.)\n\n2. **Loop 2:** `b (3) <= n (4)` is true.\n   - `next_f = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5`\n   - `a = b = 3`\n   - `b = next_f = 5`\n   - `k_val = 2 + 1 = 3`\n   (Now `a=f(2)=3`, `b=f(3)=5`, `k_val=3`. This means 3 games are possible with 5 players.)\n\n3. **Loop 3:** `b (5) <= n (4)` is false. Loop terminates.\n\n- Print `k_val - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.\nThis matches the example output for `n=4`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # f(k) represents the minimum number of players required for the winner\n    # to play k games according to the rules.\n    # f(0) = 1 (the winner themselves)\n    # f(1) = 2 (winner + 1 opponent)\n    # f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) for k >= 2.\n    # This is a Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...\n\n    # We want to find the maximum k such that f(k) <= n.\n\n    # Initialize a and b to represent consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\n    # Let 'a' be f(current_k - 1) and 'b' be f(current_k).\n    # Initially, we consider k=1.\n    # f(0) = 1\n    # f(1) = 2\n    a = 1  # Represents f(k_val - 1)\n    b = 2  # Represents f(k_val)\n    \n    k_val = 1 # 'b' (which is f(k_val)) is the number of players needed for k_val games.\n\n    # Loop as long as the current number of players required (b) does not exceed n.\n    while b <= n:\n        # If 'b' players are sufficient for 'k_val' games,\n        # we can potentially play 'k_val + 1' games.\n        # Calculate the number of players needed for 'k_val + 1' games (next Fibonacci number).\n        \n        temp = b\n        b = a + b # 'b' now becomes f(k_val + 1)\n        a = temp  # 'a' now becomes f(k_val)\n        \n        k_val += 1 # 'k_val' is incremented to correspond to the new 'b'\n        \n    # The loop terminates when 'b' > n.\n    # At this point, 'b' corresponds to f(k_val), which means 'k_val' games\n    # are NOT possible with 'n' players.\n    # The maximum number of games possible was for the previous 'k_val', which is 'k_val - 1'.\n    print(k_val - 1)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
