Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for X-Shaped Grid Validation**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to determine if a given *n x n* grid of characters forms a valid 'X' shape, following a set of strict rules. Let me break this down step-by-step.\n\nFirstly, the rules: all characters along both diagonals must be identical, and all other characters (those *not* on the diagonals) must be the same single character, and importantly, different from the diagonal character.  Also, *n* is odd and lies between 3 and 300, which simplifies a few things.\n\nMy strategy involves reading the grid into a 2D structure, like a list of lists. Then, I need to define a way to identify the elements that lie on the main and anti-diagonals.  Easy enough: for the main diagonal, it's where the row index *i* equals the column index *j*; and for the anti-diagonal, it's where *i + j = n - 1*.\n\nNext, I need to initialize two variables: `diag_char` and `other_char`. I'll use the first character on the main diagonal, `grid[0][0]`, as my initial guess for `diag_char`. Then, I'll pick a character that's definitely *not* on a diagonal, like `grid[0][1]`, and that will be my `other_char`. Crucially, I have to ensure these two are different right from the start. If they're the same, the grid can't form an 'X', and I can immediately output \"NO\" and quit.\n\nNow comes the core of the algorithm: iterating through every cell in the grid. Inside the loop, I need to perform the validation. If a cell is on either diagonal, I check if its character matches `diag_char`; otherwise, it should match `other_char`. If I find any mismatch, I immediately output \"NO\" and exit.\n\nIf I manage to complete the entire grid traversal without finding any violations, that means the grid does indeed form a valid 'X', and I output \"YES\".\n\nHowever, there's a refinement to this. I should not assume that the first characters, `grid[0][0]` and `grid[0][1]` are representative. It's safer to *find* the characters during the first pass.\n\nHere is the revised approach: Read in *n* and the grid. Initialize `diag_char` and `other_char` to `None`. Set a `possible` flag to `True`. Then, I iterate through the grid. If I encounter a diagonal element and `diag_char` is still `None`, I set `diag_char` to that character. Similarly, for non-diagonal elements and `other_char`. If a diagonal element doesn't match `diag_char`, or a non-diagonal element doesn't match `other_char`, I set `possible` to `False` and break the loop. Afterwards, If `possible` is still `True`, I do a final check to make sure `diag_char != other_char` before printing \"YES\". I will print \"NO\" if they match or the possible flag gets set to False within the loop.\n\nThis refined method ensures correct assignment of characters.\n\nLet's do a quick example. Consider an `n = 3` grid. I need to iterate through each cell, checking if it is on a diagonal, then validate if each diagonal and non-diagonal value is matching. If any do not, I will terminate and say \"NO\".\n\nThe code must also address that `n` is odd. This simplifies because the center element is on both diagonals, but it is not a problem.\n\nFinally, edge cases. When `n = 3` and all characters are the same, my code should still correctly output \"NO\" because the non-diagonal elements *must* be different.\n\nRegarding implementation, reading *n* from input is straightforward, and the grid can be read as a list of strings. I can access individual characters using list indexing. Given that *n* is at most 300, an *O(n^2)* solution is perfectly acceptable.\n\nI have thoroughly analyzed the problem and the steps to solve it and I believe the algorithm is solid.\n",
