    "thought": "**My Plan for Gluttony:**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Gluttony\" problem. The goal is to rearrange an array `a` into a new array `b` where the sums of all proper subsets of elements in `a` are different from their counterparts in `b`.  The tricky part is that we need to maintain the original indices, just permuting the values. The constraint on `n` (up to 22) gives a hint: brute force, or at least something with a manageable exponential complexity, should be feasible. I'm going to start with the simplest approach and iterate on optimizations.\n\nFirst, I think about edge cases. If `n=1`, there's no proper subset, so any permutation works (in this case just the array itself). For `n=2`, I can swap the elements. These are just initial tests to make sure I'm on the right path.\n\nThe key observation is that the condition \"sum of subsets must be different\" is difficult to guarantee for *all* possible subsets at the same time. The first instinct is, can I make `b` very dissimilar to `a`? A simple method of sorting will not work because the problem expects me to rearrange the initial array's elements and not change the indices' locations.\n\nIf I sort the array, the problem becomes easier to understand, but the indices are critical here. I want `b` to be a permutation of the *original* array `a`.\n\nI'm now focusing on a cyclic shift. Let's see if shifting the elements cyclically works. For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3]`, then `b = [2, 3, 1]`. Let's test if this simple approach solves the problem. A test with values that are powers of 2 seems like a safe bet.\n\nIf a cyclic shift doesn't work, what property would help ensure the sum of any subset of the cyclic shift does not equal the corresponding subset in `a`? If the sorted elements are `a_0 < a_1 <...<a_{n-1}`, the cycle shift generates `b = [a_1, a_2,...,a_{n-1}, a_0]`. I must compare the sums of `a_S` and `b_S`.\n\nI'm thinking about the differences. If I calculate the differences between adjacent elements and then take sums, that might help. Basically, can I represent the condition in terms of differences between the elements in `a` and their corresponding elements in `b`? The sum of those differences needs to be non-zero for any proper subset. I need to keep those individual differences non-zero and non-canceling. The sums of all the differences must be distinct from zero and each other.\n\nThe cyclic shift can be tested in O(n * 2^n) time by checking the sums of all subsets. Since `n` is small, it should be fast enough.\n\nLet's test this cyclic shift with the original input:\n\n1.  Create `indexed_a = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`. This stores the value along with the original index.\n2.  Sort `indexed_a` by the value, creating `sorted_a`.\n3.  Let `b[idx_i] = sorted_a[k+1]` where `a[k]` is the *sorted value*. This stores the value at its original index and maps to the cyclic value.\n\nTesting with the example cases, this looks correct! I'm pretty confident that the cyclic shift on the sorted list and then mapping it back to the original index is the right approach. Let's write the code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements `a[i]` for `i` in `S` is different from the sum of elements `b[i]` for `i` in `S`. The input array `a` contains `n` distinct integers, where `1 <= n <= 22`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition: `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} (a[i] - b[i]) != 0`.\n\nConsider a simple construction for `b`.\n1. Pair each element `a[i]` with its original index `i`: `(a[i], i)`.\n2. Sort these pairs based on the values `a[i]`. Let the sorted pairs be `(v_0, idx_0), (v_1, idx_1), ..., (v_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})`, where `v_0 < v_1 < ... < v_{n-1}`. This means `v_k` is the `k`-th smallest value in `a`, and it was originally at index `idx_k`. So, `a[idx_k] = v_k`.\n3. Construct the array `b` by cyclically shifting these sorted values. Specifically, for each `k` from `0` to `n-1`, we want the element at `a[idx_k]` (which is `v_k`) to be replaced by `v_{(k+1)%n}` in `b`. That is, `b[idx_k] = v_{(k+1)%n}`.\n\nLet's verify this construction:\n*   **Is `b` a permutation of `a`?** Yes. The values `v_0, v_1, ..., v_{n-1}` are exactly the elements of `a` (just sorted). The values `v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n-1}, v_0` are also exactly the elements of `a`. Since each original index `idx_k` is assigned exactly one of these values, `b` is a permutation of `a`.\n*   **Does the condition hold?**\n    Let `S` be a non-empty proper subset of indices.\n    We need to check if `sum_{j in S} a[j] != sum_{j in S} b[j]`.\n    Let `D_k = a[idx_k] - b[idx_k] = v_k - v_{(k+1)%n}`.\n    The sum `sum_{j in S} (a[j] - b[j])` can be rewritten by considering the original indices `idx_k` that are present in `S`.\n    Let `K = {k | idx_k in S}`.\n    Then `sum_{j in S} (a[j] - b[j]) = sum_{k in K} (a[idx_k] - b[idx_k]) = sum_{k in K} (v_k - v_{(k+1)%n})`.\n\n    Notice that `sum_{k=0}^{n-1} D_k = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (v_k - v_{(k+1)%n}) = (v_0 - v_1) + (v_1 - v_2) + ... + (v_{n-1} - v_0) = 0`.\n    This implies that if `sum_{k in K} D_k = 0`, then `sum_{k in {0,...,n-1} \\setminus K} D_k = 0` as well.\n    Since `S` is a proper non-empty subset of indices, `K` is a proper non-empty subset of `{0, ..., n-1}`.\n\n    The values `v_k` are distinct. The differences `D_k = v_k - v_{(k+1)%n}` are:\n    `D_0 = v_0 - v_1 < 0`\n    `D_1 = v_1 - v_2 < 0`\n    ...\n    `D_{n-2} = v_{n-2} - v_{n-1} < 0`\n    `D_{n-1} = v_{n-1} - v_0 > 0` (since `v_{n-1}` is the largest and `v_0` is the smallest)\n\n    So we have `n-1` negative differences and one positive difference.\n    For `sum_{k in K} D_k` to be zero, `K` must contain `D_{n-1}` (the only positive term) and some negative terms that exactly cancel it out.\n    If `n=1`, there are no proper non-empty subsets, so `b=a` is valid. The construction gives `b[idx_0] = v_0`, so `b=a`.\n    If `n=2`, `a = [v_0, v_1]` (after sorting and re-indexing). `D_0 = v_0 - v_1 < 0`, `D_1 = v_1 - v_0 > 0`.\n    For `S={idx_0}`, `K={0}`. Sum is `D_0 != 0`.\n    For `S={idx_1}`, `K={1}`. Sum is `D_1 != 0`.\n    The construction works.\n\n    For `n > 2`, can `sum_{k in K} D_k = 0`?\n    This is a specific instance of the subset sum problem. Given the `n` values `D_k`, can we find a proper non-empty subset `K` that sums to 0?\n    Since `n <= 22`, we can iterate through all `2^n` subsets of `K`.\n    For each subset `K`, calculate `sum_{k in K} D_k`. If it's 0, then this construction fails.\n    However, the problem statement guarantees that `a_i` are distinct. They can be any integers up to `10^9`.\n    The sum of `D_k` is 0. If there is a subset `K` that sums to 0, then the construction fails.\n\n    It turns out that this construction (sorting `a` and cyclically shifting the values) is sufficient. Such a `b` always exists. The problem is classified as \"easy\" in competitive programming, which suggests a simple construction rather than a complex subset sum check. The fact that the `D_k` values include one positive and `n-1` negative values, and their total sum is zero, means that if a subset sum to zero exists, it must include `D_{n-1}`. If `D_{n-1}` is very large compared to the absolute values of `D_0, ..., D_{n-2}`, it might be difficult to form zero.\n    For example, if `a = [0, 1, 2, ..., n-2, M]` where `M` is a very large number.\n    `v_0=0, v_1=1, ..., v_{n-2}=n-2, v_{n-1}=M`.\n    `D_0 = -1, D_1 = -1, ..., D_{n-2} = (n-2)-M, D_{n-1} = M-0`.\n    The `D_k` values are `[-1, -1, ..., -1 (n-2 times), (n-2)-M, M]`.\n    If `M` is large, `(n-2)-M` is a large negative number. `M` is a large positive number.\n    `sum D_k = -(n-2) + (n-2)-M + M = 0`.\n    It's hard to make a subset sum zero. For example, if `n=4`, `a=[0,1,2,1000]`.\n    `v = [0,1,2,1000]`.\n    `D = [-1, -1, 2-1000, 1000-0] = [-1, -1, -998, 1000]`.\n    To sum to zero, we must include `1000`. Then we need `-1000` from `{-1, -1, -998}`. This is impossible.\n    This intuition suggests that the construction works.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read `a` as a list of integers.\n3. Create a list of tuples `indexed_a = [(value, original_index) for original_index, value in enumerate(a)]`.\n4. Sort `indexed_a` based on the values (the first element of the tuple). This will give `sorted_pairs = [(v_0, idx_0), ..., (v_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})]`.\n5. Create a result array `b` of size `n`.\n6. For `k` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   The value `v_k` (which was originally at `idx_k`) should be replaced by `v_{(k+1)%n}`.\n   So, set `b[idx_k] = sorted_pairs[(k+1)%n][0]`.\n7. Print the elements of `b` separated by spaces.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 4`\n`a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n\n1. `indexed_a = [(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n2. `sorted_pairs = sorted(indexed_a)`:\n   `[(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   Let's label them:\n   `k=0: (v_0, idx_0) = (1, 3)`\n   `k=1: (v_1, idx_1) = (10, 2)`\n   `k=2: (v_2, idx_2) = (100, 1)`\n   `k=3: (v_3, idx_3) = (1000, 0)`\n\n3. `b = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (initialized)\n\n4. Populate `b`:\n   `k=0`: `b[idx_0] = v_1`  => `b[3] = 10`\n   `k=1`: `b[idx_1] = v_2`  => `b[2] = 100`\n   `k=2`: `b[idx_2] = v_3`  => `b[1] = 1000`\n   `k=3`: `b[idx_3] = v_0`  => `b[0] = 1`\n\n5. Result `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\nThis matches the logic and produces a valid output. The problem's example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]` is just *one* possible answer. My derived `b` is also a valid answer.\n\nThis solution is efficient enough: sorting takes `O(N log N)`, and constructing `b` takes `O(N)`. Given `N <= 22`, this is extremely fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Edge case for n=1: no proper non-empty subsets exist.\n    # Any permutation works, so b=a is valid.\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Create pairs of (value, original_index)\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort these pairs based on values\n    # This gives us (v_0, idx_0), (v_1, idx_1), ..., (v_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})\n    # where v_k is the k-th smallest value and idx_k is its original index.\n    sorted_pairs = sorted(indexed_a)\n\n    # Construct the result array b\n    # b will be a permutation of a\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # For each element v_k (originally at idx_k),\n    # assign it the value v_{(k+1)%n} in the b array at position idx_k.\n    for k in range(n):\n        original_index = sorted_pairs[k][1]\n        next_value_index = (k + 1) % n\n        value_to_assign = sorted_pairs[next_value_index][0]\n        b[original_index] = value_to_assign\n    \n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
