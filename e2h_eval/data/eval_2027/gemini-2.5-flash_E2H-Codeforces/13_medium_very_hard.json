For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Chord Classification Algorithm - My Perspective**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a program to classify a three-note chord as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange.\" My initial thought is to break this down into smaller, manageable steps. First, I need to understand the music theory behind major and minor triads, which involves the concept of semitones and the cyclical nature of musical notes. The input is three note names, and the expected output is a single word.\n\nThe core idea is to map these notes to numerical values, with \"C\" being 0, \"C#\" being 1, and so on. This simplifies the distance calculation between notes. The distance is the number of semitones between two notes, taking into account that the scale is cyclical. I'll need a way to calculate these distances and, more crucially, to consider all possible orderings of the three input notes.\n\nSince a triad can be rearranged, I'll need to explore all possible permutations of the three notes. The definition of a major triad is a root note, a third four semitones away, and a fifth three semitones away from the third. A minor triad is the root note, a third three semitones away, and a fifth four semitones away from the third. I'll need to check if any of these orderings match the major or minor conditions. If an ordering matches these distances, the chord is identified as either major or minor. If none of the orderings lead to a major or minor triad, it is marked as \"strange.\"\n\nFor efficiency, instead of calculating all 6 permutations, I can just find the root of the chord and then rearrange the other two notes accordingly.  I will have a loop to try each note as the \"root\" and check if it forms a major or minor chord. The code will need to read the input note names, convert them to their numerical values, calculate the distances for each ordering, and output the result. The problem statement guarantees unambiguous answers (not both major and minor), which simplifies the code. I will include a clear mapping of notes to values, functions for semitone calculation, and the necessary logic for the core algorithm, and will test with a variety of known chords, as well as chords not within major/minor constraints, to verify the function.\n",
