He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find how many positive integers, `n`, exist such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Sounds straightforward, but there's a bit of math involved.  First, I need to figure out how to efficiently count those trailing zeroes.\n\nI know the key is the prime factorization of `n!`. Trailing zeroes come from factors of 10, which is 2 * 5.  Since there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is entirely determined by the number of 5s.\n\nNow, Legendre's formula comes to mind.  It provides a neat way to calculate the number of 5s in `n!`: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`  This summation continues until the denominator exceeds `n`. This is my primary tool.\n\nI've got to understand how `Z(n)` behaves. It's non-decreasing; as `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or goes up. The real changes occur when `n` is a multiple of 5, which makes sense.  Let's consider some examples:\n*   `Z(5) = 1`\n*   `Z(10) = 2`\n*   `Z(25) = 6`\n\nThe jumps are what I'm interested in to identify the required number of solutions.\n\nI need to find `n` such that `Z(n) = m`. Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, if a solution exists, there's likely a range of values with that `m` value. Also, if `Z(n) = m`, it's possible that `Z(n+1)` is also `m` (or `m+1`), but if `n` is not a multiple of `5`, `Z(n)` remains constant.\n\nThis is a good start. I can construct a Python script to iterate and check the required condition, while exploiting the logic derived.\n",
