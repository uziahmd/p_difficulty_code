Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Let's break down this competitive programming problem and how to solve it efficiently.**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the decimal value of a string `s` after applying a series of digit-replacement queries, all modulo 1000000007. A naive approach of direct string manipulation is too slow due to potential exponential string growth. We need a way to track the effect of these replacements without constructing the final string.\n\nThe core idea is to process the queries in *reverse* order.  This allows us to determine what each digit *would have become* before a given query was applied.  We'll use two arrays, `current_val[d]` and `current_len[d]` for each digit `d` (0-9). `current_val[d]` will store the final numerical value that `d` transforms into after all the replacements (modulo 1000000007). `current_len[d]` will store the length of the final string that `d` transforms into (modulo 1000000006, because it's used as an exponent with 10).\n\nWe initialize these arrays: `current_val[d] = d` and `current_len[d] = 1`. This represents the initial state where each digit remains itself.  Then, we iterate through the queries backwards. For each query, `di -> ti`, we calculate the new `current_val[di]` and `current_len[di]` based on the string `ti`. The value of `ti` is determined recursively, considering that the digits in `ti` themselves might undergo further replacements.\n\nWe update `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` iteratively. The length is handled with modulo arithmetic since the length could become large. `new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[digit_val]) % (MOD - 1)` ensures lengths are correctly handled modulo `MOD - 1` as exponents.  For the case where `ti` is an empty string, we set both the new value and length to zero.\n\nOnce we've processed all queries in reverse, we can calculate the final answer for the original string `s`. We iterate through `s`, and for each digit, we substitute `current_val[digit]` and use `current_len[digit]` in calculations. Because leading zeros don't affect the numerical result, that case is automatically handled because the `0` has its own final value.\n\nThe time complexity is `O(|s| + sum(len(ti)))`, which is efficient given the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then find the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The key challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially if we perform actual string manipulations, which is too slow and memory-intensive given the constraints.\n\nInstead of directly manipulating the string, we can track how each individual digit (0-9) transforms. Let `MOD = 1000000007`. For each digit `d`, we want to know two things:\n1. `val[d]`: The numerical value (modulo `MOD`) of the string that `d` eventually transforms into.\n2. `length[d]`: The length (modulo `MOD - 1`) of the string that `d` eventually transforms into. We use `MOD - 1` for the length because it will be used as an exponent for powers of 10 in modular arithmetic (by Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p)` for prime `p`).\n\nThe queries are given in chronological order. A query `di -> ti` means that `di` is replaced by `ti`. The digits within `ti` might themselves be subject to later transformations. This suggests processing the queries in reverse order.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Create two arrays, `current_val` and `current_len`, both of size 10 (for digits 0-9).\n    *   Initially, assume no queries have happened. So, each digit `d` transforms into itself.\n    *   Set `current_val[d] = d` (as an integer) for `d` from 0 to 9.\n    *   Set `current_len[d] = 1` for `d` from 0 to 9.\n\n2.  **Process Queries in Reverse Order**:\n    *   Iterate through the queries from the last one to the first one.\n    *   For each query `di -> ti`:\n        *   We need to calculate the new `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on `ti`.\n        *   Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n        *   If `ti` is an empty string, then `new_val_di` remains 0 and `new_len_di` remains 0.\n        *   If `ti` is not empty, iterate through each character `c` in `ti` from left to right:\n            *   Let `digit_c = int(c)`.\n            *   The value contribution of `digit_c` is `current_val[digit_c]`.\n            *   The length contribution of `digit_c` is `current_len[digit_c]`.\n            *   To combine these, `new_val_di` is updated as `(new_val_di * pow(10, current_len[digit_c], MOD) + current_val[digit_c]) % MOD`.\n            *   `new_len_di` is updated as `(new_len_di + current_len[digit_c]) % (MOD - 1)`.\n        *   After processing all characters in `ti`, update `current_val[int(di)] = new_val_di` and `current_len[int(di)] = new_len_di`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Value of Initial String `s`**:\n    *   Initialize `final_ans = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `c` in the original string `s` from left to right:\n        *   Let `digit_c = int(c)`.\n        *   `final_ans` is updated as `(final_ans * pow(10, current_len[digit_c], MOD) + current_val[digit_c]) % MOD`.\n\n4.  **Output**: Print `final_ans`.\n\n**Handling Edge Cases:**\n*   **Empty `ti`**: If `ti` is an empty string, `new_val_di` becomes 0 and `new_len_di` becomes 0. This correctly simulates removing the digit. When this `di` appears in `s` or another `ti`, it will contribute 0 to the value and effectively shift the next digit by `10^0 = 1`.\n*   **Leading Zeros**: The problem states \"ignore the leading zeroes\" when representing `s` as a decimal number. Our iterative calculation `(current_ans * 10^length + digit_value)` naturally handles this. For example, if `s` becomes \"007\", the calculation would be `((0 * 10^1 + 0) * 10^1 + 7) = 7`. If `0` maps to an empty string, its length becomes 0, so `10^0 = 1`. For `s=\"007\"` with `0->\"\"`, the calculation would be `((0 * 10^0 + 0) * 10^0 + 7) = 7`.\n*   **Empty Final String**: If the initial string `s` is empty, or if all digits in `s` eventually map to empty strings, `final_ans` will correctly be 0.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**:\n*   **Initialization**: O(10) operations.\n*   **Processing Queries**: There are `n` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The total length of all `ti` strings is `L_T`. Each character processing involves a `pow` function (logarithmic time) and constant arithmetic operations. So, the total time for queries is `O(L_T * log MOD)`.\n*   **Final Calculation**: Iterating through the initial string `s` of length `|s|`. Each character processing involves `pow` and constant arithmetic. Total time is `O(|s| * log MOD)`.\n*   **Overall**: `O((|s| + L_T) * log MOD)`. Given `|s| <= 10^5`, `L_T <= 10^5`, and `MOD` is about `10^9`, `log MOD` is small (around 30 for base 2). This complexity is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di, ti = line.split('->')\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n\n    # current_val[d] stores the numerical value of the string that digit d eventually transforms into.\n    # It is kept modulo MOD.\n    current_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n\n    # current_len[d] stores the length of the string that digit d eventually transforms into.\n    # It is kept modulo (MOD - 1) because it's used as an exponent for powers of 10.\n    current_len = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    # This ensures that when we process a query di -> ti,\n    # the transformations for digits within ti (e.g., c in ti)\n    # have already been determined by subsequent queries (which are processed earlier in reverse).\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di_str, ti = queries[i]\n        di = int(di_str)\n\n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_len_di = 0\n\n        if not ti: # If replacement string is empty\n            new_val_di = 0\n            new_len_di = 0\n        else:\n            # Calculate the value and length for ti based on the current transformations\n            # of its constituent digits.\n            for char_c in ti:\n                digit_in_ti = int(char_c)\n                \n                # Update the value: new_val_di = (new_val_di * 10^(length of digit_in_ti) + value of digit_in_ti) % MOD\n                # pow(10, current_len[digit_in_ti], MOD) calculates 10 raised to the power of the length\n                # of the string that digit_in_ti transforms into, modulo MOD.\n                power_of_10_for_len = pow(10, current_len[digit_in_ti], MOD)\n                new_val_di = (new_val_di * power_of_10_for_len + current_val[digit_in_ti]) % MOD\n                \n                # Update the length: new_len_di = (new_len_di + length of digit_in_ti) % (MOD - 1)\n                new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[digit_in_ti]) % (MOD - 1)\n        \n        # After processing ti, update the transformation for digit di.\n        current_val[di] = new_val_di\n        current_len[di] = new_len_di\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s using the determined transformations.\n    final_ans = 0\n    for char_s in s:\n        digit_in_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Update final_ans similar to how new_val_di was updated.\n        power_of_10_for_len = pow(10, current_len[digit_in_s], MOD)\n        final_ans = (final_ans * power_of_10_for_len + current_val[digit_in_s]) % MOD\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
