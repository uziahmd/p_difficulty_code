Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Longest Repeated Substring**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this problem: finding the length of the longest substring that repeats at least once in a given string.  It needs to be a Python script, and the input string is lowercase Latin letters, length 1 to 100. Overlaps are allowed, which is important.\n\nMy first thought is, let's break this down. The naive approach comes to mind:\n\n1.  I'll iterate through all possible substring lengths.  The longest possible would be `n-1` (if `n` is the string length; a substring the same length as the string itself can only occur once), and the shortest is obviously 1.  I want the *longest* repeated substring, so it makes sense to start at `n-1` and work my way down.\n2.  For a given length `L`, I'll generate all substrings of that length.  Then I count how many times each of those substrings appears in the original string. If *any* of them occur at least twice, boom, that's a candidate length. Since I'm iterating downwards, the *first* such length I find will be the answer.\n3.  I need to handle edge cases. If no substring of length 1 or more appears twice, the answer is 0.  Think \"abcd\" or \"a\".  Simple enough.\n\nNow, let's codify this into an algorithm and start to think about an example.\n\n**Brute Force Algorithm**\n\nI think a straightforward brute-force approach is the way to go here. It's essentially the approach I just outlined:\n\n```python\ndef solve(s):\n  n = len(s)\n  if n < 2:\n    return 0\n\n  # Iterate possible lengths from n-1 down to 1\n  for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    substring_counts = {}\n\n    # Iterate through all possible starting positions for substrings of length L\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n      sub = s[i : i+L]\n      substring_counts[sub] = substring_counts.get(sub, 0) + 1\n\n    # Check if any substring occurred at least twice\n    for count in substring_counts.values():\n      if count >= 2:\n        return L # Found the longest one\n\n  return 0 # No substring of length >= 1 appeared twice\n```\n\nI'll use \"ababa\" as a test case to run the code in my head. If `n = 5`:\n\n*   When `L = 4`: I find \"abab\" and \"baba,\" neither repeat.\n*   When `L = 3`: I get \"aba\", \"bab\", and \"aba\" again. The counter for \"aba\" hits 2. Return 3.\n\nIt seems to work! I'm confident in the algorithm and it's within the performance limits. I'm ready to write the script.\n",
