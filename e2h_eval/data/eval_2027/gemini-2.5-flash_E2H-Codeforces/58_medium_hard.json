You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nMy primary goal here is to determine the minimum number of edges, `t`, needed to transform a given graph into one containing an odd-length simple cycle, and also to count the distinct ways, `w`, of adding those edges. The input graph is undirected, without self-loops or parallel edges. My thinking proceeds in several ordered steps, aiming for the simplest and most efficient solution possible.\n\n**Case 0: The graph *already* has an odd cycle**\n\nFirst, I need to check whether the existing graph already contains an odd cycle. This is the simplest scenario because no additional edges are required (`t = 0`). To do this, I'll employ a classic graph coloring approach, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) based 2-coloring algorithm (also known as a bipartite check). If I encounter a conflict during the coloring (i.e., an edge connecting two vertices of the same color), I've detected an odd cycle. If an odd cycle exists, there's only one way to achieve it; do nothing (`w = 1`). This test should be done first for efficiency as it offers an immediate and often optimal solution.\n\n**Case 1: The graph is bipartite**\n\nIf the initial check determines that no odd cycles exist, the graph must be bipartite. In this case, I will then have to add edges to create the cycle. To form an odd cycle in a bipartite graph, the crucial insight is that an added edge must connect two vertices within the same partition set (either both in the \"left\" partition or both in the \"right\" partition). This new edge will close a cycle, where the cycle includes that edge, and a path of even length from the same component, connecting those two vertices in the original graph (because the original graph is bipartite). To form an odd cycle we need to add an edge. So, the minimum `t` is 1.\n\nTo calculate the number of ways, `w`, to add a single edge to create an odd cycle, I'll need to count the valid pairs within the connected components. I'll iterate through each connected component and count the vertices in each partition set. For each partition, I can create edges by any pair of nodes with in the same partition. I can then sum all those combinations of the total vertices `L` and `R` as: `w = sum_C ( |L_C| * (|L_C| - 1) / 2 + |R_C| * (|R_C| - 1) / 2 )`, that is, summing through each partition of each connected component, and calculating the number of possible edges from picking two of the same colored nodes.\n\n**Case 2: When adding one edge within the same partition of a component is not enough.**\n\nIf I find the `w = 0` (no way of forming an odd cycle with one added edge, and the graph remains bipartite), it means that not all components in the original graph have a partition of size greater than one. In this scenario, all connected components will consist of isolated vertices, or two vertices connected by an edge (essentially, single edges).\n\nIn this case, the number of required edges `t > 1`. To form a cycle of odd length, it would require forming a triangle, or a cycle with the addition of three edges.\n\n*   **Subcase 2A**: If the number of components is greater than two: The minimum number of edges to form a triangle is three. I'll select three unconnected vertices and connect them in a cycle to meet the problem constraints. I will add three edges, giving `t=3`. The number of ways is `C(n,3)` where `n` is the number of vertices.\n*   **Subcase 2B:** If the number of components is two: The graph is bipartite (because it contains isolated edges). The components are made of isolated vertices or edges that are un-connected. We need to add at least 2 edges. So `t = 2`. The number of ways is determined by picking one vertex from one edge and connecting it to a vertex within another edge to form an odd cycle. This will be the number of edges times the number of isolated vertices.\n\n**Complexity**\n\nThe critical components are the bipartite check (BFS/DFS) and the connected component analysis. Both are linear in the number of vertices and edges.  This makes the overall algorithm efficient.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to add these `t` edges. The graph has `n` vertices and `m` edges, with no loops or parallel edges.\n\nWe will analyze the problem by considering the smallest possible values for `t`:\n\n**Case 0: The graph already contains an odd cycle (t = 0).**\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. We can check for bipartiteness using a 2-coloring algorithm (BFS or DFS).\nWe assign colors (say, 0 or 1) to vertices. Start a traversal from an uncolored vertex, assign it color 0. All its neighbors must be color 1. All neighbors of color 1 vertices must be color 0, and so on. If we encounter an edge `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` already have the same color, then we have found an odd cycle.\nIf an odd cycle is found, `t = 0` and `w = 1` (since we don't add any edges). This is the optimal solution if possible.\n\n**Case 1: The graph is bipartite but does not contain an odd cycle (t = 1).**\nIf the graph is bipartite, we need to add at least one edge to create an odd cycle. Adding an edge `(u, v)` between two vertices `u` and `v` that belong to the same partition (i.e., have the same color) will create an odd cycle. This is because any path between `u` and `v` in a bipartite graph must have an even length if `u` and `v` are in the same partition. Adding the edge `(u, v)` closes this path to form a cycle of length `(path_length + 1)`, which is odd.\nTo find `w`, we count the number of such pairs `(u, v)` that are not already connected by an edge. Since the graph is bipartite, no existing edge connects vertices of the same color.\nFor each connected component `C` of the graph, let `L_C` and `R_C` be its two partition sets. The number of ways to add an edge within `C` to form an odd cycle is `|L_C| * (|L_C| - 1) / 2 + |R_C| * (|R_C| - 1) / 2`.\nWe sum this quantity over all connected components. If this sum `w_1` is greater than 0, then `t = 1` and `w = w_1`.\n\n**Case 2: The graph is bipartite, and `t = 1` is not possible (t = 2 or t = 3).**\nIf `w_1` (from Case 1) is 0, it means that for every connected component `C`, at least one of its partition sets (`L_C` or `R_C`) has size less than 2. This implies that every connected component has at most 2 vertices.\nSo, the graph consists only of isolated vertices and isolated edges.\nLet `N_0` be the number of isolated vertices (degree 0).\nLet `m` be the number of existing edges. Each edge `(u, v)` forms a component of size 2.\n\nWe try to form an odd cycle by adding two edges (`t = 2`). The smallest odd cycle is a triangle (length 3).\nTo form a triangle `u-v-w-u` by adding two edges, one edge must already exist. Let `(u,v)` be an existing edge. We need to add edges `(u,w)` and `(v,w)` for some third vertex `w`. These added edges must not already exist.\n*   **Subcase 2a: `N_0 > 0` (there are isolated vertices) and `m > 0` (there are existing edges).**\n    Pick an existing edge `(u,v)` (there are `m` ways). Pick an isolated vertex `w` (there are `N_0` ways).\n    Since `w` is isolated, `(u,w)` and `(v,w)` cannot be existing edges. Adding `(u,w)` and `(v,w)` forms the triangle `u-w-v-u`.\n    The number of ways `w_2a = m * N_0`.\n    If `w_2a > 0`, then `t = 2` and `w = w_2a`.\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: `N_0 = 0` (all vertices are part of existing edges) and `m > 0`.**\n    This implies `n = 2m`. All vertices have degree 1 (if `n > 2`). For example, `(1,2), (3,4)`.\n    We need `n >= 3` to form a triangle. If `n=2, m=1`, it's impossible to form a triangle, so `t=2` is not possible.\n    If `n >= 3` (which means `m >= 2` since `n=2m`), we can pick an existing edge `(u,v)` (`m` ways). Then pick any other vertex `w` (`n-2` ways).\n    Since `N_0=0` and `w` is not `u` or `v`, `w` must be part of another existing edge `(w,x)`. This means `w` is in a different component than `u,v`. So `(u,w)` and `(v,w)` cannot be existing edges.\n    Adding `(u,w)` and `(v,w)` forms the triangle `u-w-v-u`.\n    The number of ways `w_2b = m * (n-2)`.\n    If `w_2b > 0`, then `t = 2` and `w = w_2b`.\n\n**Case 3: `t = 2` is not possible (t = 3).**\nThis happens if:\n*   `m = 0` (no existing edges): All `n` vertices are isolated.\n    If `n < 3`, it's impossible to form any cycle of length > 1. (The problem implicitly assumes `n >= 3` for a cycle to be possible, as evidenced by example `3 0 -> 3 1`).\n    If `n >= 3`, we need to pick 3 vertices `u,v,w` and add three edges `(u,v), (v,w), (w,u)` to form a triangle. This requires `t = 3` edges.\n    The number of ways `w_3a = C(n, 3) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`.\n    So `t = 3` and `w = w_3a`.\n\n*   `m > 0` but `n < 3` (e.g., `n=2, m=1` with edge `(1,2)`).\n    In this specific scenario (`n=2, m=1`), we cannot form an odd cycle. `N_0=0`, so Subcase 2a is not applicable. `n-2=0`, so `w_2b=0`. `n < 3`, so `w_3a=0`.\n    This case implies it's impossible to form an odd cycle. However, competitive programming problems usually have an answer for all valid inputs. The problem constraints are `n >= 1`. The smallest odd cycle is a triangle, requiring 3 vertices. If `n < 3`, it's impossible. If `n=1` or `n=2`, no cycle can be formed. The problem statement implies a solution always exists if `n >= 3`. We'll assume `n >= 3` for any cycle formation. If `n < 3`, it's impossible to form an odd cycle of length > 1. If `n=1` or `n=2` and `m=0` or `m=1`, no solution. But the problem constraints `n, m` are up to `2*10^5`, so `n>=3` is not guaranteed.\n    The example `3 0` output `3 1` confirms `n=3, m=0` leads to `t=3, w=1`. This implies `n < 3` is the only case where `t` might be impossible. If `n < 3`, then `C(n,3)=0`. Our logic for `t=3` handles this by `w=0`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Read `n, m`.\n    *   Create adjacency list `adj` for the graph.\n    *   `colors = [-1] * (n + 1)` (0, 1 for colors, -1 for uncolored).\n    *   `visited_comp = [False] * (n + 1)` (for identifying connected components).\n    *   `has_odd_cycle = False`.\n\n2.  **Check for `t = 0` (Odd Cycle Detection):**\n    *   Iterate `i` from 1 to `n`:\n        *   If `colors[i] == -1` (uncolored, start new BFS/DFS for component):\n            *   `q = deque([(i, 0)])`\n            *   `colors[i] = 0`\n            *   While `q` is not empty:\n                *   `u, c = q.popleft()`\n                *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n                    *   If `colors[v] == -1`:\n                        *   `colors[v] = 1 - c`\n                        *   `q.append((v, 1 - c))`\n                    *   Else if `colors[v] == c`:\n                        *   `has_odd_cycle = True`\n                        *   Break inner and outer loops.\n            *   If `has_odd_cycle`, break outer loop.\n    *   If `has_odd_cycle`: Print `0 1` and exit.\n\n3.  **Check for `t = 1` (Add edge within bipartite component):**\n    *   `ways_t1 = 0`\n    *   Iterate `i` from 1 to `n`:\n        *   If `not visited_comp[i]`: (Start BFS/DFS for a new component to count nodes by color)\n            *   `component_nodes = []`\n            *   `q = deque([i])`\n            *   `visited_comp[i] = True`\n            *   `component_nodes.append(i)`\n            *   While `q` is not empty:\n                *   `u = q.popleft()`\n                *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n                    *   If `not visited_comp[v]`:\n                        *   `visited_comp[v] = True`\n                        *   `component_nodes.append(v)`\n                        *   `q.append(v)`\n            *   `count0 = 0`, `count1 = 0`\n            *   For `node` in `component_nodes`:\n                *   If `colors[node] == 0`: `count0 += 1`\n                *   Else: `count1 += 1`\n            *   `ways_t1 += count0 * (count0 - 1) // 2`\n            *   `ways_t1 += count1 * (count1 - 1) // 2`\n    *   If `ways_t1 > 0`: Print `1 ways_t1` and exit.\n\n4.  **Check for `t = 2` (Add two edges to form a triangle):**\n    *   `num_isolated_vertices = 0`\n    *   For `i` from 1 to `n`:\n        *   If `len(adj[i]) == 0`: `num_isolated_vertices += 1`\n    *   `ways_t2 = 0`\n    *   If `num_isolated_vertices > 0` and `m > 0`:\n        *   `ways_t2 = num_isolated_vertices * m`\n    *   Else if `num_isolated_vertices == 0` and `m > 0`:\n        *   // All vertices are part of edges. `n = 2m`.\n        *   // Requires `n >= 3` (i.e., `m >= 2`) to pick an edge and another vertex.\n        *   If `n >= 3`:\n            *   `ways_t2 = m * (n - 2)`\n    *   If `ways_t2 > 0`: Print `2 ways_t2` and exit.\n\n5.  **If `t = 0, 1, 2` are not possible (then `t = 3`):**\n    *   This implies `m = 0` (all vertices isolated) or `n < 3`.\n    *   We need to form a triangle.
