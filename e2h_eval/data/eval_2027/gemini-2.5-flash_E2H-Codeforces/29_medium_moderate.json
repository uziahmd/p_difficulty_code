Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan to tackle this competitive programming problem:**\n\nIt looks like I need to implement a Python script to handle string substitutions and a final modular calculation. The core challenge is the potential for the string `s` to grow exponentially with repeated substitutions.  Directly simulating each substitution will be way too slow given the constraints.\n\nMy strategy involves pre-computing the *final* transformations for each digit. I'll maintain two arrays, `val[k]` and `len[k]`, for each digit `k` from 0 to 9. `val[k]` will store the numerical value of what digit `k` ultimately becomes (modulo `10^9 + 7`), and `len[k]` will store the final length of that string (modulo `10^9 + 6` for efficient exponentiation).\n\nI'll process the queries in *reverse* order.  This is the key insight.  Working backward, I can effectively \"undo\" the final state of the string and build up the transformations incrementally.  For each query `di -> ti`, I'll update `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on the string `ti`. The real trick is how to calculate the value and length of the updated `ti` which might contain digits that are also transformed.\n\nTo handle these nested substitutions, I'll iterate through the characters of `ti` and recursively calculate the value and length, using the already computed `val` and `len` values.  I will need to take care to compute the length modulo `10^9 + 6` (M-1).  This will prevent the length from growing too large for exponentiation.  For the final answer calculation, I'll calculate `10^(length) mod (10^9 + 7)` to correctly multiply the values.\n\nOnce I have the final transformations for each digit, I'll iterate through the original string `s` and replace each digit with its pre-computed value and length, performing modular arithmetic at each step to avoid overflows.\n\nI'll also keep in mind edge cases like empty strings and how leading zeros are handled in the final result. I am going to also be careful with the modulo operations, particularly with the length calculation and powering to avoid integer overflows.\n\nThis approach should avoid the exponential string growth issue and allow me to calculate the final result efficiently, given the constraints of the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit substitutions in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. The key challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct simulation infeasible.\n\nTo handle this, we use a technique called \"reverse processing of queries\". Instead of tracking the entire string `s`, we track what each individual digit `0` through `9` ultimately transforms into. For each digit `k`, we need to store two pieces of information:\n1.  `val[k]`: The numerical value of the string that `k` ultimately becomes, modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n2.  `length[k]`: The length of the string that `k` ultimately becomes. Since this length can be very large and is only used as an exponent for powers of 10 (`10^L mod M`), we only need to store `L` modulo `M-1` (by Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^L mod M = 10^(L mod (M-1)) mod M` for prime `M` and `10` not a multiple of `M`). If `L mod (M-1)` is `0`, we should use `M-1` as the exponent, unless `L` is actually `0`. However, in this problem, lengths are always positive, so `L mod (M-1)` will never be `0` unless `L` is a multiple of `M-1`. If `L` is a multiple of `M-1`, `L mod (M-1)` will be `0`, and `pow(10, 0, M)` is `1`. `pow(10, M-1, M)` is also `1`. So `L % (M-1)` works as long as we handle `0` correctly. A common idiom `exp % (MOD-1) or (MOD-1)` can be used if `exp` could be `0` and we want `MOD-1`. Here, `length[k]` will always be at least `1`, so `length[k] % (MOD-1)` will be at least `1`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Define `MOD = 1000000007`.\n    *   Define `MOD_PHI = MOD - 1 = 1000000006` (Euler's totient for `MOD`).\n    *   Create two arrays, `val` and `length`, of size 10.\n    *   Initially, each digit `k` (from 0 to 9) transforms into itself. So, set `val[k] = k` and `length[k] = 1` for all `k`.\n\n2.  **Store Queries:**\n    *   Read `n`.\n    *   Store all `n` queries `di -> ti` in a list.\n\n3.  **Process Queries in Reverse Order:**\n    *   Iterate through the queries from the last one to the first one. This is crucial because a query `di -> ti` defines what `di` becomes *at that point in time*. By processing in reverse, when we consider `di -> ti`, the `val[c]` and `length[c]` for digits `c` within `ti` already represent their *final* transformations (after all subsequent queries).\n    *   For each query `di -> ti`:\n        *   Initialize `current_val = 0` and `current_len = 0`.\n        *   If `ti` is an empty string:\n            *   Set `val[int(di)] = 0` and `length[int(di)] = 0`. (An empty string represents the number 0 and has length 0).\n        *   Otherwise (if `ti` is not empty):\n            *   Iterate through each character `c` in `ti` from left to right:\n                *   Convert `c` to an integer `c_int`.\n                *   Calculate `power_of_10 = pow(10, length[c_int], MOD)`. This `length[c_int]` is the length of the string that `c_int` ultimately becomes.\n                *   Update `current_val`: `current_val = (current_val * power_of_10 + val[c_int]) % MOD`. This effectively concatenates the value of `c_int` to the right of `current_val`.\n                *   Update `current_len`: `current_len = (current_len + length[c_int]) % MOD_PHI`. This sums up the lengths.\n            *   After iterating through all characters in `ti`, update `val[int(di)] = current_val` and `length[int(di)] = current_len`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Final Answer:**\n    *   Initialize `final_ans = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `char_s` in the original input string `s`:\n        *   Convert `char_s` to an integer `s_int`.\n        *   Calculate `power_of_10 = pow(10, length[s_int], MOD)`.\n        *   Update `final_ans`: `final_ans = (final_ans * power_of_10 + val[s_int]) % MOD`.\n    *   Print `final_ans`.\n\n**Example Trace (from problem description): `s = 222`, `n = 2`, `2->0`, `0->7`**\n\n*   `MOD = 1000000007`, `MOD_PHI = 1000000006`\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    `val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n*   **Queries (stored):** `[(2, '0'), (0, '7')]`\n\n*   **Process in Reverse:**\n\n    1.  **Query `(0, '7')`:** (`di = 0`, `ti = '7'`)\n        *   `current_val = 0`, `current_len = 0`\n        *   `c = '7'` (`c_int = 7`):\n            *   `power_of_10 = pow(10, length[7], MOD) = pow(10, 1, MOD) = 10`\n            *   `current_val = (0 * 10 + val[7]) % MOD = (0 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n            *   `current_len = (0 + length[7]) % MOD_PHI = (0 + 1) % MOD_PHI = 1`\n        *   Update: `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n        *   `val` is now `[7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n\n    2.  **Query `(2, '0')`:** (`di = 2`, `ti = '0'`)\n        *   `current_val = 0`, `current_len = 0`\n        *   `c = '0'` (`c_int = 0`):\n            *   `power_of_10 = pow(10, length[0], MOD) = pow(10, 1, MOD) = 10` (Note: `length[0]` is now 1 from the previous step)\n            *   `current_val = (0 * 10 + val[0]) % MOD = (0 + 7) % MOD = 7` (Note: `val[0]` is now 7 from the previous step)\n            *   `current_len = (0 + length[0]) % MOD_PHI = (0 + 1) % MOD_PHI = 1`\n        *   Update: `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n        *   `val` is now `[7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n\n*   **Final Calculation for `s = 222`:**\n    *   `final_ans = 0`\n    *   `char_s = '2'` (`s_int = 2`):\n        *   `power_of_10 = pow(10, length[2], MOD) = pow(10, 1, MOD) = 10`\n        *   `final_ans = (0 * 10 + val[2]) % MOD = (0 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n    *   `char_s = '2'` (`s_int = 2`):\n        *   `power_of_10 = pow(10, length[2], MOD) = pow(10, 1, MOD) = 10`\n        *   `final_ans = (7 * 10 + val[2]) % MOD = (70 + 7) % MOD = 77`\n    *   `char_s = '2'` (`s_int = 2`):\n        *   `power_of_10 = pow(10, length[2], MOD) = pow(10, 1, MOD) = 10`\n        *   `final_ans = (77 * 10 + val[2]) % MOD = (770 + 7) % MOD = 777`\n\n*   **Output:** `777`\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Reading input: `O(|s| + N + sum(|ti|))`.\n*   Processing queries: `N` queries. For each query, we iterate through `ti`. The total length of all `ti` strings is `sum(|ti|)`. Inside the loop, `pow` takes `O(log MOD)` time. So, `O(sum(|ti|) * log MOD)`.\n*   Final calculation: `O(|s| * log MOD)`.\n*   Given constraints: `|s| <= 10^5`, `N <= 10^5`, `sum(|ti|) <= 10^5`. `log MOD` is about `log(10^9) ~ 30`.\n*   Total time complexity: `O((|s| + sum(|ti|)) * log MOD)`.
