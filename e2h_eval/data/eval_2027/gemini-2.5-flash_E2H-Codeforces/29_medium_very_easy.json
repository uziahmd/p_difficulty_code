Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The Grand Design: Solving the \"Substitutes in Number\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's get into this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem. My goal is a Python script that cracks this competitive programming challenge, and I'm going to walk through my thinking process step by step, as if I'm explaining it to myself.\n\nThe problem throws a string of digits, `s`, at us, and a series of queries. Each query is a simple substitution: \"di -> ti\", replace all occurrences of digit `di` with the string `ti`. The real kicker is the final task: calculate the value of the transformed `s` modulo 1000000007.  The string `s` can get huge, really fast, meaning direct string replacement is out the window.  We need a smarter, more efficient way.\n\nI immediately spot the exponential growth potential.  The key is to avoid constructing the massive string.  Instead, let's work with the *value* and *length* of each digit after all the substitutions.  I'll define `val[d]` as the final numerical value represented by digit `d`, and `len[d]` as the final *length* (or effectively, its exponent of 10 within the final number).\n\nInitially, for each digit `d` (0 to 9), `val[d]` is just the integer value of `d`, and `len[d]` is 1 (representing a single digit).  When a query \"di -> ti\" comes, we need to update `val[di]` and `len[di]`.  The trick here is to process the queries *in reverse order*.  This is crucial because we need to build up the transformations from the base level.  If we processed in the forward order, the later substitutions would be based on \"intermediate\" values which may change later.\n\nWith reverse processing, we essentially build up a \"dependency graph\" where transformations rely on other transformations.  To calculate the *new* `val[di]`, we need to determine the numeric value that string `ti` represents after any *subsequent* transformations, including those within `ti` itself. Likewise, the new `len[di]` will be the length (exponent of 10) that `ti` *eventually* represents after all transformations.  I'm interpreting `ti` as a *literal* sequence of digit characters, that when substituted, will itself be transformed by *subsequent* queries.\n\nHere's where the modular arithmetic comes in.  We're working modulo 1000000007, a prime number. Fermat's Little Theorem helps us with the exponents.  We have to manage the fact that string lengths can become huge with multiple substitutions, so they can be taken modulo `MOD-1` (where `MOD = 1000000007`).  However, the `len` values will be used as the exponent in a modular exponentiation.\n\nSo, when processing a query `di -> ti`, I'll iterate through `ti`, building the `new_val_di` (the new transformed value for `di`) and `new_len_di` (its new exponent).  The exponent needs to be modulo `MOD - 1`.   I can use the `pow` function in Python for efficient modular exponentiation.\n\nThe final evaluation of the initial `s` will then be a matter of iterating through it from right to left, using the calculated `val[d]` and `len[d]` values (the transformed values of each digit) to calculate the final number modulo `MOD`.  We keep a running value of the current power of 10 to account for the positions of the digits.\n\nI've carefully considered the edge cases: empty strings, leading zeros (which we need to ignore when *interpreting* the final result), and multiple queries to the same digit. The design handles these gracefully by how we perform the transformations.  The core idea to keep length and numeric value for each digit is robust.\n\nThe time complexity will be dominated by the query processing, which is `SUM_L * O(log MOD)` if `SUM_L` is the sum of the lengths of the \"ti\" strings and the initial string `s`. The space complexity is `O(10)` since we only store `val` and `len` for each digit, plus space for the queries. This looks reasonable, so let's translate this into Python and get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The key challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct string manipulation infeasible.\n\nWe can solve this problem by working with the numerical values and lengths that each digit `0-9` represents after all transformations. Since a digit `d_i` might be replaced by a string `t_i`, and `t_i` itself might contain digits that are subject to further transformations, we need to process the queries in reverse order. This ensures that when we calculate the value and length for a digit `d_i` based on its replacement string `t_i`, the digits within `t_i` already reflect their *final* transformations.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. This is a prime number.\nLet `MOD_PHI = MOD - 1 = 1000000006`. By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer `a` not divisible by `MOD`, `a^(MOD-1) ≡ 1 (mod MOD)`. This means we can compute `a^E mod MOD` as `a^(E % (MOD-1)) mod MOD` for large `E`. If `E` is 0, `a^0` is 1. Python's `pow(base, exp, mod)` function handles this correctly for `exp=0` and large `exp` (it uses `exp % (mod-1)` internally if `exp` is large and `mod` is prime).\n\nWe maintain two arrays, `val` and `length`, both of size 10 (for digits 0-9):\n*   `val[d]` will store the numerical value that a single digit `d` represents after all transformations, modulo `MOD`.\n*   `length[d]` will store the effective length that a single digit `d` represents after all transformations, modulo `MOD_PHI`. This is used for calculating powers of 10.\n\n**Initialization**:\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` represents itself:\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `length[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries (in reverse order)**:\n1.  Read all `n` queries and store them.\n2.  Iterate through the stored queries from the last query to the first query.\n3.  For each query `d_i -> t_i`:\n    *   Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through the characters `char` in `t_i` from right to left (to correctly account for powers of 10).\n        *   Let `digit = int(char)`.\n        *   `new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[digit] * pow(10, new_len_di, MOD)) % MOD`\n        *   `new_len_di = (new_len_di + length[digit]) % MOD_PHI`\n    *   Update `val[int(d_i)] = new_val_di` and `length[int(d_i)] = new_len_di`.\n    *   If `t_i` is an empty string, `new_val_di` will remain `0` and `new_len_di` will remain `0`, which is correct.\n\n**Calculating the Final Result**:\n1.  Initialize `final_ans = 0` and `current_power_of_10 = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through the characters `char` in the initial string `s` from right to left.\n    *   Let `digit = int(char)`.\n    *   `final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit] * pow(10, current_power_of_10, MOD)) % MOD`\n    *   `current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 + length[digit]) % MOD_PHI`\n\n3.  The final `final_ans` is the answer. The problem states to ignore leading zeros and that an empty string is 0. Our approach naturally handles this: if `val[0]` is 0, it contributes nothing to the sum, effectively ignoring leading zeros. If the final string `s` effectively becomes empty (e.g., all digits transform to empty strings), `final_ans` will be 0.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**:\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   Storing queries: `O(N + SUM_LENGTH_T)`, where `SUM_LENGTH_T` is the sum of lengths of all `t_i`.\n    *   Processing queries: Each character in `t_i` involves a constant number of arithmetic operations and a `pow` call (which is `O(log MOD)`). Total for queries: `O(SUM_LENGTH_T * log MOD)`.\n    *   Evaluating initial string `s`: Each character in `s` involves similar operations. Total for `s`: `O(|s| * log MOD)`.\n    *   Overall: `O((N + SUM_LENGTH_T + |s|) * log MOD)`. Given `N, SUM_LENGTH_T, |s| <= 10^5` and `log MOD` is small (~30), this is efficient enough (`3 * 10^5 * 30 = 9 * 10^6` operations).\n*   **Space Complexity**:\n    *   `val` and `length` arrays: `O(1)` (10 elements each).\n    *   Storing queries: `O(N + SUM_LENGTH_T)`.\n    *   Overall: `O(N + SUM_LENGTH_T)`. This is also within limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di, ti = line.split('->')\n        queries.append((int(di), ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_PHI = MOD - 1 # For Fermat's Little Theorem, exponent is modulo MOD-1\n\n    # Initialize val[d] and length[d] for each digit d\n    # val[d]: numerical value represented by digit d\n    # length[d]: effective length represented by digit d (for powers of 10)\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for di, ti in reversed(queries):\n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_len_di = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through ti from right to left\n        for char_t in reversed(ti):\n            digit_t = int(char_t)\n            # Add value of digit_t * 10^(new_len_di)\n            new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[digit_t] * pow(10, new_len_di, MOD)) % MOD\n            # Add length of digit_t\n            new_len_di = (new_len_di + length[digit_t]) % MOD_PHI\n        \n        val[di] = new_val_di\n        length[di] = new_len_di\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    current_power_of_10 = 0 # This accumulates the total length from the right\n\n    # Iterate through s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        # Add value of digit_s * 10^(current_power_of_10)\n        final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit_s] * pow(10, current_power_of_10, MOD)) % MOD\n        # Add length of digit_s\n        current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 + length[digit_s]) % MOD_PHI\n\n    print(final_ans)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
