Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and here's my thought process. The input is pretty straightforward: home and university coordinates, and a set of road equations. The goal is to figure out the fewest steps to get from home to the university, where a step means crossing a road.\n\nMy first thought is, forget the whole \"blocks\" thing; it's all about crossing those road lines. Since we can only move between adjacent blocks, which are separated by a road, the minimum steps are equivalent to the minimum number of roads that separate the starting point from the destination.\n\nNow, a line divides the plane. The key insight is using the sign of `ax + by + c` to determine which side of the line a point is on. If the home and university points are on opposite sides of a road, we *have* to cross that road. If they're on the same side, we *don't* need to cross it.\n\nSo, for each road, I need to evaluate the road equation for both the home and university points. Let's call these values `val1` and `val2`. If the signs of `val1` and `val2` are different, meaning `val1 * val2` is negative, that road is a necessary crossing. If `val1 * val2` is positive, we don't count it. Zero won't happen because they can't be on the line.\n\nFinally, I just need to iterate through all the roads, count the number of roads that separate the home and university, and that count will be my answer.  Seems like a pretty elegant and direct solution to me. I'm going to put my Python skills to the test and code this up.\n",
