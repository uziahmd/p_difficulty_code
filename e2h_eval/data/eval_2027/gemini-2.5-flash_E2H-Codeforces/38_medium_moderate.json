    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this competitive programming problem and my thought process.**  The core challenge is finding the minimum number of nodes (`n`) needed for a specific kind of directed graph (`p`-reachable), and then maximizing the \"unidirectional pairs\" within that minimal graph. I need to figure out how to arrange strongly connected components (SCCs) to achieve this.\n\nFirst, I define my terms.  A \"reachable from each other\" pair of nodes is one that are in the same SCC. The problem specifies u < v which makes my calculations a bit less straightforward. A \"p-reachable graph\" must have *exactly* `p` such pairs.  A \"unidirectional pair\" means there is a path from `u` to `v` but *not* from `v` back to `u`.  This implies `u` and `v` are in separate SCCs.\n\nI start by realizing the total number of nodes is the sum of the number of nodes within each SCC: `n = s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k`, where `s_i` is the size of the ith SCC. Within an SCC of size `s_i`, the number of reachable-from-each-other pairs is `s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2`.  Therefore, `p = sum(s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2)` across all SCCs.\n\n**My first goal is to minimize `n`**.  The function `f(x) = x * (x - 1) / 2` grows quadratically, so to achieve a large `p` with minimum nodes, I need to use the *largest possible* SCCs. I can calculate the sizes of the components using a greedy approach, breaking `p` down into contributions of `f(s)`, where `s` is the largest possible integer to satisfy this. This greedy strategy works because `f(x)` is convex.\n\nI test this greedy strategy with a small example and verify that this is correct. I note a special edge case where `p` is 0.\n\n**Next, the challenge is to maximize unidirectional pairs.** To get the most unidirectional pairs, I need to make sure that there are only one-way paths between my SCCs. I arrange the SCCs in a chain: `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_k`.  If `u` is in SCC `C_i` and `v` is in SCC `C_j`, then `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `i < j`. I determine that the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (`U_max`) is equal to `(n^2 - sum(s_i^2)) / 2`.\n\nI test the formula on the examples. I verify that with the constructed `min_n`, this formula should give the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nI also double check the constraints, the meaning of \"unidirectional pair\", and verify that there are no floating point issues from the `math.isqrt()` call and calculations. This checks edge cases to get the code correct.\n\nFinally, I summarize the overall algorithm and the graph construction.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is **reachable from each other** if `u != v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there is a path from `v` to `u`. This means `u` and `v` belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC).\n- A directed graph is **`p`-reachable** if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is **unidirectional** if `u != v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n\nLet `n` be the total number of nodes in the graph.\nLet the graph consist of `k` strongly connected components (SCCs), `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k`, with sizes `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k` respectively. The total number of nodes is `n = s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimize `n` for a given `p`**\n\nFor any SCC `C_i` of size `s_i`, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within `C_i` are reachable from each other. The number of such unordered pairs is `s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2`. Since the `p`-reachable definition specifies `u < v`, we count each such pair once.\nTherefore, the total number of `p`-reachable pairs is `p = sum_{i=1 to k} (s_i * (s_i - 1) / 2)`.\n\nTo minimize `n = sum(s_i)` for a fixed `p`, we should use the largest possible SCC sizes. This is a greedy approach:\n1. Initialize `min_n = 0` and `current_p = p`.\n2. While `current_p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `s` such that `s * (s - 1) / 2 <= current_p`.\n   b. Add `s` to `min_n`.\n   c. Subtract `s * (s - 1) / 2` from `current_p`.\n   d. Store `s` (or `s^2`) for the second part of the problem.\n\nTo find `s` efficiently: `s * (s - 1) / 2 <= current_p` implies `s^2 - s - 2 * current_p <= 0`. The positive root of `x^2 - x - 2 * current_p = 0` is `(1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2`. So `s` is `floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2)`. We can use `math.isqrt` for integer square root to ensure precision: `s = (1 + math.isqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) // 2`.\n\nSpecial case: If `p = 0`, no pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` are reachable from each other. This can be achieved with `n=0` nodes. So for `p=0`, `min_n = 0`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximize unidirectional pairs for `min_n` nodes**\n\nLet `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k` be the sizes of the SCCs determined in Part 1. The total number of nodes is `min_n = sum(s_i)`.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs `(u, v)` (path `u -> v`, no path `v -> u`), we should arrange the SCCs in a linear, directed chain in the condensation graph. For example, `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_k`.\nWe can construct such a graph by:\n- Making each `C_i` a complete directed graph (a clique). This ensures all nodes within `C_i` are mutually reachable.\n- Adding a single edge from an arbitrary node in `C_i` to an arbitrary node in `C_{i+1}` for each `i` from `1` to `k-1`. This establishes reachability `C_i -> C_j` for all `i < j` by transitivity.\n- No edges are added from `C_j` to `C_i` if `j > i`. This ensures there is no path from `C_j` to `C_i` if `j > i`.\n\nWith this construction:\n- If `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j` with `i = j`: `u` and `v` are in the same SCC. They are mutually reachable, so `(u, v)` is not unidirectional.\n- If `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j` with `i < j`: There is a path `u -> v` (from `C_i` to `C_j`). There is no path `v -> u` (from `C_j` to `C_i`). Thus, `(u, v)` is a unidirectional pair. There are `s_i * s_j` such pairs.\n- If `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j` with `i > j`: There is a path `v -> u` (from `C_j` to `C_i`). There is no path `u -> v` (from `C_i` to `C_j`). Thus, `(v, u)` is a unidirectional pair, but `(u, v)` is not.\n\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `sum_{1 <= i < j <= k} (s_i * s_j)`.\nThis sum can be computed using the identity:\n`(sum s_i)^2 = sum(s_i^2) + 2 * sum_{i < j} (s_i * s_j)`\nSo, `sum_{i < j} (s_i * s_j) = ((sum s_i)^2 - sum(s_i^2)) / 2`.\nLet `N = min_n`. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(N^2 - sum(s_i^2)) / 2`.\nTo calculate this, we need to keep track of `sum(s_i^2)` during the calculation of `min_n`.\n\n**Algorithm Summary:**\n1. Read `p`.\n2. If `p == 0`, print `0 0` and exit.\n3. Initialize `min_n = 0`, `sum_sq_s = 0`, `current_p = p`.\n4. While `current_p > 0`:\n   a. Calculate `s = (1 + math.isqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) // 2`.\n   b. Add `s` to `min_n`.\n   c. Add `s * s` to `sum_sq_s`.\n   d. Subtract `s * (s - 1) // 2` from `current_p`.\n5. Calculate `max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_n * min_n - sum_sq_s) // 2`.\n6. Print `min_n` and `max_unidirectional_pairs`.\n\n**Example `p=3`:**\n1. `p=3`.\n2. `min_n = 0`, `sum_sq_s = 0`, `current_p = 3`.\n3. Loop 1:\n   a. `s = (1 + math.isqrt(1 + 8*3)) // 2 = (1 + math.isqrt(25)) // 2 = (1 + 5) // 2 = 3`.\n   b. `min_n = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n   c. `sum_sq_s = 0 + 3*3 = 9`.\n   d. `current_p = 3 - (3*2 // 2) = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n4. `current_p` is 0, loop ends.\n5. `max_unidirectional_pairs = (3*3 - 9) // 2 = (9 - 9) // 2 = 0`.\n6. Output: `3 0`.\n\n**Example `p=4`:**\n1. `p=4`.\n2. `min_n = 0`, `sum_sq_s = 0`, `current_p = 4`.\n3. Loop 1:\n   a. `s = (1 + math.isqrt(1 + 8*4)) // 2 = (1 + math.isqrt(33)) // 2 = (1 + 5) // 2 = 3`.\n   b. `min_n = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n   c. `sum_sq_s = 0 + 3*3 = 9`.\n   d. `current_p = 4 - (3*2 // 2) = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n4. Loop 2:\n   a. `s = (1 + math.isqrt(1 + 8*1)) // 2 = (1 + math.isqrt(9)) // 2 = (1 + 3) // 2 = 2`.\n   b. `min_n = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n   c. `sum_sq_s = 9 + 2*2 = 13`.\n   d. `current_p = 1 - (2*1 // 2) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n5. `current_p` is 0, loop ends.\n6. `max_unidirectional_pairs = (5*5 - 13) // 2 = (25 - 13) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.\n7. Output: `5 6`.\n\nThese match the example outputs.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    min_n = 0\n    sum_sq_s = 0  # Sum of squares of SCC sizes (s_i^2)\n    \n    current_p = p\n\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest integer s such that s * (s - 1) / 2 <= current_p\n        # This is equivalent to finding the largest s such that s^2 - s - 2 * current_p <= 0.\n        # The positive root of s^2 - s - 2 * current_p = 0 is (1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2.\n        # So, s should be floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2).\n        \n        # Use math.isqrt for integer square root to avoid floating point precision issues.\n        discriminant = 1 + 8 * current_p\n        isqrt_val = math.isqrt(discriminant)\n        \n        s = (1 + isqrt_val) // 2\n        \n        # Add s to the total number of nodes\n        min_n += s\n        \n        # Add s^2 to the sum of squares of SCC sizes\n        sum_sq_s += s * s\n        \n        # Subtract the pairs contributed by this SCC from current_p\n        current_p -= s * (s - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum number of unidirectional pairs\n    # This is (N^2 - sum(s_i^2)) / 2, where N = min_n\n    max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_n * min_n - sum_sq_s) // 2\n    \n    print(min_n, max_unidirectional_pairs)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
