    "thought": "**The Essence of the Ternary String Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this interesting ternary string problem, and my main focus is on finding the lexicographically smallest arrangement. My immediate instinct is to look at the allowed swaps: '0' and '1' can swap if they're next to each other, and the same goes for '1' and '2'. The big restriction, of course, is that '0' and '2' can *never* swap directly. That's the core of the challenge.\n\nMy initial thought is to make all the '0's go as far left as possible and then the '1's, and then the '2's. That's the lexicographic order. But the \"0 and 2\" restriction throws a wrench into that.\n\nSo, I start thinking about the relative order of the digits. \"0\" and \"1\" can switch freely. So can \"1\" and \"2\". But the important part is that a \"0\" and a \"2\" can *never* switch positions. This means that if a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, they *must* appear in that order in the final result. The same idea goes for a '2' appearing before a '0'.\n\nThis \"relative order\" preservation is key. I'm visualizing the string as being partitioned. All '0's are moving to the left, all '2's are going to the right, and the '1's are floating in the middle.\n\nHowever, I'm now realizing that is not quite right because the '1's can be blocked by a '2' if it comes before a '0' and blocks the '1' from its path.\n\nI need to rethink the role of '1's.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Swapping '0's and '2's directly is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1', and vice versa.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2', and vice versa.\n\nThe crucial constraint is that '0' and '2' cannot swap directly. This implies that the relative order of any '0' and any '2' is invariant. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if a '2' appears before a '0', their relative order is fixed.\n\nConsider the '1's. A '1' can move past any '0' and any '2'. This means '1's are very flexible. They can move to any position in the string, as long as they don't violate the relative order of '0's and '2's. However, since '1's can move past both '0's and '2's, they effectively don't block the movement of '0's or '2's relative to other '0's or '2's.\n\nFor example, if we have `012`, `0` cannot move past `2`. But `1` can move past `0` to get `102`, and `1` can move past `2` to get `021`. From `102`, `1` can move past `2` to get `120`. From `021`, `1` can move past `0` to get `201`.\nNotice that `012` -> `021` and `012` -> `102`.\nThe relative order of `0` and `2` is preserved. `0` always comes before `2`.\n\nSince we want the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each character:\n- Count all '0's.\n- Count all '1's.\n- Count all '2's.\n\nConsider the '1's:\nSince '1's can move past '0's and '2's, they can essentially be grouped together and placed anywhere without affecting the relative order of '0's and '2's.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first.\nAll '0's can be moved to the very beginning of the string, *unless* they are blocked by a '2'.\nSimilarly, all '2's can be moved to the very end of the string, *unless* they are blocked by a '0'.\n\nThe invariant relative order of '0's and '2's means that the sequence of '0's and '2's (ignoring '1's) is fixed. For example, if the string is \"010210\", the sequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\". This sequence cannot change.\n\nSince '1's can move past both '0's and '2's, they can effectively be gathered and inserted at any point in the string formed by '0's and '2's.\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string, all '0's should come first, then all '1's, then all '2's.\nHowever, the '0'-'2' relative order constraint prevents this ideal form directly.\n\nThe simplest approach is to realize that all '1's can be moved to any position relative to each other, and they can move past any '0' or '2'. This means all '1's can be grouped together.\nWhere should this group of '1's be placed to achieve the lexicographically smallest string?\nWe want '0's to come first. So, all '0's that are not blocked by a '2' should come first.\nThen, we want '1's.\nThen, '2's.\n\nLet's find the first '2' in the string.\n- All '0's appearing before this first '2' can be moved to the beginning of the string.\n- All '0's appearing after this first '2' cannot move past it.\n- All '2's appearing before any '0' cannot move past that '0'.\n\nThis problem simplifies significantly if we consider what happens to the '1's. Since '1's can move past '0's and '2's, they can be collected.\nAll '0's can move left past '1's. All '2's can move right past '1's.\nThe crucial observation is that all '1's can be moved to *any* position relative to the '0's and '2's, as long as they don't change the relative order of '0's and '2's.\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. We want to put as many '0's as possible at the beginning.\n2. Then, we want '1's.\n3. Then, '2's.\n\nConsider the string without '1's. Let's call this `s_no_1`. For example, if `s = \"100210\"`, then `s_no_1 = \"0020\"`.\nThe relative order of characters in `s_no_1` is fixed. We cannot change `0020` to `0200` or `2000`.\nNow, where do the '1's go?\nSince '1's are \"flexible\", they can be inserted anywhere into `s_no_1`.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nSo, we should place all the '1's *after* all the '0's that appear *before* the first '2' in `s_no_1`.\nMore precisely, we find the first '2' in the original string `s`. All '0's that appear before this '2' can be moved to the beginning. All '1's can be moved to any position.\n\nThe optimal strategy is:\n1. Collect all '0's from the input string.\n2. Collect all '1's from the input string.\n3. Collect all '2's from the input string.\n\nConstruct the output string:\n- Append all '0's that appear *before the first '2'* in the original string.\n- Then, append all the '1's.\n- Then, append all '2's and any '0's that appeared *after the first '2'* in the original string, maintaining their relative order.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n1. Build a string of all '0's.\n2. Find the position of the first '2' in the original string `s`. If there are no '2's, all '0's and '1's can be arranged as `0...01...1`.\n3. If there are '2's:\n   - All '0's that appear in `s` *before* the first '2' can be moved to the very beginning.\n   - All '1's can be grouped together. To make the string lexicographically smallest, they should come after all possible '0's.\n   - All '2's, and any '0's that appear *after* the first '2', must maintain their relative order.\n\nLet's refine this.\nThe structure of the final string will be:\n(some '0's) + (all '1's) + (remaining '0's and '2's in their original relative order).\n\nWhy?\n- All '1's can be moved past any '0' or '2'. This means they can be grouped together.\n- To make the string lexicographically smallest, these grouped '1's should be placed as far left as possible, but *after* any '0's that can precede them.\n- Any '0' that appears before *any* '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning, past any '1's.\n- Once a '0' is followed by a '2' (e.g., `...0...2...`), this `0` cannot move past this `2`.\n- So, all '0's that appear before the *first* '2' in the original string `s` can be moved to the absolute beginning.\n- After these initial '0's, we have a choice for the '1's. Placing them next is optimal for lexicographical order.\n- After all the '1's, we must place the remaining '0's and '2's. These are the '0's that were originally after the first '2', and all the '2's. Their relative order must be preserved.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n1. Count the total number of '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `count_ones`.\n2. Initialize an empty list or string `result`.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n   - If the current character `c` is '0', append '0' to `result`.\n   - If the current character `c` is '2':\n     - Append all `count_ones` '1's to `result`.\n     - Then, append all remaining characters from `s` (from `c` onwards) to `result`, but skip any '1's (as they have already been added).\n     - Break the loop (the rest of the string is just appended).\n4. If the loop finishes without finding any '2's (i.e., `s` contained only '0's and '1's), then append all `count_ones` '1's to `result`.\n5. Print `result`.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `count_ones = 2`\n2. `result = \"\"`\n3. Iterate:\n   - `s[0] = '1'`: Skip (it's a '1', we'll add all '1's later).\n   - `s[1] = '0'`: `result = \"0\"`.\n   - `s[2] = '0'`: `result = \"00\"`.\n   - `s[3] = '2'`:\n     - Append `count_ones` '1's: `result = \"0011\"`.\n     - Append remaining characters from `s[3]` onwards, skipping '1's:\n       - `s[3] = '2'`: `result = \"00112\"`.\n       - `s[4] = '1'`: Skip.\n       - `s[5] = '0'`: `result = \"001120\"`.\n     - Break.\n4. Final `result = \"001120\"`.\n\nExample: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `count_ones = 4`\n2. `result = \"\"`\n3. Iterate:\n   - `s[0] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[1] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[2] = '2'`:\n     - Append `count_ones` '1's: `result = \"1111\"`.\n     - Append remaining characters from `s[2]` onwards, skipping '1's:\n       - `s[2] = '2'`: `result = \"11112\"`.\n       - `s[3] = '2'`: `result = \"111122\"`.\n       - `s[4] = '2'`: `result = \"1111222\"`.\n       - `s[5] = '1'`: Skip.\n       - `s[6] = '2'`: `result = \"11112222\"`.\n       - `s[7] = '1'`: Skip.\n     - Break.\n4. Final `result = \"11112222\"`.\n\nExample: `s = \"20\"`\n1. `count_ones = 0`\n2. `result = \"\"`\n3. Iterate:\n   - `s[0] = '2'`:\n     - Append `count_ones` '1's (0 '1's): `result = \"\"`.\n     - Append remaining characters from `s[0]` onwards, skipping '1's:\n       - `s[0] = '2'`: `result = \"2\"`.\n       - `s[1] = '0'`: `result = \"20\"`.\n     - Break.\n4. Final `result = \"20\"`.\n\nExample: `s = \"00110\"` (no '2's)\n1. `count_ones = 2`\n2. `result = \"\"`\n3. Iterate:\n   - `s[0] = '0'`: `result = \"0\"`.\n   - `s[1] = '0'`: `result = \"00\"`.\n   - `s[2] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[3] = '1'`: Skip.\n   - `s[4] = '0'`: `result = \"000\"`.\n   - Loop finishes.\n4. Append `count_ones` '1's: `result = \"00011\"`.\n5. Final `result = \"00011\"`.\n\nThis logic seems correct and covers all cases.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = s.count('1')\n    \n    result_parts = []\n    \n    found_first_two = False\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            if not found_first_two:\n                result_parts.append('0')\n            # If '0' appears after the first '2', it will be handled\n            # when we append the remaining part of the string.\n        elif char == '2':\n            # This is the first '2' encountered.\n            # All '1's should be inserted here.\n            result_parts.append('1' * count_ones)\n            \n            # Now, append the rest of the string, but filter out '1's\n            # since they've already been placed.\n            # We need to append '2' and all subsequent '0's and '2's.\n            # The 'char' itself is '2', so we append it.\n            result_parts.append('2')\n            found_first_two = True\n        # If char is '1', we skip it here.
