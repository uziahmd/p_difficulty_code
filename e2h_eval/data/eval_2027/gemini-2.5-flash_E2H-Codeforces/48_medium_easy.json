            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this Python script:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to write a script that converts a number from one base to another. The input will be the original base (`a`), the target base (`b`), and the number itself (`c`) in base `a`. Base `b` can either be an integer or \"R\" for Roman numerals. The input format is fixed, and the constraints are pretty clear (base values within specific ranges, length of the input number, and maximum values in base 10). I need to make sure my code handles those constraints.\n\n**Here's the breakdown of the steps I need to take:**\n\n1.  **Parse the input:** Read the first line to get `a` and `b`. If `b` is \"R\", it's Roman; otherwise, it's an integer. Then, read the number `c`.\n\n2.  **Convert to Base 10:** The most straightforward approach is to convert the input number `c` from base `a` to base 10. I need a helper function to do the conversion correctly, taking care of the digits '0'-'9' and 'A'-'O'. This seems simple: iterate from left to right, multiplying the base 10 value by `a` and then adding the new digit.\n\n3.  **Convert to Target Base:** If `b` is an integer, I need to convert the base 10 number to the target base `b`. This is standard, using the modulo operator to get the remainders and repeatedly dividing by the base. I'll need another helper function here.\n\n4.  **Convert to Roman Numerals:** If `b` is \"R\", convert the base 10 number to its Roman numeral representation. I'll need a way to build this output and a helper function for this. I can make a list of Roman numeral value pairs in descending order to help with this. The problem also specifies the maximum value, so I need to make sure my logic respects this constraint (i.e., less than or equal to 3000).\n\n5.  **Output:** Finally, print the result. The problem specifically asks to omit any leading zeros in the output, so I have to ensure that is the case when printing.\n\n**The code flow, step by step:**\n\n1.  I'll start by defining the helper functions:\n    *   `get_digit_value(char)` to get the integer value of a character (handling '0'-'9' and 'A'-'O').\n    *   `get_digit_char(value)` to do the opposite of get_digit_value to represent the target base\n    *   `to_base10(n_str, base_a)` to convert a number string from a given base to base 10.\n    *   `from_base10(n_decimal, base_b)` to convert base 10 to any other base.\n    *   `to_roman(n_decimal)` for the Roman numeral conversion, using the lookup table.\n\n2.  Then, in the `solve()` function, I'll read the input, parse `a`, `b`, and `c`, call the corresponding conversion functions.\n\n3.  I have to deal with the special case when the target base is \"R\".\n\n4.  Finally, print the result.\n\nI have to carefully design the helper functions to make sure they handle the edge cases like:\n\n*   Leading zeros in the input number `c`\n*   Zero as the base 10 result.\n*   The valid value range for Roman numerals is 1-3000. The problem statement won't have 0 as Roman numbers, so I have to handle it anyway in case.\n\nI'll test my code with the examples to be sure. I'm thinking of edge cases: What happens if I get a base 10 0 as an output? What happens when I convert from a very large base `a` with the max digits to smaller `b`.\n\nAnd I will finally write the code. I will use helper functions for readability. I'll implement each step in this way.\n",
