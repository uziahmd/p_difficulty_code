Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking Process for the Leha's Vacation Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem where we need to find two non-intersecting vouchers whose durations add up to a specific vacation length, `x`, and minimize the total cost. Let's break this down.\n\n**Understanding the Core Challenge:** The key is to efficiently find a *complementary* voucher for each voucher we consider.  A brute-force approach (checking every pair) would be way too slow, given the constraints of up to 200,000 vouchers.  We need something smarter, likely involving some kind of pre-processing or data structure.\n\n**Initial Ideas & Data Structures:**  My first thought is, can we group vouchers by duration? This might allow us to quickly find vouchers with the \"missing\" duration needed to reach `x`.  So, I considered a `vouchers_by_duration` dictionary (or similar data structure) to store vouchers based on their length.  However, the non-intersection condition (`ri < lj` or `rj < li`) complicates things.  We need to ensure vouchers *don't overlap*.\n\n**The \"Sweep-Line\" Approach:**  Since we're dealing with start and end times (`li`, `ri`), a sweep-line approach seems like a good fit. I began thinking about iterating through potential 'split points' in time (days), but quickly realized this isn't very helpful as vouchers have varying lengths.\n\n**Refining the Sweep-Line:** Then I got the idea to process vouchers based on their start or end times.  For each day, I would maintain a data structure that keeps track of the *minimum cost* of vouchers ending *before* that day for a given duration.  This sounds like dynamic programming or a prefix minimum kind of computation.\n\n**Optimizing Data Structures:** The initial approach involved a `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at` array with two dimensions (duration and day) which got prohibitively large with `2 * 10^5`. I realized, however, that we *don't* need to store minimum costs for all days. We only care about vouchers that ended *before* a start day. That prompted the core design.\n\n**The Solution Design:**  I decided to create two key structures: `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`.  These are arrays (lists) where the index is the start or end day, and the array at each index holds the relevant vouchers.  My \"sweep-line\" is now going to process days one by one. I use a `min_cost_for_duration` array (of size `x+1`) to store the minimum cost of a voucher with each duration that *ended before* the current day.  When I process a voucher, I look to see if I can pair it up to make up `x` by checking `min_cost_for_duration`.\n\n**Implementation Details:** The core logic now involves iterating through the days. For each day, I first update the `min_cost_for_duration` array with the vouchers that *ended* the day before.  Then I look at vouchers that *start* on the current day. I compute the complementary duration and check if I have a matching \"previous\" voucher stored in `min_cost_for_duration`.  If so, I can update the minimum total cost `ans`.\n\n**Complexity and Proof of Correctness:** This approach appears to be `O(N)` for preprocessing (populating the start and end day structures), and `O(N)` for the main loop (iterating through vouchers), for a total time complexity of `O(N)`. Space complexity is also linear, mostly due to the voucher storage.  It appears correct because I am checking for the condition, and only pairs which satisfy that are allowed.  I have also walked through example cases to ensure its validity. The final crucial point is the initial array set to infinity.\n\nLet's write it up and see if it works!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct vouchers `i` and `j` such that:\n1. They do not intersect: `ri < lj` or `rj < li`.\n2. The sum of their durations is exactly `x`: `(ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x`.\n3. Their total cost `costi + costj` is minimized.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we should print -1.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- `n, x <= 2 * 10^5`\n- `li, ri <= 2 * 10^5`\n- `costi <= 10^9`\n\n**Approach: Sweep Line Algorithm**\n\nThe key challenge is efficiently finding a pair that satisfies the non-intersection and duration sum conditions while minimizing cost. A brute-force O(N^2) approach is too slow. We can use a sweep-line algorithm that processes events (voucher starts and ends) chronologically by day.\n\nLet `MAX_COORD` be the maximum possible value for `li` or `ri`, which is `2 * 10^5`.\n\nWe'll maintain an array, `min_cost_for_duration`, where `min_cost_for_duration[d]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has *already ended* before the current day in our sweep.\n\nHere's the detailed algorithm:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Initialize `min_total_cost = float('inf')` to store the minimum total cost found.\n    *   Create two lists of lists:\n        *   `vouchers_by_start_day[day]`: Stores `(r, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that start on `day`.\n        *   `vouchers_by_end_day[day]`: Stores `(l, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that end on `day`.\n        These lists will be indexed from `1` to `MAX_COORD`.\n    *   Initialize `min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)`. This array will store the minimum cost for a voucher of a specific duration `d` that has ended *strictly before* the current `day` of the sweep. Its size is `x + 1` because durations can range from `1` to `x`.\n\n2.  **Populate Voucher Lists:**\n    *   Read `n` vouchers. For each voucher `(li, ri, costi)`:\n        *   Calculate its `duration = ri - li + 1`.\n        *   Add `(ri, costi, duration)` to `vouchers_by_start_day[li]`.\n        *   Add `(li, costi, duration)` to `vouchers_by_end_day[ri]`.\n\n3.  **Sweep Line:**\n    *   Iterate `day` from `1` to `MAX_COORD`:\n        a.  **Process Vouchers Ending at `day - 1`:**\n            For each voucher `(l_prev, cost_prev, d_prev)` in `vouchers_by_end_day[day - 1]`:\n            This voucher has just ended. It is now available to be paired with any voucher starting at `day` or later.\n            Update `min_cost_for_duration[d_prev] = min(min_cost_for_duration[d_prev], cost_prev)`.\n            We only care about `d_prev` if `1 <= d_prev <= x`.\n\n        b.  **Process Vouchers Starting at `day`:**\n            For each voucher `(r_curr, cost_curr, d_curr)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[day]`:\n            This voucher `v_curr` starts today. We need to find a preceding voucher `v_prev` such that:\n            *   `v_prev` ended before `day` (which is handled by `min_cost_for_duration`).\n            *   `duration(v_prev) + d_curr = x`.\n            *   `cost(v_prev) + cost_curr` is minimized.\n\n            Calculate the `d_needed = x - d_curr`.\n            If `1 <= d_needed <= x`:\n                If `min_cost_for_duration[d_needed]` is not `float('inf')` (meaning a suitable preceding voucher exists):\n                    Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_curr + min_cost_for_duration[d_needed])`.\n\n4.  **Result:**\n    *   After the loop, if `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no valid pair was found, so print `-1`.\n    *   Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   Initializing lists and arrays: O(MAX_COORD + X).\n*   Populating `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`: O(N) as each voucher is processed twice.\n*   Sweep line loop: Runs `MAX_COORD` times. Inside the loop, each voucher is processed twice across all iterations (once when its end day is `day-1`, once when its start day is `day`). Array lookups/updates are O(1).\n*   Total time complexity: O(N + X + MAX_COORD). Given `N, X, MAX_COORD <= 2 * 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n*   `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`: O(N + MAX_COORD) for storing all vouchers and the list structures.\n*   `min_cost_for_duration`: O(X).\n*   Total space complexity: O(N + X + MAX_COORD).
