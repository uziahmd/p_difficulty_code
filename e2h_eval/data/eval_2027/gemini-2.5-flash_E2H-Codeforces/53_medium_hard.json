It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string. The string is relatively short, with a maximum length of 100 characters, and it consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Crucially, the occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\nMy initial approach involves breaking down the problem into these steps:\n1.  **Iterate through all possible substrings.** A string of length *N* has *N*(N+1)/2 substrings, which is computationally manageable since *N* is small.\n2.  **For each substring, count its occurrences.**  I need to check how many times a given substring appears in the original string.\n3.  **Keep track of the maximum length.** As I find substrings that appear at least twice, I'll store the length of the longest one.\n\nSince the string's length is at most 100, the total number of substrings, *N*(N+1)/2, is relatively small (at most 5050).\n\nNow, let's refine this approach to make it more efficient. I'm focusing on the \"longest\" part, which suggests I might want to start checking for the longest possible substrings and work my way down, or I can simply loop through substrings and update the max.  Since the string length is small, I'll iterate through all substrings, but I'll optimize the counting part.\n\nA substring is defined by its start and end positions, or by its start position and length.\nLet the input string be *S* of length *N*.\n\nI'll use nested loops:\n*   **Outer loop:** Iterate through all possible starting positions *i* from 0 to *N-1*.\n*   **Inner loop:** Iterate through all possible ending positions *j* from *i+1* to *N*. This will define the substring *S[i:j]*.\n\nFor each substring *sub = S[i:j]* with length *sub_len = j-i*, I need to count how many times it appears in *S*.\nTo do this:\n*   **Innermost loop:** Iterate through all possible starting positions *k* from 0 to *N-sub_len*.\n*   If *S[k : k + sub_len]* is equal to *sub*, increment a counter.\n\nIf the counter is 2 or greater, this substring is a candidate, and I'll update the *max_len* with the longer one.\n\nLet's work through an example \"ababa\":\n`i=0`:\n  `j=1`: sub = \"a\", count = 3. max_len = 1.\n  `j=2`: sub = \"ab\", count = 2. max_len = 2.\n  `j=3`: sub = \"aba\", count = 2. max_len = 3.\n  `j=4`: sub = \"abab\", count = 1.\n  `j=5`: sub = \"ababa\", count = 1.\n`i=1`:\n  `j=2`: sub = \"b\", count = 2. max_len = 3.\n  `j=3`: sub = \"ba\", count = 2. max_len = 3.\n  `j=4`: sub = \"bab\", count = 1.\n  `j=5`: sub = \"baba\", count = 1.\n...\n\nThe final answer should be 3. This approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's consider the complexity. This approach has three nested loops, where the outer two loops go up to N, and the innermost one goes up to N. This makes the overall complexity **O(N<sup>3</sup>)**, which is manageable for *N* up to 100 (which gives 1 million operations, well within typical time limits).\n\nHowever, I need a better way to do the substring counting. Using something like `string.count()` won't work, because it will count *non-overlapping* occurrences, and my problem states that the occurrences *can* overlap.\n\nI need a function that specifically counts overlapping occurrences. So, I will create a helper function that does just that:\n\n```python\ndef count_overlapping_occurrences(main_string, sub_string):\n    count = 0\n    start = 0\n    while True:\n        idx = main_string.find(sub_string, start)\n        if idx == -1:\n            break\n        count += 1\n        start = idx + 1\n    return count\n```\nUsing this approach, the nested loops remain O(N^2), but the",
