For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify these three-note chords as major, minor, or something \"strange.\"  Let's break this down. First, I have to think about the fundamental representation of these notes. It's clear that the easiest way to work with them mathematically is to assign them numerical values. I'll map C to 0, C# to 1, and so on, all the way up to H as 11. That gives me a clean, cyclical representation within the 12-semitone scale.\n\nNext, distance calculation is key. I'll need to define a function to determine the distance between two notes, and the key will be to make sure it is always calculated *upwards*.  The formula `(note2_val - note1_val + 12) % 12` does the trick, ensuring the distance wraps around the scale correctly. For example, C to E will correctly yield 4 semitones and E to C will yield 8.\n\nThe input will be three space-separated note names. So, I will need to process this string into a list of notes. I'll need to use the numerical mapping to convert each of these to their semitone values. Then I'll store them in a list, making it easy to work with.\n\nFinally, the crux of the problem: determining whether the triad is major or minor. I know a major triad consists of a root, a major third (4 semitones up), and a perfect fifth (7 semitones up). A minor triad has a root, a minor third (3 semitones up), and a perfect fifth (7 semitones up). Therefore, I'll need to see if I can rearrange the three notes so the distances between them match one of these patterns. Let me start thinking about the major and minor triad arrangements in terms of semitone differences.\n",
