There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Zoning Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem. My goal is a Python script that efficiently figures out the maximum profit we can get from building houses, given some specific constraints. Here's how I'm thinking about it:\n\nFirst, let's establish the key elements. We have `n` spots, each with a potential height (`a`) between `0` and `h`. The profit for a house is simply `a^2`. There are also `m` restrictions. Each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` means the *tallest* house between spots `l_i` and `r_i` can't exceed `x_i`.\n\nThe size constraints (`n, h, m <= 50`) are interesting. They suggest that a fairly straightforward polynomial-time algorithm, possibly even cubic or quartic, is likely to be performant enough to pass.\n\nNow, the crucial insight lies in how the restrictions interact. If multiple restrictions overlap a spot, the *most restrictive* one applies.  Meaning, for a spot `j`, its maximum allowed height is the minimum of `h` and all the `x_i` values that cover that spot. If there are no restrictions on `j`, then `h` is the max.\n\nMy plan is to build an array, `max_allowed_heights`, which will hold the maximum height allowed for each spot. Initially, all elements in this array will be set to `h` (the global max). I'll then process each restriction. For each restriction `(l, r, x)`, I'll iterate from `l` to `r` and update the corresponding element in `max_allowed_heights` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.\n\nFinally, to maximize profit, I'll simply build each house to its maximum allowed height (given by `max_allowed_heights`). Since the profit function is a square, the higher the house, the greater the profit. The total profit will be the sum of the squares of these maximum allowed heights for each spot. It's a greedy approach, and it looks like it will provide the correct answer efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot, we can build a house with an integer height `a` between `0` and `h`. The profit for a house of height `a` is `a^2`. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house within a given range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on the height of a house at a specific spot `j`.\n1.  **Global maximum height**: The height of any house `height[j]` must be at most `h`.\n2.  **Zoning restrictions**: For each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, if spot `j` is within the range `[l_i, r_i]` (i.e., `l_i <= j <= r_i`), then `height[j]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nIf multiple restrictions apply to a single spot `j`, say `height[j] <= x_1` and `height[j] <= x_2`, then `height[j]` must satisfy both, meaning `height[j] <= min(x_1, x_2)`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, the maximum allowed height `max_h_j` is determined by the minimum of `h` and all `x_i` values from restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` that cover spot `j`.\nFormally, `max_h_j = min(h, min({x_i | 1 <= i <= m, l_i <= j <= r_i}))`. If no restrictions cover spot `j`, then `max_h_j = h`.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, since the profit function `a^2` is monotonically increasing for `a >= 0`, we should choose the largest possible height for each house. Therefore, for each spot `j`, we should build a house with height `max_h_j`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize an array `actual_max_height` of size `n`. For each spot `j` (from `1` to `n`), set `actual_max_height[j-1] = h`. This accounts for the global maximum height constraint. (Using 0-indexed array for convenience, so spot `j` corresponds to index `j-1`).\n2.  Iterate through each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n    For each spot `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive), update `actual_max_height[j-1] = min(actual_max_height[j-1], x_i)`. This ensures that all restrictions are met for each individual spot.\n3.  After processing all restrictions, `actual_max_height[j-1]` will contain the maximum possible height for a house at spot `j` that satisfies all constraints.\n4.  Calculate the total profit by summing `(actual_max_height[j-1])^2` for all `j` from `1` to `n`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `(1, 1, 1)`\n2. `(2, 2, 3)`\n3. `(3, 3, 2)`\n\n1.  Initialize `actual_max_height = [3, 3, 3]` (all spots can initially be height `h=3`).\n\n2.  Process restrictions:\n    *   Restriction `(1, 1, 1)`:\n        For spot 1 (index 0): `actual_max_height[0] = min(actual_max_height[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n        `actual_max_height` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction `(2, 2, 3)`:\n        For spot 2 (index 1): `actual_max_height[1] = min(actual_max_height[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n        `actual_max_height` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction `(3, 3, 2)`:\n        For spot 3 (index 2): `actual_max_height[2] = min(actual_max_height[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n        `actual_max_height` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3.  All restrictions processed. The optimal heights are `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n4.  Calculate total profit:\n    `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: `O(n)`\n*   Processing restrictions: `m` restrictions. Each restriction iterates `r_i - l_i + 1` spots. In the worst case, `r_i - l_i + 1` can be `n`. So, this step is `O(m * n)`.\n*   Calculating total profit: `O(n)`\nTotal time complexity: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`.\nGiven `n, h, m <= 50`, `m*n` is at most `50 * 50 = 2500`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(n)` for `actual_max_height` array.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # Initially, each spot can have a height up to 'h'.\n    # Using 0-indexed array, so actual_max_height[i] corresponds to spot i+1.\n    actual_max_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each zoning restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        # Restrictions are 1-indexed, convert to 0-indexed for array access\n        # For each spot j from l to r (inclusive), update its maximum allowed height\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            actual_max_height[i] = min(actual_max_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height_val in actual_max_height:\n        # To maximize profit, we choose the maximum allowed height for each spot\n        # Profit for height 'a' is a^2\n        total_profit += height_val ** 2\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
