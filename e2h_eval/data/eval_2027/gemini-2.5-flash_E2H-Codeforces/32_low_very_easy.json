Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Stabilizing an Array: My Analytical Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  Let me break down my thought process.  The core of the problem is: given an array of integers, remove *exactly* one element and minimize the \"instability,\" which is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the *remaining* array.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We're dealing with arrays that can be quite large (up to 10^5 elements), and the integer values themselves can also be substantial (up to 10^5). Efficiency will be key.\n\nMy intuition says sorting the array is a smart move.  It allows for direct access to the min and max elements, and allows quick comparison of the sorted positions.\n\nThe instability, as defined, hinges on the range of values after removal. I know that if I remove an element in the \"middle\" of the array, I'm not going to change the min or max, which means the instability won't change at all.  Therefore, focus should be on manipulating the boundaries.\n\nHere's my logic:\n\n1. **Sort the array.** Let's call the sorted array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\n\n2. **Consider the edge cases.**\n   *   If I remove the smallest element (`a_1`), the new minimum is `a_2`, and the new maximum is `a_n`. Instability becomes `a_n - a_2`.\n   *   If I remove the largest element (`a_n`), the new minimum is `a_1`, and the new maximum is `a_{n-1}`. Instability becomes `a_{n-1} - a_1`.\n   *   If I remove any other element, the instability will not change.\n\n3. **Compare.** I need to compare the two \"edge removal\" scenarios. The lower of those two results will be the minimum instability possible.\n\nI'm pretty confident in this approach.  The sorting step is O(n log n), and everything else is O(1) or O(n) (if we consider removing any element), so the overall complexity should be reasonable, and I will be able to solve the problem efficiently. I also need to make sure my logic covers when the input array has size 2. In that case, the answer would be 0. Let me make sure that my logic works in that case too.\n",
