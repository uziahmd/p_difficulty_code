    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down.** The goal is to figure out how many cells get gilded on a rectangular plate, depending on its size and the number of rings we apply.\n\nWe're given the plate's width (`w`) and height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`). Each ring is a border around a smaller and smaller rectangle within the plate. The dimensions of these inner rectangles are key: for the *i*-th ring (remembering that *i* starts at 1), the inner rectangle is `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  \n\nTo get the number of gilded cells for a single ring, we need to calculate the perimeter (or border) of that inner rectangle.  A rectangle's perimeter is `2 * width + 2 * height - 4`. The \"-4\" is to account for the corners being counted twice. So, for the *i*-th ring, the number of cells is `2 * (w - 4(i - 1)) + 2 * (h - 4(i - 1)) - 4`.\n\nThe total number of gilded cells is simply the sum of the cells for each of the `k` rings. So, we loop from `i = 1` to `k`, calculate the cells in each ring's border, and add them up. That's the core of the solution. We will use a loop from `0` to `k-1` and use `4 * i` as offset to simplify. \n\nWe need to make sure the dimensions remain valid. The constraint provided guarantees that the inner rectangles won't become too small, i.e., at least 3x3 so the formula applies. The code implements this logic directly and efficiently. We will test a few cases to be sure.\n\nLet's test the cases with the given inputs. And the constraint is `min(w,h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3`.\n\nWe go through the calculations to ensure accuracy!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings.\n\nEach ring `i` (1-indexed) is defined as the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of this inner rectangle for the `i`-th ring are `(w - 4(i - 1))` by `(h - 4(i - 1))`. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nLet's break down the calculation for a single ring:\nFor the `i`-th ring:\n1.  **Calculate current dimensions:**\n    Let `current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)`\n    Let `current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)`\n    The term `4 * (i - 1)` represents the total reduction in dimensions from the original `w` and `h`. For `i=1`, the reduction is `4 * 0 = 0`, so `current_w = w` and `current_h = h`. For `i=2`, the reduction is `4 * 1 = 4`, so `current_w = w - 4` and `current_h = h - 4`. This means the second ring's rectangle starts 2 cells in from each side of the first ring's rectangle.\n\n2.  **Calculate cells in the border:**\n    The number of cells forming the border of a rectangle with dimensions `current_w` by `current_h` is `2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`. This formula accounts for the four corners being counted twice when summing `2 * current_w` (top and bottom rows) and `2 * current_h` (left and right columns).\n\nThe total number of gilded cells is the sum of cells for all `k` rings. We can iterate from `i = 1` to `k`, calculate the cells for each ring, and add them to a running total.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (w=7, h=9, k=2):**\n\n*   **Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`**\n\n*   **For `i = 1` (first ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 7 - 0 = 7`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 9 - 0 = 9`\n    *   `cells_in_ring_1 = 2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 0 + 28 = 28`\n\n*   **For `i = 2` (second ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 7 - 4 = 3`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 9 - 4 = 5`\n    *   `cells_in_ring_2 = 2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\n\n*   **Loop ends.**\n*   **Final result: 40**\n\nThe constraints `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1) / 4)` ensure that `current_w` and `current_h` will always be at least 3 for any ring, so the border calculation formula is always valid. The number of rings `k` is small (at most 25), making a simple loop efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the three integers w, h, and k from a single line of input.\n    # map(int, ...) converts the space-separated strings to integers.\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    # Iterate 'k' times, once for each ring.\n    # The loop variable 'i' goes from 0 to k-1.\n    # In the problem statement, rings are 1-indexed (i.e., 1st, 2nd, ..., k-th ring).\n    # The offset for the j-th ring (1-indexed) is 4 * (j - 1).\n    # Our loop variable 'i' (0-indexed) directly corresponds to (j - 1).\n    for i in range(k):\n        # Calculate the total reduction in dimensions for the current ring.\n        # Each ring is 2 cells inward from the previous one on each side,\n        # so total reduction in width/height is 4 cells per step.\n        offset = 4 * i\n        \n        # Calculate the effective width and height of the rectangle\n        # whose border forms the current ring.\n        current_w = w - offset\n        current_h = h - offset\n        \n        # Calculate the number of cells in the border of this current_w x current_h rectangle.\n        # The formula 2 * (width + height) - 4 correctly calculates the perimeter cells\n        # by summing the lengths of the four sides and subtracting 4 to avoid double-counting the corner cells.\n        cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4\n        \n        # Add the cells of the current ring to the running total.\n        total_gilded_cells += cells_in_current_ring\n        \n    # Print the final sum of gilded cells.\n    print(total_gilded_cells)\n\n# Ensure the solve function is called when the script is executed.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
