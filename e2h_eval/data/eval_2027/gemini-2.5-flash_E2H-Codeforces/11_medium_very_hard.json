A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Soft Drinking Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Soft Drinking\" problem and my immediate thought is: \"This looks like a classic resource allocation problem\".  I need to figure out what's the limiting factor here.  They're giving me numbers for friends, drinks, limes, and salt – all the ingredients for a toast, basically.  The core of this is about finding how many complete toasts *each friend* can make, given that everyone needs the same amount of everything.\n\nFirst, I broke down the input into the variables: `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `d`, `p`, `nl`, and `np`.  Then, I needed to understand the relationships. It's about finding the *minimum* available \"portions\" that can create a single \"complete\" resource.\n\nI started by calculating the total amount of each resource I have – total drink, total lime slices, and total salt.  That's straightforward multiplication.  But then, the trick is to figure out the *portions* available per \"individual toast\".\n\nFor drink, I calculated `(k * l) // nl` because each friend consumes the same amount. For limes, it's just `c * d`. The amount of salt available is `p // np` because each friend consumes a set amount of the ingredient. These computations give the maximum number of toasts that *could* be made with one resource, but we need the minimum.\n\nThe key is realizing that the number of toasts is *limited by the scarcity of the resources*.  I then found the *minimum* of those individual portions:  `min(drink_portions, lime_portions, salt_portions)`.  This gives me the *total* number of toasts possible *for all the friends together*, considering all resources.\n\nFinally, since the problem specifies that everyone must make the same number of toasts, I divided that `T_total` by the number of friends, `n`. That's `T_total // n`.  Integer division is crucial here because you can't have fractional toasts! The resulting integer represents the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nI tested the approach with a few examples and worked through several edge cases, making sure my method always yielded the correct answer given the prompt's specifications. The solution also is O(1) in terms of time complexity, it is efficient and fast.\n\nThe code follows naturally from this logic. I read the input, perform the calculations, find the minimum, and then divide by the number of friends.  I was careful to use integer division throughout. The problem itself isn't that difficult, once you identify the limiting resource and work through the units carefully. The description that this is \"a very hard question\" feels like a humorous addition, since it is a straightforward calculation!\n",
