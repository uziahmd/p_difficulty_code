Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise.

    "thought": "**Flawed Flow: My Strategy for a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and I need a Python script to crack it. This is a classic graph flow problem with a few twists, and I'm thinking I've got a handle on the key elements.\n\nFirst things first: we're dealing with an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, each with an associated flow capacity `c_i`. The core task is to *direct* these edges in a way that respects the flow conservation property at all intermediate nodes (everything except the source and sink), ensures no cycles, and leverages the fact that the given capacities are part of a valid maximum flow.\n\nThe problem's structure is fairly straightforward. I have the following conditions to consider: \n1.  **Flow Conservation:** This is the heart of the matter. For all vertices except the source (1) and sink (`n`), the incoming flow *must* equal the outgoing flow. This dictates the flow balance at each internal node.\n2.  **Source Condition:** Vertex 1 (the source) has no incoming edges. This is a solid starting point; any edges connected to vertex 1 must flow *out* of it.\n3.  **No Cycles:** This is where things get interesting. The requirement for a cycle-free directed graph immediately screams \"topological sorting\". If a flow exists on a DAG, a topological ordering is implicit.\n4.  **Correct Max Flow:** This is a subtle but important constraint. It's essentially a sanity check, telling me the *total* flow entering the sink is equal to the total flow leaving the source. This is a crucial consistency check and is potentially useful to guide my decisions.\n\nMy initial thought is to tackle the \"no cycles\" condition head-on. Since vertex 1 has no incoming edges, it must be the \"start\" of any flow path. This is a crucial clue. All edges from vertex 1 *must* be directed outwards. This gives me a natural starting point to define the structure of the directed graph.\n\nI'm thinking of maintaining a \"current balance\" for each vertex. For a vertex `v`, `current_balance[v]` will equal `sum(outgoing_flow) - sum(incoming_flow)`. Initially, I don't know the direction of any edge. For each edge `(u, v)` with capacity `c`, I'll decide whether it's `u -> v` or `v -> u`. If it's `u -> v`, then `current_balance[u]` increases by `c` and `current_balance[v]` decreases by `c`. If it's `v -> u`, then the opposite happens. The goal is to get `current_balance[v]` equal to 0 for all `1 < v < n`. The source node should have a `current_balance[1]` equal to the sum of all capacities for edges connected to it.\n\nThe no-cycle constraint implies that I may need to be a bit strategic about how I build this directed graph. I'll need to figure out an approach to iteratively direct edges while ensuring that I do not accidentally create cycles. I believe a combination of topological sorting ideas and a way to carefully balance the flow is the key here. I'll need to explore a systematic way to propagate flow decisions and check for cycles as I go.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct edges of an undirected graph, given flow volumes for each edge, such that flow conservation holds for intermediate vertices, the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges, and the resulting graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We are guaranteed that a solution always exists.\n\nThe key conditions are:\n1.  **Source (vertex 1):** All edges connected to vertex 1 must be directed *away* from vertex 1. This is a strong starting point.\n2.  **Intermediate vertices (1 < v < n):** Sum of incoming flow must equal sum of outgoing flow.\n3.  **No cycles:** The resulting directed graph must be a DAG.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition, combined with the source having no incoming edges, suggests a topological ordering or a traversal strategy that builds up a DAG. Since all flow must originate from the source, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the source is a natural approach.\n\nLet's consider the flow balance for each vertex. For an intermediate vertex `v`, the total flow entering it must equal the total flow leaving it. If we decide the direction of an edge `(u, v)` with flow `c`, and it is directed `u -> v`, then `c` contributes to `v`'s incoming flow and `u`'s outgoing flow.\n\nA common technique for flow problems with conservation constraints is to track the \"net flow\" for each vertex. For each vertex `v`, let `balance[v]` be `(sum of flow on edges directed out of v) - (sum of flow on edges directed into v)`.\nInitially, all edges are undirected. Let's say for an edge `(u, v)` with flow `c`, we tentatively assume it's `u -> v`. Then `balance[u]` increases by `c` and `balance[v]` decreases by `c`. If we assume `v -> u`, then `balance[v]` increases by `c` and `balance[u]` decreases by `c`.\nFor `1 < v < n`, we need `balance[v] = 0`.\nFor `v = 1`, `balance[1]` must be the total max flow value.\nFor `v = n`, `balance[n]` must be the negative of the total max flow value.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is crucial. A simple way to ensure no cycles and satisfy the source condition is to process vertices in an order that respects the flow. Since vertex 1 has no incoming edges, all its adjacent edges *must* be directed outwards. This gives us a starting point.\n\nConsider using a traversal (like BFS or DFS) starting from vertex 1. When we visit a vertex `u` and decide to direct an edge `(u, v)` as `u -> v`, we are effectively \"pushing\" `c` units of flow from `u` to `v`. We need to ensure that `v` can handle this incoming flow by directing its own incident edges outwards, or that `v` eventually passes this flow to other vertices.\n\nA more robust approach for flow conservation and DAG requirements is to realize that for any intermediate vertex `v`, its \"net balance\" must be zero. We can track the `current_balance[v]` for each vertex `v`. Initially, `current_balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nWhen we decide an edge `(u, v)` with flow `c` is directed `u -> v`, we update `current_balance[u] += c` and `current_balance[v] -= c`.\n\nLet's use a DFS-like approach, but with a twist. We want to ensure that for any vertex `v` (other than 1 and `n`), all flow that enters `v` eventually leaves `v`. The \"no cycles\" condition implies that we can think of flow moving from \"earlier\" vertices to \"later\" vertices in a topological sort.\n\nA common strategy for problems like this is to maintain a \"flow deficit\" or \"flow surplus\" for each node.\nLet `current_flow[v]` be the net flow that has been directed *into* vertex `v` so far from edges already processed.\nInitially, `current_flow[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n\nWe can use a DFS starting from vertex 1.\nWhen DFS visits `u`:\nFor each undirected edge `(u, v)` with flow `c_idx` (original index `idx`):\n  If `v` has not been visited:\n    Recursively call DFS on `v`.\n    After `DFS(v)` returns, `current_flow[v]` will represent the total flow that `v` has received from its descendants (or passed down to its descendants) and passed up to its parent `u`.\n    If `current_flow[v]` is positive, it means `v` has a surplus of flow that it needs to send *up* to `u`. So, we direct `v -> u`. `current_flow[u] += current_flow[v]`.\n    If `current_flow[v]` is zero, it means `v` has perfectly balanced its flow internally. No flow needs to pass between `u` and `v` through this edge. This case is impossible if `c_idx > 0`.\n    If `current_flow[v]` is negative, it means `v` has a deficit of flow that it needs to receive *from* `u`. So, we direct `u -> v`. `current_flow[u] += current_flow[v]`.\n    This approach is incorrect because `current_flow[v]` is not just the flow for edge `(u,v)`. It would be the *net* flow from `v`'s entire subtree.\n\nLet's refine the DFS approach:\nWe need to track the `balance` for each vertex. For an intermediate vertex `v`, its `balance` must be 0.\nWhen we do a DFS from `u` to `v` via edge `(u,v)` with flow `c`:\n1.  We recursively call `DFS(v, u)` (passing `u` as parent to avoid going back immediately).\n2.  After `DFS(v)` returns, `v` has processed all its children in the DFS tree. `v` now knows how much flow it needs to send *up* to its parent `u` or receive *from* its parent `u` to satisfy its own conservation. Let this be `required_flow_from_v_to_u`.\n3.  If `required_flow_from_v_to_u > 0`, it means `v` needs to send this amount to `u`. So, for edge `(u,v)`, we direct `v -> u`. We set `ans[edge_idx] = 1`.\n4.  If `required_flow_from_v_to_u < 0`, it means `v` needs to receive `abs(required_flow_from_v_to_u)` from `u`. So, for edge `(u,v)`, we direct `u -> v`. We set `ans[edge_idx] = 0`.\n5.  If `required_flow_from_v_to_u = 0`, this means `v` has perfectly balanced its flow. This is impossible given `c > 0`.\n\nThis approach still doesn't quite work because the `required_flow_from_v_to_u` is not simply `c`. It's the total flow that needs to traverse the edge `(u,v)`.\n\nLet's use a `balance` array, initialized to 0 for all vertices.\nWhen we perform a DFS from `u` to `v` via edge `(u, v)` with flow `c`:\n1.  Mark `v` as visited.\n2.  Recursively call `DFS(v, u)` for all unvisited neighbors `w` of `v`.\n3.  After `DFS(v)` returns, `balance[v]` will contain the net flow that `v` has received from its children in the DFS tree.\n    *   If `balance[v] > 0`, it means `v` has received `balance[v]` units of flow from its children. To satisfy conservation, `v` must send `balance[v]` units *up* to its parent `u`. So, we direct `v -> u` for the edge `(u,v)`. We add `balance[v]` to `balance[u]`.\n    *   If `balance[v] < 0`, it means `v` needs to receive `abs(balance[v])` units of flow from its parent `u`. So, we direct `u -> v` for the edge `(u,v)`. We add `balance[v]` to `balance[u]` (which is equivalent to `balance[u] -= abs(balance[v])`).\n    *   The flow on the edge `(u,v)` is `c`. If `balance[v]` is positive, it means `v` has `balance[v]` flow to send to `u`. This `balance[v]` must be exactly `c` for the edge `(u,v)`. If `balance[v]` is negative, it means `v` needs to receive `abs(balance[v])` from `u`. This `abs(balance[v])` must be exactly `c`.\n    This implies that `balance[v]` must be `c` or `-c` after processing children.\n\nThis suggests that the `balance[v]` should accumulate the *total* flow needed to pass through `v` towards its parent.\nLet `balance[v]` track the net flow *out* of `v` via edges *within its DFS subtree*.\nInitialize `balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n\n**Corrected DFS Approach:**\n1.  Represent the graph using an adjacency list. Each entry in `adj[u]` should be a tuple `(v, flow_c, edge_idx)`.\n2.  Initialize `visited` array to `False`.\n3.  Initialize `ans` array of size `m` to store directions.\n4.  Initialize `balance` array of size `n+1` to zeros. This `balance[v]` will store the net flow that needs to be \"handled\" by `v` and its parent `p` through the edge `(p,v)`.\n\n**`DFS(u, p)` function:**\n   - Mark `u` as `visited[u] = True`.\n   - For each neighbor `(v, c, edge_idx)` of `u`:\n     - If `v == p`, continue (don't go back to parent).\n     - If `visited[v]` is `False`:\n       - Call `DFS(v, u)`.\n       - After `DFS(v, u)` returns, `balance[v]` will contain the net flow that `v` needs to pass to its parent `u` (if positive) or receive from `u` (if negative).\n       - If `balance[v] > 0`: This means `v` has a surplus of `balance[v]` units of flow from its subtree that needs to be sent towards `u`. So, the edge `(u, v)` must be directed `v -> u`. We set `ans[edge_idx] = 1`. We add this flow to `u`'s balance: `balance[u] += balance[v]`.\n       - If `balance[v] < 0`: This means `v` has a deficit of `abs(balance[v])` units of flow that it needs to receive from `u`. So, the edge `(u, v)` must be directed `u -> v`. We set `ans[edge_idx] = 0`. We add this flow to `u`'s balance: `balance[u] += balance[v]`.\n       - Note: `balance[v]` will be exactly `c` or `-c` if `v` is an intermediate node and `c` is the flow on `(u,v)`. This is because `v` must pass `c` units of flow through the edge `(u,v)`.\n       - If `balance[v]` is 0, this implies `v` is vertex `n` and it has perfectly handled all flow.\n     - Else (`v` is visited and `v != p`): This means `(u, v)` is a back-edge in the DFS tree.\n       - For vertex 1 (source), all incident edges must be outward. So if `u = 1`, `1 -> v`.\n       - For vertex `n` (sink), all incident edges must be inward. So if `v = n`, `u -> n`.\n       - This case is tricky. The problem statement guarantees no cycles. A back-edge in a DFS tree implies a cycle *unless* it's directed correctly.\n       - The \"no cycles\" condition simplifies things: if we direct edges from parent to child in the DFS tree, and from child to parent for back-edges, we might create cycles.\n       - The simplest way to guarantee no cycles is to always direct edges from a lower DFS discovery time to a higher DFS discovery time, if possible. Or, from parent to child in the DFS tree.\n       - The \"no cycles\" condition is satisfied if we only direct edges *after* visiting the child subtree.\n\nLet's rethink the `balance` array. `balance[v]` should represent the *net flow that needs to leave `v` through its parent edge `(p, v)`*.\nInitialize `balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n\n**Revised DFS `DFS(u, p)`:**\n   - Mark `u` as `visited[u] = True`.\n   - For each neighbor `(v, c, edge_idx)` of `u`:\n     - If `v == p`, continue.\n     - If `visited[v]` is `False`:\n       - `DFS(v, u)`\n       - Now, `balance[v]` holds the net flow that `v` generated in its subtree and needs to send *out* through the edge `(u,v)`.\n       - If `balance[v] > 0`: `v` has `balance[v]` units to send to `u`. This means `v` is the source of this flow *relative to `u`*. So, the edge `(u, v)` is `v -> u`. We set `ans[edge_idx] = 1`. Update `balance[u] += balance[v]`.\n       - If `balance[v] < 0`: `v` needs to receive `abs(balance[v])` units of flow from `u`. So, the edge `(u, v)` is `u -> v`. We set `ans[edge_idx] = 0`. Update `balance[u] += balance[v]`.\n       - If `balance[v] == 0`: This implies `v` is the sink `n` and all its flow is perfectly balanced. This specific `c` should be added to `balance[u]` if `u->v` or subtracted if `v->u`.\n     - Else (`v` is visited and `v != p`): This is a back-edge. This means `v` was visited earlier than `u`. To maintain DAG property, flow should go from `v` to `u` or `u` to `v` based on their topological order.\n       - The problem statement guarantees vertex 1 has no incoming edges. This implies all edges connected to 1 must be `1 -> x`.\n       - The total flow out of 1 must equal total flow into `n`.\n       - The `balance` variable is tricky for back-edges. A simpler way for back-edges is to direct them from the node with smaller DFS entry time to the node with larger DFS entry time, if that's consistent with flow, or to let the parent-child DFS logic handle it.\n\nLet's use the property that for any intermediate node `v`, `sum(incoming_flow) == sum(outgoing_flow)`.\nWe can use a DFS from source 1.\n`DFS(u, parent_edge_flow)`:\n`parent_edge_flow` is the flow coming *into* `u` from its parent in the DFS tree.\n`current_out_flow = 0`\nFor each neighbor `(v, c, edge_idx)` of `u`:\n  If `v` is not visited:\n    `DFS(v, c)`\n    `current_out_flow += c` (assuming `u -> v`)\n  Else if `v` is parent:\n    continue\n  Else (`v` is visited and not parent, i.e., a back-edge):\n    If `u == 1`: `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`1 -> v`)\n    Else if `v == 1`: `ans[edge_idx] = 1` (`1 <- u`)\n    Else if `u == n`: `ans[edge_idx] = 1` (`n <- v`)\n    Else if `v == n`: `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`u -> n`)\n    Else: This is where it gets complicated.\n\nThe problem states \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\". This is the strongest constraint.\nAll edges incident to vertex 1 must be directed `1 -> x`. We can initialize these directions.\nThen, for each `x` adjacent to 1, we know `x` has an incoming flow `c` from 1.\nWe can use a queue and process vertices.\nInitially, for vertex 1, for all its neighbors `v` via edge `(1, v)` with flow `c` and index `idx`:\n  `ans[idx] = 0` (direction `1 -> v`)\n  `incoming_flow_sum[v] += c`\n  `degree[v]--` (count of edges whose direction is not yet decided)\n  If `degree[v] == 1` and `v != n`: add `v` to queue.\n\nThis is a topological sort like approach.\n`incoming_flow_sum[v]` stores the sum of flow for edges already directed *into* `v`.\n`outgoing_flow_sum[v]` stores the sum of flow for edges already directed *out of* `v`.\nInitialize `incoming_flow_sum = [0]*(n+1)`, `outgoing_flow_sum = [0]*(n+1)`.\n`undirected_edges_count[v]` stores the number of undirected edges incident to `v`.\n\n**Algorithm using a Queue (similar to Kahn's algorithm for topological sort):**\n\n1.  **Data Structures:**\n    *   `adj`: Adjacency list, `adj[u]` contains `(v, c, edge_idx)` for all neighbors `v`.\n    *   `ans`: Array of size `m` to store directions (0 for `a_i -> b_i`, 1 for `b_i -> a_i`).\n    *   `total_flow_on_edges[v]`: Sum of flow volumes `c_i` for all edges incident to `v`. This is `sum(c_i)` for `v`.\n    *   `current_flow_balance[v]`: Tracks `(sum of outgoing flow) - (sum of incoming flow)` for `v` from edges whose directions have been decided. Initialize to 0.\n    *   `q`: A queue for BFS-like processing.\n    *   `visited_edges`: A set or boolean array to mark edges whose direction has been decided.\n\n2.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Populate `adj`.\n    *   Calculate `total_flow_on_edges[v]` for all `v`.\n    *   Initialize `ans` array.\n    *   Initialize `current_flow_balance` to zeros.\n    *   Initialize `q`.\n    *   Add vertex 1 to `q`.\n\n3.  **BFS Loop:**\n    While `q` is not empty:\n    *   Dequeue `u`.\n    *   For each edge `(u, v)` with flow `c` and original index `edge_idx`:\n        *   If this edge has already been visited (its direction decided), continue.\n        *   **Decide direction for `(u, v)`:**\n            *   If `u == 1`: Edge must be `1 -> v`. Set `ans[edge_idx] = 0`.\n            *   Else if `v == 1`: Edge must be `u -> 1` (but this is impossible, 1 has no incoming). This case won't happen.\n            *   Else if `u == n`: Edge must be `v -> n`. Set `ans[edge_idx] = 1`.\n            *   Else if `v == n`: Edge must be `u -> n`.

It needs to receive more flow. So, direct `v -> u`. Set `ans[edge_idx] = 1`.\n                *   If `current_flow_balance[u]` is negative, it means `u` has a deficit of flow received.

This is where the DFS-tree based approach is better, or a simpler rule like `u -> v` by default.\n\nThis simple queue approach is problematic because `current_flow_balance[u]` depends on *all* edges incident to `u`, not just those processed. We need to know how much flow `u` *must* send out or receive.\n\nLet's use the `balance` array, where `balance[v]` is the net flow that *must* leave `v` through its incident edges.\nInitially, `balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nWhen we decide an edge `(u, v)` with flow `c` is `u -> v`:\n  `balance[u] += c`\n  `balance[v] -= c`\nFor `1 < v < n`, we need `balance[v]` to be 0 at the end.\nFor `v = 1`, `balance[1]` will be the total flow.\nFor `v = n`, `balance[n]` will be `-total_flow`.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition implies that we can find a topological ordering.

Add this flow to `u`'s net flow: `current_net_flow[u] += current_net_flow[v]`.\n        *   If `current_net_flow[v] < 0`: This means `v` needs to receive `abs(current_net_flow[v])` units of flow *from* `u`.

If negative, `u` receives from `p`.\n\n**`DFS(u, p)` function:**\n   - Mark `u` as `visited[u] = True`.\n   - For each neighbor `(v, c, edge_idx)` of `u`:\n     - If `v == p`, continue.\n     - If `visited[v]` is `False`: // `(u,v)` is a tree edge\n       - `DFS(v, u)`\n       - **Decide direction for `(u, v)` based on `flow_balance[v]` and `v` being `n`:**\n         - If `v == n`: // Edge to the sink.

If `v` is an ancestor of `u`, directing `u -> v` ensures no cycle. This also means `u` is sending flow to `v`.

The problem says \"If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\"\nLet's check my solution for validity:\n1. `1 < v < n`: `v=2`.\n   Incoming: `1 -> 2` (10 units).\n   Outgoing: `2 -> 3` (10 units).\n   Balance for 2: `10 - 10 = 0`. OK.\n2. `v=1` has no incoming edges. My solution has `1 -> 2` and `1 -> 3`. OK.\n3. No cycles. My DFS traversal: `1 -> 2 -> 3`. Back-edge `3 -> 1` was directed `1 -> 3` (my original mistake in back-edge rule application for `u=1`).\n   If `3 -> 1` was chosen: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1` is a cycle.\n   My rule `u == 1` for back-edge `(1,v)` means `1 -> v`. So `1 -> 3`.\n   This gives `1 -> 2`, `2 -> 3`, `1 -> 3`. This is a DAG. OK.\n\nThe example output:\nEdge 0: 3 -> 2 (ans[0]=1)\nEdge 1: 1 -> 2 (ans[1]=0)\nEdge 2: 1 -> 3 (ans[2]=1)\n\nLet's check example output:\n1. `v=2`:\n   Incoming: `1 -> 2` (10 units), `3 -> 2` (10 units). Total 20.\n   Outgoing: None.\n   Balance for 2: `20 != 0`. This solution is invalid!\nThe `flow_balance` for intermediate nodes must be 0.\nThe example output must have `10` from `1->2`, `10` from `2->3` and `5` from `1->3`.\nThe example output `1\\n0\\n1` means:\nEdge 0: (3,2,10) -> 2<-3 (10)\nEdge 1: (1,2,10) -> 1->2 (10)\nEdge 2: (3,1,5) -> 1<-3 (5)\nNet flow for 2: In: 10 (from 1), 10 (from 3). Out: 0. Total In: 20. Total Out: 0. NOT BALANCED.\nThe example output is incorrect based on the problem statement. The problem statement says \"sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges\".\n\nLet's re-read the problem statement carefully: \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\". This is very important. All edges connected to 1 must be directed away from 1.\nMy rule `v == 1` for back-edge `(u,v)`: `ans[idx] = 1` (`u -> 1`). This allows `u -> 1`. This contradicts \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\".\nSo, the rule for `v == 1` should be removed or changed. If `v == 1` and `visited[v]` is true, then `u` is a descendant of `1`. This edge `(u,1)` must be `1 -> u`. But `u` is already visited. This means it was `1 -> u` initially. This shouldn't be a back-edge.\n\nThe condition \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\" means that for any edge `(x, 1)`, it must be directed `1 -> x`.\nThis means:\n1.  If `u = 1`, for any neighbor `v`, `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`1 -> v`).\n2.  If `v = 1`, for any neighbor `u`, `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`1 -> u`).\n\nThis implies that if an edge `(u,v)` involves `1`, its direction is fixed.\nLet's modify the DFS:\n\n**Revised Final Algorithm (DFS based with explicit source/sink rules):**\n1.  **Adjacency List:** `adj[u]` stores `(v, c, edge_idx)`.\n2.  **`ans` array:** `ans[m]` to store 0 or 1.\n3.  **`visited` array:** `visited[n+1]` initialized to `False`.\n4.  **`flow_balance` array:** `flow_balance[n+1]` initialized to `0`. This stores the net flow *out* of `u` (from its subtree, excluding the parent edge). If positive, `u` needs to send to `p`. If negative, `u` needs to receive from `p`.\n\n**`DFS(u, p)` function:**\n   - Mark `u` as `visited[u] = True`.\n   - For each neighbor `(v, c, edge_idx)` of `u`:\n     - If `v == p`, continue.\n     - **Handle edges involving source (1) or sink (n) first:**\n       - If `u == 1`: // Source `u`. Edge must be `1 -> v`.\n         - `ans[edge_idx] = 0`.\n         - `flow_balance[u] += c`.\n         - If `visited[v]` is `False`: `DFS(v, u)`.\n         - Else: `v` is already visited ancestor, but we already directed `1 -> v`.\n       - Else if `v == 1`: // Source `v`. Edge must be `1 -> u`. (This is handled by `u=1` case from `v`'s perspective)\n         - This case `v=1` should not be reached if `u != 1` and `1` is visited.\n         - If `visited[v]` is `False`: this means `v=1` is not visited, which is impossible if we start DFS from 1.\n         - If `visited[v]` is `True`: this means `v=1` is an ancestor. But `u` is a descendant of `1`. The edge `(u,1)` should be `1 -> u`. `ans[edge_idx]=0`. `flow_balance[u] -= c`.\n         - This means `ans[edge_idx]=0` (`1->u`). `flow_balance[u] -= c`. This is wrong. It should be `flow_balance[u] += c` as `u` receives flow.\n\nLet's simplify. The `flow_balance[u]` should be the amount of flow that `u` needs to *send* to its parent `p` through the edge `(p,u)`.\nPositive value: `u -> p`. Negative value: `p -> u`.\nFor `1 < u < n`, `flow_balance[u]` must be exactly `c` or `-c` for the edge `(p,u)`.\nFor `u = 1`, `flow_balance[1]` is the total flow.\nFor `u = n`, `flow_balance[n]` must be 0 (all flow has been absorbed).\n\n**Revised Final Algorithm (DFS based with explicit source/sink rules and `flow_balance` meaning):**\n1.  **Adjacency List:** `adj[u]` stores `(v, c, edge_idx)`.\n2.  **`ans` array:** `ans[m]` to store 0 or 1.\n3.  **`visited` array:** `visited[n+1]` initialized to `False`.\n4.  **`flow_balance` array:** `flow_balance[n+1]` initialized to `0`.

The `flow_balance[u]` value represents `sum(outgoing_flow_from_u_to_children_and_backedges) - sum(incoming_flow_to_u_from_children_and_backedges)`. This value must be balanced by the edge `(p,u)`.\n\nLet's trace Example 1 again with this logic:\n3 3\n3 2 10 (edge 0)\n1 2 10 (edge 1)\n3 1 5  (edge 2)\n\nAdj:\n1: (2, 10, 1), (3, 5, 2)\n2: (3, 10, 0), (1, 10, 1)\n3: (2, 10, 0), (1, 5, 2)\n\n`DFS(1, 0)`:\n  `visited[1] = True`. `flow_balance[1] = 0`.\n  Neighbors of 1: (2, 10, 1), (3, 5, 2)\n\n  Process (2, 10, 1): `v=2`, `c=10`, `idx=1`. `visited[2]` is False.

The `current_flow_needed[u]` will be the flow that `u` needs to send to its parent `p`. For `u=1`, it should be the total flow. For `u=n`, it should be 0. For `1 < u < n`, it should be `c` or `-c` for the edge `(p,u)`.\n\nLet's re-trace Example 1 with this:\n3 3\n3 2 10 (edge 0)\n1 2 10 (edge 1)\n3 1 5  (edge 2)\n\nAdj:\n1: (2, 10, 1), (3, 5, 2)\n2: (3, 10, 0), (1, 10, 1)\n3: (2, 10, 0), (1, 5, 2)\n\n`DFS(1, 0)`:\n  `visited[1] = True`. `current_flow_needed[1] = 0`.\n  Neighbors of 1: (2, 10, 1), (3, 5, 2)\n\n  Process (2, 10, 1): `v=2`, `c=10`, `idx=1`. `visited[2]` is False.

Let's re-verify the example output.\nExample output: `1\\n0\\n1`\nThis means:\nEdge 0: 3 -> 2 (10 units)\nEdge 1: 1 -> 2 (10 units)\nEdge 2: 3 -> 1 (5 units)\n\nCheck conservation for vertex 2 (1 < 2 < 3):\nIncoming: `1 -> 2` (10 units), `3 -> 2` (10 units).

The example output is indeed wrong or I misunderstand the problem.\nGiven the strict conditions, my DFS approach that tries to balance flow for each intermediate node and ensure DAG property should be correct. The problem guarantees a solution exists, so my solution should be one of them.\n\nFinal check on edge cases:\n- `n=2`: Graph 1-2. `DFS(1,0)` will process `(2,c,idx)`. `v=n`. `ans[idx]=0`. `current_flow_needed[1]+=c`. Correct.\n- Graph is connected: DFS will visit all nodes.\n- No two edges connecting same vertices.\n- `c_i >= 1`.\n\nThe logic seems fine.

This is correct for a sink. However, if `n` is an intermediate node in the DFS tree (i.e., it has children), `current_flow_needed[n]` would be updated based on its children, which conflicts with it being a sink. The correct way for the sink `n` is that any flow on an edge `(u,n)` must be `u -> n`, and `n` itself doesn't contribute to `current_flow_needed` of its parent.\n\nLet's test the `u == n` case in my `dfs` function.\nIf `u == n`: `current_flow_needed[n]` is set to 0. Then the loop processes its neighbors.\nIf `(n, v)` is a tree edge (`visited[v]` is false): `dfs(v, n)` is called. After `dfs(v,n)` returns, `current_flow_needed[v]` is processed.\n  If `current_flow_needed[v] > 0`: `v` wants to send flow to `n`. `ans[edge_idx]=1` (`v -> n`). `current_flow_needed[n] += current_flow_needed[v]`.\n  This means `current_flow_needed[n]` will become positive, which is wrong for a sink. It should remain 0.\n\nThe `current_flow_needed[u]` should represent the net flow that `u` *would* send to its parent `p` if `u` were an intermediate node. For `u=n`, this value should be 0, regardless of what its children do. For `u=1`, it's the total flow.\n\nLet's reconsider the `current_flow_needed` meaning. It's the net flow *out* of `u`'s subtree (excluding edge to parent). Positive means net flow out, negative means net flow in.\n\n**Final Algorithm (DFS based, `net_flow_out_of_subtree`):**\n1.  **Adjacency List:** `adj[u]` stores `(v, c, edge_idx)`.\n2.  **`ans` array:** `ans[m]` to store 0 or 1.\n3.  **`visited` array:** `visited[n+1]` initialized to `False`.\n4.  **`net_flow_out_of_subtree` array:** `net_flow_out_of_subtree[n+1]` initialized to `0`.\n    - For `u=n`, this should remain 0, as it's a sink.\n\n**`DFS(u, p)` function:**\n   - Mark `u` as `visited[u] = True`.\n   - `current_node_net_flow = 0` (local variable for `u`'s flow contribution from its children/back-edges)\n\n   - For each neighbor `(v, c, edge_idx)` of `u`:\n     - If `v == p`, continue.\n\n     - If `visited[v]` is `False`: // `(u,v)` is a tree edge\n       - `DFS(v, u)`\n       - **Decide direction for `(u, v)` based on `net_flow_out_of_subtree[v]`:**\n         - If `net_flow_out_of_subtree[v] > 0`: (`v`'s subtree has net outgoing flow).

This means `v` needs to send flow to `u` or `u` needs to receive from `v`. So, `v -> u`.\n           - `ans[edge_idx] = 1`.\n           - `current_node_net_flow -= c`. // `u` receives `c` from `v`.\n           - `current_node_net_flow += net_flow_out_of_subtree[v]`. // `u` is responsible for `v`'s net outgoing flow.\n\n     - Else (`v` is visited and `v != p`): // `(u,v)` is a back-edge (to an ancestor `v`)\n       - **Decide direction for `(u, v)`:**\n         - If `u == 1`: `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`1 -> v`). `current_node_net_flow += c`.\n         - Else if `v == 1`: `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`1 -> u`). `current_node_net_flow -= c`.\n         - Else if `v == n`: `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`u -> n`). `current_node_net_flow += c`.\n         - Else if `u == n`: `ans[edge_idx] = 1` (`v -> n`). `current_node_net_flow -= c`.\n         - Else: `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`u -> v`). `current_node_net_flow += c`.\n\n   - **After processing all children and back-edges for `u`:**\n     - If `u == n`: `net_flow_out_of_subtree[n] = 0`.
