Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The Longest Repeating Substring**\n\nOkay, so I need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string.  The occurrences are allowed to overlap, and the input string will only contain lowercase Latin letters and have a length between 1 and 100.  Let's see...\n\nMy approach will be to systematically check all possible substring lengths, starting with the longest possible (which is the length of the string minus one) and working downwards.  For each length, I'll need to iterate through all substrings of that length within the original string.  Essentially, for each potential substring, I'll compare it to every other possible substring within the original string.\n\nSpecifically, I'll initialize a variable, `max_len`, to zero. Then I'll iterate through substring lengths from `N-1` down to 1.  For each length, I will start by taking substrings of the original string by starting at index 0 up to `N - length`.\n\nInside the loop, for the current substring I'll need to check if it occurs *again* somewhere else in the string. I will have another nested loop that compares the current substring with all other substrings of the same length, skipping the starting index of the current substring. If I find a match, then I have found a substring that repeats. Since I'm iterating `length` downwards, the first time I find a repeating substring, that length will be the answer.  At that point, I can assign the length to `max_len` and break out of all the loops.\n\nIf I reach the end of the iterations without finding any repeating substrings, `max_len` will remain at zero, indicating that there are no repeating substrings.  That's my plan. I think I have a solid algorithm here.\n",
