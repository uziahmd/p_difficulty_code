Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"New Year Candles\" problem. I see it as a simulation where the goal is to maximize the total burn time of candles.** My approach will be a step-by-step process of burning and crafting, keeping track of the key variables: `total_hours`, `current_new_candles`, and `burned_out_candles`.\n\nThe core of the strategy is simple: always use available new candles. This makes intuitive sense because there's no penalty for burning a candle immediately – it's just a time counter, and any burned candle can be turned into a new one.\n\nI'll start with the given initial number of candles (`a`), and then simulate each round. In each round, I'll first burn all the `current_new_candles`, adding their number to the `total_hours` and increasing the `burned_out_candles` count accordingly.\n\nNext, I'll determine how many new candles I can make from the `burned_out_candles` using integer division by `b`. Any remaining burned-out candles (the remainder from the division) are kept for the next round. This crafting step updates the `current_new_candles` for the next burn.\n\nI'll loop through these steps until there are no `current_new_candles` left. At that point, the accumulated `total_hours` is the solution.\n\nI've walked through a few example scenarios with different values of `a` and `b`, like `a=4, b=2` and `a=6, b=3`. Each time, the simulation gave the correct answer. I also checked the edge case with `a=1` to make sure it functions correctly. I am certain that the solution will work.\n\nBecause of the constraints `1 <= a <= 1000` and `2 <= b <= 1000`, the loop will terminate quickly. Each crafting step either decreases the remaining burned candles, or increases them, and `a` determines how long the loop can execute. I am also certain that the simulation approach will be efficient enough for any input within the given constraints.\n\nI assume standard input will contain a single line with two space-separated integers, representing `a` and `b`. The program will output a single integer representing `total_hours`.\nI've already created the Python code, read the input, and performed the simulation. The result will be printed to standard output.\n",
