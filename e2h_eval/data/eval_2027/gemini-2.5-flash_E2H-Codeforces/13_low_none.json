For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Triad Classification: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify a given set of three notes (a triad) as either \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".  No problem, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the musical concepts involved. There are twelve notes in a chromatic scale, and the distances between them are measured in semitones. Importantly, the scale is cyclic, so going from \"H\" to \"C\" is a single semitone.\n\nTo make things easier, I'll represent the notes numerically.  A simple mapping will do the trick:  C=0, C#=1, and so on, all the way up to H=11.  This way, I can treat the notes as integers. I'll call the map `note_map`.\n\nCalculating the distance between two notes will involve using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature.  The distance between two notes, `n1` and `n2`, is simply `(n2 - n1) % 12`.  This gives me the semitone distance from `n1` to `n2`. I can test this easily with a few examples in my head. C to E is `(4-0)%12 = 4`, E to C is `(0-4)%12 = 8`, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's look at the definitions of major and minor triads.  A major triad has distances 4-3, and a minor triad has distances 3-4.  Both sum to 7 semitones.  \n\nThe input is unordered, so I'll be given a set of three notes, and I need to figure out if it can be reordered to match either the major or minor pattern. Since there are three notes, I need to check all six possible orderings (3 factorial). \n\nTherefore, I'll need to:\n1.  Convert the input notes to integers using the `note_map`.\n2.  Calculate the distances between all pairs of notes in the triad.\n3.  Check if any ordering matches the 4-3 pattern (major) or the 3-4 pattern (minor).\n4.  If a match is found, return \"major\" or \"minor\" accordingly.\n5. If no match is found after checking all orders, it is \"strange\".\n\nOkay, that's the plan. Time to start coding!\n",
