After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Marks\" Problem and Crafting a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Marks\" problem, and my initial thought is, \"Python is definitely the way to go here.\" The problem itself seems pretty straightforward. We've got a gradebook, and we need to figure out which students are \"successful,\" meaning they got the highest mark in at least one subject.\n\nThe input format is clear: dimensions `n` and `m` (students and subjects), followed by `n` lines, each representing a student's marks across `m` subjects.  The marks are single-digit integers from 1 to 9.\n\nMy plan is to convert the raw string input into a more manageable data structure.  I'm leaning toward a list of lists (or a 2D array) of integers. This will make it easier to compare marks and iterate through rows (students) and columns (subjects). The core logic revolves around finding the maximum mark for each subject and then seeing if each student achieved that maximum in at least one subject.\n\nHere's how I envision the algorithm:\n\n1.  **Input:** Read `n` and `m`. Then, read the gradebook data line by line and immediately convert each character to an integer.  I'll store this in a nested list called `gradebook_int`.\n\n2.  **Maximum Marks per Subject:** I need to find the maximum mark for each subject.  I can iterate through the columns of `gradebook_int` (the subjects) and, for each subject, iterate through the students (rows) to find the max.  I'll store these maximum marks in a list called `max_marks_per_subject`.  Alternatively, I could use `zip` or a more functional approach to iterate by columns.\n\n3.  **Identify Successful Students:**  Now, I'll iterate through each student and then through each subject they took. If a student's mark matches the maximum mark for that subject, then they are successful.  I can keep track of successful students using a boolean list (or array) where `is_successful[i]` indicates whether student `i` is successful. Once a student is marked as successful, I can break out of the inner loop (subject loop).\n\n4.  **Count Successful Students:** Finally, I'll simply count the number of `True` values in the `is_successful` list.  This gives me the total number of successful students.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Let's work through an example to make sure this all makes sense.\"  If I had a simple 3x3 gradebook like `[[\"2\", \"2\", \"3\"], [\"2\", \"3\", \"2\"], [\"1\", \"1\", \"2\"]]`, I would see that the max mark in the first subject is 2, in the second subject is 3, and in the third is 3. Student 0 (the first row) is successful since they got the max mark (2) in subject 0. And so on...\n\nWith a Python implementation, this should be quick and efficient enough to pass all the test cases, even with n and m up to 100.  Now, let's write the code!\n",
