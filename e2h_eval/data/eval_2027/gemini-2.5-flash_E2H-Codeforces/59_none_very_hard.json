Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

Let's simplify the child condition.\n    # S is a child of S' if for all x in S, x+1 is in S'.\n    # This is equivalent to saying that S_shifted = {x+1 | x in S} is a subset of S'.\n    # Let's define a \"level\" for each element.\n    # We can define a partial order on sets: S <= S' if S is a child of S'.\n    # We need to find the number of arrays [S_1, ..., S_N] such that there is a total order S'_1 <= S'_2 <= ... <= S'_N.\n\n    # This problem seems to be related to the number of non-decreasing sequences.\n    # Let's consider the sets by their \"shift amount\".\n    # Define a \"base set\" B as a set where 1 is not in B.\n    # Then a set S can be written as B + k = {x+k | x in B}.\n    # This is not general enough.\n\n    # The problem is a variant of counting chains in a poset.\n    # The poset is (P, <=) where P is the set of all subsets of {1, ..., K} and <= is the child relation.\n    # S <= S' if S is a child of S'.\n    # We need to find the number of arrays [S_1, ..., S_N] such that there is a permutation p\n    # such that S_{p_1} <= S_{p_2} <= ... <= S_{p_N}.\n    # This means the multiset {S_1, ..., S_N} must be a \"chainable multiset\".\n\n    # Key observation: If S is a child of S', and S' is a child of S'', then S is a child of S''.\n    # This is because if x in S, then x+1 in S'. If x+1 in S', then x+2 in S''.\n    # So the child relation is transitive.
