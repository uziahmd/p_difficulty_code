            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Tokitsukaze Mahjong Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Mahjong problem to tackle. The goal is to figure out the least number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to make at least one valid \"mentsu\" from her initial three tiles. I've got to consider both \"koutsu\" (triplets) and \"shuntsu\" (sequences) as valid mentsu.\n\nI'm thinking, let's break this down systematically. First, I need to understand what constitutes a \"tile\" – a number (1-9) combined with a suit (m, p, or s). I'm going to represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)` to keep things organized.\n\nNow, the core of the problem is about checking how many extra draws are needed to form a mentsu.  I should start by checking if a mentsu is possible with zero extra draws (just from the initial three). If not, move on to checking with one extra draw, and then finally with two extra draws. The problem statement guarantees a solution within two draws, so I can rest assured my approach will eventually work.\n\nI need to analyze how to form a koutsu and a shuntsu. For a koutsu (triplet), it's straightforward. I need three identical tiles. If I already have two of the same, I need one more. If I have one of a kind, I'll need two more of the same. With shuntsu (sequence), three tiles in a consecutive number sequence of the same suit are required. The key is that the tiles must be sequential, not just in any order. The suit must also match. \n\nThe strategy is clear now. I need a Python script to iterate through the possibilities efficiently. I'll translate the tiles into the (number, suit) tuple representation. Then, I'll systematically check if a mentsu can be made with 0, 1, or 2 extra tiles, and return the minimum count. I can stop as soon as a solution is found.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. She can draw any tiles she wants, and there's an infinite supply. We need to find the minimum draws (0, 1, or 2).\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`. For example, '1s' becomes `(1, 's')`. This allows for easy sorting and comparison.\n\nWe will check the possibilities in increasing order of draws: 0 draws, then 1 draw, then 2 draws.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nTo form a mentsu with 0 draws, the initial three tiles `[t1, t2, t3]` must already contain a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n1.  **Check for Koutsu:** Are all three tiles identical? `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`.\n2.  **Check for Shuntsu:**\n    *   First, sort the tiles by number within each suit. This requires grouping by suit.\n    *   If all three tiles are of the same suit, say `(n1, s), (n2, s), (n3, s)` where `n1 <= n2 <= n3`:\n        *   Check if `n1 + 1 == n2` and `n2 + 1 == n3`.\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, 0 draws are needed.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws are not enough, we check if 1 draw is sufficient. With 1 draw, Tokitsukaze will have 4 tiles in total. She needs to be able to form a mentsu using *any* three of these four tiles. This means the initial three tiles must be \"one tile away\" from forming a mentsu.\n\n1.  **Check for Koutsu:**\n    *   Are there two identical tiles among `t1, t2, t3`? E.g., `t1 == t2` (and `t3` is different). If so, drawing one more `t1` (or `t2`) forms a koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`.\n    *   We can count the occurrences of each unique tile. If any tile appears 2 or 3 times, we can form a koutsu with 1 draw (if 2 times, draw one more; if 3 times, already a koutsu, covered by 0 draws). So, if there's any pair of identical tiles, 1 draw is sufficient.\n\n2.  **Check for Shuntsu:**\n    *   Sort the initial tiles `t1, t2, t3` by suit, then by number.\n    *   Iterate through all possible tiles `(num, suit)` that could be drawn. A simpler approach is to check if the existing tiles can form a shuntsu by drawing one specific tile.\n    *   Consider all pairs of tiles from the initial three: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`.\n    *   For each pair `(ta, tb)`:\n        *   If `ta` and `tb` are of the same suit, say `(na, s)` and `(nb, s)`:\n            *   Sort them: let `n_min = min(na, nb)` and `n_max = max(na, nb)`.\n            *   If `n_max - n_min == 1` (e.g., `(1m, 2m)`): We can draw `(n_min - 1, s)` (if `n_min > 1`) or `(n_max + 1, s)` (if `n_max < 9`). Either of these forms a shuntsu.\n            *   If `n_max - n_min == 2` (e.g., `(1m, 3m)`): We can draw `(n_min + 1, s)` to form a shuntsu `[n_min, n_min+1, n_max]`.\n    *   If any of these conditions are met, 1 draw is needed.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws must be the answer. This is because we can always form a koutsu by drawing two more of any existing tile (e.g., if we have `1m`, we draw two `1m`s to get `[1m, 1m, 1m]`). Or we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles (e.g., if we have `1m`, we draw `2m` and `3m`). The problem statement guarantees this.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:** Read the three tile strings and convert them into `(int(number), suit_char)` tuples.\n2.  **Sort Tiles:** Sort the initial three tiles. This helps in checking shuntsu conditions consistently.\n3.  **Helper Function `check_mentsu(tiles)`:** This function takes a list of three tile tuples and returns `True` if they form a mentsu, `False` otherwise.\n    *   It should first sort the input `tiles` to handle out-of-order sequences.\n    *   Check for koutsu: `tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]`.\n    *   Check for shuntsu: `tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]` (same suit) AND `tiles[0][0] + 1 == tiles[1][0] and tiles[1][0] + 1 == tiles[2][0]` (sequential numbers).\n\n**Algorithm Flow:**\n\n1.  Read input tiles `t1_str, t2_str, t3_str`.\n2.  Convert to `(num, suit)` tuples: `tiles = [parse(t1_str), parse(t2_str), parse(t3_str)]`.\n3.  Sort `tiles`.\n4.  **Check 0 Draws:**\n    *   If `check_mentsu(tiles)` is `True`, print `0` and exit.\n5.  **Check 1 Draw:**\n    *   Initialize `can_do_in_1_draw = False`.\n    *   **Koutsu with 1 draw:**\n        *   Count frequencies of tiles. If any tile appears 2 times, set `can_do_in_1_draw = True`.\n    *   **Shuntsu with 1 draw:**\n        *   Iterate through all pairs of tiles `(t_a, t_b)` from `tiles`.\n        *   If `t_a[1] == t_b[1]` (same suit):\n            *   Let `n_a, n_b = t_a[0], t_b[0]`.\n            *   If `abs(n_a - n_b) == 1` (e.g., 1m, 2m): We can draw `n_a-1` (if >0) or `n_b+1` (if <10). So, 1 draw works. Set `can_do_in_1_draw = True`.\n            *   If `abs(n_a - n_b) == 2` (e.g., 1m, 3m): We can draw `min(n_a, n_b) + 1`. So, 1 draw works. Set `can_do_in_1_draw = True`.\n    *   If `can_do_in_1_draw` is `True`, print `1` and exit.\n6.  **Check 2 Draws:**\n    *   If we reach this point, print `2`.\n\nExample walkthrough: `3p 9m 2p`\n1.  Tiles: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`. Sorted: `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`.\n2.  **0 Draws?**\n    *   `check_mentsu([(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')])`:\n        *   Not koutsu (all different).\n        *   Not shuntsu (suits are not all same).\n    *   Result: No.\n3.  **1 Draw?** `can_do_in_1_draw = False`\n    *   **Koutsu with 1 draw:**\n        *   Counts: `(2, 'p'): 1, (3, 'p'): 1, (9, 'm'): 1`. No tile appears twice.\n    *   **Shuntsu with 1 draw:**\n        *   Pairs:\n            *   `((2, 'p'), (3, 'p'))`: Same suit 'p'. `abs(2-3) == 1`. Yes, can draw `1p` or `4p`. `can_do_in_1_draw = True`.\n    *   `can_do_in_1_draw` is `True`. Print `1` and exit.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for tile_str in s:\n        num = int(tile_str[0])\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for consistent checking of sequences\n    # Sorting by suit then number helps in grouping similar tiles\n    tiles.sort()\n\n    # Helper function to check if three tiles form a mentsu\n    def check_mentsu(t1, t2, t3):\n        # Sort them internally to handle shuntsu order\n        current_tiles = sorted([t1, t2, t3])\n        \n        # Check for Koutsu (triplet)\n        if current_tiles[0] == current_tiles[1] and current_tiles[1] == current_tiles[2]:\n            return True\n        \n        # Check for Shuntsu (sequence)\n        if (current_tiles[0][1] == current_tiles[1][1] and \n            current_tiles[1][1] == current_tiles[2][1]): # Same suit\n            if (current_tiles[0][0] + 1 == current_tiles[1][0] and \n                current_tiles[1][0] + 1 == current_tiles[2][0]): # Sequential numbers\n                return True\n        \n        return False\n\n    # 0 Draws: Check if initial three tiles already form a mentsu\n    if check_mentsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # 1 Draw: Check if one draw can form a mentsu\n    # This involves having 2 identical tiles or 2 tiles that can form a sequence with one more tile.\n    \n    # Check for Koutsu with 1 draw:\n    # If any two tiles are identical, we can draw a third one to form a koutsu.\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] or tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for Shuntsu with 1 draw:\n    # Consider all pairs of tiles.\n    # We use a set to avoid redundant checks for pairs, though with only 3 tiles, it's trivial.\n    \n    # Check all permutations of 2 tiles from the 3 original tiles\n    # (t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3)\n    \n    # Case 1: Two tiles are sequential in the same suit (e.g., 1m, 2m).
