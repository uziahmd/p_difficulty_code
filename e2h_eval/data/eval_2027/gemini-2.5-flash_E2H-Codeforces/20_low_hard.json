For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem. It's about binary strings and multisets, and I need a Python solution. Let me break this down logically. I've got these binary strings with lengths from 1 to *n*, and for each string, I'm choosing a *c_s* value between 0 and *k*.  The core concept here is a \"beautiful\" multiset. It’s beautiful if, for any prefix `s` (of length 1 to n), the count of strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix is no more than `c_s`.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to figure out how many ways I can choose all the *c_s* values such that the *maximum possible size* of a beautiful multiset ends up being exactly *f*. I need to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's nail down how to determine the maximum multiset size given some `c_s` values. This reminds me of network flow or perhaps a clever greedy algorithm, or dynamic programming on a trie structure. Since any string `t` of length *n* that begins with a prefix `s` has all of `s`'s prefixes, this is really just about managing counts.\n\nLet's think about this. It seems that if `s` is a prefix of some other string `t` (where `t` is length *n*), then `c_s` is a restriction for *all* strings that begin with `s`, including `t`. If I had a \"dynamic programming\" approach, maybe I can consider this: `dp[s]` as the maximum number of strings of length *n* which start with prefix s and also respect all the `c_s` constraints. However, that isn't quite right.\n\nA better way is to see this in terms of the number of strings of length *n* that are in the multiset.  Let's say `x_t` represents how many times a string *t* (of length *n*) appears in the multiset.  The total size of the multiset is then the sum of all the `x_t`'s. For any prefix `s` (of length L < *n*), the number of strings with `s` as a prefix is the sum of `x_t` for all *t* starting with `s`. If s has length `n`, then `count(s is prefix of t)` is `x_s`.\n\nThe constraints are: each `x_t` has to be greater than or equal to 0, and each prefix `s` (length 1 to *n*) must satisfy the count constraint.  We are maximizing the sum of the `x_t` values. This is screaming \"max flow\" to me, but also as a supply chain on a binary trie.\n\nOkay, let's treat this like a \"supply chain\" problem on a binary trie.  The nodes of the trie are all the strings `s` (of length 1 to *n*). Each node `s` has a capacity `c_s`.  The leaves (strings of length *n*) are where we gather the strings to form the multiset.  The `c_s` values limit how many strings we can \"collect.\" Essentially, the total number of strings that can be collected is limited by the constraints. Thinking of the binary trie structure, this is starting to make much more sense!  Now, I just need to get the Python code working...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers `c_s` for all binary strings `s` of length 1 to `n` (where `0 <= c_s <= k`) such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand how to determine the maximum size of a beautiful multiset given all `c_s` values.\nA beautiful multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly `n`. Let `x_t` be the count of string `t` in the multiset.\nThe condition is that for every binary string `s` (length 1 to `n`), the number of strings in the multiset having `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\nThe total size of the multiset is `sum(x_t)` for all `t` of length `n`.\n\nConsider a binary trie where nodes represent prefixes. A node `s` has children `s0` and `s1`.\nThe constraint `count(s is prefix of t) <= c_s` means that the total \"flow\" through node `s` cannot exceed `c_s`.\nThe total flow through `s` is the sum of flows through its children `s0` and `s1` (if they exist).\nIf `s` is a string of length `n`, then `count(s is prefix of t)` is simply `x_s`.\nSo, for a string `s` of length `n`, `x_s <= c_s`.\nFor a string `s` of length `L < n`, `sum(x_t for t starting with s) <= c_s`. This sum is also equal to `sum(x_t for t starting with s0) + sum(x_t for t starting with s1)`.\n\nLet `M(s)` be the maximum possible number of strings of length `n` that have `s` as a prefix, given the constraints `c_p` for all prefixes `p` of `s`, and `c_s` itself.\nIf `s` has length `n`, then `M(s) = c_s`.\nIf `s` has length `L < n`, then `M(s)` is limited by `c_s` and also by the sum of what its children `s0` and `s1` can contribute.\nSpecifically, `M(s) = min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))`.\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is `M(\"\")`, where `\"\"` represents the empty string (the root of the trie). This is `min(c_\"\", M(\"0\") + M(\"1\"))`. However, the problem states strings of length 1 to `n`. So, the actual total is `M(\"0\") + M(\"1\")`.\nLet's define `M(s)` for a string `s` of length `L` as the maximum number of strings of length `n` having `s` as a prefix.\n`M(s) = c_s` if `len(s) = n`.\n`M(s) = min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))` if `len(s) < n`.\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `M(\"\") = M(\"0\") + M(\"1\")`.\n\nNotice that `M(s)` depends only on `c_s` and `M(s0), M(s1)`. Also, `M(s0)` and `M(s1)` are independent of each other (except through `c_s`).\nThis structure suggests dynamic programming.\nLet `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` values for all strings `s'` of length `L` to `n` that are descendants of some fixed string `s` of length `L-1`, such that `M(s)` (the maximum count for `s`) turns out to be `val`.\nThis is still a bit complex because `c_s` can go up to `k`, and `M(s)` can go up to `k * 2^(n-L)`. `f` can also be large.\n\nA key observation: `M(s)` is determined by `c_s` and the `M` values of its children. The `M` values of children depend on their `c` values and *their* children's `M` values, and so on.\nUltimately, `M(s)` is a function of `c_s` and all `c_{s'}` where `s'` is a descendant of `s`.\nThe total size `M(\"\")` is `M(\"0\") + M(\"1\")`.\nLet `dp[L][v]` be the number of ways to assign `c_s` values for all strings `s` of length `L` to `n` that are descendants of a fixed string `p` of length `L-1`, such that `M(p)` (the maximum count for `p`) can be `v`.\nThe number of strings of length `L` is `2^L`.\nThe number of strings of length `L` to `n` is `2^L + ... + 2^n`.\nThere are `2^(L-1)` nodes at level `L-1`. All these nodes are symmetric. So we can calculate `dp[L][v]` for one such node and raise it to the power `2^(L-1)`.\n\nLet `dp[L][v]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` for all strings `s'` of length `L` to `n` that are descendants of a specific string `s` of length `L`, such that `M(s)` (the maximum count for `s`) is `v`.\nBase case: `L = n`.\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `M(s) = c_s`.\nWe need to choose `c_s` from `0` to `k`. So, `M(s)` can be any value from `0` to `k`.\n`dp[n][v] = 1` for `0 <= v <= k`. (There's 1 way to choose `c_s = v`).\n`dp[n][v] = 0` for `v > k`.\n\nRecursive step: `L < n`.\nTo calculate `dp[L][v]`:\nA string `s` of length `L` has children `s0` and `s1`.\n`M(s) = min(c_s, M(s0) + M(s1))`.\nWe need to sum over possible values of `c_s` (from `0` to `k`), `M(s0)` (from `0` to `k_max_L+1`), and `M(s1)` (from `0` to `k_max_L+1`).\n`k_max_L+1` is `k * 2^(n-L-1)`.\n`dp[L][v] = sum_{c_s=0..k} sum_{v0=0..k_max_L+1} sum_{v1=0..k_max_L+1} (dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1])`\nsuch that `min(c_s, v0 + v1) = v`.\n\nThis DP state is `dp[L][v]` for a *single* subtree rooted at a node of depth `L`.\nThe values `v0` and `v1` can go up to `k * 2^(n-(L+1))`.\nLet `V_L = k * 2^(n-L)`. This is the maximum possible value for `M(s)` for a string `s` of length `L`.\nThe maximum value for `f` is `k * 2^n`.\nThe `f` value is `M(\"0\") + M(\"1\")`. So `f` can be up to `2 * V_1 = 2 * k * 2^(n-1) = k * 2^n`.\nThe state `v` can go up to `k * 2^(n-L)`.\nThe number of states `(n+1) * (k * 2^n)`.\nTransition involves a triple summation. `O(k * V_L^2)`. Total `O(n * k * (k * 2^n)^2)`. This is too slow. `n=15, k=2e5`. `2^15 = 32768`. `k * 2^n` is huge.\n\nLet `P_L[v] = dp[L][v]`.\n`P_L[v] = sum_{c_s=0..k} sum_{v0, v1} P_{L+1}[v0] * P_{L+1}[v1]` where `min(c_s, v0+v1) = v`.\nLet `S_{L+1}[X] = sum_{v'=0..X} P_{L+1}[v']`.\nLet `Q_{L+1}[X] = sum_{v0+v1=X} P_{L+1}[v0] * P_{L+1}[v1]`. This is a convolution.\nLet `R_{L+1}[X] = sum_{v0+v1 >= X} P_{L+1}[v0] * P_{L+1}[v1]`.\n\nThe condition `min(c_s, v0+v1) = v` can be split into two cases:\n1. `c_s = v` and `v0+v1 >= v`.\n2. `c_s > v` and `v0+v1 = v`.\n\nFor case 1: `c_s = v`. We need `v0+v1 >= v`.\nThe number of ways is `R_{L+1}[v]`. This is for one specific `c_s=v`.\nThis applies for `0 <= v <= k`.\nSo, `P_L[v] += R_{L+1}[v]` for `0 <= v <= k`.\n\nFor case 2: `c_s > v` and `v0+v1 = v`.\nThe number of choices for `c_s` is `k - v`.\nThe number of ways for `v0, v1` is `Q_{L+1}[v]`.\nSo, `P_L[v] += (k - v) * Q_{L+1}[v]` for `0 <= v < k`.\n\nCombining these:\n`P_L[v] = R_{L+1}[v] + (k - v) * Q_{L+1}[v]` for `0 <= v < k`.\n`P_L[k] = R_{L+1}[k]`. (Since `c_s` cannot be `> k`, only `c_s = k` is possible for `v=k`).\nNote: `R_{L+1}[v]` includes `Q_{L+1}[v]` and `Q_{L+1}[v+1]`, etc.\n`R_{L+1}[v] = sum_{X=v..2*V_{L+1}} Q_{L+1}[X]`.\n`R_{L+1}[v] = Q_{L+1}[v] + R_{L+1}[v+1]`.\n\nLet's refine the calculation of `P_L[v]`:\n`P_L[v] = (sum_{c_s=v+1..k} Q_{L+1}[v]) + Q_{L+1}[v] + sum_{X=v+1..2*V_{L+1}} Q_{L+1}[X]`\n`P_L[v] = (k - v) * Q_{L+1}[v] + R_{L+1}[v]` for `0 <= v < k`.\n`P_L[k] = R_{L+1}[k]`. (This is because if `v=k`, then `c_s` must be `k`, so only `c_s=v` case applies.)\n`P_L[v] = 0` for `v > k` or `v > 2*V_{L+1}`.\n\nThe maximum value `v` can take is `k * 2^(n-L)`.\nThe maximum value `v0+v1` can take is `2 * k * 2^(n-(L+1)) = k * 2^(n-L)`.\nSo, the maximum `v` for `P_L[v]` is `k * 2^(n-L)`.\nLet `MAX_V = k * 2^n`.\nLet `dp[L]` be the array `P_L`.\n`dp[n]` is an array of size `k+1`, `dp[n][v] = 1` for `0 <= v <= k`.\nFor `L = n-1` down to `0`:\n1. Calculate `Q_{L+1}`: `Q_{L+1}[X] = sum_{v0+v1=X} dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1]`. This is the convolution `dp[L+1] * dp[L+1]`.\n   The length of `dp[L+1]` is `k * 2^(n-(L+1)) + 1`. Let `len_dp = k * 2^(n-(L+1)) + 1`.\n   Convolution takes `O(len_dp * log(len_dp))` using NTT.\n   The result `Q_{L+1}` has length `2 * len_dp - 1`.\n2. Calculate `R_{L+1}`: `R_{L+1}[v] = sum_{X=v..} Q_{L+1}[X]`. This can be done in `O(len_Q)` time by iterating `R[v] = (R[v+1] + Q[v]) % MOD`.\n3. Calculate `dp[L]`:\n   `dp[L][v] = (R_{L+1}[v] + (k - v) * Q_{L+1}[v]) % MOD` for `0 <= v < k`.\n   `dp[L][k] = R_{L+1}[k] % MOD`.\n   The maximum `v` for `dp[L]` is `k * 2^(n-L)`.\n   The maximum value for `k` is `2e5`. `n=15`.\n   `k * 2^(n-L)` can be up to `k * 2^n = 2e5 * 32768 approx 6.5e9`. This is too large for an array index.\n\nThe maximum value for `M(s)` for a string `s` of length `L` is `min(k, k * 2^(n-L))`.\nThis is `k` if `2^(n-L) >= 1`.\nNo, `M(s)` can be `min(c_s, M(s0)+M(s1))`. `c_s` is at most `k`. So `M(s)` is at most `k`.\nThis is a critical insight!\n`M(s)` is capped at `k`.\nIf `len(s) = n`, `M(s) = c_s <= k`.\nIf `len(s) < n`, `M(s) = min(c_s, M(s0)+M(s1))`. Since `c_s <= k`, `M(s)` must also be `<= k`.\nThis means all `dp[L][v]` arrays only need to go up to `v=k`.\nThe length of `dp[L]` is `k+1`.\nThe convolution `dp[L+1] * dp[L+1]` will produce a polynomial of degree `2k`.\nSo `Q_{L+1}` has length `2k+1`.\n`R_{L+1}` has length `2k+1`.\nThe transition for `dp[L]` takes `O(k * log k)` for convolution and `O(k)` for `R` and `dp[L]`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n * k * log k)`.\n`n=15, k=2e5`. `15 * 2e5 * log(2e5) approx 15 * 2e5 * 18 approx 5.4e7`. This is feasible.\n\nFinal step: The problem asks for `M(\"0\") + M(\"1\") = f`.\nWe need to calculate `dp[0]` for the \"root\" (empty string's children).\n`dp[0]` is not a single `M(\"\")` value, but rather the distribution of `M(s)` for `s` of length 1.\nSo, `dp[1]` is the distribution of `M(\"0\")` (or `M(\"1\")`).\nWe need to calculate `sum_{v0+v1=f} dp[1][v0] * dp[1][v1]`.\nThis is `Q_1[f]`.\nSo, after `n` iterations, we get `dp[1]`. Then we compute `Q_1 = dp[1] * dp[1]` and return `Q_1[f]`.\nThe maximum value of `f` is `k * 2^n`. But `M(s)` is capped at `k`. So `M(\"0\")` and `M(\"1\")` are both at most `k`.\nTherefore, `f = M(\"0\") + M(\"1\")` is at most `2k`.\nIf `f > 2k`, the answer is 0.\n\nLet's re-check the `f` constraint. `f` can be `2e5`. `2k` can be `4e5`. So `f` can be up to `2k`.\nThe maximum `f` is `2 * k * 2^(n-1) = k * 2^n` if we didn't cap `M(s)` at `k`.\nBut `M(s) <= k` for any `s`. So `M(\"0\") <= k` and `M(\"1\") <= k`.\nThus, `M(\"0\") + M(\"1\") <= 2k`.\nIf `f > 2k`, the answer must be 0.\nThis is consistent with the example `n=6, k=153, f=23699`. Here `2k = 306`. Since `f=23699 > 306`, the output is 0.\n\nImplementation details:\nModulo is `998244353`.
