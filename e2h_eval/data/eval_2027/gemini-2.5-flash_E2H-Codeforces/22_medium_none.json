After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Marks Problem: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so we've got this \"Marks\" problem.  The goal is to determine the number of students who are \"best\" at at least one subject.  Here's how I'm thinking we can tackle this efficiently with Python, using some competitive programming best practices.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the input and data structures. We'll be given `n` students and `m` subjects. The input will come as a series of lines, so we'll store the marks as a list of strings called `gradebook`. Each string in `gradebook` represents a student's marks.  `gradebook[i][j]` will be the mark of student `i` in subject `j`. This is pretty standard for this type of problem.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the definition of a \"successful\" student. A student is successful if they have the highest mark for *at least one* subject. This means we'll need to figure out the maximum mark for each subject. We'll create a list, `max_marks_per_subject`, where `max_marks_per_subject[j]` holds the highest mark for subject `j`.\n\nThe algorithm is pretty straightforward:\n\n1.  **Read the Input:**  Grab `n`, `m`, and the marks and store them in the `gradebook` list.  We'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` for fast input.\n\n2.  **Determine Maximum Marks:**  We'll iterate through the `gradebook` column by column (subject by subject). For each subject, we'll find the maximum mark among all students and store it in `max_marks_per_subject`.  Since the marks are single characters, we can use string comparison (`'9' > '8'`) directly to find the maximum.\n\n3.  **Identify Successful Students:** We'll use a `set` called `successful_students_indices` to keep track of the students who are successful. We iterate through each student and subject. If a student's mark matches the maximum mark for that subject, we add the student's index to the set. The set automatically handles duplicates (a student might be best at multiple subjects, but we only count them once). An optimization can be added here - after adding a student to the set, we can stop checking that student.\n\n4.  **Count Successful Students:** The number of successful students is simply the size of the `successful_students_indices` set.\n\nThe time complexity of this is `O(n*m)`, which is plenty efficient for the given constraints (n, m <= 100). Given the small input size, this approach will be very fast.  We can convert the solution directly into python and run it efficiently.\n\nI've already tested this against the sample inputs and worked through a couple of edge cases in my head to make sure the logic is sound. Let's get the code ready and submit it!\n",
