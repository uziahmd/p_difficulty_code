Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vanya and Lanterns problem, and my initial goal is clear: I need to write a Python script to find the minimum light radius, `d`, to illuminate the entire street.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem itself. We're given a street of length `l` and the positions of `n` lanterns along it. Each lantern has a light radius, `d`, and lights up a segment of length `2d` centered at its position. The crucial requirement is that the entire street from 0 to `l` must be lit.\n\n**Key Idea: Ensuring Complete Coverage:**\n\nTo guarantee full illumination, I recognize three key aspects that need to be addressed:\n1.  **Street Beginning (0):** The beginning of the street must be within the light coverage.\n2.  **Street End (l):** Similarly, the very end of the street needs to be lit.\n3.  **Gaps Between Lanterns:** Any segment between two lanterns needs to be covered as well.\n\n**Formulating a Strategy:**\n\nThe logical first step is to sort the lantern positions, `a_i`, which simplifies the reasoning about coverage. Let's call the sorted array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.\n\nMy approach will be as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate Maximum Gap:** I need to find the largest \"gap\" between adjacent lanterns. This gap is the difference between two adjacent lantern positions. The light radius must be large enough to \"bridge\" this gap; specifically, I need half the gap to cover it from either side. This will give me `max_gap_d`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Start Distance:** To illuminate the beginning (coordinate 0) of the street, the first lantern's position must be within its light radius. So I will calculate the value needed for `start_d`.\n\n3.  **Calculate End Distance:** Similarly, to light the end (coordinate `l`), the final lantern must extend its light to reach `l`. I'll calculate `end_d` accordingly.\n\n4.  **Final `d` Determination:** The minimum `d` needed will be the maximum of `max_gap_d`, `start_d`, and `end_d`.\n\n**Detailed Execution:**\n\nThe detailed plan:\n1. Read the input: `n`, `l`, and the array `a`.\n2. Sort `a` (using `a.sort()`).\n3. Iterate to find the maximum difference between consecutive lanterns, dividing each difference by two.\n4. Calculate the distances needed to cover the start and end of the street from the first and last lanterns, respectively.\n5. Take the maximum of all these calculated distances.\n",
