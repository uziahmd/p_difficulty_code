Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**A Strategy for Maximizing Souvenir Sales**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which sounds suspiciously like a knapsack, but with some clever twists. My goal is a Python script to find the optimal solution.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints: `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `wi` and a cost `ci`, and a maximum weight `m`. The catch is those weights... they're only 1, 2, or 3. That's the key.  A standard knapsack approach, with its O(N*M) complexity, is going to be far too slow, given `n` and `m` can be quite large.\n\nThe small weight values are definitely the clue here.  I can categorize the souvenirs by their weights: `items_w1`, `items_w2`, and `items_w3`, where each list contains the costs of souvenirs of weight 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Sorting these lists in descending order of cost is obvious – grab the most expensive items first within each weight class.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about choosing a combination of items from each category. Let `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` be the number of items selected from each list.  The total weight has to be less than or equal to `m`: `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3 <= m`.  The total cost is the sum of the costs from the selected items in each category.\n\nTo efficiently calculate the cost of a combination, I can precompute prefix sums for each weight category. `prefix_cost_w1[k]` will store the sum of the costs of the `k` most expensive weight-1 items, and so on.\n\nThe question then becomes:  how to find the optimal `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`? I realize I'm still dealing with a form of knapsack. With the prefix sums, the calculation of total cost for any valid combination becomes straightforward. I might need to iterate through all possible combinations.  The upper bounds for `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are `m`, `m/2`, and `m/3` respectively. That makes the search space significant. I'll need to explore the best way to iterate through these possibilities. I believe that should lead to an efficient solution.\n",
