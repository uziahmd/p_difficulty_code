The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan.** I need a Python script to figure out how many times two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, lose in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game that goes on for a massive number of rounds (`n`). Nikephoros and Polycarpus each have a cyclic strategy: Nikephoros's is based on a sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus's on a sequence `B` of length `k`.\n\nEssentially, I'll need to figure out who wins in each round, but because `n` is so large, simulating all rounds would be too slow. Since the sequences are cyclic, the key is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`, which determines how often their choices repeat. I can simulate a single cycle of the game (length `L`, where `L = lcm(m, k)`) to count the losses within that cycle. Then, I can multiply the number of full cycles that fit into `n` by those losses, and finally, add any losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nI'll start by defining a helper function, `get_winner()`, to determine the outcome of a single round. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. Draws return 0. Then, I'll calculate the LCM of `m` and `k`, which I'll call `L`. Next, I'll simulate one cycle of `L` rounds, keeping track of how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose in this cycle.\n\nAfter that, I'll calculate the number of full cycles in `n` rounds and multiply the losses from one cycle by that number to find the total losses in all full cycles. Finally, I'll simulate the remaining rounds (those that don't make up a full cycle) to get the final total losses for each player. My output will be two integers, space-separated, representing Nikephoros and Polycarpus's total losses, respectively. I'll make sure to use `sys.stdout.write` and `sys.stdin.readline` because competitive programming loves them.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of losses for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, over `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Both players use a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences of moves, `A` and `B`. Nikephoros's sequence `A` has length `m`, and Polycarpus's sequence `B` has length `k`.\n\nThe key challenge is that `n` can be very large (up to `2 * 10^9`), while `m` and `k` are relatively small (up to `1000`). A direct simulation of `n` rounds would be too slow.\n\nThe choices made by Nikephoros and Polycarpus are cyclic. Nikephoros's choice in round `i` (1-indexed) is `A[(i-1) % m]`, and Polycarpus's choice is `B[(i-1) % k]`. The pair of choices `(A[(i-1) % m], B[(i-1) % k])` will repeat in a cycle. The length of this cycle is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.\n\nLet `L = lcm(m, k)`. Since `m, k <= 1000`, `L` can be at most `m * k = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000`. This is a manageable number of rounds to simulate.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1.  **Calculate LCM:** Determine `L = lcm(m, k)`. This can be calculated using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor. Python's `math.gcd` can be used for this.\n2.  **Simulate One Cycle:** Simulate `L` rounds of the game. During this simulation, count how many times Nikephoros loses (`nikephoros_losses_in_cycle`) and how many times Polycarpus loses (`polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`).\n3.  **Extrapolate for Full Cycles:** Calculate how many full `L`-round cycles fit into `n` rounds: `num_full_cycles = n // L`. Multiply the losses per cycle by `num_full_cycles` to get the total losses from these full cycles.\n4.  **Simulate Remaining Rounds:** Calculate the number of remaining rounds: `remaining_rounds = n % L`. Simulate these `remaining_rounds` and add any losses from them to the total counts.\n\n**Rock-Paper-Scissors Rules:**\nA helper function `get_winner(choice1, choice2)` can determine the outcome of a single round:\n*   If `choice1 == choice2`, it's a draw (return `0`).\n*   If `choice1` beats `choice2` (e.g., 'R' beats 'S'), `choice1` wins (return `1`).\n*   Otherwise, `choice1` loses to `choice2` (return `-1`).\nA dictionary `WIN_MAP = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}` can efficiently represent which item beats which.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n = 7`, `A = \"RPS\"` (`m=3`), `B = \"RSPP\"` (`k=4`)\n\n1.  **LCM:** `gcd(3, 4) = 1`. `lcm(3, 4) = (3 * 4) // 1 = 12`.\n2.  **Simulate one cycle (12 rounds):**\n    *   Initialize `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 0`, `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 0`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `11`:\n        *   Round `i=0`: N: `A[0]`='R', P: `B[0]`='R'.
