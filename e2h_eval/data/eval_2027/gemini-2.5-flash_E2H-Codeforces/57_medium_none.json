His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Best and Worst Olympiad Ranks**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the best and worst possible ranks for a participant named Vasya in an Olympiad. I've got this Python script in mind, and the core problem is this: given a set of scores from two rounds, how do I strategically pair them to either maximize or minimize Vasya's rank?\n\nHere's my thought process: The input gives me `n` participants, a minimum score `x` that Vasya must have, and two lists of scores, `a` and `b`. The tricky part is that I don't know *which* score from `a` goes with *which* score from `b`. But I know there's a match, and I know Vasya's total score is at least `x`.\n\nThe key insight? I can \"choose\" how the scores are paired. Since it says the *jury* assigns places in case of ties, I can use that to my advantage. To get the *best* rank, I want Vasya to be at the top. I need to figure out what the *maximum* possible score is *guaranteed* to be for Vasya. If I can, I want that maximum score, because then he's guaranteed rank 1, since all other scores are *tied* with him at the absolute best. So, the best rank is always 1, because, the highest score is `max(a) + max(b)`.\n\nFor the *worst* rank, I want to make Vasya's score as low as possible while still being at least `x`. Then, I want to pair the other scores in a way that *maximizes* the number of people who score at least as well as Vasya. That sounds tough to do. I have the scores for everyone. So, let's sort all the individual scores (from both rounds). I can't look at all the ways. \n\nI'm thinking, sort both lists of scores. I need to find the smallest possible sum of scores for Vasya such that the result is `>= x`. This can be done by using a binary search. That sets my floor. Now, for his worst rank, to get Vasya's worst possible rank, I want to maximize the number of other participants who score at least as well. Let's start with the smallest valid score for Vasya (`min_vasya_score >= x`), and then count how many other pairs I can make that are also greater than or equal to that number.\n\nI can do this efficiently using a two-pointer approach after sorting the scores. I can count how many pairs can I make such that the sum is equal to or greater than the score of Vasya, for his worst rank. If there are `k` others with a score >= Vasya, then Vasya gets the rank `k + 1`. This two pointer is quick.\n\nThe algorithm seems correct. I think I've got a handle on the nuances of this ranking problem!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad, given the individual scores for `n` participants in two tours and a minimum total score `x` for Vasya. The key challenge is that we don't know which participant scored what in which tour; we only have two lists of `n` scores each, one for the first tour and one for the second. Each participant takes one score from the first tour list and one from the second, such that all scores are used exactly once. Ties are broken by the jury.\n\n**1. Vasya's Best Possible Rank**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his own score and/or ensure no one else scores strictly higher than him.\nThe problem guarantees that \"there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x\". This means Vasya can always achieve at least `x` points.\nThe highest possible score any participant can achieve is `max(a) + max(b)`. Since this sum is guaranteed to be at least `x` (as it's the maximum possible sum, and at least one pair sums to `x` or more), Vasya *could* be the participant who scored `max(a)` in the first tour and `max(b)` in the second tour. In this scenario, his score `S_Vasya = max(a) + max(b)` would be the highest possible total score. No other participant could score strictly more than him.\nGiven the tie-breaking rule (\"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\"), if Vasya achieves the highest score, the jury can assign him the first place.\nTherefore, Vasya's best possible rank is always **1**.\n\n**2. Vasya's Worst Possible Rank**\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, we need to:\na. Minimize Vasya's total score, while still satisfying `S_Vasya >= x`.\nb. Maximize the number of other participants whose scores are greater than or equal to Vasya's score.\nc. Take advantage of ties: if Vasya ties with others, the jury can assign him the worst rank among them.\n\nLet's denote Vasya's score as `S_Vasya`. If `k` participants (including Vasya) achieve a score of at least `S_Vasya`, then Vasya's worst rank would be `k`.\n\nThe strategy to find the worst rank involves two steps:\n\n**Step 1: Determine Vasya's minimum possible score (`min_vasya_score`)**\nVasya wants to minimize his score `S_Vasya` such that `S_Vasya >= x`. To do this, we can iterate through all possible scores `a_i` from the first tour. For each `a_i`, we need to find the smallest `b_j` from the second tour such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. This `b_j` would be `b_j >= x - a_i`.\nTo efficiently find this `b_j`, we first sort the `b` array in ascending order. Then, for each `a_i`, we can use binary search (e.g., `bisect_left` in Python) on the sorted `b` array to find the smallest `b_j` that meets the condition.\n`min_vasya_score` will be the minimum of all such `a_i + b_j` pairs found.\n\nAlgorithm for `min_vasya_score`:\n1. Sort `a` (or `b`, or both) in ascending order. Let's sort both `a` and `b`.\n2. Initialize `min_vasya_score = infinity`.\n3. For each `score_a` in sorted `a`:\n    a. Calculate the minimum `score_b` needed: `needed_b = x - score_a`.\n    b. Use `bisect_left` on sorted `b` to find the index `idx` of the first element `b[idx]` such that `b[idx] >= needed_b`.\n    c. If `idx < n` (meaning a suitable `b_j` exists):\n        `min_vasya_score = min(min_vasya_score, score_a + b[idx])`.\nThis step takes `O(n log n)` time due to sorting and `n` binary searches.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of participants who can score at least `min_vasya_score`**\nLet `K = min_vasya_score`. We need to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` that can be formed such that `a_p + b_q >= K`. This is a classic two-pointer problem:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Initialize `count = 0`, `left_ptr = 0` (for `a`), `right_ptr = n - 1` (for `b`).\n4. While `left_ptr < n` and `right_ptr >= 0`:\n    a. If `a[left_ptr] + b[right_ptr] >= K`:\n        This pair `(a[left_ptr], b[right_ptr])` contributes to a score of at least `K`. We use both scores and increment `count`.\n        `count++`\n        `left_ptr++`\n        `right_ptr--`\n    b. Else (`a[left_ptr] + b[right_ptr] < K`):\n        The current `a[left_ptr]` is too small to reach `K` even with the largest available `b[right_ptr]`. So, `a[left_ptr]` cannot form a pair summing to `K` or more with any remaining `b` score. We must discard `a[left_ptr]` and try the next `a` score.\n        `left_ptr++`\n5. The `count` obtained is the maximum number of participants who can score at least `K`. This `count` will be Vasya's worst rank.\n\nThis step takes `O(n)` time after sorting.\n\n**Overall Complexity:**\nSorting `a` and `b` takes `O(n log n)`.\nFinding `min_vasya_score` takes `O(n log n)`.\nCalculating the final count takes `O(n)`.\nThe total time complexity is `O(n log n)`.\nThe space complexity is `O(n)` for storing `a` and `b`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Best Rank:** 1 (as established).\n\n**Worst Rank:**\n1.  **Find `min_vasya_score`:**\n    Sorted `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n    For `a_i = 1`: `needed_b = 2 - 1 = 1`.\n    `bisect_left(b, 1)` returns `0`. `b[0] = 1`.\n    Candidate score: `1 + 1 = 2`. `min_vasya_score = 2`.\n    All other `a_i` yield the same `min_vasya_score = 2`.\n\n2.  **Calculate `count_ge(2)`:**\n    `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `K = 2`.\n    `count = 0`, `left_ptr = 0`, `right_ptr = 4`.\n    - `a[0] + b[4] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= 2`. `count = 1`, `left_ptr = 1`, `right_ptr = 3`.\n    - `a[1] + b[3] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= 2`. `count = 2`, `left_ptr = 2`, `right_ptr = 2`.\n    - `a[2] + b[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= 2`. `count = 3`, `left_ptr = 3`, `right_ptr = 1`.\n    - `a[3] + b[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= 2`. `count = 4`, `left_ptr = 4`, `right_ptr = 0`.\n    - `a[4] + b[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= 2`. `count = 5`, `left_ptr = 5`, `right_ptr = -1`.\n    Loop ends. `count = 5`.\n    Vasya's worst rank is 5.\n\nOutput: `1 5`.
