And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Sleep Time Averaging Script**\n\nOkay, so I need to whip up a Python script that calculates the average sleep time over a sliding window of days, which they're calling \"weeks.\"  The input is an array of sleep records, `a1, a2, ..., an`, and the window size `k`.  Effectively, I'm looking at consecutive blocks of `k` days and calculating the average sleep time within each block, then averaging those averages.\n\nThe core of the problem is figuring out how to efficiently sum the sleep times for each week. I know I have `n - k + 1` possible weeks to consider.  A brute-force approach, where I recalculate the sum for each week independently, would be  `O((n-k+1) * k)`, which could be `O(n^2)` in the worst case where `k` is close to `n/2`. That's going to be too slow, given the constraints of `n` being up to 200,000.  \n\nThe sliding window technique is the way to go here.  I can calculate the sum of the first week, `S_1`, in `O(k)` time.  Then, to get the sum of the next week, `S_2`, I can take `S_1`, subtract the first element (`a_1`), and add the new element (`a_{k+1}`).  This gives me the equation: `S_i = S_{i-1} - a_{i-1} + a_{i+k-1}`.  This makes calculating each subsequent window sum an `O(1)` operation.  Therefore, I can calculate the sum of all windows in `O(n)` time, which is exactly what I want.\n\nSo, the algorithm will go like this:\n\n1.  Calculate the sum of the first week (first `k` elements).\n2.  Iterate through the remaining possible weeks: for each window, subtract the leftmost element of the previous window and add the new rightmost element to get the new sum.\n3. Sum up all these week sums to get the `TotalSumOfWeeks`.\n4.  Finally, divide the total sum of the weeks by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) to get the average.\n\nI'll need to remember to handle potential edge cases, of course, like `k` being larger than `n` and any potential integer overflows during summation, although with the `int` type in Python, this is less of a worry. I think I'm ready to start coding this up.\n",
