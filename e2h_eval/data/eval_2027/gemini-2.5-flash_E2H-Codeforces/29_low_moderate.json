Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Substitutes in Number\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem. It seems like a classic example where naive string manipulation will get me into trouble with memory limits. The problem boils down to processing a starting string `s` and a series of substitution queries, ultimately finding the numerical value of the modified string modulo 1000000007.\n\nThe key is realizing that building the *entire* final string is a no-go. With a potential for exponential string growth, I'll need a more clever approach.  I see that the queries build on each other in sequence. If I replace a digit with a string and then *that* string has digits which are also later replaced, I've got a recursion problem on my hands.\n\nSince I can't build the string, the plan forming is this:  I need to figure out what a *single digit* from the initial string *contributes* to the final result.  That's my core focus. I think I can use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach in reverse.\n\nI'm thinking about two arrays, `val[d]` and `len[d]`. `val[d]` will store the final numerical value represented by a single original digit `d` after all the substitutions, and `len[d]` will store its final length (number of digits).\n\nI'll start by initializing `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`.  Then, I'll process the queries in *reverse* order.  As I process each query \"di -> ti\", I'll *update* the `val` and `len` arrays. I'll need to multiply `val[d]` by a power of 10 based on the length of whatever `ti` ends up representing.  This should allow me to keep track of place values correctly. I'll need to iterate over the digits in `ti` to handle further substitutions in `ti`.\n\nThis way, by the time I've processed all the queries, I should have a `val[d]` and a `len[d]` for each original digit. Then, I can just iterate through the original string `s` and sum up the contributions of each digit, using my precalculated `val` and `len` values, and performing modulo operations along the way to keep the numbers manageable. This will avoid ever constructing the extremely long final string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the value of a very long string of digits, modulo 1000000007, after a series of substitution operations. The string `s` can become astronomically long, so we cannot explicitly construct it.\n\nThe key idea is to process the queries in reverse order. This allows us to determine, for each initial digit `d` (0-9), what its final value and length would be if it were to appear in the string.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nFor each digit `d` from 0 to 9, we need to store two pieces of information:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value that a single occurrence of digit `d` would contribute to the final number, modulo `MOD`.\n2.  `pow10[d]`: The power of 10 corresponding to the length of the string that a single occurrence of digit `d` would expand into, modulo `MOD`. This is equivalent to `10^(length_of_expanded_string) % MOD`.\n\nInitially, before any queries are processed:\nFor each digit `d` (0-9):\n*   `val[d] = d` (a single digit `d` has value `d`)\n*   `pow10[d] = 10` (a single digit `d` has length 1, so it contributes `10^1` to the place value of digits to its left)\n\nNow, we process the `n` queries from the last query to the first query. Suppose the current query is `di -> ti`.\nWhen we process this query in reverse, it means we are calculating what `di` *would have become* if this query were applied. The `val` and `pow10` arrays currently store the values and lengths for digits *after* this query (and all subsequent queries) have been applied.\n\nLet's calculate `new_val_di` and `new_pow10_di` for `di` based on `ti`:\n*   `new_val_di = 0`\n*   `new_pow10_di = 1` (representing `10^0` for an empty string, as we build up length)\n\nIterate through `ti` from right to left (to correctly calculate place values):\nFor each character `c` in `ti` (from right to left):\n*   `digit = int(c)`\n*   `new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[digit] * new_pow10_di) % MOD`\n*   `new_pow10_di = (new_pow10_di * pow10[digit]) % MOD`\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`:\n*   Update `val[di] = new_val_di`\n*   Update `pow10[di] = new_pow10_di`\n\nThis reverse processing ensures that when we calculate `val[digit]` and `pow10[digit]` for a character `c` in `ti`, we are using the values that `c` would expand into *after* all subsequent queries (which are earlier in the reverse order) have been applied.\n\nAfter processing all `n` queries in reverse, the `val` and `pow10` arrays will contain the final values and lengths for each initial digit.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of the original string `s`.\n*   `final_val = 0`\n*   `final_pow10 = 1` (representing `10^0` as we build up length from right)\n\nIterate through the original string `s` from right to left:\nFor each character `c` in `s` (from right to left):\n*   `digit = int(c)`\n*   `final_val = (final_val + val[digit] * final_pow10) % MOD`\n*   `final_pow10 = (final_pow10 * pow10[digit]) % MOD`\n\nThe `final_val` will be the answer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `s = \"222\"`, queries `2->0`, `0->7`**\n\n`MOD = 1000000007`\n\n**Initial state:**\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`pow10 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`\n\n**Queries in reverse:**\n1.  **Query `0 -> 7` (last query)**\n    `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n    `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_pow10_0 = 1`\n    Process `ti[0] = '7'`:\n    `digit = 7`\n    `new_val_0 = (0 + val[7] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n    `new_pow10_0 = (1 * pow10[7]) % MOD = (1 * 10) % MOD = 10`\n    Update `val[0] = 7`, `pow10[0] = 10`\n    (Now `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `pow10 = [10, 10, ..., 10]`)\n\n2.  **Query `2 -> 0` (first query)**\n    `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n    `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_pow10_2 = 1`\n    Process `ti[0] = '0'`:\n    `digit = 0`\n    `new_val_2 = (0 + val[0] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7` (Note: `val[0]` is now 7)\n    `new_pow10_2 = (1 * pow10[0]) % MOD = (1 * 10) % MOD = 10` (Note: `pow10[0]` is now 10)\n    Update `val[2] = 7`, `pow10[2] = 10`\n    (Now `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `pow10 = [10, 10, ..., 10]`)\n\n**Calculate final value for original `s = \"222\"`:**\n`final_val = 0`, `final_pow10 = 1`\n\n1.  Process `s[2] = '2'`:\n    `digit = 2`\n    `final_val = (0 + val[2] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n    `final_pow10 = (1 * pow10[2]) % MOD = (1 * 10) % MOD = 10`\n\n2.  Process `s[1] = '2'`:\n    `digit = 2`\n    `final_val = (7 + val[2] * 10) % MOD = (7 + 7 * 10) % MOD = (7 + 70) % MOD = 77`\n    `final_pow10 = (10 * pow10[2]) % MOD = (10 * 10) % MOD = 100`\n\n3.  Process `s[0] = '2'`:\n    `digit = 2`\n    `final_val = (77 + val[2] * 100) % MOD = (77 + 7 * 100) % MOD = (77 + 700) % MOD = 777`\n    `final_pow10 = (100 * pow10[2]) % MOD = (100 * 10) % MOD = 1000`\n\nFinal answer: `777`. This matches the example.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: O(10)\n*   Processing queries in reverse: `N` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. Sum of lengths of all `ti` is `L_sum`. So, this step is O(`N` + `L_sum`).\n*   Calculating final value: Iterate through initial string `s`. Length of `s` is `|s|`. So, this step is O(`|s|`).\n*   Total time complexity: O(`|s|` + `N` + `L_sum`). Given constraints (`|s|`, `N`, `L_sum` up to `10^5`), this is efficient enough.\n*   Space complexity: O(10) for `val` and `pow10` arrays, plus O(`N` + `L_sum`) to store queries. O(`|s|` + `N` + `L_sum`) overall for input. This is also efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split(\"->\")\n        di = int(parts[0])\n        ti = parts[1]\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n\n    # val[d] stores the numerical value that a single digit d expands to\n    # pow10[d] stores 10^(length of string that d expands to) % MOD\n    # Initially, each digit d expands to itself (length 1, value d)\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    pow10 = [10 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di, ti = queries[i]\n\n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_pow10_di = 1 # Represents 10^0 for an empty string, building up length\n\n        # Iterate through ti from right to left to correctly calculate place values\n        for char_t in reversed(ti):\n            digit_t = int(char_t)\n            \n            # Add the value of digit_t (which is val[digit_t])\n            # multiplied by the current accumulated place value (new_pow10_di)\n            new_val_di = (new_val_di + val[digit_t] * new_pow10_di) % MOD\n            \n            # Update the accumulated place value by multiplying with the length factor of digit_t\n            new_pow10_di = (new_pow10_di * pow10[digit_t]) % MOD\n        \n        # Update the values for di\n        val[di] = new_val_di\n        pow10[di] = new_pow10_di\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the original string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    current_pow10_s = 1 # Represents 10^0 for the rightmost digit of s\n\n    # Iterate through the original string s from right to left\n    for char_s in reversed(s):\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Add the value of digit_s (which is val[digit_s])\n        # multiplied by the current accumulated place value (current_pow10_s)\n        final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit_s] * current_pow10_s) % MOD\n        \n        # Update the accumulated place value by multiplying with the length factor of digit_s\n        current_pow10_s = (current_pow10_s * pow10[digit_s]) % MOD\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
