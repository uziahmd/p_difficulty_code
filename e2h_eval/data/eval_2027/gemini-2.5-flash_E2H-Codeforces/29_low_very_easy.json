Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Substitutes in Number\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem staring me down. The goal is clear: a Python script to crunch through this. Andrew starts with a string of digits, and Eugene throws a series of replacement queries at him. The final task? Figure out the numerical value of the resulting number, ignoring those pesky leading zeros, and then get the result modulo 1000000007.\n\nThe constraints are pretty manageable: strings up to 10^5 in length, a similar number of queries, and reasonably sized replacement strings. But wait, here's the tricky part: direct string replacements would be an absolute performance nightmare.  If a query like \"1 -> 11\" hits a string with a single \"1\", things explode quickly.  We're talking exponential growth and a swift trip to the \"memory error\" zone.\n\nMy immediate instinct is to focus on the *value*, not the literal string.  I know I can represent the value of a string as a sum of its digits multiplied by powers of 10.  The query order is critical. Let's process the queries in order.\n\nWorking backwards is tempting, but the dynamic programming approach seems more viable. I can initialize an array to hold the numerical value `val[d]` and length `len[d]` of what each digit eventually becomes. Initially, the value of each digit is just the digit itself, and the length is 1.\n\nThen, for each query, `di -> ti`, I need to update  `val[di]` and `len[di]`.  The `val[di]` will become the value represented by `ti` after *all* prior queries have been applied to its individual digits.  That feels like the key insight.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate string replacements and then calculate the final number modulo 1000000007. A direct simulation of string replacements would be too slow because the string length can grow exponentially. Instead, we need to find an efficient way to calculate the numerical value and length of the transformed strings.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nFor each digit `d` from 0 to 9, we need to keep track of two values:\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value (modulo `MOD`) that digit `d` eventually transforms into.\n2.  `length[d]`: The length (modulo `MOD-1` for powers of 10, or just the actual length if it's small enough, but powers of 10 require modulo `MOD-1` in the exponent) of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into.\n\nInitially, before any queries:\nFor each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n`val[d] = d`\n`length[d] = 1`\n\nThe queries are applied in a specific order. Since later queries affect the meaning of digits, and we need to process the initial string `s` using the *final* meanings of digits, it's more efficient to process the queries in *reverse order*.\n\nLet's say we have a query `di -> ti`. When we process this query in reverse order, it means we are determining what `di` *should* transform into. The `ti` string consists of digits. For each digit `c` in `ti`, its `val[c]` and `length[c]` have already been determined by queries *after* the current one (which we are processing earlier in reverse).\n\nSo, for a query `di -> ti` (processing in reverse):\nWe calculate the new `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on `ti` and the current `val` and `length` arrays.\nInitialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_length_di = 0`.\nIterate through `ti` from left to right (or right to left, careful with powers of 10):\nLet's iterate `c` in `ti` from right to left (more natural for powers of 10).\nFor each digit `c` in `ti` (from right to left):\n`new_val_di = (val[c] * pow(10, new_length_di, MOD) + new_val_di) % MOD`\n`new_length_di = (new_length_di + length[c]) % (MOD - 1)` (The exponent for `pow(10, exp, MOD)` should be modulo `MOD-1` by Fermat's Little Theorem if `MOD` is prime)\n\nAfter processing all digits in `ti`, update:\n`val[di] = new_val_di`\n`length[di] = new_length_di`\n\nNote about `length[d]` modulo `MOD-1`: The actual length can grow very large, but we only need it as an exponent for powers of 10. By Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^(p-1) % p = 1` for prime `p` and `a` not a multiple of `p`. So `a^E % p = a^(E % (p-1)) % p`. Here `p = MOD = 10^9 + 7`, which is prime. Thus, we should take `length[d]` modulo `MOD-1`. If `length[d]` becomes 0 after modulo `MOD-1`, it should be treated as `MOD-1` if the original length was a multiple of `MOD-1` and non-zero. A simpler way to handle this is to ensure `length[d]` is always non-negative and then use `pow(10, length[d], MOD)`. When `length[d]` is 0, `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is 1, which is correct. The sum `(new_length_di + length[c])` should be taken modulo `MOD-1`.\n\nAfter processing all `n` queries in reverse order, the `val` and `length` arrays will contain the final transformations for each digit.\nFinally, we need to calculate the value of the initial string `s`.\nInitialize `final_val = 0` and `current_power_of_10_exp = 0`.\nIterate through the initial string `s` from right to left:\nFor each digit `c` in `s`:\n`digit_val = int(c)`\n`final_val = (val[digit_val] * pow(10, current_power_of_10_exp, MOD) + final_val) % MOD`\n`current_power_of_10_exp = (current_power_of_10_exp + length[digit_val]) % (MOD - 1)`\n\nThe result is `final_val`.\n\nExample Walkthrough (from problem description): `s = \"222\"`, queries: `2->0`, `0->7`\n\n`MOD = 1000000007`, `MOD_EXP = 1000000006`\n\nInitial state:\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nQueries in reverse:\n1.  `0->7` (This is the second query, processed first in reverse)\n    `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n    `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_length_0 = 0`\n    Digit `c = '7'` in `ti`:\n    `new_val_0 = (val[7] * pow(10, new_length_0, MOD) + new_val_0) % MOD`\n    `new_val_0 = (7 * pow(10, 0, MOD) + 0) % MOD = 7`\n    `new_length_0 = (new_length_0 + length[7]) % MOD_EXP = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\n    Update `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n    `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2.  `2->0` (This is the first query, processed second in reverse)\n    `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n    `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_length_2 = 0`\n    Digit `c = '0'` in `ti`:\n    `new_val_2 = (val[0] * pow(10, new_length_2, MOD) + new_val_2) % MOD`\n    `new_val_2 = (7 * pow(10, 0, MOD) + 0) % MOD = 7`\n    `new_length_2 = (new_length_2 + length[0]) % MOD_EXP = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\n    Update `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n    `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nFinal calculation for `s = \"222\"`:\n`final_val = 0`, `current_power_of_10_exp = 0`\n1.
