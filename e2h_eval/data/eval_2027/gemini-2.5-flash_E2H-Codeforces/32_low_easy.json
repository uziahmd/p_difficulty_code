Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  The goal is pretty clear: I have an array of integers, and I need to remove *exactly* one element to minimize the instability, which is just the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the remaining array.  Given the constraints, I can assume a brute force approach won't work - I need to be smart about this. The examples really helped solidify the problem definition.\n\nI've got the input format in mind, and the fact that `n` can be up to 10^5, and the elements up to 10^5, so I need an efficient solution.  Thinking about it, I realized that sorting is the key.  Once the array is sorted, I get a clear perspective. Removing an arbitrary element is complex.\n\nThe critical insight I had is that removing either the absolute minimum or the absolute maximum *must* be considered.  I mean, the new maximum or minimum is going to be either the second smallest element or the second largest element, respectively. If I remove the smallest element, my new minimum becomes the second smallest. The maximum *could* be the original maximum. Similarly, if I remove the largest, my new maximum becomes the second largest element.  The minimum might be the same.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, if I sort the array, the new instability after removing the minimum (i.e., the first element) will be the difference between the largest element and the second smallest.  And the instability after removing the maximum (i.e., the last element) will be the difference between the second largest and the smallest.  I suspect that by evaluating only those two cases I can solve the problem!\n",
