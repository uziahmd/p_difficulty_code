The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem, and my immediate instinct is to break it down. We've got `n` houses in a circle, `m` tasks, and an array `a` listing the houses each task is at. Xenia starts at house 1 and has to complete tasks in order, moving clockwise. The challenge is to find the *minimum* time, where moving to a neighboring house takes one unit of time.\n\nMy first thought is to trace Xenia's movements. She starts at house 1, and the time for the first task is just `a1 - 1`, right? Then, for each subsequent task, the core of the problem lies in dealing with the circular nature of the road. If the next task (`a2`, `a3`, etc.) is *ahead* of Xenia's current position, the time is simple: just the difference between the target and the current house. However, if the next task is *behind*, that's where I need to account for going all the way around the ring. I figured out the formula is `n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nI did a quick dry run with example cases to make sure the logic is sound. After some careful consideration of the edge cases and the input/output constraints, I'm confident that the core part of the solution will be an iterative loop that updates the `current_house` after each task and adds the calculated time to the `total_time`.\n\nThe Python implementation is straightforward: I'll read the inputs using `sys.stdin`, iterate through the tasks, calculate the travel time based on the relative position of the current and target houses, and update the total time. Finally, print the result. The time complexity seems like it'll be O(m), and space complexity will also be O(m) to store the inputs. This seems pretty optimal, given the problem constraints!\n",
