Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Quest for the Optimal Angle**\n\nAlright, here's the game plan. My goal is to craft a Python script that can pinpoint three distinct vertices (v1, v2, v3) on a regular n-gon, ensuring the angle formed (v1-v2-v3) is as close as possible to a target angle 'a'.  The vertices are helpfully numbered 1 through n, clockwise.\n\nFirst, some geometric musings. In a regular n-gon, all vertices lie on a circle (the circumcircle).  Angles formed by three vertices (inscribed angles) are related to the arcs they \"intercept.\"  The key is that the inscribed angle's measure is half of the intercepted arc.  Each arc created by the n-gon's sides is 360/n degrees.\n\nLet's fix one vertex as our reference point, 'v2'.  Due to the regularity of the n-gon, it doesn't really matter which one we pick, so let's use vertex 2, and then adjust the output if needed. Now, let's say 'v1' is vertex 1. The challenge is choosing the third vertex, 'v3'.\n\nThe angle v1-v2-v3 intercepts an arc on the circumcircle. The number of sides making up this arc is critical.  Let's call that number 'k'.  The intercepted arc has a measure of `k * (360/n)` degrees. The inscribed angle's measure is then half of that, or `k * (180/n)`.  Our task is to find a 'k' value, within the bounds of a n-gon, that makes this formula as close as possible to the target angle 'a'.\n\nThe possible values for 'k', the number of sides (arcs) between v1 and v3 (excluding v2), range from 1 to n-2. A 'k' value of 1 means adjacent vertices. A 'k' value of n-2 implies that you are \"almost\" going around the shape to reach v3. The value k must be between 1 and n-2 to avoid redundant or non-viable angles.\n\nWe need to make `k * (180/n)` as close to 'a' as possible. To do this, let's calculate `x = (a * n) / 180`. This helps us find the optimal `k`.  This is finding `k` to be as close to `x`. Our solution relies on this relation between 'x' and 'k'. The number k must be an integer, so we choose the closest integers by rounding x.\n\nAfter that, we will take the floor and ceiling of `x`, and check the value, to find a value that is within our valid range of vertices for the given n-gon. With this strategy, the integer value of `k` is found, and then a proper vertex to achieve the angle is defined. I am confident that my solution will work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\n1.  **Circumcircle:** All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle.\n2.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An angle formed by three vertices of the polygon is an inscribed angle in this circumcircle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n3.  **Arc Measures:** A regular `n`-gon divides its circumcircle into `n` equal arcs. Each such arc (corresponding to one side of the polygon) measures `360/n` degrees.\n\nLet's fix the vertex `v2` of the angle. Due to symmetry, we can choose any vertex for `v2`. Let's choose `v2` to be vertex `1`.\nNow, we need to choose two other distinct vertices `v1` and `v3`. Let `v1` be vertex `2`.\nThen `v3` must be a vertex distinct from `1` and `2`. So `v3` can be any vertex from `3` to `n`.\n\nThe angle `v1-v2-v3` (which is `2-1-v3` in our setup) intercepts the arc `2-v3` that does not contain vertex `1`.\nLet `k` be the number of polygon edges on this arc `2-v3`.\nThe arc measure will be `k * (360/n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `2-1-v3` will then be `(k * (360/n)) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\n**Determining Possible Values for `k`**\n\nWith `v2=1` and `v1=2`:\n*   If `v3=3`, the arc `2-3` has 1 edge. So `k=1`. The angle is `1 * (180/n)`.\n*   If `v3=4`, the arc `2-4` has 2 edges (edges `2-3` and `3-4`). So `k=2`. The angle is `2 * (180/n)`.\n*   ...\n*   If `v3=n`, the arc `2-n` has `n-2` edges (edges `2-3, 3-4, ..., (n-1)-n`). So `k=n-2`. The angle is `(n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for `k` are integers from `1` to `n-2`.\nThe possible angles are `1 * (180/n), 2 * (180/n), ..., (n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nLet `base_angle = 180.0 / n`.\nWe want to minimize `|k * base_angle - a|`.\nThis is equivalent to minimizing `|k - a / base_angle|`.\nLet `x = a / base_angle = a / (180.0 / n) = (a * n) / 180.0`.\nWe need to find an integer `k` in `[1, n-2]` that is closest to `x`.\n\nThe integer closest to `x` is `round(x)`. Let's call this `k_rounded`.\nSince `k` must be within the range `[1, n-2]`, we clamp `k_rounded` to this range:\n`best_k = max(1, min(n - 2, int(round(x))))`.\n\n**Constructing the Output Vertices**\n\nOnce we have `best_k`, we need to output `v1, v2, v3`.\nUsing our chosen setup:\n*   `v2 = 1`\n*   `v1 = 2`\n*   `v3` is the vertex that forms `best_k` segments from `v1` (going clockwise and not passing `v2`).\n    If `v1=2`, and we need `best_k` segments, then `v3` will be `2 + best_k`.\n    However, vertex indices wrap around `n`. So, `v3 = (v1 + best_k - 1) % n + 1`.\n    Substituting `v1=2`: `v3 = (2 + best_k - 1) % n + 1 = (1 + best_k) % n + 1`.\n\nLet's verify this for small `n`:\n*   If `n=3`, `best_k` must be `1`. `v1=2, v2=1, v3=(1+1)%3+1 = 3`. Output: `2 1 3`. The angle `2-1-3` is `1 * (180/3) = 60` degrees. This is correct for an equilateral triangle.\n*   If `n=4, a=67`: `x = (67 * 4) / 180.0 = 1.488...`. `k_rounded = 1`. `best_k = max(1, min(2, 1)) = 1`.\n    `v1=2, v2=1, v3=(1+1)%4+1 = 3`. Output: `2 1 3`. Angle `2-1-3` is `1 * (180/4) = 45` degrees. `|45-67|=22`.\n*   If `n=4, a=68`: `x = (68 * 4) / 180.0 = 1.511...`. `k_rounded = 2`. `best_k = max(1, min(2, 2)) = 2`.\n    `v1=2, v2=1, v3=(1+2)%4+1 = 4`. Output: `2 1 4`. Angle `2-1-4` is `2 * (180/4) = 90` degrees. `|90-68|=22`.\n\nThe logic seems sound. The use of `round()` for `x.5` cases (Python 3's `round()` rounds to the nearest even integer) is acceptable because if `x` is exactly `k + 0.5`, both `k` and `k+1` result in angles equally close to `a`, and any optimal solution is fine.\n\n**Input and Output Format**\n\nInput: `n a`\nOutput: `v1 v2 v3`\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Calculate x = a / (180/n), which is the ideal 'k' value (not necessarily integer)\n    # k is the number of segments on the intercepted arc.\n    # The angle is k * (180/n) degrees.\n    # We want to find k such that |k * (180/n) - a| is minimized.\n    # This is equivalent to minimizing |k - a / (180/n)|.\n    # Let x = a / (180/n) = (a * n) / 180.0\n    x = (a * n) / 180.0\n\n    # The optimal integer k is usually round(x).\n    # However, k must be in the range [1, n-2].\n    # For n=3, k must be 1.
