Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a competitive programming challenge. The core idea is to build an NxN board with numbers 1 to N^2.  The twist? A rook (horizontal/vertical moves) must pay fewer vuns (a fee for teleports) than a queen (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves). If this isn't possible, I need to output -1.  The rules are: start at '1', move to the lowest unvisited reachable cell, and teleport (paying 1 vun) if stuck.\n\n**Rook vs. Queen Dynamics and the 'Vun' Challenge**\n\nMy first instinct is that the queen should have fewer vuns than the rook.  A queen always has at least as many options as a rook, meaning the rook is more likely to get 'stuck' due to its restricted movement.  However, this makes me rethink the core rule of taking the *minimal number* as that could be counter-intuitive.\nLet's analyze it: if `Q_reachable` is empty, then `R_reachable` also has to be empty because the queen's reach is superset to the rook's reach.\n\n**Formalizing the Approach and Path Dependence**\n\nI need to formalize the sets of reachable cells and how this relates to vuns.  Let's define `S_R(pos, visited)` and `S_Q(pos, visited)` as the sets of *unvisited* cells reachable by rook and queen respectively from position `pos`. \"Crucially, the path of the Rook and Queen is independent\". I realize the key is that both figures have their own \"visited\" sets and thus could cause a divergence in vuns.\n\n**The Impossible Case? Re-evaluation**\n\nThis changes everything. If the queen is forced to pay a vun, it means that for the current position, all accessible cells are already in its visited set. But since a rook *also* can't move and all accessible cells for the Rook is subset or equal to the queen's accessibility, the rook also has to teleport and thus pay a vun. So both are paying the same vuns at each teleportation step. This would mean it seems impossible to have `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\n\n**Debugging and Refining the Logic**\n\nI have to carefully rethink the conditions. My gut says it can't be done, but I need a solid proof or a counterexample. Let me analyze small test cases, like N=2, and attempt a valid board. I see I have to put numbers carefully. I have to make the queen pay a vun but not the rook. Maybe the rook's path should be sparse, while the queen's blocks its own moves.  So both figure's paths have their own unique \"visited\" sets, which is key.\n\n**Example Case Analysis and Search for a Solution**\n\nAnalyzing the N=4 example in the problem description is a critical step, it's where I can trace the path of the rook and the queen, and identify the conditions to meet the criteria. This seems the way to figure out how the board should be built. So it makes the rook and the queen have differing paths on the same board, this may be helpful. I need to continue tracing. The goal is to construct this example case and learn why it works.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an $N \\times N$ board, filled with numbers from $1$ to $N^2$ exactly once, such that a rook pays strictly less \"vuns\" than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print -1.\n\nLet's first understand the rules for paying vuns:\n1. Both the rook and queen start at the cell containing the number 1. This cell is marked as visited for each piece.\n2. In each step, a piece looks for unvisited cells it can reach in one move.\n3. If there are such cells, it moves to the one with the minimal number among them.\n4. If all accessible cells are already visited, but there are still unvisited cells on the board, the piece \"teleports\" to the unvisited cell with the minimal number and pays 1 vun.\n5. The process stops when all cells are visited.\n\nCrucially, the set of visited cells is maintained independently for the rook and the queen.\n\n**Case N=1:**\nThe board is just `[1]`. Both pieces start at 1. All cells are visited. No moves are made, no vuns are paid. Rook vuns = 0, Queen vuns = 0. Since $0 < 0$ is false, N=1 has no solution. Output -1.\n\n**General Strategy:**\nWe need `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`. This means we need to engineer a situation where the queen gets stuck (i.e., all cells reachable by the queen are already visited) and pays a vun, while the rook does not get stuck at that same point, or gets stuck fewer times overall.\n\nThe queen has more movement options (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) than the rook (horizontal, vertical). This means from any given position, a queen can reach a superset of cells that a rook can.\nIf we want the queen to get stuck and pay a vun, it means its `Q_reachable` set becomes empty. This is harder to achieve for a queen than for a rook, because the queen can reach more cells.\n\nThe key insight from the example for N=4 is that we want the queen to exhaust its reachable options quicker than the rook, leading to a vun. This can happen if the queen, by picking smaller numbers, visits cells that are crucial for its future moves, effectively trapping itself. The rook, having fewer options, might be forced to pick larger numbers, leaving more \"escape routes\" open.\n\nConsider a checkerboard pattern. A queen can move between squares of different colors (e.g., from white to black or black to white). A rook can also move between squares of different colors. However, a queen can move diagonally, which is often a \"faster\" way to cover the board, especially if the board is large and numbers are strategically placed.\n\nLet's try to place small numbers in a way that helps the rook and hinders the queen.\nIf we place numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, N^2$ such that the numbers are \"spread out\" for the rook, but \"clustered\" for the queen, it might work.\n\nA simple construction for $N > 1$:\nWe can fill the board by iterating through cells and assigning numbers. Let's try to fill numbers 1 to $N^2$ in two phases:\n1. Fill numbers $1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ in some cells.\n2. Fill numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil + 1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the remaining cells.\n\nConsider filling the board in a specific pattern to create the desired effect.\nA common strategy in competitive programming for such problems is to fill \"half\" the cells with small numbers and the other \"half\" with large numbers.\nLet's try to fill cells $(i, j)$ where $(i+j)$ is even with small numbers, and cells where $(i+j)$ is odd with large numbers, or vice-versa. This creates a checkerboard pattern.\n\nLet's fill the board such that:\n- Cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is even get numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\n- Cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is odd get numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil + 1, \\ldots, N^2$.\n\nA rook can always move between cells of different parity sums (e.g., from $(i,j)$ to $(i, j+1)$, parity changes by 1).\nA queen can also move between cells of different parity sums.\nHowever, a queen can move diagonally, which means it can stay on cells of the same parity sum (e.g., from $(i,j)$ to $(i+1, j+1)$, parity sum changes by 2, so remains same parity).\n\nThis suggests that if we place all small numbers on cells of one parity, and all large numbers on cells of the other parity:\n- The rook, moving from a small-number cell, can only move to a large-number cell.\n- The queen, moving from a small-number cell, can move to a large-number cell (horizontally/vertically) OR to another small-number cell (diagonally).\n\nThis strategy might not work directly to make the queen pay more, because the queen would prioritize smaller numbers. If small numbers are on same-parity cells, the queen can stay on those cells and exhaust them before moving to large-number cells.\n\nWhat if we try to place numbers in a snake-like pattern?\nFor example, fill row 0 from left to right, row 1 from right to left, row 2 from left to right, etc.\nThis is a standard way to fill a board, but it doesn't give any obvious advantage to the rook.\n\nThe example solution for N=4 is very specific. Let's analyze its structure.\nThe numbers 1 to 16 are:\n1 (2,1)\n2 (3,3)\n3 (0,1)\n4 (0,0)\n5 (1,1)\n6 (0,2)\n7 (1,0)\n8 (3,1)\n9 (1,2)\n10 (2,3)\n11 (2,2)\n12 (0,3)\n13 (3,0)\n14 (2,0)\n15 (1,3)\n16 (3,2)\n\nSmall numbers are scattered:\n1 at (2,1)\n2 at (3,3)\n3 at (0,1)\n4 at (0,0)\n\nThis board seems to have small numbers (1-4) in the corners and middle-ish.\nThe cells with even sum $i+j$: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)\nThe cells with odd sum $i+j$: (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)\n\nLet's check the parity of $i+j$ for small numbers:\n1 (2,1): $2+1=3$ (odd)\n2 (3,3): $3+3=6$ (even)\n3 (0,1): $0+1=1$ (odd)\n4 (0,0): $0+0=0$ (even)\n\nThe small numbers are mixed parity. So the checkerboard strategy with small/large numbers on specific parities isn't what the example is doing.\n\nThe example board is likely a result of some specific construction.\nWhat if we fill the board in a way that minimizes the \"connectedness\" of small numbers for the queen?\nOne common pattern is to fill the first half of cells with numbers $1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ and the second half with numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil + 1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nLet's try to fill the board by alternating small and large numbers.\nFor example, fill cells $(i,j)$ with $i \\times N + j + 1$.\nThis is just a simple row-major filling.\nFor $N=2$:\n1 2\n3 4\nRook: 1->2->4->3 (0 vuns)\nQueen: 1->2->3->4 (0 vuns)\nDoesn't work.\n\nFor $N=3$:\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\nRook: 1->2->3->6->9->8->7->4->5 (0 vuns)\nQueen: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9 (0 vuns)\nDoesn't work.\n\nIt seems that for $N \\le 3$, it's impossible.\nN=1: -1\nN=2: -1 (based on analysis, hard to get vuns for queen without rook getting them too)\nN=3: -1 (likely)\n\nWhat about the example for N=4?\nThe rook pays 1 vun, queen pays 2 vuns.\nThis confirms that `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is possible.\n\nThe strategy for $N \\ge 4$:\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ into cells $(i, j)$ such that $i+j$ is odd.\nPlace numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil + 1, \\ldots, N^2$ into cells $(i, j)$ such that $i+j$ is even.\nLet's try this for $N=4$.\nCells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ odd: (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2) - 8 cells.\nCells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ even: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3) - 8 cells.\n$N^2 = 16$. $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil = 8$.\nSo numbers $1, \\ldots, 8$ go into odd-sum cells.\nNumbers $9, \\ldots, 16$ go into even-sum cells.\n\nLet's fill the board:\nNumbers 1 to 8:\n(0,1) 1, (0,3) 2\n(1,0) 3, (1,2) 4\n(2,1) 5, (2,3) 6\n(3,0) 7, (3,2) 8\n\nNumbers 9 to 16:\n(0,0) 9, (0,2) 10\n(1,1) 11, (1,3) 12\n(2,0) 13, (2,2) 14\n(3,1) 15, (3,3) 16\n\nBoard:\n9  1 10  2\n3 11  4 12\n13  5 14  6\n7 15  8 16\n\nLet's trace this board for N=4.\nStart at 1 (0,1).\n\nRook:\n1.

Total 0 vuns.\n\nThis strategy (small numbers on odd sum $i+j$, large numbers on even sum $i+j$) results in rook_vuns = 1, queen_vuns = 0 for N=4. This is `1 < 0` (false). So this strategy doesn't work.\n\nThe example board for N=4 has 1 at (2,1) and 2 at (3,3).\n(2,1) is odd sum (2+1=3).\n(3,3) is even sum (3+3=6).\nSo it's not simply separating numbers by parity of $i+j$.\n\nLet's try to construct a general solution for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe condition $N < 4$ outputting -1 is important.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has a specific structure.\nLet's try to generalize that structure. The numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ are split into two groups.\nGroup 1: Small numbers $1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\nGroup 2: Large numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil + 1, \\ldots, N^2$.\n\nLet's place the small numbers in a specific pattern, and large numbers in the remaining cells.\nA pattern that could make a difference is to place small numbers in an \"L\" shape or a cross shape, leaving many cells reachable for the rook but not for the queen.\n\nConsider filling the first half of the numbers ($1, \\ldots, N^2/2$) into cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is odd, and the second half ($N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$) into cells where $i+j$ is even.\nLet's re-verify the $N=4$ example values and their parities for $i+j$:\n(2,1) 1 (odd)\n(3,3) 2 (even)\n(0,1) 3 (odd)\n(0,0) 4 (even)\n(1,1) 5 (even)\n(0,2) 6 (even)\n(1,0) 7 (odd)\n(3,1) 8 (odd)\n(1,2) 9 (odd)\n(2,3) 10 (odd)\n(2,2) 11 (even)\n(0,3) 12 (odd)\n(3,0) 13 (odd)\n(2,0) 14 (even)\n(1,3) 15 (odd)\n(3,2) 16 (even)\n\nCounts:\nOdd-sum cells: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 (9 numbers)\nEven-sum cells: 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 14, 16 (7 numbers)\nTotal 16.\nThis is not a simple split by parity. The example board is quite specific.\n\nThe problem states $N \\ge 1$. For $N=1, 2, 3$, it's likely -1.\nFor $N=1$, it is -1.\nFor $N=2$:\nLet's try to prove $N=2$ is impossible.\nThe board has 4 cells. Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.\nLet (r1, c1) be the cell with 1.\nRook must visit all cells. Queen must visit all cells.\nIf a piece pays a vun, it means it's stuck.\nTo get stuck, all cells in its row/col (for rook) or row/col/diag (for queen) must be visited.\nFor N=2, a cell (r,c) has 1 row, 1 col, and at most 2 diagonals.\nExample: (0,0) has (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\nIf 1 is at (0,0):\nRook reachable: (0,1), (1,0). Queen reachable: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\nSuppose 2 is at (0,1), 3 at (1,0), 4 at (1,1).\nRook path: 1->2 (from (0,0) to (0,1)). Visited={1,2}.\nFrom (0,1), rook can reach (1,1) (value 4). Rook moves to 4. Visited={1,2,4}.\nFrom (1,1), rook can reach (1,0) (value 3). Rook moves to 3. Visited={1,2,4,3}. 0 vuns.\nQueen path: 1->2 (from (0,0) to (0,1)). Visited={1,2}.\nFrom (0,1), queen can reach (1,0) (value 3), (1,1) (value 4). Queen moves to 3. Visited={1,2,3}.\nFrom (1,0), queen can reach (1,1) (value 4). Queen moves to 4. Visited={1,2,3,4}. 0 vuns.\nBoth 0.\n\nIt seems very hard to make the queen pay a vun for N=2. The board is too small.\nIf the queen pays a vun, it means all 3 cells reachable from its current position are visited.\nE.g., if queen is at (0,0), and (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are all visited. But these are all other cells. So it means all cells are visited.\nThis means for N=2, a piece can only pay a vun if it's at the *last* unvisited cell, and it can't move to any other unvisited cell (because there are none). This implies the last cell is the one it teleports to, but it's already on it, so no vun paid.\nThis logic is wrong. \"If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited\".\nFor N=2, if queen is at (0,0) and (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are all visited, then all cells are visited. So no vun is paid.\nThis means for N=2, no vuns are ever paid by either piece. Both pay 0. So N=2 is -1.\n\nWhat about N=3?\nBoard has 9 cells.\nIf a piece is at (1,1) (center):\nRook can reach 4 cells in row/col.\nQueen can reach 8 cells (all other cells).\nIf 1 is at (1,1).\nQueen picks min of 8 cells.\nIf 1 is at (0,0) (corner):\nRook can reach 4 cells.\nQueen can reach 6 cells.\nIf 1 is at (0,1) (edge):\nRook can reach 6 cells.\nQueen can reach 8 cells.\n\nIt's hard to make the queen pay a vun for N=3.\nIf the queen gets stuck, it means all 8 other cells (if at center) or 6 (if at corner) or 8 (if at edge) are already visited.\nIf it's at a corner, e.g. (0,0), it can reach (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2).\nIf these 6 cells are visited, then 1 and these 6 cells are visited (total 7 cells).\nThere are 2 remaining unvisited cells. The queen teleports to the minimum of these 2 and pays 1 vun.\nThis is possible for N=3.\n\nLet's try the checkerboard pattern again, but with a slight modification.\nFill the board in a specific order.\nLet $N_{small} = \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\nLet $N_{large} = N^2 - N_{small}$.\nWe need to assign numbers $1, \\ldots, N_{small}$ to $N_{small}$ cells, and $N_{small}+1, \\ldots, N^2$ to $N_{large}$ cells.\n\nConsider placing numbers $1, \\ldots, N_{small}$ in a \"sparse\" way that is hard for the queen to collect all of them, but easy for the rook.\nAnd place $N_{small}+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by first filling cells with $i+j$ even, then cells with $i+j$ odd.\nThis is what I tried above, which resulted in queen_vuns=0, rook_vuns=1 for N=4. This is $1 < 0$ (false).\nWe need rook_vuns to be smaller.\n\nWhat if we fill cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is odd with smaller numbers, and cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is even with larger numbers?\nThis is the opposite of my previous attempt.\nFor $N=4$:\nOdd-sum cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2) - 8 cells.\nEven-sum cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3) - 8 cells.\n$N^2 = 16$. $N_{small} = 8$. $N_{large} = 8$.\nNumbers $1, \\ldots, 8$ go into odd-sum cells.\nNumbers $9, \\ldots, 16$ go into even-sum cells.\n\nFill odd-sum cells with $1, \\ldots, 8$ in reading order:\n(0,1) 1, (0,3) 2\n(1,0) 3, (1,2) 4\n(2,1) 5, (2,3) 6\n(3,0) 7, (3,2) 8\n\nFill even-sum cells with $9, \\ldots, 16$ in reading order:\n(0,0) 9, (0,2) 10\n(1,1) 11, (1,3) 12\n(2,0) 13, (2,2) 14\n(3,1) 15, (3,3) 16\n\nBoard (same as my previous failed attempt):\n9  1 10  2\n3 11  4 12\n13  5 14  6\n7 15  8 16\n\nThe analysis for this board gave `rook_vuns = 1`, `queen_vuns = 0`. This is not `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\n\nThis means the simple checkerboard pattern does not work for $N=4$.\nThe example output for $N=4$ must be using a more complex pattern or a specific placement of numbers.\n\nLet's re-examine the example output for N=4:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nSmall numbers:\n1 at (2,1)\n2 at (3,3)\n3 at (0,1)\n4 at (0,0)\n\nNotice that 1 is in an odd-sum cell (2+1=3).\n2 is in an even-sum cell (3+3=6).\n3 is in an odd-sum cell (0+1=1).\n4 is in an even-sum cell (0+0=0).\n\nThis is an alternating pattern for the small numbers: odd, then even, then odd, then even.\nThis means the small numbers $1, 3, 5, \\ldots$ are on odd-sum cells, and $2, 4, 6, \\ldots$ are on even-sum cells.\nLet's try this construction.\nNumbers $k$ such that $k$ is odd are placed in cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\nNumbers $k$ such that $k$ is even are placed in cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even.\n\nLet's try this for $N=4$.\nOdd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15.

For $N=3$, my logic suggests 0 vuns.\nFor $N=1,2,3$, it seems to be -1.\nThe example is for $N=4$.\n\nLet's try to construct a solution for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has a center-like arrangement for 1.\n1 is at (2,1).\nThe cells surrounding 1 are (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\nTheir values: 5, 9, 14, 11, 13, 8, 16.\nThe smallest among these is 5.\nQueen (from 1) goes to 3.\nRook (from 1) goes to 3.\nSo the first step is the same.\n\nThe problem is that a general construction might be difficult.\nIf $N$ is small ($N=1,2,3$), it might be impossible.\nFor $N=1$, it is impossible.\nFor $N=2$, it is impossible (0 vuns for both).\nFor $N=3$:\nIf a piece is at (1,1) (center), and all 8 other cells are visited, it pays 0 vuns.\nIf a piece is at (0,0) (corner), it can reach 6 cells. If these 6 are visited, 1 + 6 = 7 cells are visited. 2 cells remain. It pays 1 vun.\nIf a piece is at (0,1) (edge), it can reach 8 cells. If these 8 are visited, 1 + 8 = 9 cells are visited. 0 cells remain. It pays 0 vuns.\n\nSo for $N=3$, vuns can be paid if the piece is at a corner, and all 6 reachable cells are visited, and there are still unvisited cells.\nThis is a tricky problem.\nThe sample explanation itself says: \"In case we have $1 \\times 1$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.\" This implies $N=1$ is -1.\n\nIf $N=2,3$, is it -1?\nThe problem statement does not say \"for $N \\ge 4$\". It says $1 \\le N \\le 500$.\nSo we must provide a solution for all $N \\ge 1$.\n\nWhat if for $N=2,3$ there is no solution?\nThe problem asks \"Help him to find such $N \\times N$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\"\nSo for $N=1,2,3$, it's likely -1.\nLet's assume $N=1,2,3$ are -1.\n\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nThe example output for $N=4$ has a very specific pattern.\nLet's try to generalize that pattern.\nThe numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ are placed in a specific way, and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are placed in the remaining cells.\nThe example solution for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's divide numbers into two sets:\nSet A: $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ (first half)\nSet B: $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ (second half)\nFor $N=4$, $N^2/2 = 8$.\nSet A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\nSet B: {9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}\n\nLocations of Set A numbers in the example board:\n1: (2,1)\n2: (3,3)\n3: (0,1)\n4: (0,0)\n5: (1,1)\n6: (0,2)\n7: (1,0)\n8: (3,1)\n\nLocations of Set B numbers:\n9: (1,2)\n10: (2,3)\n11: (2,2)\n12: (0,3)\n13: (3,0)\n14: (2,0)\n15: (1,3)\n16: (3,2)\n\nThis looks like numbers from Set A are placed in a \"cross\" or \"X\" pattern, and numbers from Set B fill the remaining cells.\nIt's not that simple.\nThe numbers 1-8 are scattered.\n(0,0)=4, (0,1)=3, (0,2)=6, (0,3)=12\n(1,0)=7, (1,1)=5, (1,2)=9, (1,3)=15\n(2,0)=14, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=11, (2,3)=10\n(3,0)=13, (3,1)=8, (3,2)=16, (3,3)=2\n\nThis pattern seems to be:\nFill the first $N/2$ rows with $N^2/2+1 \\ldots N^2$ (large numbers)\nFill the last $N/2$ rows with $1 \\ldots N^2/2$ (small numbers)\nThis is a very simple pattern. Let's try it for $N=4$.\nBoard:\n13 14 15 16\n9 10 11 12\n1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8\nStart at 1 (2,0).\nRook: 1 (2,0) -> 2 (2,1) -> 3 (2,2) -> 4 (2,3) -> 8 (3,3) -> 7 (3,2) -> 6 (3,1) -> 5 (3,0) -> 9 (1,0) -> 10 (1,1) -> 11 (1,2) -> 12 (1,3) -> 16 (0,3) -> 15 (0,2) -> 14 (0,1) -> 13 (0,0). Rook vuns = 0.\nQueen: Same path. Queen vuns = 0.\nThis doesn't work.\n\nThe example solution for N=4 is very specific.\nIt might be that for $N \\ge 4$, a simple construction based on the checkerboard pattern or filling rows/columns in a specific order with small/large numbers is sufficient.\nLet's try a construction that is simple to implement and test.\nFill the top-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block with small numbers, etc.\nNo, that's not general enough.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating through rows. In each row, alternate placing small and large numbers.\nNumbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nLet $S = \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, S$ into a set of cells.\nPlace numbers $S+1, \\ldots, N^2$ into the remaining cells.\n\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nLet's try to fill the board such that:\nNumbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ are put in cells $(i,j)$ where $i$ is even and $j$ is even, OR $i$ is odd and $j$ is odd. (These are cells where $i+j$ is even).\nNumbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are put in cells $(i,j)$ where $i$ is even and $j$ is odd, OR $i$ is odd and $j$ is even. (These are cells where $i+j$ is odd).\nThis is the checkerboard pattern.\nNumber of even-sum cells: $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$. Number of odd-sum cells: $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$.\nIf $N^2$ is even, both counts are $N^2/2$.\nIf $N^2$ is odd, even-sum cells have one more.\n\nLet's use this pattern for $N \\ge 4$:\nFill cells $(i,j)$ where $(i+j)$ is even with numbers $1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\nFill cells $(i,j)$ where $(i+j)$ is odd with numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil + 1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nLet's call the first set of numbers \"small\" and the second set \"large\".\nBoard `grid[N][N]`.\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = ceil(N*N/2) + 1`\nIterate $i$ from $0$ to $N-1$, $j$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\nIf $(i+j)$ is even: `grid[i][j] = small_num++`\nIf $(i+j)$ is odd: `grid[i][j] = large_num++`\n\nLet's test this construction for $N=4$.\n$N^2=16$. $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil = 8$.\nSmall numbers $1, \\ldots, 8$.

Reachable: ... Queen will pick 4, then 5, ..., 16 in order.\nQueen vuns = 0.\n\nThis means all simple patterns result in 0 vuns for both.\nThe problem is much harder than it looks. The specific example output must be the key.\n\nLet's re-examine the example output for N=4.\nRook: 1 vun. Queen: 2 vuns.\nThis is `1 < 2`.\nThe difference is that the queen visits more cells that are \"connected\" to its current path, while the rook is forced to take some \"detours\" or leave more cells unvisited.\nThe example output for N=4 is the solution for N=4.\nFor $N=1,2,3$, output -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$, is there a general construction?\nThe problem statement says $N \\le 500$. A general construction is expected.\n\nWhat if we generalize the $N=4$ board as two sets of numbers, $1 \\dots N^2/2$ and $N^2/2+1 \\dots N^2$?\nLet's try to put numbers $1 \\dots N^2/2$ on 'black' squares of a checkerboard, and $N^2/2+1 \\dots N^2$ on 'white' squares.\nThis is `(i+j)%2 == 0` vs `(i+j)%2 == 1`.\nLet's assign $1 \\dots N^2/2$ to cells with $i+j$ even, and $N^2/2+1 \\dots N^2$ to cells with $i+j$ odd.\nThis is what I tried and failed with (rook_vuns=0, queen_vuns=0).\n\nThe example output for N=4 is given.\nThe problem statement is \"Help him to find such $N \\times N$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\"\nIt does not say \"for $N \\ge 4$\".\nSo for $N=1,2,3$ it's -1. For $N=4$ use the example.\nWhat about $N > 4$?\nThe problem is likely testing if we can figure out the N=1,2,3 cases, and then for N=4 use the example, and for N>4 a similar pattern to N=4 or a different general pattern.\n\nOne possible interpretation: the problem implies that such a board exists for all $N \\ge 4$.\nThe output for $N=4$ has a specific arrangement that ensures rook_vuns < queen_vuns.\nThe pattern for $N=4$ is not immediately obvious for generalization.\n\nLet's try to construct a solution for $N \\ge 4$ using a simpler pattern that might work.\nConsider filling the board in a way that separates small numbers from large numbers by a \"barrier\" that is easily crossed by a rook but not by a queen.\nThis is very difficult to design.\n\nWhat if the solution is simply the $N=4$ board for $N=4$, and for $N>4$ we can use a similar logic?\nThe problem is that for $N > 4$, the $N=4$ board is not directly applicable.\nWe need an $N \\times N$ board.\n\nThe problem could be a trick. Maybe for $N \\ge 4$, we can just use a simple construction.\nLet's try to fill the board by alternating numbers in a specific way.\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nFill the board in a snake-like pattern.\nRow 0: 1, 2, 3, ... N\nRow 1: 2N, 2N-1, ..., N+1\nRow 2: 2N+1, ..., 3N\n...\nThis is a standard row-major traversal, but alternating direction.\nFor $N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n8  7  6  5\n9 10 11 12\n16 15 14 13\n\nStart at 1 (0,0).\nRook: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->12->13->14->15->16. Rook vuns = 0.\nQueen: Same path. Queen vuns = 0.\nThis doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we fill the board with small numbers in the first $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$ rows, and large numbers in the remaining rows?\n$N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\nThis was already tested, 0 vuns for both.\n\nWhat if we fill the board such that numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ are placed in the first $N/2$ rows in a snake-like pattern, and numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are placed in the remaining $N/2$ rows in a snake-like pattern?\nFor $N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n8  7  6  5\n9 10 11 12\n16 15 14 13\nThis also gives 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only remaining option is that there is a special construction for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is likely a part of a larger family of solutions.\nThe key must be to make the queen get stuck while the rook does not.\nThe queen gets stuck if all cells in its row, column, and diagonals are visited.\nThe rook gets stuck if all cells in its row and column are visited.\n\nConsider placing all small numbers in a \"sparse\" way for the queen.\nWhat if we place numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ on cells $(i,j)$ such that $i$ is even, and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ on cells $(i,j)$ where $i$ is odd?\nThis means half the rows have small numbers, half have large numbers.\nFor $N=4$:\nRows 0, 2 have small numbers. Rows 1, 3 have large numbers.\n1  2  3  4\n9 10 11 12\n5  6  7  8\n13 14 15 16\n\nStart at 1 (0,0).\nRook: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->12->13->14->15->16. Rook vuns = 0.\nQueen: Same path. Queen vuns = 0.\n\nThis is a very difficult problem for a competitive programming context if a simple pattern doesn't work and a specific construction like the example is needed for $N=4$ and then a generalization for $N>4$.\n\nThe example output for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's try to identify a pattern for the values $1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nThe numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ are placed.\nLet's try to fill the board with two alternating sequences.\nSequence 1: $1, 3, 5, \\dots$ (odd numbers)\nSequence 2: $2, 4, 6, \\dots$ (even numbers)\n\nFill the board like this:\nFor $i = 0 \\ldots N-1$:\n  For $j = 0 \\ldots N-1$:\n    If $(i \\% 2 == 0)$: (even row)\n      If $(j \\% 2 == 0)$: (even col) fill with odd number\n      Else (odd col): fill with even number\n    Else (odd row):\n      If $(j \\% 2 == 0)$: (even col) fill with even number\n      Else (odd col): fill with odd number\n\nThis means cells $(i,j)$ where $i,j$ are both even or both odd get odd numbers.\nCells $(i,j)$ where one is even and one is odd get even numbers.\nThis implies odd numbers go to cells where $i+j$ is even.\nEven numbers go to cells where $i+j$ is odd.\nThis is exactly the checkerboard pattern I tried earlier.\nIt resulted in 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only pattern that seems to work is the example output for N=4, and for N=1,2,3 output -1.\nWhat about $N > 4$?\nIt is possible that for $N > 4$ any simple pattern works.\nOr maybe the problem setters expect us to find a general solution that is a variant of the N=4 example.\n\nLet's consider the constraints $N \\le 500$. This means $N^2$ can be up to $250000$.\nA simulation of the process would be $N^2$ steps, and each step involves finding min among $O(N)$ cells. Total $O(N^3)$.\nWith $N=500$, $N^3 = 125 \\times 10^6$, which is too slow for a full simulation within typical time limits (1-2 seconds).\nThis means we are not expected to simulate for $N=500$. We are expected to find a construction.\n\nThe solution must be a simple construction that works for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe most common \"simple\" constructions are row-major, snake, or checkerboard.\nNone of these worked in my analysis.\n\nThe problem is from \"Road to 1600\", which implies it's not super hard, but tricky.\nThe trick might be the $N=1,2,3$ cases, and then for $N \\ge 4$ there is a specific simple pattern.\nCould it be that the example output for $N=4$ is just *one* specific solution, and a simpler general solution exists for $N \\ge 4$?\n\nLet's try to fill the board in a \"spiral\" pattern.\nOr maybe the numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are placed in a specific way.\nLet's place $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ into cells $(i,j)$ where $i$ is even.\nAnd $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ into cells $(i,j)$ where $i$ is odd.\nThis is what I tried before. It gave 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only strategy that resulted in non-zero vuns for the example $N=4$ was the official example.\nThis suggests that for $N \\ge 4$, we should use a generalization of the example.\nBut the example itself is not easy to generalize.\n\nWhat if we just print the $N=4$ example for all $N \\ge 4$? No, that's not possible, the board size changes.\n\nFinal attempt at a general pattern for $N \\ge 4$:\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ in the top-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block and the bottom-right $N/2 \\times N/2$ block.\nPlace numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the top-right $N/2 \\times N/2$ block and the bottom-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block.\nThis pattern creates a \"cross\" of small numbers, and an \"anti-cross\" of large numbers.\nThis was tested for $N=4$ and resulted in 0 vuns for both.\n\nIt's highly likely that for $N=1,2,3$ the answer is -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$, the solution is probably the example given for $N=4$, but generalized.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's try to fill the board with two sequences:\nSequence 1: $1, 2, \\dots, N^2/2$\nSequence 2: $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$\n\nFill `board[i][j]` with `seq1_idx` or `seq2_idx`.\nThe example places $1, \\dots, 8$ and $9, \\dots, 16$.\nThe locations of $1, \\dots, 8$ are:\n(2,1), (3,3), (0,1), (0,0), (1,1), (0,2), (1,0), (3,1)\nThe locations of $9, \\dots, 16$ are:\n(1,2), (2,3), (2,2), (0,3), (3,0), (2,0), (1,3), (3,2)\n\nLet's divide $N$ by 2. Let $M = N/2$.\nThe cells for small numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are:\n$(i, j)$ such that $i < M$ and $j < M$ (top-left) AND $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge M$ and $j \\ge M$ (bottom-right).\nThis is $2 \\times M^2$ cells.\nThe cells for large numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are:\n$(i, j)$ such that $i < M$ and $j \\ge M$ (top-right) AND $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge M$ and $j < M$ (bottom-left).\nThis is also $2 \\times M^2$ cells.\nThis is the pattern that results in 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only way to get rook_vuns < queen_vuns is if queen_vuns is positive.\nThis means the queen must get stuck.\nThe example for N=4 is the most crucial part.\nMaybe the problem setters just want us to hardcode the N=4 solution and print -1 for others.\nBut $N \\le 500$ makes that unlikely.\n\nA solution for $N \\ge 4$:\nFill cells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ even with values from $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$.\nFill cells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ odd with values from $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nLet's call this pattern A.\nThis was tested and gave 0 vuns for both.\n\nWhat if we reverse the filling?\nFill cells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ odd with values from $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$.\nFill cells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ even with values from $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nLet's call this pattern B.\nThis was also tested and gave 0 vuns for both.\n\nMy previous manual trace for pattern B for N=4 was incorrect.\nLet's re-trace pattern B for N=4:\nBoard:\n9  1 10  2\n3 11  4 12\n13  5 14  6\n7 15  8 16\n\nRook path: 1->2->6->5->11->3->4->8->7->13->14->10->9->(vun)12->16->15. Total 1 vun.\nQueen path: 1->2->4->3->5->6->8->7->13->10->9->11->12->15->16. Total 0 vuns.\nRook: 1 vun, Queen: 0 vuns.\nThis is `1 < 0` (false). Rook pays more.\n\nSo this pattern (Pattern B) makes the rook pay more than the queen.\nThe problem asks for rook_vuns < queen_vuns.\nThis means we need to reverse the roles.\nWe need the rook to get stuck less, and the queen to get stuck more.\n\nThis means we need to make it such that:\n- For the rook, the path of small numbers is always connected.\n- For the queen, the path of small numbers gets disconnected.\n\nThis implies if the rook is at a cell `(r, c)` with `grid[r][c] = k`, it can always find `k+1` (or another small number) in its row/col.\nIf the queen is at `(r, c)` with `grid[r][c] = k`, it might find `k+1` in its row/col/diag, but by visiting it, it might block itself later.\n\nLet's try to make the rook pay 0 vuns and the queen pay 1 vun.\nThe pattern for $N=4$ example is the only one that works.\nI should just output -1 for $N=1,2,3$ and the example for $N=4$.\nFor $N > 4$, what to do?\nThe problem's difficulty suggests there is a general strategy for $N \\ge 4$.\n\nThe example solution for $N=4$ is a specific instance of a general construction.\nThe pattern for $N=4$ in the example is:\n```\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n```\nThis is a specific \"rotated\" or \"shifted\" checkerboard pattern.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are placed in cells $(i,j)$ such that $i+j$ is odd OR $i+j$ is even but $i$ is even and $j$ is even.\nThis is too complex to derive.\n\nLet's consider the problem statement again. \"find an $N \\times N$ board\".\nThis implies there exists one.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is the only one provided.\nCould it be that the problem is a trick and for $N > 4$ we just output a pattern that gives 0 vuns for both?\nNo, because $0 < 0$ is false.\n\nThe problem is tricky. The most common approach for such \"construct a grid\" problems is to find a repeating pattern.\nThe sample solution for $N=4$ is very specific.\nIt's possible that for $N \\ge 4$, we can construct a board by alternating values like this:\nFill the first $N/2$ rows with alternating small/large numbers.\nFill the last $N/2$ rows with alternating large/small numbers.\n\nLet's try this for $N=4$:\nSmall numbers: $1, \\dots, 8$. Large numbers: $9, \\dots, 16$.\nRows 0, 1: small numbers\nRows 2, 3: large numbers\nPattern:\n1  9  2 10\n3 11  4 12\n13  5 14  6\n15  7 16  8\nThis is the pattern where small numbers are in $(i,j)$ if $i < N/2$ and $(i+j)$ is even, or $i \\ge N/2$ and $(i+j)$ is odd.\nLarge numbers are in $(i,j)$ if $i < N/2$ and $(i+j)$ is odd, or $i \\ge N/2$ and $(i+j)$ is even.\nThis is a combined pattern.\nLet's try to trace this.\nStart at 1 (0,0).\nRook:\n1. 1 (0,0).

This pattern also fails.\n\nIt seems the only way is to use the example output for N=4, and for $N=1,2,3$ print -1.\nFor $N > 4$, the problem statement doesn't give examples.\nThis implies there's a general construction that works for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe problem is hard if the general solution is not a simple pattern.\n\nGiven the context of \"Road to 1600\", it's unlikely to be a super complex construction.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has rook_vuns=1 and queen_vuns=2.\nThis is the only configuration shown that works.\n\nLet's assume the problem is simpler than finding a complex general construction.\nMaybe the solution is to print -1 for $N=1,2,3$.\nAnd for $N \\ge 4$, print a board that has 0 vuns for rook and 1 vun for queen.\nThis is what the example implies.\n\nFinal strategy:\nFor $N=1,2,3$, print -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ in the first $N/2$ rows.\nPlace numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the last $N/2$ rows.\nThis is the simple split of the board into top and bottom halves.\nThis resulted in 0 vuns for both.\n\nThis is a tricky problem. I will assume the problem means that for $N < 4$ it is impossible, and for $N \\ge 4$ the example strategy (or a generalization) works.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is the only one provided. I will use this as a reference point.\n\nIf I can't find a general strategy, I'll output the example for $N=4$ and -1 for $N < 4$.\nBut this does not cover $N > 4$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    N = int(input())\n\n    if N <= 3:\n        print(\"-1\")\n        return\n\n    # For N >= 4, we need a construction.\n    # Let's try to generalize the idea from the N=4 example\n    # where rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n    # The example output for N=4 is:\n    # 4 3 6 12\n    # 7 5 9 15\n    # 14 1 11 10\n    # 13 8 16 2\n\n    # A common strategy for such problems is to separate numbers into two halves\n    # and place them in different regions of the board.\n    # Let's try placing numbers 1 to N*N/2 in one pattern and N*N/2+1 to N*N in another.\n\n    # Consider the pattern:\n    # Place numbers from 1 to N*N/2 into cells (i,j) where i is even.\n    # Place numbers from N*N/2+1 to N*N into cells (i,j) where i is odd.\n    # This is a simple row-based alternating pattern.\n\n    board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]\n    \n    # Small numbers will be placed in even rows, large numbers in odd rows.\n    # This is reversed from a common pattern to try to make the rook pay less.\n    # Let's try to fill the board such that:\n    # Numbers 1 to N*N/2 are for cells (i,j) where (i+j) is odd.\n    # Numbers N*N/2+1 to N*N are for cells (i,j) where (i+j) is even.\n    # This was pattern B, which resulted in rook_vuns=1, queen_vuns=0 for N=4.\n    # This is 1 < 0 (false).
