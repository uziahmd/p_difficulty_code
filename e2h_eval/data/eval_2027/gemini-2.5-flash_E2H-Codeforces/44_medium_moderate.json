He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Profit in Polycarp's Practice**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem, and I need a Python solution. The core idea is to divide a list of problem difficulties (`a`) into `k` contiguous segments, maximizing the sum of the maximum difficulties within each segment.\n\nMy initial thought is that to maximize the total profit, I need to make the *largest* difficulties be the \"peaks\" of the days. This means selecting the `k` largest problems from the given list.\n\nI need to figure out how to arrange the problems. The largest `k` values sum is easy to find, but then how to structure the days. The key is to sort the *indices* of the k biggest problems so they are cut such that each of the `k` biggest values *must* be the biggest within the interval they are chosen.\n\nI started thinking I needed to make `k-1` cuts, but the cut points need to be after the `k` chosen ones. After that, determine the sizes of the segments and the logic fell into place. Each segment ends at the index of the largest value, and the prior value represents the maximum within the selected interval.\n\nThe logic should be as follows:\n1. Find the `k` largest values.\n2. Sort them by their original indices.\n3. Calculate the segment lengths by making cuts after the first `k-1` indices.\n4. The last segment covers to the end.\n\nThis strategy should give me the maximum profit and valid segment lengths.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous sequences (days). Each day must have at least one problem, and all `n` problems must be solved. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We want to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Core Idea:**\nTo maximize the sum of `k` maximums, we should pick the `k` largest problem difficulties from the entire list `a`. Let these `k` largest values be `v_1, v_2, ..., v_k`. The maximum possible total profit will be `sum(v_i)`. This is because any valid division into `k` days will yield `k` maximums, and each of these maximums must be one of the problems in the list `a`. If we can arrange the cuts such that each of our chosen `k` largest values becomes the maximum for one day, we achieve this optimal sum.\n\n**Construction Strategy:**\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest values:**\n    Create a list of pairs `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems.\n    Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty.\n    Take the first `k` pairs. These are the `k` problems whose difficulties will sum up to the maximum total profit.\n    The sum of their difficulties is our maximum total profit.\n\n2.  **Determine the cut points:**\n    Extract the original indices of these `k` chosen problems.\n    Sort these `k` indices in ascending order. Let them be `s_idx_0, s_idx_1, ..., s_idx_{k-1}`. These are the indices of the problems that will serve as the \"peak\" difficulty for each of the `k` days.\n\n3.  **Calculate daily problem counts (`t_j`):**\n    We need to make `k-1` cuts to divide `n` problems into `k` days. A simple way to ensure each of the `k` chosen problems `a[s_idx_j]` is the maximum in its segment, and that all problems are covered, is to make cuts *after* the first `k-1` of these sorted indices.\n    \n    Let `prev_cut_end_idx = -1` (conceptually, the problem before the first problem `a[0]`).\n    The lengths of the first `k-1` segments are determined by `s_idx_0, s_idx_1, ..., s_idx_{k-2}`:\n    *   Day 1: Problems from index `0` to `s_idx_0`. Length `t_1 = (s_idx_0) - prev_cut_end_idx`. `prev_cut_end_idx` becomes `s_idx_0`.\n    *   Day 2: Problems from index `s_idx_0 + 1` to `s_idx_1`. Length `t_2 = s_idx_1 - prev_cut_end_idx`. `prev_cut_end_idx` becomes `s_idx_1`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `j` (for `j < k`): Problems from `s_idx_{j-2} + 1` to `s_idx_{j-1}`. Length `t_j = s_idx_{j-1} - prev_cut_end_idx`. `prev_cut_end_idx` becomes `s_idx_{j-1}`.\n\n    The last (`k`-th) day will cover all remaining problems: from `s_idx_{k-2} + 1` to `n-1`.\n    Its length `t_k` will be `n - prev_cut_end_idx`.\n\n    Let's trace with `s_idx = [s_idx_0, s_idx_1, ..., s_idx_{k-1}]`:\n    Initialize `current_start_idx = 0`.\n    `t_lengths = []`\n    For `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        The `j`-th segment (0-indexed, so `(j+1)`-th day) ends at `s_idx_j`.\n        `length = s_idx_j - current_start_idx + 1`\n        `t_lengths.append(length)`\n        `current_start_idx = s_idx_j + 1`\n    The last segment (the `k`-th day) covers problems from `current_start_idx` to `n-1`.\n    `length = n - current_start_idx`\n    `t_lengths.append(length)`\n\n    This ensures that each `a[s_idx_j]` for `j=0, ..., k-1` falls into a distinct segment. Since these `a[s_idx_j]` are among the `k` largest overall, they will be the maximums in their respective segments. For example, in the segment `[current_start_idx, s_idx_j]`, `a[s_idx_j]` is the maximum because any `a[p]` for `p < s_idx_j` that is greater than `a[s_idx_j]` would have been chosen as one of the `k` largest values, and `s_idx_j` would not be the `j`-th smallest index among the chosen `k` problems.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3`, `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Pairs (difficulty, index):**\n    `(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)`\n    Sorted by difficulty (descending):\n    `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)`\n    Top `k=3` pairs: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`\n    Max total profit: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n2.  **Indices of chosen problems:** `6, 3, 0`.\n    Sorted indices `s_idx`: `[0, 3, 6]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate `t_j` lengths:**\n    `current_start_idx = 0`\n    `t_lengths = []`\n\n    `j = 0` (`s_idx_0 = 0`):\n        `length = s_idx_0 - current_start_idx + 1 = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.\n        `t_lengths = [1]`.\n        `current_start_idx = s_idx_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n\n    `j = 1` (`s_idx_1 = 3`):\n        `length = s_idx_1 - current_start_idx + 1 = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.\n        `t_lengths = [1, 3]`.\n        `current_start_idx = s_idx_1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n    Loop ends (since `j` goes up to `k-2 = 1`).\n\n    Last day (`k=3`):\n        `length = n - current_start_idx = 8 - 4 = 4`.\n        `t_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\n    Output lengths: `1 3 4`.\n    This corresponds to segments: `[5]`, `[4, 2, 6]`, `[5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n    Maximums: `5, 6, 9`.
