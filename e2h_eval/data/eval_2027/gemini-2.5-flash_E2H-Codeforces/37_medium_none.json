    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Proposed Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core is finding a permutation `b` of an array `a` such that the sums of all proper, non-empty subsets of elements in `a` and `b` are different. The array `a` contains distinct integers, and `n` can be up to 22. My initial instinct is that a brute-force approach, checking all permutations, won't cut it.  I'm thinking I need to find some clever structure or pattern to construct `b`.\n\nFor small cases like `n=2`, a simple swap seems to work. This makes me wonder if there's a simple, general transformation I can apply. The crucial point is that the *indices* of the array matter; it's the sums of elements at specific *positions* that need to be different. Sorting the input seems promising, but I need to make sure I don't lose track of the original index positions.\n\nMy key insight now is that I need to find a permutation, `b`, which is a reordering of `a`. I initially thought a simple cyclic shift `b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]` would do it, but that doesn't hold up under closer examination with `n=3`. The requirement that the problem uses distinct integers is a huge hint.\n\nI'm starting to think about sorting the values of `a` and applying a transformation to the *values* rather than the *indices*. I sort the elements by value, keep track of their original indices, and then attempt a cyclic shift on the *sorted* values and assign them to the original indices in a new `b`. I believe a permutation using this strategy: `b[original_index_k] = val_{(k+1)%n}`, will work. I'm hoping this will lead to a solution. I'm confident that this approach will yield a valid answer and that it can be implemented within the time constraints, given that I'm working with distinct integers.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` of `n` distinct integers such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S` (i.e., `0 < |S| < n`), the sum of elements in `a` at these positions is different from the sum of elements in `b` at these positions. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and properties:\n1. `n` is small (`1 <= n <= 22`).\n2. `a` contains `n` distinct integers.\n3. `b` must be a permutation of `a`. This means `b` contains the same elements as `a`, just possibly in a different order.\n\n**Special Case: n = 1**\nIf `n = 1`, the condition `0 < k < n` (where `k = |S|`) cannot be satisfied. There are no non-empty proper subsets of indices. Thus, any permutation `b` works. Since `b` must be a permutation of `a`, `b` must be `a` itself. So, for `n=1`, print `a[0]`.\n\n**General Strategy**\n\nThe key idea for problems involving sums of subsets and distinct elements is often to leverage the ordering of elements.\nLet's define a permutation strategy based on sorting the values of `a`.\n\n1.  **Store (value, original_index) pairs:** Create a list of tuples `(a[i], i)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This preserves the original indices.\n2.  **Sort these pairs:** Sort the list of tuples based on their values. Let the sorted list be `P_sorted = [(val_0, idx_0), (val_1, idx_1), ..., (val_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})]`.\n    Here, `val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}` are the sorted values from `a`, and `idx_k` is the original index in `a` where `val_k` was located.\n3.  **Construct `b` using a cyclic shift of sorted values:** Create an empty array `b_final` of size `n`. For each `k` from `0` to `n-1`, set `b_final[idx_k] = val_{(k+1)%n}`.\n    This means the element `a[idx_k]` (which is `val_k`) is replaced by `val_{(k+1)%n}`.\n    Effectively, the smallest value (`val_0`) is replaced by the second smallest (`val_1`), the second smallest (`val_1`) by the third smallest (`val_2`), ..., and the largest value (`val_{n-1}`) is replaced by the smallest value (`val_0`).\n\n**Proof of Correctness (for `n > 1`)**\n\nLet `b_final` be the array constructed using the strategy above.\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a non-empty proper subset of indices `S` such that `sum_{j in S} a[j] = sum_{j in S} b_final[j]`.\n\nLet `S_val = {k | idx_k in S}`. This `S_val` is the set of indices in the sorted value sequence that correspond to the elements at positions `S` in the original array `a`.\nThe condition `sum_{j in S} a[j] = sum_{j in S} b_final[j]` can be rewritten using `val_k` and `idx_k`:\n`sum_{k in S_val} val_k = sum_{k in S_val} val_{(k+1)%n}`.\n\nLet `d_k = val_{(k+1)%n} - val_k`. The equality becomes `sum_{k in S_val} d_k = 0`.\n\nWe know that `val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}`.\nConsider the values `d_k`:\n*   For `k` in `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`: `(k+1)%n = k+1`. So `d_k = val_{k+1} - val_k`. Since `val_{k+1} > val_k`, `d_k > 0`.\n*   For `k = n-1`: `(k+1)%n = 0`. So `d_{n-1} = val_0 - val_{n-1}`. Since `val_0 < val_{n-1}`, `d_{n-1} < 0`.\n\nNow, analyze `sum_{k in S_val} d_k = 0`:\n\n1.  **If `n-1` is NOT in `S_val`:**\n    In this case, all `k` in `S_val` are in `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`. Therefore, all `d_k` for `k in S_val` are strictly positive.\n    The sum `sum_{k in S_val} d_k` would be a sum of positive numbers. Since `S` is non-empty, `S_val` is non-empty, so this sum must be strictly positive.\n    Thus, `sum_{k in S_val} d_k != 0`. This is a contradiction.\n\n2.  **If `n-1` IS in `S_val`:**\n    The sum is `d_{n-1} + sum_{k in S_val, k < n-1} d_k`.\n    `d_{n-1} = val_0 - val_{n-1}` (a negative value).\n    `sum_{k in S_val, k < n-1} d_k` is a sum of positive values (or zero if `S_val = {n-1}`).\n    If `S_val = {n-1}`, then `|S|=1`. The condition `sum_{j in S} a[j] = sum_{j in S} b_final[j]` becomes `a[idx_{n-1}] = b_final[idx_{n-1}]`, which is `val_{n-1} = val_0`. This contradicts the distinctness of elements `a` (or `val_k`). So `|S| > 1`.\n    Thus, `S_val` must contain at least one `k < n-1`. So `sum_{k in S_val, k < n-1} d_k` is strictly positive.\n\n    Let `P = {k in S_val | k < n-1}` and `N = {k in S_val | k = n-1}`.\n    The sum is `sum_{k in P} (val_{k+1} - val_k) + (val_0 - val_{n-1})`.\n    For this sum to be zero, `sum_{k in P} (val_{k+1} - val_k) = val_{n-1} - val_0`.\n\n    Consider the set of values `V_S = {val_k | k in S_val}` and `V'_S = {val_{(k+1)%n} | k in S_val}`.\n    If `sum(V_S) = sum(V'_S)`, and `V_S` and `V'_S` are multisets of values from `a`, then `V_S` must be equal to `V'_S` as multisets (since all elements are distinct, they are sets).\n    If `V_S = V'_S`, it means the mapping `k -> (k+1)%n` permutes `S_val` itself.\n    The mapping `k -> (k+1)%n` on the set `{0, ..., n-1}` forms a single cycle `0 -> 1 -> ... -> n-1 -> 0`.\n    For `k -> (k+1)%n` to permute a subset `S_val`, `S_val` must be a union of such cycles. Since there's only one cycle, `S_val` must be the entire set `{0, ..., n-1}`.\n    However, the problem states `0 < |S| < n`, which implies `0 < |S_val| < n`.\n    Therefore, `S_val` cannot be the entire set `{0, ..., n-1}`.\n    This means `V_S != V'_S`.\n    Since `V_S` and `V'_S` are sets of distinct numbers, if they are not equal, their sums must be different.\n    Therefore, `sum_{k in S_val} val_k != sum_{k in S_val} val_{(k+1)%n}`.\n    This is a contradiction.\n\nBoth cases lead to a contradiction, so the initial assumption must be false. Thus, the constructed `b_final` satisfies the condition.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`**\n1.  Pairs: `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n2.  Sorted pairs: `P_sorted = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n    *   `val_0 = 1, idx_0 = 3`\n    *   `val_1 = 10, idx_1 = 2`\n    *   `val_2 = 100, idx_2 = 1`\n    *   `val_3 = 1000, idx_3 = 0`\n3.  Construct `b_final`:\n    *   `b_final[idx_0] = val_1` => `b_final[3] = 10`\n    *   `b_final[idx_1] = val_2` => `b_final[2] = 100`\n    *   `b_final[idx_2] = val_3` => `b_final[1] = 1000`\n    *   `b_final[idx_3] = val_0` => `b_final[0] = 1`\n    Result: `b_final = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\n\nThis output is different from the example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`, but the problem statement allows any valid answer.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Read `n`.\n*   Read `a` as a list of integers.\n*   Handle `n=1` case separately: print `a[0]`.\n*   For `n > 1`:\n    *   Create `pairs = []`.\n    *   Populate `pairs` with `(a[i], i)`.\n    *   Sort `pairs`.\n    *   Create `b_final = [0] * n`.\n    *   Iterate `k` from `0` to `n-1`:\n        *   `val_k = pairs[k][0]`\n        *   `idx_k = pairs[k][1]`\n        *   `val_next = pairs[(k+1)%n][0]`\n        *   `b_final[idx_k] = val_next`\n    *   Print elements of `b_final` space-separated.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Create (value, original_index) pairs\n    # For a = [a0, a1, ..., an-1], pairs = [(a0, 0), (a1, 1), ..., (an-1, n-1)]\n    pairs = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        pairs.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort these pairs based on their values\n    # P_sorted = [(val_0, idx_0), (val_1, idx_1), ..., (val_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})]\n    # where val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}\n    pairs.sort()\n\n    # Step 3: Construct b_final using a cyclic shift of sorted values\n    # b_final[idx_k] = val_{(k+1)%n}\n    b_final = [0] * n\n    for k in range(n):\n        # val_k is pairs[k][0]\n        idx_k = pairs[k][1] # Original index of the k-th smallest value\n\n        # val_{(k+1)%n} is pairs[(k+1)%n][0]\n        val_next = pairs[(k + 1) % n][0] # The value that replaces val_k\n\n        b_final[idx_k] = val_next\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b_final))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
