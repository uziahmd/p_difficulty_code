String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings.

    "thought": "**A Deep Dive into Vasily the Bear's Beautiful Strings**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, \"Vasily the Bear and Beautiful Strings.\" My goal: write a Python script to count these \"beautiful strings\" that, through a series of operations, reduce to a single character. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, a beautiful string is defined by a certain number of zeros (`n`) and ones (`m`). The modification operation is key. We take the last two characters and replace them based on these rules: `00` becomes `1`, and anything else becomes `0`. The final state we're after is a single character, `g`. The catch? These numbers can get pretty large, so we need to work modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis modification rule screams \"binary operation\" to me. Let's look closely at what's going on. We start with a string of length `L`, and with each operation, we reduce it by one character. So after `L-1` operations, we'll arrive at our final single character. We can represent these characters as numbers: `0` as `0` and `1` as `1`. The operation is as follows: `00` -> `1`, `01` -> `0`, `10` -> `0`, `11` -> `0`. We can view this as a function of `op(a, b)`: `1 - (a | b)`.\n\nSo, the whole point is that we apply this binary reduction until a string `s` becomes the single character `R(s)`. This reduction is done right-associatively. If the string starts with `1`, the final result is always `0`. If the string starts with `0`, the result flips (or not) depending on whether the number of leading zeros is even or odd.\n\nLet's summarize these rules for `R(s)`:\n\n1.  If the string contains no ones (`m=0`):\n    *   `s = 0^n`.\n    *   `R(s) = 0` if `n` is odd.\n    *   `R(s) = 1` if `n` is even (and at least 2).\n\n2.  If the string contains at least one one (`m>0`):\n    Let `k` be the number of leading zeros. `s = 0^k 1 ...`.\n    *   If `k` is even, `R(s) = 0`.\n    *   If `k` is odd, `R(s) = 1`.\n\nNow, we need to count those strings where `R(s) = g`.\n\n---\n\n**Now, let's consider the specific case where g=0:**\n\n*   **When m = 0:**\n    *   If `n` is odd, then the only such string is `0^n`.\n    *   If `n` is even, there's no such string.\n\n*   **When m > 0:**\n    *   `val(s) = 0` implies that `k`, the count of leading zeros, must be even.\n\n    The string has `n` zeros and `m` ones. Consider the first character `c_1`. If `c_1 = 1`, then `k = 0`, an even number of leading zeros. If `c_1 = 0`, we have `n-1` remaining 0s and `m` remaining 1s, with at least the second character being a one. The solution involves summing combinatorial terms.\n\n    So, we now have a combinatorial formula to compute the number of such strings. This involves sums of binomial coefficients and figuring out the number of arrangements. This is `Sum_{k=0, k even, k <= n} C(n-k + m-1, n-k)`.\n\nSo, it's about setting up the right combinatorial problem to efficiently compute these values! That, in a nutshell, is my thought process on tackling this problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of \"beautiful strings\" consisting of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, such that after a sequence of modifications, the string reduces to a single character `g`. We need to output the count modulo 1000000007.\n\nLet's analyze the modification operation: we replace the two last characters `c1 c2` with `c'`.\n- If `c1 = 0` and `c2 = 0`, then `c' = 1`.\n- Otherwise (`c1 c2` is `01`, `10`, or `11`), then `c' = 0`.\n\nWe can represent this operation as `op(a, b)`. If we treat `0` and `1` as boolean values (0 for false, 1 for true), then `op(a, b) = 1 - (a OR b)`.\n- `op(0,0) = 1 - (0 | 0) = 1 - 0 = 1`\n- `op(0,1) = 1 - (0 | 1) = 1 - 1 = 0`\n- `op(1,0) = 1 - (1 | 0) = 1 - 1 = 0`\n- `op(1,1) = 1 - (1 | 1) = 1 - 1 = 0`\nThis matches the problem description.\n\nThe modification process repeatedly applies this operation to the two rightmost characters. This means the final character `R(s)` for a string `s = c_1 c_2 ... c_L` is computed as:\n`R(s) = op(c_1, op(c_2, ... op(c_{L-1}, c_L)...))`.\nThis is a right-associative reduction. Let's define `val(sub_s)` as the result of reducing `sub_s`.\n- `val(c_L) = c_L`\n- `val(c_k ... c_L) = op(c_k, val(c_{k+1} ... c_L))`\n\nLet's analyze `val(s)` based on its first character:\n1.  If `s` starts with `1` (i.e., `c_1 = 1`):\n    `val(s) = op(1, val(c_2 ... c_L))`. Since `val(c_2 ... c_L)` can only be `0` or `1`, `op(1, X)` will always be `0` (from our `op` table).\n    Thus, if `s` starts with `1`, `val(s) = 0`.\n\n2.  If `s` starts with `0` (i.e., `c_1 = 0`):\n    `val(s) = op(0, val(c_2 ... c_L))`. Let `s' = c_2 ... c_L`.\n    `val(s) = op(0, val(s'))`. From our `op` table, `op(0,0) = 1` and `op(0,1) = 0`.\n    This means `val(s) = 1 - val(s')`. (The result is flipped if `s` starts with `0`).\n\nLet `k` be the number of leading zeros in `s`.\n- If `s = 0^k s_rest` where `s_rest` starts with `1`:\n    `val(s) = val(0^k 1 ...)`\n    Applying the rule `val(0 s') = 1 - val(s')` `k` times:\n    - If `k` is even: `val(s) = val(1 ...)`\n    - If `k` is odd: `val(s) = 1 - val(1 ...)`\n    Since `val(1 ...)` is `0` (from rule 1), we have:\n    - If `k` is even: `val(s) = 0`.\n    - If `k` is odd: `val(s) = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n\n- If `s` consists only of zeros (`m = 0`, so `s = 0^n`):\n    - `val(\"0\") = 0`\n    - `val(\"00\") = op(0, val(\"0\")) = op(0,0) = 1`\n    - `val(\"000\") = op(0, val(\"00\")) = op(0,1) = 0`\n    - `val(\"0000\") = op(0, val(\"000\")) = op(0,0) = 1`\n    The pattern is: `val(0^n) = 0` if `n` is odd, `val(0^n) = 1` if `n` is even and `n \\ge 2`. (Since `n+m \\ge 1`, if `m=0`, then `n \\ge 1`).\n\nSummary of `val(s)`:\n1.  **If `m = 0` (string is `0^n`)**:\n    - `val(s) = 0` if `n` is odd.\n    - `val(s) = 1` if `n` is even (and `n \\ge 2`).\n2.  **If `m > 0` (string contains at least one `1`)**:\n    Let `k` be the number of leading zeros in `s`.\n    - `val(s) = 0` if `k` is even.\n    - `val(s) = 1` if `k` is odd.\n\nNow we count strings for a given `g`. The total length of the string is `L = n+m`.\n\n**Case A: `g = 0`**\n*   **If `m = 0`**: We need `val(0^n) = 0`. This happens if `n` is odd.\n    - If `n` is odd: 1 string (`0^n`).\n    - If `n` is even: 0 strings.\n*   **If `m > 0`**: We need `val(s) = 0`. This happens if the number of leading zeros `k` is even.\n    - The string must start with `0^k 1` where `k` is even.\n    - The remaining `n-k` zeros and `m-1` ones can be arranged in `C(n-k + m-1, n-k)` ways.\n    - We need to sum `C(n-k + m-1, n-k)` for all even `k` such that `0 \\le k \\le n`.\n    - Let `N_0 = n`, `M_0 = m-1`. The sum is `Sum_{k=0, k even, k \\le N_0} C(N_0-k + M_0, M_0)`.\n    - This sum is equivalent to `C(n+m-1, m-1) + C(n+m-3, m-1) + ...`.\n    - Using the identity `Sum_{i=0 \\text{ to } K} C(R+i, R) = C(R+K+1, R+1)`, and properties of binomial coefficients, we can find a closed form.\n    - A simpler approach: The total number of strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones is `C(n+m, n)`.\n    - For `m > 0`, each string `s` has a unique number of leading zeros `k` (from `0` to `n`).\n    - `val(s)=0` if `k` is even, `val(s)=1` if `k` is odd.\n    - The number of strings with `k` leading zeros is `C(n-k+m-1, m-1)`.\n    - Let `S_even = Sum_{k=0, k even, k \\le n} C(n-k+m-1, m-1)`.\n    - Let `S_odd = Sum_{k=1, k odd, k \\le n} C(n-k+m-1, m-1)`.\n    - We know `S_even + S_odd = C(n+m, n)`.\n    - It can be shown that `S_even` and `S_odd` are related. In fact, if `n >= 1` and `m >= 1`, `S_even = S_odd` if `n+m` is even, and `S_even = S_odd + C(n+m-1, n)` if `n+m` is odd. (This is related to the number of paths to (n,m) starting with a 0 or 1, and using `C(N,K) = C(N-1,K) + C(N-1,K-1)`).\n    - A known identity: `Sum_{i=0 to N} C(R+i, R) = C(R+N+1, R+1)`.\n    - `Sum_{k=0, k \\text{ even}, k \\le n} C(n-k+m-1, m-1)` is the number of ways to pick `m-1` ones from `n-k+m-1` items.\n    - This sum can be simplified. The number of strings with `val(s)=0` (i.e., `k` even) is `C(n+m-1, n)` if `n+m` is even. It's `C(n+m-1, n) - 1` if `n+m` is odd.\n    - No, the correct identity is `Sum_{i=0 \\text{ to } N, i \\text{ even}} C(R+i, R) = C(R+N+1, R+1)` if `N` is even.\n    - The sum `Sum_{k=0, k even, k \\le n} C(n-k+m-1, m-1)` is `C(n+m-1, n)`. This is the number of strings that start with `1` OR start with `001` OR `00001` etc. This is simply the number of strings that don't start with `0` followed by an odd number of `0`s. This is `C(n+m-1, n)`.\n\n**Case B: `g = 1`**\n*   **If `m = 0`**: We need `val(0^n) = 1`. This happens if `n` is even and `n \\ge 2`.\n    - If `n` is even and `n \\ge 2`: 1 string (`0^n`).\n    - Otherwise: 0 strings.\n*   **If `m > 0`**: We need `val(s) = 1`. This happens if the number of leading zeros `k` is odd.\n    - We need to sum `C(n-k + m-1, n-k)` for all odd `k` such that `1 \\le k \\le n`.\n    - This sum is `C(n+m, n) - C(n+m-1, n)`.\n\nLet's refine the counts:\n**Total strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones is `C(n+m, n)`**.\n\n**If `m=0`:**\n- `n` must be odd for `g=0`. Answer is 1.\n- `n` must be even and `n \\ge 2` for `g=1`. Answer is 1.\n- Otherwise, answer is 0.\n\n**If `m > 0`:**\n- For `g=0` (`k` even):\n    - Count strings starting with `1` (`k=0`): `C(n+m-1, n)`.\n    - Count strings starting with `001` (`k=2`): `C(n-2+m-1, n-2)`.\n    - ...\n    - The sum `Sum_{k=0, k even, k \\le n} C(n-k+m-1, m-1)` is exactly `C(n+m-1, n)`.\n    - This is because `C(N, K) = C(N-1, K) + C(N-1, K-1)`.\n    - `C(n+m-1, m-1)` counts all strings that start with `1` (by placing the first `1` at index 0, then arranging `n` zeros and `m-1` ones in `n+m-1` positions).\n    - What about strings starting with `0`?\n    - `C(n+m, n)` is the total.\n    - Number of strings starting with `1` is `C(n+m-1, n)`. These have `k=0` (even). So `val(s)=0`.\n    - Number of strings starting with `0` is `C(n+m-1, n-1)`.\n    - Among strings starting with `0`, we need `val(s)=0`. This means `val(0s')=0`, which implies `1-val(s')=0`, so `val(s')=1`.\n    - `s'` has `n-1` zeros and `m` ones.\n    - For `s'` to have `val(s')=1`, it must have an odd number of leading zeros (if `m>0`).\n    - This is getting complicated. Let's use a known identity:\n    `Sum_{i=0 \\text{ to } N} C(A-i, B) = C(A+1, B+1) - C(A-N, B+1)`. This is not it.\n    The identity is: `Sum_{i=0 \\text{ to } K} C(N-i, K-i) = C(N+1, K)`.\n    Our sum: `Sum_{k=0, k even, k \\le n} C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\n    This sum is `C(n+m-1, n)`.\n    This can be seen by `C(n+m-1, n)` = `C(n+m-2, n) + C(n+m-2, n-1)`.\n    `C(n+m-2, n-1)` = `C(n+m-3, n-1) + C(n+m-3, n-2)`.\n    This is not leading to a simple sum over even `k`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the counts for `m > 0`:\nTotal ways to arrange `n` zeros and `m` ones is `C(n+m, n)`.\n`N_0 = n`, `N_1 = m`.\nThe number of strings `s` with `k` leading zeros (i.e., `s = 0^k 1 ...`) is `C(N_0-k + N_1-1, N_0-k)`.\nLet `A_k = C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\nIf `g=0`, we need `Sum_{k \\text{ even}} A_k`.\nIf `g=1`, we need `Sum_{k \\text{ odd}} A_k`.\n\nThere is a simple combinatorial argument for this:\nConsider the total number of paths from `(0,0)` to `(n,m)` on a grid, taking `n` steps right (0) and `m` steps up (1). This is `C(n+m, n)`.\nEach path corresponds to a unique string.\nA path corresponds to `val(s)=0` if `k` (number of leading 0s) is even.\nA path corresponds to `val(s)=1` if `k` (number of leading 0s) is odd.\nThe number of paths from `(0,0)` to `(n,m)` that start with `0^k 1` is `C(n-k+m-1, n-k)`.\nThe number of paths from `(0,0)` to `(n,m)` that start with `0` is `C(n+m-1, n-1)`.\nThe number of paths from `(0,0)` to `(n,m)` that start with `1` is `C(n+m-1, n)`.\n\nThe total number of strings is `C(n+m, n)`.\nIf `m > 0`:\n- Number of strings where `val(s)=0` is `C(n+m-1, n)`. (These are strings starting with `1`, or `001`, or `00001`, etc.)\n- Number of strings where `val(s)=1` is `C(n+m-1, n-1)`. (These are strings starting with `01`, or `0001`, etc.)\nThis is a standard result for these types of sums.\n`Sum_{k \\text{ even}, k \\le n} C(n-k+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m-1, n)` (if `m \\ge 1`).\n`Sum_{k \\text{ odd}, k \\le n} C(n-k+m-1, m-1) = C(n+m-1, m) = C(n+m-1, n-1)` (if `m \\ge 1`).\nThese sums are valid for `m \\ge 1`.\n\nFinal logic:\n`MOD = 1000000007`\n\n`C(N, K)` function needed. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials.\n\nIf `m = 0`:\n  If `g = 0`:\n    If `n` is odd: `ans = 1`.\n    Else (`n` is even): `ans = 0`.\n  If `g = 1`:\n    If `n` is even and `n >= 2`: `ans = 1`.\n    Else (`n` is odd or `n=0`): `ans = 0`.\n  (Note: `n+m >= 1` means `n >= 1` when `m=0`).\n\nIf `m > 0`:\n  If `g = 0`:\n    `ans = C(n+m-1, n)`.\n  If `g = 1`:\n    `ans = C(n+m-1, n-1)`.\n    (Special case: if `n=0`, `C(n+m-1, n-1)` would be `C(m-1, -1)`, which is 0. This is correct as `n-1` is negative. `C(N,K)` is 0 if `K<0` or `K>N`).\n\nLet's check edge cases:\n- `n=0, m=1, g=0`: String is \"1\". `val(\"1\")=0`. So ans=1.\n  My logic: `m>0, g=0`. `C(0+1-1, 0) = C(0,0) = 1`. Correct.\n- `n=0, m=1, g=1`: String is \"1\". `val(\"1\")=0`. So ans=0.\n  My logic: `m>0, g=1`. `C(0+1-1, 0-1) = C(0,-1) = 0`. Correct.\n- `n=1, m=0, g=0`: String is \"0\". `val(\"0\")=0`. So ans=1.\n  My logic: `m=0, g=0`. `n=1` is odd. `ans=1`. Correct.\n- `n=1, m=0, g=1`: String is \"0\". `val(\"0\")=0`.
