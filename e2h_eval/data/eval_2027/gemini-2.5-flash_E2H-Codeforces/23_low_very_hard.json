            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Mahjong Puzzle: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem. The core of it is figuring out the *minimum* number of extra tiles I need to form at least one \"mentsu\" (that's either a koutsu – three of a kind – or a shuntsu – a sequence). I've got three starting tiles, and I can draw more.  My gut feeling is the solution will be 0, 1, or 2 extra draws, given the problem's constraints.\n\nMy strategy?  Iterate through the possible number of draws, starting from zero. So first, I'll see if I can make a mentsu with just the initial three tiles. If not, I'll try with one extra tile, then two.  That sounds computationally efficient for this problem size.\n\nFirst step: Tile representation.  I'm going to represent each tile as a tuple: `(number, suit)`.  So, '1s' becomes `(1, 's')`. This should make it easy to process.\n\nNext, I need a reliable way to check for a mentsu. I'm thinking a function called `has_mentsu(tiles_list)` will do the trick.  It will take a list of tiles as input.\n\nNow, within `has_mentsu()`, I'll check for both koutsu and shuntsu. For koutsu, I'll need to count the occurrences of each tile and see if any appear three or more times.  A Python `Counter` looks ideal for this.  For shuntsu, I need to group tiles by their suit, sort the numbers, and check for sequential numbers within each suit (allowing any order of the numbers, of course).  The numbers need to be sequential, not necessarily in the order they are input. So, if I have `[5s, 7s, 6s]`, it's a shuntsu.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu is either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nWe need to determine if 0, 1, or 2 draws are needed. Since the maximum number of tiles we'd consider is 5 (3 initial + 2 drawn), we can iterate through possible draws.\n\nFirst, let's represent the tiles. Each tile has a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s). We can parse the input strings into a list of `(number, suit)` tuples. For example, '1s' becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\nThe core logic is to check if a given hand of tiles contains a mentsu.\n\n**`has_mentsu(hand)` function:**\nThis function takes a list of `(number, suit)` tuples and returns `True` if it contains a mentsu, `False` otherwise.\n1.  **Check for Koutsu:**\n    *   Count the occurrences of each unique tile in the `hand`.\n    *   If any tile appears 3 or more times, a koutsu is formed. Return `True`.\n2.  **Check for Shuntsu:**\n    *   Group tiles by suit. For each suit, collect the numbers present.\n    *   For each suit, sort the collected numbers and remove duplicates (as `[1m, 1m, 2m, 3m]` still forms `[1m, 2m, 3m]`).\n    *   Iterate through the sorted unique numbers. If `n`, `n+1`, and `n+2` are all present for a given suit, a shuntsu is formed. Return `True`.\n3.  If neither a koutsu nor a shuntsu is found, return `False`.\n\n**Main Logic:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:** Read the three tile strings and convert them into a list of `(number, suit)` tuples. Let's call this `initial_hand`.\n\n2.  **Check 0 Draws:**\n    *   Call `has_mentsu(initial_hand)`.\n    *   If `True`, print `0` and exit.\n\n3.  **Check 1 Draw:**\n    *   We need to consider drawing every possible tile (1m-9m, 1p-9p, 1s-9s). There are 27 unique tile types.\n    *   For each possible tile `t_draw` from the full set of 27 tiles:\n        *   Create a new hand: `new_hand = initial_hand + [t_draw]`.\n        *   Call `has_mentsu(new_hand)`.\n        *   If `True` for any `t_draw`, it means we can form a mentsu with 1 draw. Print `1` and exit.\n\n4.  **Check 2 Draws:**\n    *   If we reach this point, 0 or 1 draw is not enough. This implies we need 2 draws. Print `2`.\n    *   It's guaranteed that 2 draws are always sufficient to form a mentsu. For example, by drawing two tiles identical to one of the initial tiles, we can form a koutsu (e.g., if initial hand is `[1m, 2p, 3s]`, draw `1m, 1m` to get `[1m, 1m, 1m, 2p, 3s]`). Or, if we have `[1m, 2m, X]`, we can draw `3m` and another tile to form a shuntsu. If we have `[1m, X, Y]`, we can draw `2m, 3m` to form a shuntsu.\n\n**Detailed `has_mentsu` implementation notes:**\n\n*   To check for koutsu, `collections.Counter` is very useful.\n*   To check for shuntsu, we can iterate through suits ('m', 'p', 's'). For each suit, filter tiles belonging to it, extract their numbers, convert to a `set` to remove duplicates, then convert back to a sorted list. Then check for `n, n+1, n+2` patterns.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nInput: `3p 9m 2p`\n1.  `initial_hand = [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`\n\n2.  **0 Draws?**\n    *   Koutsu check: `Counter({(3, 'p'): 1, (9, 'm'): 1, (2, 'p'): 1})`. No tile appears 3 times.\n    *   Shuntsu check:\n        *   Suit 'm': `[9]`. No shuntsu.\n        *   Suit 'p': `[2, 3]`. No `n, n+1, n+2` sequence.\n        *   Suit 's': `[]`. No shuntsu.\n    *   `has_mentsu` returns `False`.\n\n3.  **1 Draw?**\n    *   Try drawing `(1, 'p')`: `new_hand = [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (1, 'p')]`\n        *   Koutsu check: No.\n        *   Shuntsu check:\n            *   Suit 'p': Numbers are `[1, 2, 3]`. This forms a shuntsu `(1p, 2p, 3p)`.\n        *   `has_mentsu` returns `True`.\n    *   Since we found a way to win with 1 draw, print `1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    \"\"\"Parses a tile string like '1s' into a (number, suit) tuple.\"\"\"\n    number = int(s[0])\n    suit = s[1]\n    return (number, suit)\n\ndef has_mentsu(hand):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the given hand of tiles contains at least one mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu).\n    A hand is a list of (number, suit) tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
