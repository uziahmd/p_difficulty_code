He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about Polycarp's Practice problem.** My goal is to maximize the total profit by strategically dividing the problems into segments.\n\nFirst, I recognize that the profit of a segment is solely determined by its maximum value. This means I want to ensure that the `k` largest values in the entire problem set are, in fact, the maximums of their respective days. The sum of these values then becomes the maximum achievable total profit.\n\nTo achieve this, I need to identify these `k` largest values along with their original indices within the array. Then, I need to divide the problems into `k` contiguous segments in a way that includes these k large values as the maximums of those segments.\n\nMy strategy involves:\n\n1.  Creating `(value, index)` pairs for all problems and sorting them in descending order.\n2.  Selecting the top `k` pairs to get the largest values and their original indices.\n3.  Calculating the `max_profit` as the sum of these `k` largest values.\n4.  Sorting the chosen indices to establish a cut-off point for segment boundaries.\n5.  Based on these sorted indices, determine the lengths of each segment.\n\nI need to make sure the last segment includes all remaining problems. The segment lengths need to be calculated to ensure that each chosen index is included as the maximum of its corresponding day.\n\nThe code reflects this logic, ensuring correct segment lengths and indices, along with proper handling of edge cases and constraints, such as `k=1`, and `k=n` cases.\n\nI'm confident that this approach will deliver the optimal solution to the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments (days). For each day, the \"profit\" is the maximum difficulty among problems solved that day. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of profits over all `k` days, and to output this maximum profit along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Core Idea:**\nTo maximize the sum of `k` maximums, we should choose the `k` largest problem difficulties from the entire list `a`. Let these `k` largest difficulties be `M_1, M_2, ..., M_k`. The maximum possible total profit will be `sum(M_i)`. This is because any set of `k` maximums chosen from `k` segments must be problems from the original list `a`. The sum of these `k` maximums cannot exceed the sum of the `k` overall largest problems in `a`.\n\nWe can achieve this sum by ensuring that each of these `k` largest problems `M_i` becomes the maximum of one of the `k` daily segments.\nLet's find the original indices of these `k` largest problems. Suppose these indices, when sorted in ascending order, are `idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{k-1}`.\nWe can define the `k` segments as follows:\n*   Day 1 solves problems from index `0` to `idx_0`.\n*   Day 2 solves problems from index `idx_0 + 1` to `idx_1`.\n*   ...\n*   Day `j` solves problems from index `idx_{j-2} + 1` to `idx_{j-1}` (for `j` from 2 to `k-1`).\n*   Day `k` solves problems from index `idx_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1` (the end of the list).\n\nWith this segmentation, each problem `a[idx_j]` (for `j` from `0` to `k-1`) falls into a distinct segment. Since `a[idx_j]` is one of the `k` largest problems overall, and all other problems `a[p]` within its segment are either smaller than `a[idx_j]` or are not among the `k` largest problems (and thus less than or equal to `a[idx_j]`), `a[idx_j]` is guaranteed to be the maximum difficulty for its day. Therefore, the total profit will indeed be `sum(M_i)`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Get `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.\n2.  **Pair Difficulties with Indices:** Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems. This is important to keep track of the original positions after sorting.\n3.  **Sort by Difficulty:** Sort this list of pairs in descending order based on difficulty.\n4.  **Select Top `k`:** Take the first `k` pairs from the sorted list. These represent the `k` problems with the highest difficulties.\n5.  **Calculate Total Profit:** Sum the difficulties of these `k` selected problems. This is the maximum total profit.\n6.  **Extract and Sort Indices:** Get the original indices of these `k` selected problems and sort them in ascending order. Let these sorted indices be `s_0, s_1, ..., s_{k-1}`.\n7.  **Calculate Segment Lengths:**\n    *   Initialize an empty list `t_lengths` to store the number of problems per day.\n    *   Initialize `prev_cut_idx = -1`. This represents the index *before* the start of the first segment.\n    *   For `i` from `0` to `k-2` (i.e., for the first `k-1` days):\n        *   The current day ends at `s_i`.\n        *   The number of problems for this day is `s_i - prev_cut_idx`.\n        *   Add this length to `t_lengths`.\n        *   Update `prev_cut_idx = s_i`.\n    *   For the last day (day `k`):\n        *   The number of problems is `n - (prev_cut_idx + 1)`. This accounts for all remaining problems until the end of the list (`n-1`).\n        *   Add this length to `t_lengths`.\n8.  **Print Output:** Print the maximum total profit, followed by the `t_lengths` values separated by spaces.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem statement):**\n`n = 8, k = 3`, `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  `indexed_problems = [(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  Sort by difficulty (descending): `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3.  Top `k=3` problems: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`\n4.  `max_profit = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20`\n5.  Original indices of these problems: `[6, 3, 0]`. Sorted: `chosen_indices = [0, 3, 6]`\n6.  Calculate `t_lengths`:\n    *   `prev_cut_idx = -1`\n    *   `i = 0` (`k-1` is `2`):\n        *   `s_0 = 0`. Length = `0 - (-1) = 1`. `t_lengths = [1]`. `prev_cut_idx = 0`.\n    *   `i = 1`:\n        *   `s_1 = 3`. Length = `3 - 0 = 3`. `t_lengths = [1, 3]`. `prev_cut_idx = 3`.\n    *   Loop ends.\n    *   Last day: Length = `n - (prev_cut_idx + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 8 - 4 = 4`. `t_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\n7.  Output:\n    `20`\n    `1 3 4`\n\nThis matches the maximum profit from the example, although the segment lengths are different (`3 2 3` in example). This is fine as any valid distribution is acceptable.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Time: O(N log N) dominated by sorting the `N` problems.\n*   Space: O(N) for storing `(difficulty, index)` pairs.\nGiven `N <= 2000`, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Create a list of (value, original_index) pairs\n    indexed_problems = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_problems.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the problems by difficulty in descending order\n    # Python's sort is stable, which is fine here.\n    indexed_problems.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 4 & 5: Select the k problems with the highest difficulties\n    # Calculate the total profit and store their original indices\n    max_total_profit = 0\n    chosen_indices = []\n    for i in range(k):\n        max_total_profit += indexed_problems[i][0]\n        chosen_indices.append(indexed_problems[i][1])\n\n    # Step 6: Sort the chosen indices in ascending order\n    # These indices define the cut points for the segments\n    chosen_indices.sort()\n\n    # Step 7: Calculate the lengths of problems solved each day\n    t_lengths = []\n    prev_cut_idx = -1  # Represents the index *before* the first problem (0-indexed)\n\n    # For the first k-1 days, make cuts after each of the first k-1 chosen problems\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The current day ends at chosen_indices[i]\n        # The problems for this day are from prev_cut_idx + 1 to chosen_indices[i]\n        length = chosen_indices[i] - prev_cut_idx\n        t_lengths.append(length)\n        prev_cut_idx = chosen_indices[i]  # Update prev_cut_idx for the next day\n\n    # The last day covers all remaining problems from prev_cut_idx + 1 to n-1\n    last_day_length = n - (prev_cut_idx + 1)\n    t_lengths.append(last_day_length)\n\n    # Output the maximum total profit\n    sys.stdout.write(str(max_total_profit) + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Output the lengths of problems for each day\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, t_lengths)) + \"\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
