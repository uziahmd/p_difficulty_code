Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Vanya and Lanterns Problem in Python**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to address the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. Let's break this down systematically, as I would when designing an algorithm.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n*   I've got `n` lanterns, a street of length `l`, and a list `a` containing the positions of the lanterns.\n*   The goal is to find the *minimum* radius `d` each lantern needs so that the entire street from 0 to `l` is illuminated.\n*   A lantern at position `ai` with radius `d` covers the segment `[ai - d, ai + d]`.\n\n**Key Insight: Managing Gaps**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in effectively managing the \"gaps.\"  I need to consider three primary areas:\n\n1.  **The Start:** Ensuring the first lantern reaches the start of the street (0).\n2.  **The End:** Ensuring the last lantern covers the end of the street (l).\n3.  **In-Between:** Filling the gaps *between* adjacent lanterns.\n\nThe efficient approach here is clearly to sort the lantern positions, `a`, first.  That's going to make the \"in-between\" calculations much easier.\n\n**Calculating `d`:**\n\n1.  **Left Edge:**  To light the start (0), the first lantern's reach, `a_0 - d`, must be less than or equal to 0.  This means `d` must be greater than or equal to `a_0`.\n2.  **Right Edge:** To light the end (l), the last lantern's reach, `a_{n-1} + d`, must be greater than or equal to `l`. This means `d` must be greater than or equal to `l - a_{n-1}`.\n3.  **In Between:** Now for the gaps between the lanterns. Consider any two consecutive lanterns, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. They need to meet or overlap.\n    *   The coverage of `a_i` goes to `a_i + d`\n    *   The coverage of `a_{i+1}` begins from `a_{i+1} - d`.\n    *   So, `a_i + d` must be >= `a_{i+1} - d`.  This means `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.\n    *   I need to find the *largest* of these `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` values across all adjacent lantern pairs (from i=0 to n-2).  Let's call this maximum value `max_gap_d`.\n\n**Putting it Together**\n\nThe minimum radius `d` I'm looking for is essentially the largest of these three values: `a_0`, `l - a_{n-1}`, and `max_gap_d`.  That's how I'll ensure full street coverage.\n\nNow, let me translate this into clean Python code...\n",
