For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got in mind. I need to take a set of three musical notes, represented as text (e.g., \"C E G\"), and determine if they form a major triad, a minor triad, or something else. I'm going to lean heavily on the concept of semitones, as distance between notes, working in a 12-note chromatic scale (C, C#, D... B, and then back to C). I'll treat these notes cyclically.\n\nFirst, I'm going to map each note name to a numerical value from 0 to 11. C will be 0, C# will be 1, and so on. A dictionary is ideal for this kind of look-up.\n\nNext, I have the key idea: I'll convert each input note to its numerical value.  The order of the notes in the input is not initially important, so I'll sort the three numerical values. This way, the process will always start with the smallest note value. The core of my logic involves calculating the intervals, in semitones, between these notes, considering the wraparound of the chromatic scale. Let's call these sorted values v1, v2, and v3.\n\nThen, there is the clever part:  I can compute the distances (in semitones) between v1 and v2, v2 and v3, and the distance back from v3 to v1.  The crucial step is recognizing that these distances, or intervals, form a cyclic pattern.  A major triad has a specific pattern of intervals – 4, 3, and 5 semitones. A minor triad has a different pattern: 3, 4, and 5 semitones. That final distance from v3 back to v1 is the key piece; it's what differentiates the major from minor.\n\nHere's the problem I have to consider: these notes can be ordered in any way initially. The order of the input notes doesn't matter, and the cyclic nature means any of these 3 notes could be the root. I need to make sure I check all possible starting points/roots within the chord. So, even though I sort the values, I must consider all the possible combinations of these 3 numbers for the start. I'll need to check the three distinct cyclic permutations of the intervals. If any of those permutations matches the major or minor pattern, then I can confidently classify the triad.  The intervals are cyclic because these three notes form the whole thing; there is no beginning and end, and the 12-semitone circle must always be accounted for.\n\nI'll check for major first, then minor.  If no pattern matches, the chord is \"strange\". The problem statement promises that there won't be any chords that are both major and minor, which simplifies things considerably.\n\nHere's my approach:\n1.  Map the notes to numbers 0-11\n2.  Convert the three notes to their numerical equivalents.\n3.  Sort those numbers in ascending order.\n4.  Calculate the three cyclic intervals.\n5.  Check these three interval combinations in a loop against major and minor patterns.\n6.  Print the correct classification.\n",
