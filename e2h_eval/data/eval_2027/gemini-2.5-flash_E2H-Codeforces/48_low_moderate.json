            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Base Conversion Script**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this base conversion problem. The user wants a Python script to convert a number from base *a* to base *b*.  The input format is pretty straightforward: *a* and *b* on the first line, then the number *c* itself on the second.  I need to handle bases between 2 and 25, and potentially 'R' for Roman numerals.\n\nThe core challenge is two-fold:  First, parse the input number *c* from its original base *a* and convert it to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. Second, take this decimal value and convert it to the target base *b* (or Roman numerals if that's the desired output).\n\nLet's break this down into manageable functions.\n\nFirst, I'll need a utility function `val(char)` to convert characters (like 'A', '7', etc.) representing digits in a base to their integer values.  '0' through '9' are easy; 'A' to 'Z' map to 10 to 35.\n\nNext, `to_decimal(n_str, base_a)` will do the heavy lifting of converting the number string *n_str* from base *a* to decimal.  I'll iterate through the string from right to left, get the integer value of each digit using `val()`, multiply it by the appropriate power of *a*, and accumulate the result.\n\nThen, for the reverse conversion, `from_decimal(n_dec, base_b)` will take a decimal number *n_dec* and convert it to a string representation in base *b*. This is the classic division-remainder algorithm.  I'll repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base, take the remainder (which is the digit), and append the appropriate character to the result string (remembering to handle both numeric and alphabetic digits).  I need to handle the case of input 0 carefully.  Also, I'll write `char_for_val(v)` as a helper to do the reverse conversion.\n\nFinally, if *b* is 'R', I'll need a separate `to_roman(n_dec)` function.  This one will be a bit more involved, requiring a specific mapping of decimal values to Roman numerals and handling the subtractive notation (IV, IX, etc.).  Fortunately, the constraint for Roman numerals limits the input to a relatively small decimal value (<= 3000).\n\nLet's start putting the code together, starting with those helper functions and the decimal conversion. I'm feeling confident in this approach.\n",
