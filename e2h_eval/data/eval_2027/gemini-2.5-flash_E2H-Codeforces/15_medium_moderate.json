They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Winning Integers of the \"Playoff\" Problem: A Detailed Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're given a competitive programming problem about a single-elimination tournament with $2^n$ teams, each with a unique skill level from $1$ to $2^n$. The tournament's outcome is partly determined by a string $s$ of length $n$, where each character signifies whether the lower or higher-skilled team wins in each phase. Our goal is to figure out which skill levels, if assigned to a team, could lead that team to win the entire tournament, no matter the specific skill arrangement of the other teams. This means identifying the \"winning integers\".\n\nThe key here is that we can freely arrange the skills of the other teams (the permutation $p$) to our advantage. The only fixed parameters are the bracket structure and the string $s$. We only care if we *can* find a permutation that makes a certain skill level the victor, not about the *specific* permutation. For the winner (let's say they have skill $x$), the string $s$ dictates how their skill level needs to compare to their opponents' in each round. If $s_i$ is '0', skill $x$ must be less than the opponent's skill. If $s_i$ is '1', skill $x$ must be greater.\n\nNow, if we count how many times the lower skill wins (represented by $c_0$, the number of '0's in $s$) and how many times the higher skill wins (represented by $c_1$, the number of '1's in $s$), we have the following conditions. To win, $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ distinct opponent skills, meaning it must be sufficiently large. Conversely, $x$ must be less than $c_0$ distinct opponent skills, meaning it must be sufficiently small. The smallest possible winning value of $x$ is $c_1 + 1$ (we need $c_1$ skills to be smaller). The largest possible winning value of $x$ is $2^n - c_0$ (we need $c_0$ skills to be larger).\n\nHere comes the crucial part: $x$ can't be so large or so small that we *can't* find enough distinct skills to make it win, and they must be distinct from $x$. Since we can assign any permutation, the range is determined by how many teams will have to have a lower skill than $x$ or greater than $x$, but distinct from it. The available skills have to be within the range $1$ to $2^n$. Any skill $x$ in the range $[c_1+1, 2^n - c_0]$ is winning.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) such that it's possible for a team with skill $x$ to win a $2^n$-team playoff tournament. The tournament structure is a standard single-elimination bracket. The rules for winning a game depend on the phase of the tournament, specified by a string $s$ of length $n$. If $s_i = '0'$, the team with lower skill wins in phase $i+1$. If $s_i = '1'$, the team with higher skill wins in phase $i+1$. We can choose any permutation $p$ of $1, \\ldots, 2^n$ to assign skill levels to the initial $2^n$ teams.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the tournament winner. A team must win $n$ games to become the champion.\nLet $C_0$ be the count of '0's in the string $s$. These are the number of games the champion must win where the lower skill team proceeds.\nLet $C_1$ be the count of '1's in the string $s$. These are the number of games the champion must win where the higher skill team proceeds.\nClearly, $C_0 + C_1 = n$.\n\nConsider a team with skill $x$ that wins the tournament.\n1. In each of the $C_0$ games where the lower skill wins, team $x$ must have a skill strictly less than its opponent's skill.\n2. In each of the $C_1$ games where the higher skill wins, team $x$ must have a skill strictly greater than its opponent's skill.\n\nTo make this possible, we need to find $C_0$ distinct skill values greater than $x$ and $C_1$ distinct skill values less than $x$. These $C_0+C_1=n$ opponent skills must also be distinct from $x$ and from each other.\n\nLet's determine the minimum possible value for $x$.\nFor $x$ to win $C_1$ games where it's the higher skill, it needs $C_1$ opponents with skills $x-1, x-2, \\ldots, x-C_1$. For these skills to be valid (i.e., $\\ge 1$), we must have $x-C_1 \\ge 1$, which means $x \\ge C_1+1$.\n\nLet's determine the maximum possible value for $x$.\nFor $x$ to win $C_0$ games where it's the lower skill, it needs $C_0$ opponents with skills $x+1, x+2, \\ldots, x+C_0$. For these skills to be valid (i.e., $\\le 2^n$), we must have $x+C_0 \\le 2^n$, which means $x \\le 2^n-C_0$.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the range of possible winning skills is $[C_1+1, 2^n-C_0]$.\nLet's check this against the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$C_0=1$ (one '0' in $s$), $C_1=2$ (two '1's in $s$). $2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nAccording to the formula: $[2+1, 8-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example output for this case is `4 5 6 7`. My range is $[3, 7]$, which includes $3$ but the example output does not. This suggests my reasoning is missing something.\n\nThe crucial detail missed is that the choice of permutation $p$ allows us to assign *any* skill to *any* team. However, the *structure* of the tournament bracket is fixed. A team with skill $x$ plays $n$ games, but its opponents are not arbitrary skills from the remaining $2^n-1$ skills. Its opponents are themselves winners of sub-tournaments.\n\nConsider the \"effective\" number of teams that can reach a certain stage.\nIn a tournament of $2^k$ teams, there are $2^k-1$ games.\nIf $s_i = '0'$ (lower skill wins), then in each game, the higher-skilled team is eliminated. This means that among any $2^k$ initial teams, at most $2^k-1$ of them can have a skill value greater than the winner of that sub-tournament.\nIf $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins), then in each game, the lower-skilled team is eliminated. This means that among any $2^k$ initial teams, at most $2^k-1$ of them can have a skill value smaller than the winner of that sub-tournament.\n\nLet's look at it from the perspective of how many \"slots\" are available for skills relative to $x$.\nIn the $C_1$ games where $x$ wins by being higher skill, $x$ must beat $C_1$ distinct opponents with skills $y_1, \\ldots, y_{C_1}$ such that $y_j < x$.\nIn the $C_0$ games where $x$ wins by being lower skill, $x$ must beat $C_0$ distinct opponents with skills $z_1, \\ldots, z_{C_0}$ such that $z_j > x$.\n\nThe key is that for a team with skill $x$ to win, we can construct a permutation $p$ such that $x$ wins its games.\nThe minimum skill value that can win is $1$. This is possible only if $C_0=n$ (all '0's). In this scenario, $x=1$ wins all its games by being the lower skill. The maximum skill value that can win is $2^n$. This is possible only if $C_1=n$ (all '1's). In this scenario, $x=2^n$ wins all its games by being the higher skill.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that are \"stronger\" than $x$ (skills $>x$) and \"weaker\" than $x$ (skills $<x$).\nThere are $2^n-x$ teams with skill greater than $x$.\nThere are $x-1$ teams with skill less than $x$.\n\nFor $x$ to win the tournament:\n1. $x$ must defeat $C_1$ teams with skill less than $x$. These $C_1$ opponents must be distinct. The minimum number of skills less than $x$ required is $C_1$. So $x-1 \\ge C_1 \\implies x \\ge C_1+1$.\n2. $x$ must defeat $C_0$ teams with skill greater than $x$. These $C_0$ opponents must be distinct. The minimum number of skills greater than $x$ required is $C_0$. So $2^n-x \\ge C_0 \\implies x \\le 2^n-C_0$.\n\nThis still leads to the range $[C_1+1, 2^n-C_0]$. The example output implies that $x$ must be able to beat not just $C_1$ teams, but $2^{C_1}$ teams that are \"effectively\" weaker than it, and $2^{C_0}$ teams that are \"effectively\" stronger than it. This interpretation is often used in similar problems where the opponent's \"strength\" is not arbitrary but depends on their sub-bracket.\n\nLet $k_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$ and $k_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum skill that can win is $1 + (2^{k_1}-1)$.\nThe maximum skill that can win is $2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)$.\n\nLet's check this hypothesis with the example: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_0=1, k_1=2$.\nMinimum winning skill: $1 + (2^2-1) = 1 + (4-1) = 1+3=4$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^3 - (2^1-1) = 8 - (2-1) = 8-1=7$.\nThis gives the range $[4, 7]$, which matches the example output `4 5 6 7`.\n\nLet's try another example: $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n$k_0=0, k_1=1$. $2^n=2$.\nMinimum winning skill: $1 + (2^1-1) = 1+1=2$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^1 - (2^0-1) = 2 - (1-1) = 2-0=2$.\nThis gives the range $[2, 2]$. The output is `2`. This matches.\n\nExample: $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n$k_0=1, k_1=1$. $2^n=4$.\nMinimum winning skill: $1 + (2^1-1) = 1+1=2$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^2 - (2^1-1) = 4 - (2-1) = 4-1=3$.\nThis gives the range $[2, 3]$. The output is `2 3`. This matches.\n\nThis hypothesis seems correct. Why $2^{k_1}-1$ and $2^{k_0}-1$?\nConsider the $k_1$ games where the higher skill wins. To win these games, team $X$ must be higher than $k_1$ direct opponents. But these $k_1$ direct opponents are themselves winners of sub-tournaments. Each opponent that $X$ beats in a '1'-game means that $X$ has effectively eliminated a whole sub-bracket of teams where $X$ was the highest skill.\nIf $X$ wins a game where $s_i='1'$, it means $X$ is the highest skill in its sub-bracket of size $2^{i-1}$ (if $i$ is 1-indexed phase number).\nIf $X$ wins $k_1$ such games, it implies $X$ is the highest skill among $k_1$ such sub-brackets. The total number of teams in these sub-brackets (including $X$ itself) is $2^{k_1}$. All other $2^{k_1}-1$ teams must have skill less than $X$. Thus, $X$ must be at least $2^{k_1}$. If $X$ is $2^{k_1}$, it can have $1, \\ldots, 2^{k_1}-1$ as opponents.\nThe minimum skill for $X$ is $1 + (2^{k_1}-1)$. This means $X$ needs to be greater than $2^{k_1}-1$ other skills. The smallest $X$ can be is $2^{k_1}$. For example, if $k_1=0$, $X$ needs to be greater than $2^0-1 = 0$ skills, so $X \\ge 1$. If $k_1=1$, $X$ needs to be greater than $2^1-1=1$ skill, so $X \\ge 2$. If $k_1=2$, $X$ needs to be greater than $2^2-1=3$ skills, so $X \\ge 4$.\n\nSimilarly, for the $k_0$ games where the lower skill wins. To win these games, $X$ must be lower than $k_0$ direct opponents. This means $X$ is the lowest skill in $k_0$ sub-brackets. The total number of teams in these sub-brackets (including $X$ itself) is $2^{k_0}$. All other $2^{k_0}-1$ teams must have skill greater than $X$. Thus, $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)$. For example, if $k_0=0$, $X$ needs to be less than $2^0-1 = 0$ skills, so $X \\le 2^n$. If $k_0=1$, $X$ needs to be less than $2^1-1=1$ skill, so $X \\le 2^n-1$. If $k_0=2$, $X$ needs to be less than $2^2-1=3$ skills, so $X \\le 2^n-3$.\n\nSo the range of winning integers is $[1 + (2^{C_1}-1), 2^n - (2^{C_0}-1)]$.\nLet $min\\_x = 1 + (2^{C_1}-1) = 2^{C_1}$.\nLet $max\\_x = 2^n - (2^{C_0}-1)$.\nThe winning integers are $x$ such that $min\\_x \\le x \\le max\\_x$.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $C_0$ (number of '0's) and $C_1$ (number of '1's) in $s$.\n4. Calculate $min\\_x = 2^{C_1}$.\n5. Calculate $max\\_x = 2^n - (2^{C_0}-1)$.\n6. Print all integers from $min\\_x$ to $max\\_x$ inclusive, separated by spaces.\n\nExample $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$C_0=1, C_1=2$.\n$min\\_x = 2^{C_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n$max\\_x = 2^3 - (2^1-1) = 8 - (2-1) = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nOutput: `4 5 6 7`.\n\nThis logic holds for all examples.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    c0 = s.count('0')\n    c1 = s.count('1')\n\n    # The minimum skill level that can win.\n    # To win c1 games where higher skill wins, the winner must be\n    # higher than 2^c1 - 1 other skills.\n    # So the minimum skill level is 1 + (2^c1 - 1) = 2^c1.\n    min_winning_skill = 2**c1\n\n    # The maximum skill level that can win.\n    # To win c0 games where lower skill wins, the winner must be\n    # lower than 2^c0 - 1 other skills.\n    # Total skills are 2^n.
