The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Gilded Cells Calculation - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, and I'm given the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`). This sounds like a fun problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the rings are defined. Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle. The first ring is the outer edge, the second is two cells in, and so on. Let's start by analyzing the dimensions of the inner rectangles.\n\nThe *i*-th ring will have an inner rectangle of `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  Let's call those `current_w` and `current_h`. I can iterate through each ring and calculate its bordered cells.\n\nNow, how do I calculate those bordering cells? For a general rectangle with dimensions `W x H`, it's not simply the perimeter, but the count of the border cells. I need to make sure I get this right.  I initially thought it was `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` which works for most dimensions. I need to be careful with the edge cases. I know if either `W` or `H` is 1, it's not the same. If either are 1, it would be `W` or `H`, respectively. If both `W` and `H` are 1 it's 1.\n\nThe correct formula for border cells is indeed `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` for most scenarios. I need to take care of edge cases: if either `current_w` or `current_h` gets smaller than 2, I need to adjust the formula. The inner rectangle could collapse to a line if either `current_w` or `current_h` becomes 1 or smaller. The idea is to calculate bordered cells for each ring and accumulate the totals to get the final gilded count. That's the core logic. I'm going to start writing the script now.\n",
