    "thought": "**My Analysis of a Competitive Programming Problem: Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this programming challenge where I need to figure out how many positive integers, *n*, exist such that *n* factorial (*n*!) ends with exactly *m* zeroes. My first step is to break down how to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in *n*!. Since trailing zeroes come from factors of 10, and 10 is 2 * 5, I need to count pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of *n*!. There'll always be more factors of 2 than 5, so the number of 5s determines the number of trailing zeroes.\n\nI'm using Legendre's formula, which simplifies to `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`. This sum keeps going as long as 5 raised to some power is less than or equal to *n*. Let's call the result of this formula `Z(n)`. This `Z(n)` gives me the exact number of trailing zeroes in *n*!.\n\nNow, I'm analyzing how `Z(n)` behaves. I notice it's a non-decreasing function; it either stays the same or increases. It only increases when *n* is a multiple of 5. Specifically, when *n* jumps from `5k-1` to `5k`, `Z(n)` might increase. For instance, when it goes from 24 to 25, the increase is 2. The formula shows that a jump in zeroes happens when *n* is a multiple of 5, then a bigger jump if *n* is also a multiple of 25, and so on. Also I noticed that `Z(n)` increases in increments of 1 and 2, but it has no case where `Z(n)` is *5*.\nFor example, `Z(24) = 4`, `Z(25)=6`, there is a gap. Therefore if *m* is one of those skipped numbers, the result should be zero.\n\nThe key insight is that if `Z(n)` *does* equal *m*, then there are exactly 5 consecutive integers `n_0`, `n_0+1`, `n_0+2`, `n_0+3`, `n_0+4` for which `Z(n)` remains constant. If it cannot, the result must be 0. So my strategy is: 1) find the smallest *n* (call it `n_0`) where `Z(n) >= m`, 2) check if `Z(n_0)` *equals* *m*. If it does, those are the solutions, and if not then there are 0 solutions.\n\nTo find `n_0` efficiently, I use binary search because `Z(n)` is non-decreasing. I need to define the search range for *n*. Since `Z(n)` is approximately *n*/4, and *m* can be up to 100,000, I estimate a safe upper bound of `5 * 10^5` (five times *m*), or even better I could use a slightly tighter upper bound of `6*10^5` - but 500000 seems more than enough based on previous results.\n\nI've written a function, `count_trailing_zeroes(n)`, to calculate `Z(n)` using Legendre's formula.\n\nHere's my binary search: I initialize `low` to 1 and `high` to `5 * 10^5`, and a place to store the results, setting `ans_n = -1`. Then in a loop, I calculate the `mid`point, and use `count_trailing_zeroes(mid)`. If it's greater than or equal to *m*, I store `mid` as a potential answer and narrow the `high` bound. Otherwise, I narrow `low`. Eventually the binary search lands on `n_0`.\n\nAfter the binary search, I verify that `count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n)` is exactly *m*. If it is, the answer is 5, and I print the 5 consecutive numbers `ans_n` to `ans_n+4`. If not, I print 0.\n\nI've carefully considered edge cases, such as very small or very large *m* values, and values where there are no solutions due to a \"skipped\" *m*. It all appears to work correctly! I added the print statement following the requested format of \"k\" on one line, followed by space-separated solutions. I",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n` values, followed by the values themselves in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s. In any factorial `n!`, the number of prime factor 2s will always be greater than or equal to the number of prime factor 5s. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is equal to the number of factors of 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nThis count can be calculated using Legendre's Formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThe sum continues as long as the denominator `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n**Properties of Z(n)**\n\nLet `Z(n)` denote the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.\n1. `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2. `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n3. For any integer `k`, `Z(5k-1) = Z(5k-2) = Z(5k-3) = Z(5k-4)`.\n4. When `n` crosses a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` increases. For example, `Z(4)=0`, `Z(5)=1`. `Z(9)=1`, `Z(10)=2`.\n5. Crucially, `Z(n)` remains constant for 5 consecutive values of `n` that are not multiples of 5, and then increases at the next multiple of 5. For example:\n   `Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1` (5 values)\n   `Z(10)=2, Z(11)=2, Z(12)=2, Z(13)=2, Z(14)=2` (5 values)\n   `Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4` (5 values)\nHowever, `Z(n)` can \"skip\" values. For instance, `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`. There is no `n` for which `Z(n)=5`. This means if `m=5`, there are no solutions.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nBased on these observations, the strategy is:\n1. **Define `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function:** Implement Legendre's formula.\n2. **Binary Search for `n_0`:** Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the smallest positive integer `n_0` such that `Z(n_0) >= m`.\n   - The lower bound for `n` can be 1.\n   - The upper bound for `n`: For `m = 100,000`, `n` is approximately `4m` (since `Z(n) ~ n/4`). So, `n` will be around `400,000`. A safe upper bound for binary search is `500,000`.\n3. **Check `Z(n_0)`:**\n   - If `count_trailing_zeroes(n_0) == m`: This means `m` is an achievable number of zeroes. Due to the property that `Z(n)` is constant for 5 consecutive values (before the next multiple of 5 causes an increase), the solutions will be `n_0, n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4`. There are exactly 5 such values.\n   - If `count_trailing_zeroes(n_0) > m`: This means `m` is one of the \"skipped\" values (like 5 in the example above). In this case, there are no integers `n` for which `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=1)**\n\n1. `count_trailing_zeroes(n)`:\n   - `Z(4) = 0`\n   - `Z(5) = 1`\n   - `Z(6) = 1`\n   ...\n2. Binary search for smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= 1`:\n   - `low = 1`, `high = 500000`\n   - `mid` values will be tried.\n   - Eventually, `ans_n` will converge to `5`.\n3. Check `Z(ans_n)`:\n   - `ans_n = 5`.\n   - `count_trailing_zeroes(5) = 1`.\n   - Since `1 == m (1)`, the condition is met.\n   - Output `5` (the count) and `5 6 7 8 9` (the values).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=5)**\n\n1. Binary search for smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= 5`:\n   - `Z(24) = 4`\n   - `Z(25) = 6`\n   - Binary search will find `ans_n = 25` as the smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= 5`.\n2. Check `Z(ans_n)`:\n   - `ans_n = 25`.\n   - `count_trailing_zeroes(25) = 6`.\n   - Since `6 > m (5)`, the condition `Z(ans_n) == m` is false.\n   - Output `0`.\n\n**Complexity**\n\n- The `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function takes `O(log_5 n)` time because `i` is multiplied by 5 in each step.\n- The binary search performs `O(log N)` iterations, where `N` is the search range (e.g., `500,000`).\n- Total time complexity: `O(log N * log_5 N)`. For `N = 500,000`, `log_2(500,000)` is about 19, and `log_5(500,000)` is about 8. So, roughly `19 * 8 = 152` operations, which is extremely fast and well within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!.\n    Using Legendre's formula: Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    power_of_5 = 5\n    while n >= power_of_5:\n        count += n // power_of_5\n        power_of_5 *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest positive integer n_0 such that count_trailing_zeroes(n_0) >= m.\n    # The maximum value for m is 100,000.\n    # We know that Z(n) is approximately n/4.
