And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Sleep Time Averages: A Sliding Window Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to compute the average sleep time across all possible \"weeks,\" where a \"week\" is defined as a consecutive sequence of *k* days from Polycarp's sleep records, which are stored in the array `a` of length *n*.  The goal is to calculate the average sleep time over all these potential \"weeks\".\n\nThe core of the problem lies in efficiently summing the sleep times for each week. There are `n - k + 1` weeks to consider. A naive approach would involve a nested loop, computing the sum for each *k*-sized window. However, with `n` potentially reaching 2 * 10<sup>5</sup>, a direct calculation like that would lead to an `O(n<sup>2</sup>)` time complexity, which is far too slow, especially if *k* becomes close to *n/2*.\n\nMy experience tells me this is a classic sliding window sum problem. I can cleverly reuse the computations from the previous \"week\" to calculate the current \"week's\" sum. For week *i*, the sum `S_i` is given by `a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{i+k-1}`.  The key is realizing that `S_{i+1}` is just `S_i` minus the contribution of the first element (`a_i`) and plus the contribution of the new element (`a_{i+k}`). This makes it an `O(1)` operation to calculate each `S_i` after I compute the initial `S_1` in `O(k)` time.\n\nThis means I can compute the total sum of all weeks (`TotalSum`) with an `O(n)` time complexity overall because after the first calculation the subsequent updates are `O(1)`. The final step is simple division: `TotalSum / (n - k + 1)` to get the average sleep time.  This sliding window technique will be the most efficient strategy.\n",
