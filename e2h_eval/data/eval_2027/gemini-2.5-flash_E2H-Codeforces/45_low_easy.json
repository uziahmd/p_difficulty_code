There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Tennis Tournament Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. The core of it is a knockout tournament with *n* players, and the twist is this quirky rule about who can play whom.  My main objective is to figure out the maximum number of games the eventual winner can possibly play.\n\n**Breaking Down the Rule**\n\nThe crucial part is understanding this rule: two players can only face off if the absolute difference in the number of games they've *won* is at most one.  Think about it – if player A has won, say, 5 games, their potential opponent can have won 4, 5, or 6 games. That's the key.\n\n**How the Tournament Unfolds**\n\nI'm visualizing this tournament from the winner's perspective.  Initially, everyone's at zero games. The games progress in rounds, and with each match, a player gets eliminated.  The number of games played will be n-1.\n\n**Optimizing the Winner's Path**\n\nTo maximize the winner's games, I need to make sure they're always matched with an eligible opponent. This means ensuring there's always someone with a compatible game count.  I can think about it as the number of players at each game count level.  Let `P_k` be the number of players with k wins.\n\nIf the winner has played k games, they need to play a player with either `k-2`, `k-1` or `k` games. So, if the winner keeps playing, this needs to have a way to stay true.\n\n**Game by Game Analysis**\n\nLet's trace this first game: all players have 0 wins.\nThe winner, `W`, starts with 0 games. They can only play someone with 0 or 1 win.  Since everyone starts at 0, that's their first match. One person wins, they move to one game, leaving `n-2` players with zero games played. Now there's one player with one game won.\n\nI'll need to develop a strategy to track this, using a system, perhaps iteratively.  This problem is not simply calculating the number of games total, it's finding the upper bound on the number of games that can be played!\n",
