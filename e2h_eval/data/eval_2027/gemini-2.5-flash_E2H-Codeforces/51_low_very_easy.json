Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Let's Tackle This \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Amusing Joke.\" Seems simple enough on the surface. We're given three strings representing a guest's name, a host's name, and a pile of letters. The goal is to determine if the pile of letters is a perfect permutation of the combined guest and host names.\n\nMy immediate thought is, the most efficient way to solve this is to count character frequencies. I could do this by:\n\n1.  **Combining the Names:** I'll concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n2.  **Counting Characters:** I'll create a dictionary or map to store the frequency of each character in the combined names. I'll do the same for the pile of letters.\n3.  **Comparing Frequencies:** If the frequency counts of each character perfectly match between the combined names and the pile of letters, then I'll print \"YES.\" Otherwise, I'll print \"NO.\"\n\nEssentially, I'm checking if the \"bag of letters\" from the combined names can be rearranged exactly into the pile of letters. A quick example I've run through in my head is that if I have \"SANTACLAUS\" and \"DEDMOROZ\" and \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" the frequency of each letter is identical between the names and the pile, so YES.\n\nAlternatively, I could also use a sorting approach, which is often a cleaner way to handle this in Python:\n\n1.  Concatenate the guest and host names.\n2.  Sort the characters in the combined string.\n3.  Sort the characters in the pile of letters.\n4.  Compare the sorted strings. If they're identical, it's a \"YES\"; otherwise, it's a \"NO.\"\n\nI'm leaning towards the sorting method, it's pretty Pythonic.\n\nI can write a script using the sorting method, and I'll test it thoroughly with various test cases, but I am confident.\n",
