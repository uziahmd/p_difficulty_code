Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Detecting \"X\" Shapes in Grids**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with crafting a Python script to figure out if a given grid of characters constitutes an \"X\" shape according to some rules. The core idea is pretty straightforward: we need to verify that the diagonals are all the same letter, and every other position in the grid contains a *different* letter. The grid's size is going to be `n x n`, where `n` has to be an odd number between 3 and 299 (inclusive).\n\nI'll start by reading the grid size `n` and then the grid itself, probably storing the input as a list of strings, or a list of lists of characters.  The key is recognizing the diagonal elements:  `grid[i][j]` is on a diagonal if either `i` equals `j` or if the sum of `i` and `j` is equal to `n-1`.\n\nNow, the actual algorithm: I'll initialize a flag, `is_valid_X`, to `True`, assuming the grid is an X until proven otherwise. I'll also need variables to store the diagonal character (`diag_char`) and the other character (`other_char`). I'll use nested loops to go through each cell in the grid. If a cell is on a diagonal, I'll either set `diag_char` to that cell's character (if it's the first diagonal character seen) or compare it to `diag_char`.  If they don't match, I immediately set `is_valid_X` to `False` and break out of the loops, no point in continuing if we know it's not a valid X.  A similar logic goes for non-diagonal cells; compare it to `other_char`, and if they differ, the flag goes down.\n\nAfter traversing the grid, I'll perform a final check.  Since `n` is always greater than or equal to 3, both `diag_char` and `other_char` are definitely assigned. What's crucial at this point is that `diag_char` and `other_char` *must* be different. So, if they *are* the same, I flip `is_valid_X` back to `False`. Finally, I print \"YES\" if `is_valid_X` is still `True` and \"NO\" otherwise. This seems pretty solid, covers all cases, and efficient enough. I've also done a lot of test cases to verify the results.\n",
