Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vanya and Lanterns problem to tackle, and it's sounding like a classic optimization problem.  I need to find the smallest radius (let's call it 'd') for the lanterns so that the entire street is illuminated. The street's length is `l`, and there are `n` lanterns at specific locations `a_i`.  Each lantern lights a segment of the street centered at its position.\n\nThe input's clear: `n`, `l`, and the positions of the lanterns `a_i`. The output will be the smallest `d` that does the trick, a float.  Constraints are pretty straightforward, nothing unusual there.\n\nMy approach is starting to form.  Sorting the lantern positions is definitely the first move.  That's going to make identifying the gaps between lanterns much easier. Let me assume a sorted list of lantern positions, `a_0` to `a_{n-1}`.\n\nNow, let's break down the coverage requirements. The start of the street (0) needs to be lit, so the first lantern must reach that. Similarly, the end of the street (`l`) also has to be lit by the last lantern.  But the *really* interesting part is the space *between* the lanterns. I need to make sure there are no unlit gaps.\n\nLet's think about consecutive lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. The segment between them, `[a_i + d, a_{i+1} - d]`, needs to be illuminated. That means the lit segments must overlap, or at least touch. The distance between them must be less than or equal to `2d`. This gives us the core constraint: `d` must be greater than or equal to half the distance between consecutive lanterns.\n\nNow to calculate that minimum `d`. To cover the start, `a_0 - d` must be less than or equal to 0, meaning `d >= a_0`.  So `d_start = a_0`.  To cover the end, `a_{n-1} + d` needs to be greater than or equal to `l`, thus `d >= l - a_{n-1}`. That's `d_end = l - a_{n-1}`.  For the gaps between the sorted lanterns, as I figured out, the critical value for `d` is half the largest gap between any two adjacent lanterns: `max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2)`.\n\nThe final `d` will be the maximum of these three values: `d_start`, `d_end`, and the `max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2)`.\n",
