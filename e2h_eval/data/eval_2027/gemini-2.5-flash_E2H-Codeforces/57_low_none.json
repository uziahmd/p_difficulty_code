His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Olympiad Problem - Finding Vasya's Ranks**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Olympiad\" problem. My goal is to figure out the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve. Let's break this down.\n\nThe input is `n`, the number of participants, `x`, Vasya's minimum total points, and two lists: `a` (first tour scores) and `b` (second tour scores). The tricky part is that we don't know which scores from `a` pair with which scores from `b` to form each participant's total. We only know that Vasya's total is at least `x`, meaning there exists *at least one* pair of scores that fulfill this.\n\nThe ranking is based on total points in descending order, with the jury deciding ties. This means ties are a huge factor here.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the best possible rank for Vasya. My initial instinct was that it can always be 1. The problem guarantees that at least one combination exists, and I can always manipulate his scores to be the maximum and, if necessary, make the jury favor him. I'm thinking about it like this: I need to maximize Vasya's score by finding the largest possible value of `a_i + b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Let's call this maximum score `S_max_vasya`.\n\nNow, regardless of how the other participants score, I can always arrange the scores so that Vasya achieves `S_max_vasya`. And since the jury can decide ties, even if `S_max_vasya` equals the highest score of some other participants, Vasya *could* still be in first place. It is always possible to make Vasya's rank 1. So the best rank will always be 1.  It does seem surprisingly simple though, so I'll need to double check this reasoning.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad, given his minimum total score `x` and the lists of scores for all participants in the first and second tours. We don't know which first-tour score corresponds to which second-tour score, except that Vasya's scores form one such pair.\n\n**Best Possible Rank:**\nTo achieve the best possible rank, Vasya wants to maximize his score and minimize the scores of other participants. Since the jury can assign places arbitrarily among participants with the same total score, if Vasya achieves the highest total score among all participants, he can always be assigned the 1st place. The problem guarantees that there exists at least one pair of scores `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Vasya can choose the pair `(a_i, b_j)` that gives him the maximum possible sum. If this maximum sum is `S_max`, he is guaranteed to be among those with `S_max` points. By jury's choice, he can be assigned 1st place. Therefore, the best possible rank for Vasya is always 1.\n\n**Worst Possible Rank:**\nTo find the worst possible rank, we want to minimize Vasya's score (while still satisfying `a_i + b_j >= x`) and maximize the scores of other participants. This means we should try to maximize the number of participants who score *strictly more* than Vasya, and then maximize the number of participants who score *equal to* Vasya.\n\nLet's sort both `a` and `b` arrays. Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is helpful for pairing.\n`a_sorted_asc`: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`\n`b_sorted_desc`: `b_1 >= b_2 >= ... >= b_n`\n\nConsider a specific pair `(a_i, b_j)` that Vasya *could* have. His score would be `a_i + b_j`. We are trying to find a pairing of the remaining `n-1` `a` scores and `n-1` `b` scores to other participants such that Vasya's rank is maximized (i.e., worst).\n\nA key observation for the worst case is to consider all possible pairings of scores for *other* participants. If Vasya takes `a_i` and `b_j`, the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` must be paired up among the other `n-1` participants. To maximize the number of people who score higher than Vasya, we should try to form `n-1` pairs `(a_k, b_l)` (where `k != i`, `l != j`) such that `a_k + b_l` is as large as possible.\n\nHowever, the problem statement implies that Vasya's scores `a_i` and `b_j` are *some* specific scores from the given lists, but we don't know which ones. The crucial part is \"the results have only points, no names.\" This means we are trying to find a specific `a_k` and `b_l` from the input arrays for Vasya such that `a_k + b_l >= x`, and for this `a_k` and `b_l`, his rank is maximized given optimal pairings for others.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\n`a_sorted = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`\n`b_sorted = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`\n\nTo maximize the number of participants who score higher than Vasya, we should try to find a pairing for Vasya that results in a low score (`>= x`), and then pair the remaining scores for others to get high scores.\nThe most effective way to pair scores to maximize sums for other participants is to pair the largest available `a` with the largest available `b`, the second largest `a` with the second largest `b`, and so on. This is not quite right for maximizing *individual* sums; rather, pairing largest with largest and smallest with smallest can create a wide range of sums.\n\nConsider a fixed score `S` that Vasya might have. How many participants *could* score strictly more than `S`?\nTo maximize the number of participants scoring `> S`, we should use the largest possible `a_i` and `b_j` values for them.\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nLet's sort `b` in descending order: `b_1 >= b_2 >= ... >= b_n`.\nIf we pair `a_i` with `b_i` for all `i`, these sums `a_i + b_i` represent a set of sums. This specific pairing strategy is known to maximize the minimum sum, or minimize the maximum sum, depending on the context.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's score to be `S_V`. We want to count how many participants can score `P_k > S_V`.\nTo maximize this count, we should assign `a_i` and `b_j` to Vasya such that `a_i + b_j = S_V` and `S_V >= x`.\nFor the remaining `n-1` `a` scores and `n-1` `b` scores, we pair them such that as many pairs as possible sum to `> S_V`.\nThis is a matching problem.\n\nA simpler approach for the worst case:\nWe need to find a pairing `(a_i, b_j)` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Among all such possible pairs, we pick one that results in the highest rank for Vasya.\nSuppose Vasya takes `a_p` and `b_q`. His score is `S_V = a_p + b_q`.\nThe remaining `n-1` scores from `a` (`a_k` for `k != p`) and `n-1` scores from `b` (`b_l` for `l != q`) must be paired up.\nTo maximize Vasya's rank (make it worst), we want to maximize the number of participants who score strictly more than `S_V`, and then those who score equal to `S_V`.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\n`a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`\n`b = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`\n\nConsider a participant `k`. If participant `k` scores `a_i` in the first tour and `b_j` in the second tour, their total score is `a_i + b_j`.\nThe total `n` participants will have `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)`.\nTo calculate Vasya's worst rank, we iterate through all possible `a_i` Vasya could have. For each `a_i`, we need to find a `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nTo maximize the number of people better than Vasya, we should pick the smallest `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. This gives Vasya the lowest possible score for a given `a_i`.\nSo, for a given `a_i`, Vasya's score `S_V` would be `a_i + b_k` where `b_k` is the smallest `b` such that `b_k >= x - a_i`. We can find this `b_k` using binary search (specifically, `bisect_left` on sorted `b`). If no such `b_k` exists, `a_i` cannot be Vasya's score.\n\nLet `a` be sorted ascendingly.\nFor each `a_i` in `a`:\n1. Find `target_b = x - a_i`.\n2. Find the index `k` of the smallest `b_k` in sorted `b` such that `b_k >= target_b`. This can be done using `bisect_left(b, target_b)`.\n3. If `k` is out of bounds (`k >= n`), then `a_i` cannot be Vasya's first tour score (because even the largest `b` is not enough). Continue to the next `a_i`.\n4. Now, Vasya has score `S_V = a_i + b_k`. This is one possible score for Vasya.\n5. The remaining `n-1` `a` scores (all `a_p` where `p != i`) and `n-1` `b` scores (all `b_q` where `q != k`) must be paired up. We want to maximize the number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` such that `a_p + b_q > S_V`.\n\nThis subproblem (maximizing pairs `> S_V`) is tricky. A standard greedy approach for this type of problem is to sort one array ascending and the other descending.\nLet's re-sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.\n`a_asc = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`\n`b_desc = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`\n\nNow, if Vasya takes `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, his score is `S_V = a_i + b_j`.\nWe need to count how many pairs `(a_p, b_q)` from the remaining scores sum to `> S_V`.\nThis can be solved by iterating through `a_asc` (excluding `a_i`) and for each `a_p`, finding how many `b_q` (excluding `b_j`) satisfy `b_q > S_V - a_p`.\nThis still feels like a double iteration inside a loop, which might be `O(N^2 log N)` or `O(N^2)`. Given `N=10^5`, this is too slow. `N log N` or `N log^2 N` is required.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from the perspective of how many participants can beat Vasya.\nSuppose Vasya gets a score `S_V`.\nHow many participants can score strictly more than `S_V`?\nLet `a` be sorted ascendingly and `b` be sorted descendingly.\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j > S_V`.\nThis is a standard two-pointer problem if we want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j > K`.\nInitialize `count = 0`, `left = 0`, `right = n-1`.\nWhile `left < n` and `right >= 0`:\n  If `a[left] + b[right] > K`:\n    This pair `(a[left], b[right])` can beat `K`. We take `a[left]` and `b[right]`. Increment `count`, `left++`, `right--`.\n  Else (`a[left] + b[right] <= K`):\n    `a[left]` is too small to make a sum `> K` with `b[right]`. To increase the sum, we need a larger `a`. So `left++`.\nThis greedy strategy finds the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j > K` IF WE ARE ALLOWED TO USE EACH `a_i` and `b_j` AT MOST ONCE. This is exactly what we need for other participants.\n\nSo, the algorithm for the worst case:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Initialize `max_rank = 0`.\n4. Iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1` (representing `a_i` as Vasya's first tour score).\n   a. Find `target_b = x - a[i]`.\n   b. Use `bisect_left(b, target_b)` to find the smallest `b_k` in `b` such that `b_k >= target_b`. Let its index be `k_idx`.\n   c. If `k_idx >= n`, then `a[i]` cannot be Vasya's score (even with largest `b`, `a[i] + b[n-1] < x`). Continue to next `a_i`.\n   d. Vasya's score for this `a_i` is `S_V = a[i] + b[k_idx]`.\n   e. Now, we need to count how many *other* participants can score `> S_V`.\n      This is the tricky part. The `a[i]` and `b[k_idx]` are \"used\".\n      We have `a_prime = a[:i] + a[i+1:]` and `b_prime = b[:k_idx] + b[k_idx+1:]`.\n      This is inefficient.\n\nLet's try a different perspective for the worst case.\nThe worst rank is `1 + (number of people strictly better than Vasya) + (number of people equal to Vasya, if jury decides against him)`.\nTo maximize this, we want to maximize the number of people who score strictly more than Vasya.\nLet `a` be sorted ascendingly, `b` be sorted descendingly.\n`a_asc = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`\n`b_desc = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}]`\n\nThe `i`-th participant in the `a_asc` list (who scored `a_i`) could be paired with the `j`-th participant in the `b_desc` list (who scored `b_j`).\nConsider a specific pairing of all `n` participants. For example, participant `k` gets `a_k` and `b_k` (from the sorted lists).\nThe total scores for this specific pairing are `a_0 + b_0, a_1 + b_1, ..., a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}`.\nThis pairing `(a_i, b_i)` (where `a` is ascending, `b` is descending) is known to produce sums that are \"spread out\" as much as possible, or to minimize the maximum sum, or maximize the minimum sum. It's not immediately clear how it relates to maximizing the count of people above a threshold.\n\nLet `a` be sorted ascendingly and `b` be sorted ascendingly.\nWe want to find the maximum `k` such that there exists a set of `k` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` where `a_i + b_j > S_V` for some `S_V >= x`.\nThe condition \"Vasya got at least x points\" means Vasya's score `S_V` must be at least `x`.\nTo maximize his rank, we want to choose `a_i`, `b_j` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, and for this `S_V = a_i + b_j`, the number of other participants who score `> S_V` is maximized, and then the number of participants who score `= S_V` is maximized.\n\nLet's try fixing Vasya's scores. Vasya can take any `a_i` and any `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThere are `N^2` such pairs. For each pair, we calculate `S_V = a_i + b_j`. Then we have `N-1` `a` scores and `N-1` `b` scores left. We need to pair them to maximize the count of scores `> S_V`. This is too slow.\n\nWhat if we iterate on the *rank*? Can Vasya be rank `k`?\nIf Vasya is rank `k`, it means there are `k-1` participants who are ranked higher than or equal to him, and the jury puts him at `k`.\nTo maximize `k`, we want to maximize the number of participants who score strictly more than Vasya.\nLet `a` be sorted ascendingly, `b` be sorted ascendingly.\nWe can use a two-pointer approach to count how many pairs `(a_i, b_j)` can sum to `S` or more.\nLet `count_ge(S)` be the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` (using distinct `i` and `j` for each pair) such that `a_i + b_j >= S`.\nTo calculate `count_ge(S)`:\n  Sort `a` ascendingly. Sort `b` ascendingly.\n  `count = 0`\n  `j = n - 1` (pointer for `b`)\n  For `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`):\n    While `j >= 0` and `a[i] + b[j] >= S`:\n      `j--`\n    `count += (n - 1 - j)` (all `b` from `j+1` to `n-1` can form a sum `>=S` with `a[i]`)\n  This is not quite right because elements must be distinct.\n\nCorrect two-pointer for `count_ge(S)`:\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\n`count = 0`\n`j = 0` (pointer for `b`)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`):\n  While `j < n` and `a[i] + b[j] < S`:\n    `j++`\n  If `j < n`:\n    `count += (n - j)` (all `b` from `j` to `n-1` can form a sum `>=S` with `a[i]`)\n  Else:\n    Break (no more `b` can form a sum `>=S` with `a[i]`)\nThis also counts `(a_i, b_j)` for all `j >= j_0`. But we need distinct `j`s.\nThis is a maximum matching problem.\nThe standard way to count maximum `k` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` where `a_i + b_j >= S` is:\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` descending.\n`count = 0`\n`j = 0` (pointer for `b_desc`)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a_asc`):\n  While `j < n` and `a_asc[i] + b_desc[j] < S`:\n    `j++`\n  If `j < n`:\n    `count++`\n    `j++`\n  Else:\n    Break\nThis counts the maximum number of pairs whose sum is at least `S`. No, this is wrong. This counts pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= S` where `a_i` is from `a_asc` and `b_j` is from `b_desc`. It's not guaranteed to be the max number of pairs.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a permutation `p` of `(0, ..., n-1)` such that `sum(a_i + b_{p_i})` is maximized/minimized in some way.\nThe actual problem is about maximizing/minimizing Vasya's rank.\n\nLet's re-read the example for the worst case:\nInput:\n6 7\n4 3 5 6 4 4\n8 6 0 4 3 4\nOutput: 1 5\n\nWorst case explanation: \"Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\"\nVasya's score: 4 + 3 = 7.\nOther scores:\n4+8 = 12\n4+6 = 10\n6+4 = 10\n5+4 = 9\n3+0 = 3\nScores in descending order: 12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3.\nVasya's score is 7.\nScores strictly greater than 7: 12, 10, 10, 9 (4 participants).\nScores equal to 7: None.\nSo, 4 participants are strictly better. Vasya is 5th.\nThis specific pairing for other participants used:\n(4 from `a`, 8 from `b`)\n(4 from `a`, 6 from `b`)\n(6 from `a`, 4 from `b`)\n(5 from `a`, 4 from `b`)\n(3 from `a`, 0 from `b`)\nVasya: (4 from `a`, 3 from `b`)\nOriginal `a`: [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]\nOriginal `b`: [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]\nNotice that the scores (4,3) for Vasya are present in the input.\nThe pairing for others used `a`: [4,4,6,5,3] and `b`: [8,6,4,4,0]. These are the remaining scores.\nThis implies for the worst case, we must choose `a_i` and `b_j` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. And then for the remaining `n-1` `a` scores and `n-1` `b` scores, we pair them up to maximize the count of participants scoring `> a_i + b_j`.\n\nLet `a_sorted` be `a` sorted ascendingly.\nLet `b_sorted` be `b` sorted ascendingly.\n\nThe maximum number of participants who can score `> S_V` from the remaining `n-1` `a`'s and `n-1` `b`'s.\nThis is a standard problem: given two sorted arrays, `A` and `B`, find the maximum number of pairs `(A_i, B_j)` such that `A_i + B_j > K`.\nThis can be solved efficiently.\nSort `A` ascendingly. Sort `B` descendingly.\nUse two pointers: `ptr_A = 0`, `ptr_B = 0`.\n`count = 0`\nWhile `ptr_A < len(A)` and `ptr_B < len(B)`:\n  If `A[ptr_A] + B[ptr_B] > K`:\n    `count++`\n    `ptr_A++`\n    `ptr_B++`\n  Else:\n    `ptr_A++` (try to find a larger `A` to sum with `B[ptr_B]`)\nThis is the correct greedy algorithm for this specific problem (maximum number of pairs `A_i + B_j > K` using each element at most once).\n\nSo, the overall algorithm for the worst case:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Initialize `worst_rank = 0`.\n4. We will iterate through all possible `a_i` Vasya could have. For each `a_i`, we find the smallest `b_k` such that `a_i + b_k >= x`. This forms Vasya's score `S_V = a_i + b_k`. Then we count how many people can score `> S_V`.\n   This is still `N` iterations, and inside each iteration, creating `a_prime` and `b_prime` and sorting/two-pointer is `O(N log N)` or `O(N)`. Total `O(N^2)` which is too slow.\n\nThe crucial constraint is that `a_i` and `b_j` are from the original lists.\nThe worst rank for Vasya is `1 + (max_count_strictly_better) + (max_count_equal_and_jury_against_Vasya)`.\nTo maximize this, we need to choose Vasya's `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, and the number of other participants who can achieve a sum `> a_i + b_j` is maximized.\n\nLet's use the two-pointer approach on the full `a` and `b` arrays to count.\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\nFor a given `S_V`, how many pairs `(a_i, b_j)` can sum to `> S_V`?\nLet `count_strictly_greater(S_V)` be this count.\n`a_ptr = 0`\n`b_ptr = n - 1`\n`count = 0`\nWhile `a_ptr < n` and `b_ptr >= 0`:\n  If `a[a_ptr] + b[b_ptr] > S_V`:\n    `count++`\n    `a_ptr++`\n    `b_ptr--`\n  Else:\n    `a_ptr++`\nThis counts the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` (using distinct `i,j` for each pair) that sum to `> S_V`.\n\nNow, how do we find `S_V` and the corresponding `a_i, b_j` for Vasya?\nThe key insight might be that we don't need to specify *which* `a_i` and `b_j` Vasya takes.\nInstead, we are looking for a *threshold* score `S_V` such that `S_V >= x`.\nWe want to maximize `count_strictly_greater(S_V) + count_equal(S_V)`.\nThe `count_equal(S_V)` part needs careful handling with the jury decision. If `count_strictly_greater(S_V)` is `K`, then Vasya is at least `K+1`-th. If there are `M` people with score `S_V`, then Vasya can be `K+1`-th (if jury favors him) or `K+M`-th (if jury puts him last among those with `S_V`). So we need to maximize `K+M`.\n\nLet `a` be sorted ascending. Let `b` be sorted ascending.\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of people who can score `S_target` or more, where `S_target` is Vasya's score.\nLet's consider all possible sums `a_i + b_j`. There are `N^2` such sums.\nWe are looking for a sum `S_V = a_i + b_j` such that `S_V >= x`.\nFor each such `S_V`, we want to find the maximum `k` such that `k` other participants can score `> S_V`.\nThis is exactly `count_strictly_greater(S_V)` using the two-pointer method described above.\nThe trick is that when we calculate `count_strictly_greater(S_V)`, the `a_i` and `b_j` that Vasya took are not available for others.\nThis makes it complicated.\n\nWhat if we count for each `a_i` what is the minimum `b_j` for Vasya to satisfy `a_i + b_j >= x`?\nThis means for each `a_i`, Vasya's score is `a_i + b[k]` where `k = bisect_left(b, x - a_i)`.\nLet `a` be sorted ascendingly.\nLet `b` be sorted ascendingly.\nWe can compute `current_a_idx = 0` and `current_b_idx = n-1`.\nWe want to find the number of pairs that sum to at least `x`.\nThis is not for Vasya's score, but for the other participants.\n\nLet's consider the problem from the perspective of how many participants can score *at least* `S`.\nLet `count_ge(S)` be the maximum number of participants who can score `S` or more.\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\n`count = 0`\n`j = n-1` (pointer for `b`)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`):\n  While `j >= 0` and `a[i] + b[j] >= S`:\n    `j--`\n  `count += (n - 1 - j)`\nThis `count` is the number of pairs `(a_i, b_k)` where `k > j` such that `a_i + b_k >= S`. This is not the max number of *distinct* pairs.\n\nThe problem is a variation of \"maximum number of pairs with sum >= K\".\nLet `a` be sorted ascendingly.\nLet `b` be sorted ascendingly.\nWe are looking for the maximum `k` such that `k` participants can score strictly more than Vasya.\nLet's consider the `i`-th element of `a` and the `j`-th element of `b`.\nIf Vasya takes `a_i` and `b_j` where `a_i + b_j >= x`, his score is `S_V = a_i + b_j`.\nWe need to calculate `count_strictly_greater(S_V)` using the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b`.\nThis can be optimized.\nThe maximum number of people who can score `> S_V` can be found by a two-pointer approach after removing `a_i` and `b_j`.\nLet `a_rem` be `a` without `a_i` and `b_rem` be `b` without `b_j`.\nSort `a_rem` ascending, `b_rem` descending.\nUse two pointers to count max pairs `(x,y)` s.t. `x+y > S_V`. This is `O(N)` for each `(a_i, b_j)` Vasya takes.\nTotal `O(N^3)` if we iterate all `N^2` pairs for Vasya. Still too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation must be that we don't need to try all `N^2` pairs for Vasya.\nWhat if we iterate `a_i` for Vasya? For each `a_i`, Vasya's `b_j` must be `b[k_idx]` where `k_idx = bisect_left(b, x - a_i)`. If `k_idx` is out of bounds, this `a_i` is not possible.\nSo Vasya's possible scores are `a[i] + b[bisect_left(b, x - a[i])]` for valid `i`.\nLet `S_V_i = a[i] + b[k_idx_i]`.\nWe want to maximize `1 + count_strictly_greater(S_V_i) + count_equal(S_V_i)`.\nThe `count_strictly_greater` needs to be calculated on `a` without `a[i]` and `b` without `b[k_idx_i]`.\n\nThis structure suggests a specific type of problem.\nLet `a_asc` be `a` sorted ascendingly.\nLet `b_asc` be `b` sorted ascendingly.\nLet `b_desc` be `b` sorted descendingly.\n\nFor each `a_i` in `a_asc`:\n  1. Find `k_idx = bisect_left(b_asc, x - a_asc[i])`.\n  2. If `k_idx >= n`, continue.\n  3. Vasya's score `S_V = a_asc[i] + b_asc[k_idx]`.\n  4. Now we need to count how many pairs `(a_p, b_q)` from the remaining `n-1` `a`s and `n-1` `b`s sum to `> S_V`.\n     This can be done in `O(N)` using the two-pointer technique.\n     Create `a_temp = a_asc[:i] + a_asc[i+1:]`.\n     Create `b_temp = b_desc[:k_idx] + b_desc[k_idx+1:]` (this `b_desc` is `b_asc` reversed, so `b_asc[k_idx]` corresponds to `b_desc[n-1-k_idx]`).\n     This is still `O(N^2)`.\n\nThe key is that for a fixed `S_V`, we can efficiently count `count_strictly_greater(S_V)` and `count_equal(S_V)` using two pointers.\nLet `a` be sorted ascending, `b` be sorted ascending.\nTo count `count_strictly_greater(S_V)`:\n  `p1 = 0` (for `a`), `p2 = n-1` (for `b`)\n  `count = 0`\n  While `p1 < n` and `p2 >= 0`:\n    If `a[p1] + b[p2] > S_V`:\n      `count++`\n      `p1++`\n      `p2--`\n    Else:\n      `p1++`\n  Return `count`.\n\nTo count `count_equal(S_V)`:\n  This is harder with distinct elements.\n  We want to find `k` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j = S_V`.\n  This is also a two-pointer approach.\n  `p1 = 0`, `p2 = n-1`\n  `count = 0`\n  While `p1 < n` and `p2 >= 0`:\n    If `a[p1] + b[p2] == S_V`:\n      `count++`\n      `p1++`\n      `p2--`\n    Else if `a[p1] + b[p2] < S_V`:\n      `p1++`\n    Else: // `a[p1] + b[p2] > S_V`\n      `p2--`\n  Return `count`.\n\nThe `count_strictly_greater` and `count_equal` functions above are for the *entire* `n` participants.\nIf Vasya takes one `a_i` and one `b_j`, these `a_i` and `b_j` are not available for others.\nThe issue is that removing `a_i` and `b_j` changes the arrays.\n\nLet's use a standard technique for \"remove one element\" problems:\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\nIterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This `a[i]` is Vasya's score.\nFind `k = bisect_left(b, x - a[i])`. This `b[k]` is Vasya's score.\nIf `k >= n`, this `a[i]` cannot be Vasya's score.\nVasya's score is `S_V = a[i] + b[k]`.\nWe need to count how many `p` participants can score `> S_V`.\nThis is `p = count_strictly_greater_excluding(S_V, i, k)`.\nAnd `q = count_equal_excluding(S_V, i, k)`.\nVasya's rank is `p + q + 1`. We need to maximize this.\n\nThe `count_strictly_greater_excluding(S_V, i, k)` function:\n  `a_temp = a[:i] + a[i+1:]`\n  `b_temp = b[:k] + b[k+1:]`\n  Then apply the two-pointer `count_strictly_greater` on `a_temp` and `b_temp`.\nThis is `O(N)` for each `i`, leading to `O(N^2)`.\n\nWhat if we use `a` and `b` as they are, and then subtract 1 from `count_strictly_greater` or `count_equal` if Vasya's pair was counted?\nThis is not correct, because removing elements changes the relative positions and thus the pairings.\n\nConsider the possible values for Vasya's score `S_V`. They are `a_i + b_j` for `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThe number of participants who score `> S_V` is a non-increasing function of `S_V`.\nThe number of participants who score `= S_V` is also non-increasing for `S_V` (if we count total pairs).\n\nLet's use the two-pointer approach again for the worst case.\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\n`worst_rank = 0`\n`j = n-1` (pointer for `b`)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`):\n  While `j >= 0` and `a[i] + b[j] >= x`:\n    `j--`\n  // At this point, `a[i] + b[j+1]` is the smallest possible score Vasya can get with `a[i]` that is `>= x`.\n  // If `j+1 == n`, then `a[i]` cannot be Vasya's score.\n  // Vasya's score is `S_V = a[i] + b[j+1]`.\n  // The number of people who can score `> S_V` is `count_strictly_greater(S_V)` on the full arrays.\n  // The number of people who can score `= S_V` is `count_equal(S_V)` on the full arrays.\n  // This is still not quite right because Vasya's scores are removed.\n\nLet's use the actual solution strategy for problems like this.\nFor the worst case, we want to maximize the number of people who beat Vasya.\nSort `a` in ascending order.\nSort `b` in descending order.\n`a_asc = [a_0, ..., a_{n-1}]`\n`b_desc = [b_0, ..., b_{n-1}]`\n\nWe want to find a pair `(a_i, b_j)` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, and the remaining `n-1` `a`'s and `n-1` `b`'s can be paired to maximize the number of people scoring `> a_i + b_j`.\nThis is a greedy choice problem.\nConsider the `k`-th largest possible sum for other participants.\nThe maximum number of participants who can score `> S_V` is achieved by pairing `a_asc` with `b_desc`.\nLet `L_i = a_asc[i] + b_desc[i]` for `i = 0, ..., n-1`.\nThese `L_i` are the sums from one specific pairing.\nThis is called the \"rearrangement inequality\". If `a` is sorted ascending and `b` is sorted descending, then `sum(a_i * b_i)` is minimized. If both are sorted ascending (or both descending), `sum(a_i * b_i)` is maximized.\nFor sums `a_i + b_j`, the situation is different.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's score `S_V`.\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` from the remaining `n-1` `a`'s and `n-1` `b`'s such that `a_p + b_q > S_V`.\nThis is exactly the two-pointer problem on the remaining arrays.\n`a_prime` (sorted asc), `b_prime` (sorted desc).\n`ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n`count_better = 0`.\nWhile `ptr_a < n-1` and `ptr_b < n-1`:\n  If `a_prime[ptr_a] + b_prime[ptr_b] > S_V`:\n    `count_better++`\n    `ptr_a++`\n    `ptr_b++`\n  Else:\n    `ptr_a++`\n\nThe issue is that `a_prime` and `b_prime` depend on Vasya's choice.\nThe only way to make this `O(N log N)` or `O(N log^2 N)` is if we don't explicitly construct `a_prime` and `b_prime`.\n\nConsider the maximum value of `k` such that `k` participants can score `> S_V`.\nThis `k` can be found in `O(N)` using the two-pointer method on sorted `a` and `b` (one ascending, one descending).\nLet `a_asc` be `a` sorted ascendingly.\nLet `b_desc` be `b` sorted descendingly.\n`count_greater(S_V)`:\n  `p_a = 0`, `p_b = 0`, `count = 0`\n  While `p_a < n` and `p_b < n`:\n    If `a_asc[p_a] + b_desc[p_b] > S_V`:\n      `count++`\n      `p_a++`\n      `p_b++`\n    Else:\n      `p_a++`\n  Return `count`.\n\nNow, we need to find Vasya's `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nAnd we need to maximize `1 + count_greater_for_others(S_V, a_i, b_j) + count_equal_for_others(S_V, a_i, b_j)`.\nThe `count_greater_for_others` and `count_equal_for_others` are functions of `S_V` and also the specific `a_i, b_j` removed.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved with a binary search on the answer (worst rank).\nSuppose we want to check if Vasya can get rank `R` (or worse).\nThis means we need to find `a_i, b_j` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, and there exist `R-1` other participants who score `S_other >= S_V`.\nTo make it `R` or worse, we need `R-1` participants to score `S_other > S_V`, or `R-1` participants to score `S_other >= S_V` and the jury places Vasya last among them.\nLet's just maximize the number of people who score strictly more than Vasya.\n\nLet `a` be sorted ascending. Let `b` be sorted ascending.\n`max_worst_rank = 0`\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1`: (Vasya takes `a[i]`)\n  `k_idx = bisect_left(b, x - a[i])`\n  If `k_idx >= n`: continue\n  `S_V = a[i] + b[k_idx]`\n  \n  Now we need to count how many people can score `> S_V` from the remaining `n-1` `a`'s and `n-1` `b`'s.\n  Create `a_rem = a[:i] + a[i+1:]`\n  Create `b_rem = b[:k_idx] + b[k_idx+1:]`\n  Sort `b_rem` descending.\n  `current_rank = 1`\n  `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 0`\n  While `ptr_a < n-1` and `ptr_b < n-1`:\n    If `a_rem[ptr_a] + b_rem[ptr_b] > S_V`:\n      `current_rank++`\n      `ptr_a++`\n      `ptr_b++`\n    Else:\n      `ptr_a++`\n  `max_worst_rank = max(max_worst_rank, current_rank)`\n\nThis is `O(N^2)` because of list slicing and sorting `b_rem` inside the loop.\nList slicing `a[:i] + a[i+1:]` is `O(N)`. Sorting `b_rem` is `O(N log N)`. So `O(N^2 log N)`.\nWe need to optimize `count_strictly_greater_excluding`.\n\nThe `count_strictly_greater_excluding(S_V, i_vasya, k_vasya)` can be computed in `O(N)` if we maintain the two pointers.\nLet `a` be sorted ascending. Let `b` be sorted ascending.\n`max_rank = 0`\nFor `i_vasya` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  `k_idx = bisect_left(b, x - a[i_vasya])`\n  If `k_idx >= n`: continue\n  `S_V = a[i_vasya] + b[k_idx]`\n\n  `current_rank = 1`\n  `p_a = 0`, `p_b = n-1`\n  `used_a_vasya = False`\n  `used_b_vasya = False`\n\n  While `p_a < n` and `p_b >= 0`:\n    `current_a = a[p_a]`\n    `current_b = b[p_b]`\n\n    If `p_a == i_vasya`:\n      `p_a++`\n      continue\n    If `p_b == k_idx`:\n      `p_b--`\n      continue\n\n    If `current_a + current_b > S_V`:\n      `current_rank++`\n      `p_a++`\n      `p_b--`\n    Else:\n      `p_a++`\n  `max_worst_rank = max(max_worst_rank, current_rank)`\n\nThis is `O(N^2)` as well. The `p_a` and `p_b` pointers iterate `N` times each, but they are reset for each `i_vasya`.\n\nThis problem is very similar to \"Maximum number of pairs with sum less than K\" or \"greater than K\".\nThe fact that Vasya's scores are removed is the main difficulty.\nA common trick for \"remove one element\" is to precompute prefix/suffix sums or similar structures.\nHere, we have pairs, so it's not simple prefix sums.\n\nWhat if we fix the `k` participants who score `> S_V`?\nThe `k` largest sums are formed by taking `a_0, ..., a_{k-1}` (from `a_asc`) and `b_0, ..., b_{k-1}` (from `b_desc`).\nNo, this is wrong. The two-pointer greedy approach is correct for finding the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j > S_V`.\n\nLet's use the two-pointer approach more cleverly.\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\n`worst_rank = 0`\n`k = n-1` (pointer for `b` for Vasya's score)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1`: (Vasya takes `a[i]`)\n  // `k` points to the smallest `b[k]` such that `a[i] + b[k] >= x`.\n  // As `i` increases, `a[i]` increases, so `x - a[i]` decreases. Thus `k` can only decrease or stay same.\n  // So `k` can be maintained for `a[i]` by decreasing it.\n  While `k >= 0` and `a[i] + b[k] >= x`:\n    `k--`\n  `k++` // `b[k]` is the smallest `b` such that `a[i] + b[k] >= x`.\n  If `k == n`: // All `b` values are too small for `a[i]` to reach `x`.\n    continue\n\n  `S_V = a[i] + b[k]`\n  \n  // Now, count how many pairs `(a_p, b_q)` from remaining elements sum to `> S_V`.\n  // This is the `O(N)` part.\n  `current_rank = 1`\n  `p_a = 0`, `p_b = n-1`\n  `used_a_vasya = False`\n  `used_b_vasya = False`\n\n  While `p_a < n` and `p_b >= 0`:\n    If `p_a == i`:\n      `p_a++`\n      continue\n    If `p_b == k`:\n      `p_b--`\n      continue\n    \n    // Now `a[p_a]` and `b[p_b]` are available for others.\n    If `a[p_a] + b[p_b] > S_V`:\n      `current_rank++`\n      `p_a++`\n      `p_b--`\n    Else: // `a[p_a] + b[p_b] <= S_V`\n      `p_a++` // `a[p_a]` is too small, try a larger `a`.\n  `worst_rank = max(worst_rank, current_rank)`\n\nThis is `O(N^2)`. The `k` pointer for `b` moves `O(N)` times total. The outer loop is `N` times. Inside the loop, `p_a` and `p_b` pointers are reset and iterate `O(N)` times. So `N * N = N^2`.\n\nThis must be solvable in `N log N`.\nThe problem states: \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\"\nFor the worst rank, if Vasya scores `S_V`, and `K` people score `> S_V`, and `M` people score `= S_V`, then Vasya's rank is `K + M + 1`. This is because the jury can place him last among those with `S_V`.\n\nSo we need to maximize `K + M + 1`.\n`K`: max pairs `(a_p, b_q)` with `a_p + b_q > S_V` (excluding Vasya's scores).\n`M`: max pairs `(a_p, b_q)` with `a_p + b_q = S_V` (excluding Vasya's scores).\n\nThis is a bipartite matching problem if we want to be exact.\nBut it's competitive programming, there must be a greedy solution.\n\nThe problem \"count pairs with sum greater than K, excluding two given indices\" is the core.\nLet's consider the sums `a_i + b_j`.\nThere are `N^2` possible sums.\nThe values of `a_i` and `b_j` are up to `10^5`. So sums are up to `2*10^5`.\nWe can use a frequency array or Fenwick tree if we iterate over sums.\n\nFinal attempt at `O(N log N)` for worst case:\n1. Sort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\n2. We need to iterate over possible Vasya scores `S_V = a[i] + b[k]` where `a[i] + b[k] >= x`.\n3. For each such `S_V`, we need to find the maximum `count_strictly_greater_or_equal(S_V, i, k)`.\n   This means we want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` from the remaining `n-1` `a`'s and `n-1` `b`'s such that `a_p + b_q >= S_V`.\n   This can be done using the two-pointer approach: `a_rem` (asc), `b_rem` (desc).\n   `p_a = 0`, `p_b = n-2` (for `n-1` elements).\n   `count = 0`\n   While `p_a < n-1` and `p_b >= 0`:\n     If `a_rem[p_a] + b_rem[p_b] >= S_V`:\n       `count++`\n       `p_a++`\n       `p_b--`\n     Else:\n       `p_a++`\n   Vasya's rank is `count + 1`.\n\nThe `O(N^2)` part is still there: `a_rem` and `b_rem` creation and sorting.\nWhat if we try to optimize the `count_strictly_greater_or_equal_excluding(S_V, i, k)`?\nLet `a_asc` and `b_asc` be sorted.\nLet `cnt(S)` be the function that returns the maximum number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` such that `a_p + b_q >= S`, *without excluding any elements*.\nThis `cnt(S)` can be computed in `O(N)` using the two-pointer method (`p_a=0, p_b=n-1`, `a_asc[p_a] + b_asc[p_b] >= S`).\n`cnt(S)` is monotonically non-increasing.\nWe can use binary search on `S_V` to find the optimal `S_V`.\nThe range of `S_V` is `[x, 2*10^5]`. Binary searching on `S_V` would mean checking `cnt(S_V)` for `log(2*10^5)` values.\nBut `cnt(S_V)` doesn't exclude `a_i, b_k`.\n\nThe problem is essentially asking: for each valid `(a_i, b_k)` pair for Vasya (where `a_i + b_k >= x`), calculate the rank.\nThe rank is `1 + (# of other pairs >= a_i + b_k)`.\nLet `a` be sorted ascending, `b` be sorted ascending.\nIterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n  Find `k = bisect_left(b, x - a[i])`.\n  If `k == n`, continue.\n  `S_V = a[i] + b[k]`.\n  We need to find maximum `count` of `(a_p, b_q)` from `a \\ {a_i}` and `b \\ {b_k}` such that `a_p + b_q >= S_V`.\n  This `count` can be computed in `O(N)` by building `a_rem` and `b_rem` and applying two pointers.\n\nThis approach *is* `O(N^2)`.\nIf `N=10^5`, `N^2` is `10^{10}`, which is too slow. `N log N` or `N log^2 N` is needed.\n`N log N` is `10^5 * 17` approx.\n\nLet's assume the problem setter expects `O(N^2)` for some reason, or there's a trick.\nThe problem constraint `N <= 10^5` strongly implies `N log N` or `N log^2 N`.\n\nWhat if we iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1` (for `a[i]`) and `j` from `0` to `n-1` (for `b[j]`)?\nThis is `N^2` pairs for Vasya. Still too slow.\nThe \"at least x points\" means Vasya's score is `S_V >= x`.\nThe worst rank is `max_{i,j: a_i+b_j >= x} (1 + count_pairs_ge_S_V_excluding(i, j))`.\nThis `count_pairs_ge_S_V_excluding(i, j)` is the part that needs to be `O(1)` or `O(log N)`.\n\nMaybe we can use a data structure.\nLet `a` be sorted ascending.\nFor each `a[i]`, Vasya's partner `b[k]` is found by `bisect_left(b, x - a[i])`.\nThe number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` with `p != i, q != k` such that `a_p + b_q >= S_V`.\nThis can be calculated by `count_ge(S_V)` (on full arrays) minus adjustments for `(a_i, b_k)` and other pairs involving `a_i` or `b_k`.\n`count_ge(S_V)` is `O(N)`.\n`count_ge(S_V)` on full arrays, using `a_asc` and `b_desc`:\n  `p_a = 0`, `p_b = 0`, `count = 0`\n  While `p_a < n` and `p_b < n`:\n    If `a_asc[p_a] + b_desc[p_b] >= S_V`:\n      `count++`\n      `p_a++`\n      `p_b++`\n    Else:\n      `p_a++`\n  This `count` is the max number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` from full `a`, `b` that sum to `>= S_V`.\n\nLet's use this `count_ge(S_V)` for the full arrays.\nThe actual number of pairs that sum `>= S_V` for others is `count_ge(S_V)`\n  - 1 (if Vasya's pair `(a_i, b_k)` was counted)\n  - `(count of pairs involving a_i with b_q where q != k and sum >= S_V)`\n  - `(count of pairs involving b_k with a_p where p != i and sum >= S_V)`\n\nThis is getting complex. There must be a simpler approach.\nWhat if `a` and `b` are sorted in the same direction?\n`a_asc = [a_0, ..., a_{n-1}]`\n`b_asc = [b_0, ..., b_{n-1}]`\n\nThe two-pointer approach for `count_ge(S)` with `a_asc` and `b_asc`:\n`p_a = 0`, `p_b = n-1`, `count = 0`\nWhile `p_a < n` and `p_b >= 0`:\n  If `a_asc[p_a] + b_asc[p_b] >= S`:\n    `count += (p_a + 1)` // This `b_asc[p_b]` can pair with `a_asc[0]` to `a_asc[p_a]`.\n    `p_b--`\n  Else:\n    `p_a++`\nThis counts number of pairs `(a_x, b_y)` such that `a_x + b_y >= S`. It does not enforce distinct `x,y` for multiple pairs.\nThis function `count_ge_pairs(S)` is not counting the maximum number of distinct pairs.\n\nThe maximum number of distinct pairs `(a_x, b_y)` with `a_x + b_y >= S` is found by sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending, then using two pointers.\nLet `a_sorted` be `a` ascending. Let `b_rev_sorted` be `b` descending.\n`count_pairs(S)`:\n  `p_a = 0`, `p_b = 0`, `count = 0`\n  While `p_a < n` and `p_b < n`:\n    If `a_sorted[p_a] + b_rev_sorted[p_b] >= S`:\n      `count++`\n      `p_a++`\n      `p_b++`\n    Else:\n      `p_a++`\n  Return `count`.\n\nThis `count_pairs(S)` is what we need. It's `O(N)`.\nNow, for Vasya's worst rank:\nIterate `i` from `0` to `n-1` (Vasya's `a` score).\n  Find `k = bisect_left(b_sorted, x - a_sorted[i])`. (using `b_sorted` ascending).\n  If `k == n`, continue.\n  `S_V = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[k]`.\n  \n  Now we need to calculate `count_pairs_excluding(S_V, i, k)`.\n  This is `count_pairs(S_V)` (on full arrays) MINUS 1 if `(a_sorted[i], b_sorted[k])` was counted.\n  This is the tricky part. `a_sorted[i]` might be paired with `b_rev_sorted[j]` and `b_sorted[k]` might be paired with `a_sorted[p]`.\n  This is not simply subtracting 1.\n\nThe `count_pairs(S)` function actually counts the maximum number of pairs `(a_x, b_y)` such that `a_x + b_y >= S`.\nThe elements `a_x` are `a_sorted[0], a_sorted[1], ...` and `b_y` are `b_rev_sorted[0], b_rev_sorted[1], ...`.\nWhen we remove `a_sorted[i]` and `b_sorted[k]`, we need to re-run this.\nThe `b_sorted[k]` corresponds to `b_rev_sorted[n-1-k]`.\n\nLet's use the `count_pairs(S)` function.\n`a_sorted = sorted(a)`\n`b_sorted = sorted(b)`\n`b_rev_sorted = sorted(b, reverse=True)`\n\n`max_rank = 0`\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  // Vasya takes `a_sorted[i]`.\n  // Find smallest `b_sorted[k]` such that `a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[k] >= x`.\n  `k_idx = bisect_left(b_sorted, x - a_sorted[i])`\n  If `k_idx == n`:\n    continue\n  `S_V = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[k_idx]`\n\n  `current_count = 0`\n  `p_a = 0`, `p_b = 0`\n  `a_idx_to_remove = i`\n  `b_idx_to_remove_in_b_rev_sorted = n - 1 - k_idx`\n\n  While `p_a < n` and `p_b < n`:\n    // Skip Vasya's scores\n    If `p_a == a_idx_to_remove`:\n      `p_a++`\n      continue\n    If `p_b == b_idx_to_remove_in_b_rev_sorted`:\n      `p_b++`\n      continue\n    \n    If `a_sorted[p_a] + b_rev_sorted[p_b] >= S_V`:\n      `current_count++`\n      `p_a++`\n      `p_b++`\n    Else:\n      `p_a++`\n  `max_rank = max(max_rank, current_count + 1)`\n\nThis is `O(N^2)`. The pointers `p_a, p_b` are reset for each `i`.\nThis must be the expected solution for `N` up to `2000-5000`. For `10^5`, it's too slow.\nThe only way this could pass is if `N` is much smaller in test cases, or the test cases are weak.\n\nLet's check the constraints again: `N <= 10^5`.\nThis implies `N log N` or `N log^2 N`.\nThe problem statement gives `N, X` up to `10^5`, `2*10^5` respectively. `a_i, b_i` up to `10^5`.\n\nThe `count_pairs(S)` function is monotonic.\n`f(S) = count_pairs(S)`\n`g(S) = count_pairs_excluding(S, i, k)`\n`h(S) = 1 + g(S)`\nWe need `max_{S_V} h(S_V)`.\nThe `S_V` values are `a[i] + b[k]`.\nThese are `N` candidate `S_V` values, if we fix `a[i]` and choose minimal `b[k]`.\nThis is still `N` candidate `S_V` values.\n\nThis problem is very similar to \"Maximum number of pairs with sum less than K\" from a contest (Codeforces Round #197 (Div. 2), Problem C).\nIt can be solved by iterating `i` and using a data structure (Fenwick tree or segment tree) on `b` values.\nSort `a` ascending.
