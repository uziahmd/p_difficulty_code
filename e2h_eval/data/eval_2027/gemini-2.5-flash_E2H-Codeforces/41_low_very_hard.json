There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem, and I need a Python solution. The core of it boils down to maximizing profit from house heights, given these annoying zoning restrictions. Let's break it down: I have `n` spots, each with a potential house height from 0 to `h`. The profit from a house of height `a` is simply `a^2`. The catch? We have `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction covers a range (`l_i` to `r_i`) and limits the tallest house within that range to a height of `x_i`. The goal is to maximize the total profit across all houses. The constraints, `n`, `h`, and `m`, are all up to 50, which is manageable.\n\nMy first thought is to model this. Let `heights[j]` represent the height of the house at spot `j`. The total profit is then the sum of the squares of each `heights[j]`. Now, I have two types of constraints for each house. First, the general one: the height has to be between 0 and `h`. Then, we have the zoning restrictions. For a restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, any house `j` within the range `l_i` to `r_i` can't exceed height `x_i`.\n\nThis means that for each spot, there's an effective maximum height, which is `h` initially, but potentially lower based on the restrictions. So, for each spot `j`, I need to find the `max_h_j` which is the minimum of `h` and all the `x_i` values where the restriction range includes spot `j`. I'll iterate through all the restrictions for each spot, calculating this `max_h_j`.\n\nSince the profit function, `a^2`, is monotonically increasing, my strategy becomes obvious. I just need to choose the *largest possible height* for each spot, independently. And importantly, a house's height doesn't affect other houses' maximum heights – the restrictions are purely on individual house values. This allows for a greedy approach: maximize each spot's profit independently and then sum.\n\nThe algorithm will be straightforward:\n1.  **Initialize:** Create an `allowed_max_height` array (using 1-based indexing for convenience) to store the maximum allowed height for each spot, all initialized to `h`.\n2.  **Process Restrictions:** Iterate through each zoning restriction. For each spot `j` within the restriction's range, update `allowed_max_height[j]` by taking the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height, `x_i`.\n3.  **Calculate Profit:** Initialize the total profit to 0. Then, for each spot `j`, the optimal height will be `allowed_max_height[j]`. Add `(allowed_max_height[j])^2` to the total profit.\n4.  **Output:** Print the total profit.\n\nWith the constraints being relatively small, this straightforward approach should be efficient enough. I believe this should be a clean and optimal solution. Let's code this up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot, we can build a house with an integer height `a` between `0` and `h`. The profit from a house of height `a` is `a^2`. We also have `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house in a given range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's denote the height of the house at spot `j` as `height[j]`. We want to maximize `sum(height[j]^2)` for `j` from `1` to `n`.\n\nFor each spot `j`, its height `height[j]` is subject to several constraints:\n1.  **General height limit**: `0 <= height[j] <= h`.\n2.  **Zoning restrictions**: For every restriction `i` (`l_i, r_i, x_i`), if spot `j` is within the range `[l_i, r_i]` (i.e., `l_i <= j <= r_i`), then `height[j]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, `height[j]` must be less than or equal to `h`, and also less than or equal to `x_i` for all restrictions `i` that cover spot `j`. This means that for each spot `j`, there's an effective maximum allowed height, let's call it `max_allowed_height[j]`. This `max_allowed_height[j]` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_i` values from restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` where `l_i <= j <= r_i`.\n\nSince the profit function `a^2` is monotonically increasing for `a >= 0`, to maximize `height[j]^2` for a given spot `j`, we should choose the largest possible `height[j]` that satisfies all constraints. This optimal height for spot `j` is exactly `max_allowed_height[j]`.\n\nFurthermore, the choice of height for one spot `j` does not affect the allowed heights or profits for any other spot `k`. The restrictions are \"point-wise\" in the sense that they only limit the height of individual houses within a range, not their relative heights or dependencies between spots. Therefore, we can maximize the profit for each spot independently.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize an array `max_allowed_height` of size `n+1` (using 1-based indexing for convenience). Set all elements to `h`, representing the initial maximum height without any specific restrictions.\n2.  Iterate through each of the `m` zoning restrictions: `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`.\n    For each restriction, iterate through all spots `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive).\n    For each such spot `j`, update `max_allowed_height[j] = min(max_allowed_height[j], x_i)`. This ensures that `height[j]` respects all applicable restrictions.\n3.  After processing all restrictions, `max_allowed_height[j]` will hold the absolute maximum height allowed for a house at spot `j`.\n4.  Calculate the total maximum profit: Initialize `total_profit = 0`. Iterate from spot `j = 1` to `n`. For each spot `j`, the optimal height is `max_allowed_height[j]`. Add `(max_allowed_height[j])^2` to `total_profit`.\n5.  Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `(1, 1, 1)`\n2. `(2, 2, 3)`\n3. `(3, 3, 2)`\n\n1.  Initialize `max_allowed_height = [0, 3, 3, 3]` (index 0 unused).\n\n2.  Process restrictions:\n    *   Restriction `(1, 1, 1)`:\n        *   For `j=1`: `max_allowed_height[1] = min(max_allowed_height[1], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n        `max_allowed_height` is now `[0, 1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction `(2, 2, 3)`:\n        *   For `j=2`: `max_allowed_height[2] = min(max_allowed_height[2], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n        `max_allowed_height` is still `[0, 1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction `(3, 3, 2)`:\n        *   For `j=3`: `max_allowed_height[3] = min(max_allowed_height[3], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n        `max_allowed_height` is now `[0, 1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3.  Final `max_allowed_height` values:\n    *   Spot 1: `1`\n    *   Spot 2: `3`\n    *   Spot 3: `2`\n\n4.  Calculate total profit:\n    `total_profit = (1^2) + (3^2) + (2^2)`\n    `total_profit = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Initializing `max_allowed_height`: O(`n`).\n    *   Processing `m` restrictions: For each restriction, we iterate `r_i - l_i + 1` spots. In the worst case, `r_i - l_i + 1` can be `n`. So, processing `m` restrictions takes O(`m * n`).\n    *   Calculating total profit: O(`n`).\n    *   Total time complexity: O(`n + m * n + n`) = O(`m * n`).\n    Given `n, m <= 50`, `m * n` is at most `50 * 50 = 2500`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits for competitive programming problems.\n\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   Storing `max_allowed_height`: O(`n`).\n    Given `n <= 50`, this is a very small amount of memory.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize max_allowed_height for each spot.\n    # Initially, each spot can have a house up to height 'h'.\n    # We use 1-based indexing for spots, so array size n+1.\n    max_allowed_height = [h] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Process each zoning restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Apply the restriction to all spots in the range [l, r]\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            # The actual maximum height for spot 'i' must be the minimum\n            # of its current allowed height and the restriction's x.\n            max_allowed_height[i] = min(max_allowed_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # For each spot, the optimal height is its max_allowed_height.\n        # Profit from this spot is height^2.\n        total_profit += max_allowed_height[i] ** 2\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
