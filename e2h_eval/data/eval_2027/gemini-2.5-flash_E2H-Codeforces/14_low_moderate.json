He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Factorial Zeroes Problem with Python**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where I need to find all positive integers `n` that have exactly `m` trailing zeroes in their factorial (`n!`).  The output needs to be the count of such `n` values and the values themselves, listed in increasing order.  Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to efficiently calculate the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.  It's all about prime factorization, and specifically, the number of factors of 5.  Since every 10 needs a 2 and a 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s, the number of 5s determines the number of trailing zeroes.  Legendre's formula comes to the rescue! I can use it to get the number of factors of 5 in `n!`:  `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\n\nNow, the crucial insight is understanding the behavior of this `Z(n)` function.  It's *non-decreasing* – it either stays the same or increases as `n` increases.  It *only* increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. I need to use this information. Furthermore, I realize that `Z(n)` increases by 1 when `n` is a multiple of 5, but not 25, by 2 when `n` is a multiple of 25 but not 125, and so on.  This is because multiples of 25, 125, etc., contribute more factors of 5.  `Z(n) - Z(n-1)` gives me the \"increment\" factor for the zeroes.\n\nThis pattern suggests that there will be ranges of 'n' that yield the same number of trailing zeroes.  Specifically, `Z(n)` will remain the same for numbers not divisible by 5.  When I hit multiples of 5, like 5, 10, 15, etc., the count jumps (at least by 1).   So, I can exploit this behavior in my algorithm. This makes solving for a given 'm' tractable. The key will be to efficiently search for the 'n's where `Z(n)` equals `m`. My Python script will need to incorporate this pattern to make the calculation efficient, avoiding costly brute-force factorials.\n",
