Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**The Quest for the Perfect Angle**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with finding three vertices on a regular polygon that form an angle closest to a target value. My first thought is to dive into the geometry of a regular n-gon and how angles relate to the circumcircle.  I know that inscribed angles are half the measure of their subtended central angles.  I'm thinking about how the number of edges between two vertices, essentially the \"arc length,\" dictates the central angle and, consequently, the inscribed angle.\n\nI'm starting to formalize things.  I'm labeling vertices, deciding that 0-indexing internally and converting to 1-indexing for output makes the most sense.  I've chosen to fix one vertex (let's call it vertex 1) as the vertex of the angle I'm measuring.  Then, I need to figure out which two other vertices to pick to minimize the angular difference.\n\nMy key insight is that the angle is directly proportional to the \"distance\" (number of edges) between the other two vertices.  I can express the angle as `k * (180 / n)`, where `k` is the number of edges along the arc that *doesn't* include the fixed vertex.  Now, the problem boils down to finding the integer value of `k` that makes `k * (180 / n)` closest to the target angle, `a`.\n\nI've defined a `target_k = (a * n) / 180`, which represents the ideal `k`. Now, I have to find the closest integer to this value, and I'm realizing that simply rounding could cause trouble. I need to clamp the rounded value (or a close candidate) to a valid range from 1 to `n-2`. I'm going to consider both `floor(target_k)` and `ceil(target_k)` as viable choices.\n\nThis gets a bit complex, and I'm going to consider some testing. It seems more intuitive to pick `floor(target_k)` and `ceil(target_k)`, clamp them and then select the one resulting in the closest angle.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about actually generating the vertices. I choose a fixed vertex and the first \"leg\" of the angle. I can then use `k` to calculate the position of the third vertex by measuring how many steps to skip from the first leg around the perimeter.  I make sure to account for wrapping around the polygon, and that my third vertex is truly distinct.\n\nI'm double-checking the indexing and making sure the vertices are distinct. Let's fix vertex `v2` to be `1`, and vertex `v1` to be `2`. Then the third vertex, `v3`, will be calculated using `k`. This ensures that they meet my constraints. After a check and some testing, I believe this method works! I need to ensure my output matches the expected format, however.\n\nI've finalized my algorithm.  I can now read in `n` and `a`, compute `k` by first calculating the `target_k`, clamping my chosen `k` and calculating the vertices. Then, printing the selected vertices should produce the correct output. I feel confident about my solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these three vertices, numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular N-gon**\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` with `v2` as the vertex of the angle is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nIn a regular `n`-gon, the `n` vertices divide the circumcircle into `n` equal arcs. Each arc between adjacent vertices measures `360 / n` degrees.\nLet `v2` be the vertex of the angle. The angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1v3` that does not contain `v2`.\nIf this arc `v1v3` spans `k` segments (i.e., `k` edges of the polygon), then the measure of the arc is `k * (360 / n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` will then be `(k * (360 / n)) / 2 = k * (180 / n)` degrees.\n\n**Possible Angle Values**\n\nThe number of segments `k` must be an integer. Since `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct vertices, `k` cannot be 0. Also, the arc `v1v3` cannot span all `n` segments (as it wouldn't be an arc *not* containing `v2`, or `v1` and `v3` would coincide). The maximum number of segments `k` can span is `n-2`. For example, if `v2` is vertex 1, `v1` is vertex 2, and `v3` is vertex `n`, then the arc `v1v3` (from 2 to `n` clockwise) spans `n-2` segments.\nSo, `k` can take any integer value from `1` to `n-2`.\n\nLet `base_angle = 180.0 / n`. The possible angles are `k * base_angle` for `k = 1, 2, ..., n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` such that `|k * base_angle - a|` is minimized.\nTo do this, we can find the `k` that would produce `a` if `k` could be a real number: `k = a / base_angle = (a * n) / 180.0`.\nLet's call this ideal `k` as `target_k_float`.\nThe integer `k` closest to `target_k_float` will minimize the absolute difference. We can find this by rounding `target_k_float` to the nearest integer.\nLet `k_rounded = round(target_k_float)`.\nSince `k` must be within `[1, n-2]`, we need to clamp `k_rounded` to this range:\n`k_final = max(1, min(n - 2, k_rounded))`.\n\nPython's `round()` function rounds to the nearest even number for values ending in `.5` (e.g., `round(2.5)` is 2, `round(3.5)` is 4). However, for this problem, if `target_k_float` is exactly `X.5`, both `X` and `X+1` would yield angles equally close to `a`. Any of these optimal `k` values is acceptable. Thus, `round()` is suitable.\n\n**Choosing Vertices**\n\nOnce we have the optimal `k_final`, we need to pick three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` that form this angle.\nA simple and consistent choice is:\n1. Let `v2` be vertex `1`.\n2. Let `v1` be vertex `2`.\n3. Then `v3` should be `k_final` steps away from `v1` along the perimeter in the clockwise direction, such that `v2` is not on the arc `v1v3`.\nThis means `v3` will be `(2 + k_final)`. We need to handle wrapping around `n` vertices.\nThe formula `(X - 1) % n + 1` converts a 1-indexed vertex `X` to its equivalent 1-indexed vertex after wrapping around `n`.\nSo, `v3` can be calculated as `(2 + k_final - 1) % n + 1`.\n\nLet's verify these choices for distinctness:\n- `v1 = 2`, `v2 = 1`. These are distinct.\n- `k_final` is in `[1, n-2]`.\n- `2 + k_final - 1` will be in `[2+1-1, 2+(n-2)-1] = [2, n-1]`.\n- So `v3 = (2 + k_final - 1) % n + 1` will evaluate to a value in `[3, n]`.\n- Therefore, `v3` will always be greater than `2`, ensuring it's distinct from `v1` (which is 2) and `v2` (which is 1).\nAll three vertices `v1=2, v2=1, v3=(2+k_final-1)%n+1` are guaranteed to be distinct.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description)**\n\n`n = 4, a = 67`\n1. `base_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`\n2. `target_k_float = 67 / 45.0 = 1.488...`\n3. `k_rounded = round(1.488...) = 1`\n   `k_final = max(1, min(4 - 2, 1)) = max(1, min(2, 1)) = max(1, 1) = 1`\n4. Vertices:\n   `v1_out = 2`\n   `v2_out = 1`\n   `v3_out = (2 + 1 - 1) % 4 + 1 = 2 % 4 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`\n5. Output: `2 1 3`. This matches the sample output.\n\n`n = 4, a = 68`\n1. `base_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`\n2. `target_k_float = 68 / 45.0 = 1.511...`\n3. `k_rounded = round(1.511...) = 2`\n   `k_final = max(1, min(4 - 2, 2)) = max(1, min(2, 2)) = max(1, 2) = 2`\n4. Vertices:\n   `v1_out = 2`\n   `v2_out = 1`\n   `v3_out = (2 + 2 - 1) % 4 + 1 = 3 % 4 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`\n5. Output: `2 1 4`. The sample output is `4 1 2`, which is equivalent (just `v1` and `v3` swapped).\n\nThis approach is efficient as it involves a constant number of arithmetic operations and is robust for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Calculate the base angle subtended by one side of the polygon at the circumcenter, divided by 2.\n    # This is the angle subtended by one side at any other vertex on the circumcircle.\n    # The general formula for an inscribed angle spanning k edges is k * (180/n).\n    base_angle_unit = 180.0 / n\n\n    # We want to find an integer k (number of edges spanned by the arc v1v3)\n    # such that k * base_angle_unit is as close as possible to 'a'.\n    # The possible values for k are from 1 to n-2.\n    # If k could be a float, it would be target_k_float = a / base_angle_unit.\n    target_k_float = a / base_angle_unit\n\n    # Round target_k_float to the nearest integer.\n    # Python's round() rounds to the nearest even number for .5 cases, which is acceptable here\n    # as any optimal solution is fine if multiple exist.\n    k_rounded = round(target_k_float)\n\n    # Clamp k_rounded to the valid range [1, n-2].\n    # k must be at least 1 (to form an angle) and at most n-2 (to leave space for v2).\n    k_final = int(max(1, min(n - 2, k_rounded)))\n\n    # Choose vertices:\n    # Let v2 be vertex 1.\n    # Let v1 be vertex 2.\n    # Then v3 should be k_final steps away from v1 (vertex 2) along the perimeter,\n    # in the direction that doesn't include v2 (vertex 1).\n    # Vertices are 1-indexed.\n    # v1_out is the first vertex in the output.\n    # v2_out is the second vertex in the output (the vertex of the angle).\n    # v3_out is the third vertex in the output.\n    \n    v1_out = 2\n    v2_out = 1\n    \n    # Calculate v3_out: it's (k_final) steps clockwise from v1_out (vertex 2).\n    # So it's 2 + k_final.
