    "thought": "**Algorithm for Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nI'm tackling the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string we can create given specific swap rules for the characters '0', '1', and '2'. The key is that '0's and '2's cannot swap positions directly, but '1's can freely move past both. This means the relative order of '0's and '2's is essentially fixed, forming an invariant subsequence within the final string.\n\nMy strategy is to first count the number of '1's in the input string. Then, I extract the subsequence composed only of '0's and '2's, preserving their original relative order. To construct the final string, I'll place the '1's after all the '0's that originally appeared *before* the first '2', within this subsequence. Essentially, the '1's act as a mobile \"block\" that can be positioned anywhere between these two groups of characters to achieve the lexicographically smallest possible outcome, because this strategy preserves the order of the unswappable '0's and '2's.\n\nI achieve this by building a list (initially empty) that I'll populate with the characters from the original string. I start by iterating through the original string, counting the '1's, and collecting the '0's and '2's in a separate list. Then, I find the index of the first '2' in this list. If no '2' is present, the final string is simply the collected '0's followed by all '1's. Otherwise, I build the final result by appending all the collected characters before that first '2', followed by the '1's, and finally the rest of the original characters that I did not consider at the beginning. This process ensures the algorithm runs in linear time.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable from a given ternary string (containing '0', '1', '2') using specific adjacent swaps: '0' with '1' and '1' with '2'. Swapping '0' with '2' is explicitly forbidden.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1.  **'0' and '1' can swap:** This means a '0' can move past a '1' (and vice versa).\n2.  **'1' and '2' can swap:** This means a '1' can move past a '2' (and vice versa).\n3.  **'0' and '2' cannot swap:** This is a critical constraint.\n\nConsider the implications of these rules:\n\n*   **Relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed:** If we have a '0' at some position and a '2' at another position in the original string, their relative order (which one appears first) will always be maintained in any string reachable through the allowed operations. This is because a '0' cannot directly swap with a '2', nor can they indirectly swap using a '1' as an intermediary. For example, in \"012\", '0' is before '2'. If we swap '0' and '1' to get \"102\", '0' is still before '2'. If we swap '1' and '2' to get \"021\", '0' is still before '2'. There's no sequence of allowed swaps that would turn \"0...2\" into \"2...0\".\n    Therefore, if we extract all '0's and '2's from the original string, their subsequence will remain unchanged in any reachable string. Let's call this subsequence `s_prime`.\n\n*   **'1's are highly mobile:** A '1' can swap with a '0' and it can swap with a '2'. This means a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or any '2'. Consequently, all '1's can be grouped together into a contiguous block.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as early as possible, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nGiven that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed (i.e., `s_prime` is an invariant subsequence), the '1's must be inserted into `s_prime`. Since all '1's can be grouped together, we need to find the optimal place to insert this block of '1's into `s_prime`.\n\nTo make the resulting string lexicographically smallest:\n1.  We want to put all '0's that can possibly be at the beginning of the string first. These are the '0's that appear before any '2' in `s_prime`.\n2.  Then, we should place all the '1's.\n3.  Finally, we place the rest of `s_prime`, which will start with the first '2' and include any '0's that originally appeared after that '2'.\n\nThis leads to the following algorithm:\n\n1.  Initialize `count_ones = 0`.\n2.  Create a list `s_prime_chars` to store all '0's and '2's from the input string `s`, maintaining their original relative order. Iterate through `s`: if a character is '1', increment `count_ones`; otherwise, append the character to `s_prime_chars`.\n3.  Find the index of the first '2' in `s_prime_chars`. Let this be `first_two_idx`.\n    *   **Case 1: No '2's in `s_prime_chars`** (`first_two_idx` remains -1). This means the original string `s` only contained '0's and '1's. Since '0's and '1's can swap freely, we can arrange all '0's first, followed by all '1's. The result will be `\"\".join(s_prime_chars)` (all '0's) followed by `'1' * count_ones`.\n    *   **Case 2: '2's exist in `s_prime_chars`** (`first_two_idx` is found). The optimal structure is:\n        *   All '0's that appear before the first '2' in `s_prime_chars` (i.e., `s_prime_chars[:first_two_idx]`).\n        *   All `count_ones` '1's.\n        *   The rest of `s_prime_chars`, starting from the first '2' (i.e., `s_prime_chars[first_two_idx:]`).\n        The result string is constructed by concatenating these three parts.\n\n**Example: `s = \"100210\"`**\n\n1.  `count_ones = 0`, `s_prime_chars = []`\n2.  Iterate `s`:\n    *   '1': `count_ones = 1`\n    *   '0': `s_prime_chars = ['0']`\n    *   '0': `s_prime_chars = ['0', '0']`\n    *   '2': `s_prime_chars = ['0', '0', '2']`\n    *   '1': `count_ones = 2`\n    *   '0': `s_prime_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n    After iteration: `count_ones = 2`, `s_prime_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`.\n3.  Find `first_two_idx` in `s_prime_chars`: `'2'` is at index 2. So `first_two_idx = 2`.\n4.  Construct the result:\n    *   `s_prime_chars[:2]` is `['0', '0']`.\n    *   `'1' * 2` is `['1', '1']`.\n    *   `s_prime_chars[2:]` is `['2', '0']`.\n    Concatenating these gives `['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`.\n    The final string is `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis approach ensures `O(N)` time complexity (where N is the length of the string) because we iterate through the string a constant number of times. Space complexity is `O(N)` for storing intermediate lists.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    # s_prime_chars will store '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\n    s_prime_chars = [] \n\n    # First pass: count '1's and build s_prime_chars\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_prime_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Find the index of the first '2' in s_prime_chars.\n    # This is where the block of '1's should be inserted.\n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_prime_chars)):\n        if s_prime_chars[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    result_chars = []\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # Case 1: No '2's in the string (only '0's and '1's).\n        # All '0's come first, then all '1's.\n        result_chars.extend(s_prime_chars) # These are all the '0's\n        result_chars.extend(['1'] * count_ones) # Append all '1's\n    else:\n        # Case 2: '2's exist.
