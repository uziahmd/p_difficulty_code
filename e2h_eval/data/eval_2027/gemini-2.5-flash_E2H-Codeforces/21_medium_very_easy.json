The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The Path to Maximizing Opened Chests**\n\nAlright, I'm facing a competitive programming challenge. I've got `n` chests and `m` keys. The aim is to open as many chests as possible. A key unlocks a chest if their sum is odd. This essentially means we need to match keys and chests of opposite parities – even with odd, odd with even. Each key and chest can be used only once.\n\nMy initial thought is to count even and odd chests and keys. Let's call them `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`.  To open an even chest, I need an odd key. The most such pairings would be limited by the smaller of `chests_even` and `keys_odd`. Similarly, for odd chests and even keys, the maximum pairings would be `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThese two types of pairings are independent, as they use different sets of chests and keys. Therefore, the total number of chests opened is the sum of these two maximums:  `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nI quickly verify this logic with an example. It checks out perfectly. The time complexity is O(n + m), which should be efficient enough, even with constraints up to `10^5`. I can process the input as I read it, avoiding the need to store large lists, reducing memory consumption.\n\nMy next step is to outline the implementation: Read `n` and `m`, count chest and key parities, and then calculate the result. No fancy algorithms are required, just simple arithmetic and comparisons. Edge cases, like scenarios with all even or all odd numbers, should be considered, but the logic should handle them correctly.\n\nFinally, I will optimize the code for competitive programming: Use `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` for fast input and output. The final code will be concise, focusing solely on the core calculation, as the problem doesn't demand explanations.\n",
