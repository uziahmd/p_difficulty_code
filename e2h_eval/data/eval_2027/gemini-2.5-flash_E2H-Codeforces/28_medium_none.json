String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Analysis of \"Vasily the Bear and Beautiful Strings\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to count valid strings, right?  They need a specific composition of zeros and ones, and then we have this funky binary operation that modifies them until they become a single character.  The challenge lies in understanding how this operation works and how it affects the final result.\n\nThe core of the operation, `op(a, b)`, feels like a binary negation of an OR operation.  If we have `00` we get `1`, otherwise `0`. This operation essentially sums the two last characters `mod 2`, but with an added complexity of the NOT operation. I initially attempted to analyze the parity of ones, but it didn't lead anywhere productive.\n\nThe crucial insight here is to look at the process as a nested binary addition with the rightmost elements. We can represent the final character `g` by computing a series of operations like `s_1 + (s_2 + (...))`. It’s tempting to directly apply XOR, but the operation is a little different.\n\nLet `R_i` denote the result of reducing the substring starting from index `i`. Then the character at position `i` modifies the result of what follows, the `R_{i+1}`. If we have any `1` in `s_2`, the final result is `0`.\n\nThe key is realizing that if you have a `1`, this 'sets' the rest to `0`. If we have a string with only zeros, we can analyze the parity of the length and then determine whether or not the resulting operation is `0` or `1`.\n\nIf the string is purely zeros (`m=0`), the final character is determined by the length (`n`). If `n` is even, we get `1`; if `n` is odd, we get `0`. However, if `m>0`, and the string includes at least one `1`, and then if `s_1 = 1`, then the final result is 0.\n\nIf `s_1=0`, we need to analyze what follows and if one of them is `1`, the operation will result in `0`.\n\nI need to formalize this connection between string composition and `g`. I'm starting to think about different cases: what happens when we have strings with one or more 1s, and what happens when they have all zeros. I need a more efficient way to count these strings based on the position of the 1s and the overall parity, keeping in mind the modulo operation and the problem's constraints. I suspect there's a neat combinatorial argument hidden in here somewhere...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings containing `n` zeros and `m` ones such that after repeatedly applying a specific modification operation, the string reduces to a single character `g`. The operation replaces the two last characters `a` and `b` with a new character `a + b`, where `0+0=1`, and `0+1=0`, `1+0=0`, `1+1=0`. This operation is equivalent to `NOT(a OR b)` if we interpret `0` as `False` and `1` as `True`.\n\nLet `S = s_1 s_2 ... s_k` be the string, where `k = n+m`. The modification operation is right-associative, meaning the final character is `s_1 + (s_2 + (... + (s_{k-1} + s_k)...))`. Let `f(s_i ... s_j)` denote the result of reducing the substring `s_i ... s_j`. Then `f(s_i ... s_j) = s_i` if `i=j`, and `f(s_i ... s_j) = s_i + f(s_{i+1} ... s_j)` if `i < j`. We are interested in `f(S)`.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the operation `a + b`:\n1.  `0 + 0 = 1`\n2.  `X + 1 = 0` for any `X` (i.e., `0+1=0`, `1+1=0`)\n\nLet `R_i = f(s_i ... s_k)` be the result of reducing the suffix starting at `s_i`.\n`R_k = s_k`\n`R_{i} = s_i + R_{i+1}` for `i < k`.\n\n**Case 1: `m = 0` (The string consists only of zeros)**\n`S = 00...0` (`n` times).\n`R_k = s_k = 0`.\n`R_{k-1} = s_{k-1} + R_k = 0 + 0 = 1`.\n`R_{k-2} = s_{k-2} + R_{k-1} = 0 + 1 = 0`.\n`R_{k-3} = s_{k-3} + R_{k-2} = 0 + 0 = 1`.\nThe sequence `R_k, R_{k-1}, R_{k-2}, ...` alternates `0, 1, 0, 1, ...`.\nSpecifically, `R_i = 1` if `k-i` is odd, and `R_i = 0` if `k-i` is even.\nWe want `R_1`. The index difference is `k-1 = n-1`.\nIf `n-1` is odd (i.e., `n` is even), then `R_1 = 1`.\nIf `n-1` is even (i.e., `n` is odd), then `R_1 = 0`.\n\nSo, if `m=0`:\n*   `f(S) = 0` if `n` is odd.\n*   `f(S) = 1` if `n` is even.\nThere is only `1` such string (all zeros).\n\n**Case 2: `m > 0` (The string contains at least one '1')**\nLet `p` be the largest index such that `s_p = 1`.

(i.e., `m=1`, and `s_1=1`).\nThen `S = 100...0`.\n`R_1 = s_1 + R_2 = 1 + R_2 = 0` (by property 2).\nSo if `s_1=1` and `m=1` (all other characters are `0`), then `f(S) = 0`.\nThis aligns with the general rule `1 - s_1` for `s_1=1`.\n\nCombining these observations for `m > 0`:\n*   If `s_1 = 1`: `f(S) = 0`.\n*   If `s_1 = 0`: `f(S) = 1`.\nThis rule holds as long as there is at least one `1` in the string (i.e., `m > 0`).\n\n**Summary of `f(S)`:**\n*   **If `m = 0`:**\n    *   `f(S) = 0` if `n` is odd.\n    *   `f(S) = 1` if `n` is even.\n*   **If `m > 0`:**\n    *   `f(S) = 0` if `s_1 = 1`.\n    *   `f(S) = 1` if `s_1 = 0`.\n\nNow we need to count strings that satisfy these conditions for a given `g`.\nThe total number of strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones is `C(n+m, n)` (or `C(n+m, m)`).\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\n**Case A: `g = 0`**\nWe need `f(S) = 0`.\n1.  **If `m = 0`**:\n    This means `n` must be odd.
