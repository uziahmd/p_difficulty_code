The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on the Neko Finds Grapes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Neko Finds Grapes,\" and I need a Python script to solve it.  Let's break down the problem and figure out the best approach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We have `n` chests and `m` keys.  A key `b_j` can only open a chest `a_i` if their sum is odd (`a_i + b_j` is odd). This translates directly to the parity of the numbers: one must be even and the other odd.  The problem is to maximize the number of opened chests, and I can only use a key once and open each chest only once.\n\nMy strategy needs to focus on this parity condition.  I'll categorize the chests and keys based on their parity: `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`. Then I can clearly see the optimal strategy: I pair even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. This is a classic matching problem in a way.\n\nThe maximum number of matches for each type of pairing is simply the minimum of the counts: `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` for even chests and odd keys, and `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` for odd chests and even keys. These matches are independent, so I can sum them to get the total number of opened chests.\n\nLet's look at the example. I see that after the categorization, I can perform the two types of matches, and the sum of the maximum matches in each case is the solution.\n\nTo implement this, I need to read the input: `n`, `m`, the lists `a` (chests), and `b` (keys). Then, I'll count the even and odd numbers in each list. Finally, I will compute and sum the minimums.  That should be it! A simple and efficient solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of chests Neko can open. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. This condition implies that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities (one must be even and the other odd).\n\nWe can categorize the chests and keys based on their parity:\n*   Let `chests_even` be the count of chests with even numbers.\n*   Let `chests_odd` be the count of chests with odd numbers.\n*   Let `keys_even` be the count of keys with even numbers.\n*   Let `keys_odd` be the count of keys with odd numbers.\n\nTo open a chest, we need to match it with a key of different parity:\n1.  An even-numbered chest (`a_i` is even) can only be opened by an odd-numbered key (`b_j` is odd).\n2.  An odd-numbered chest (`a_i` is odd) can only be opened by an even-numbered key (`b_j` is even).\n\nSince one key can open at most one chest and one chest can be opened at most once, we want to maximize the number of such pairings.\n\nThe maximum number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys is limited by the minimum of `chests_even` and `keys_odd`. So, this contribution is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys is limited by the minimum of `chests_odd` and `keys_even`. So, this contribution is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThese two types of pairings are independent because they use different sets of chests (even vs. odd) and different sets of keys (odd vs. even). Therefore, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of these two independent maximums:\n\n`max_opened_chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`, check its parity: if `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `chests_even`; otherwise, increment `chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`, check its parity: if `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `keys_even`; otherwise, increment `keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)` and print the result.\n\nThis approach is efficient as it only requires a single pass through the chest numbers and a single pass through the key numbers. The time complexity will be O(n + m), which is well within the limits for n, m <= 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # To open an even chest, we need an odd key.\n    # Max matches for even chests = min(number of even chests, number of odd keys)\n    matches_even_chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n    # To open an odd chest, we need an even key.\n    # Max matches for odd chests = min(number of odd chests, number of even keys)\n    matches_odd_chests = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n    # Total maximum chests opened is the sum of these independent matches.\n    print(matches_even_chests + matches_odd_chests)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
