Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Python Solution for Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my hands, and it's asking me to find two disjoint vouchers with a specific duration sum while minimizing the total cost. Initially, I thought about brute force, iterating through all pairs, but that's O(N^2), which is way too slow for the given constraints.\n\nAfter looking at the input constraints, I get the sense that I'll need a solution that's at most O(N log N) or O(N * max_coord), where max_coord is `2 * 10^5`. The spatial coordinates `l_i, r_i` seem to point towards some kind of sweep-line approach or data structures indexed by time.\n\nThe disjoint condition is the tricky part. It means the time intervals of the two vouchers can't overlap. I realized I can iterate through all possible durations to find a voucher and maintain the second one, so the first thought was an attempt at sorting or preprocessing the vouchers by duration. But it didn't solve the overlap issue elegantly.\n\nAfter some thought, a sweep-line algorithm emerged as the winner. I'll iterate through time points and, for each one, consider vouchers that are starting (the 'j' vouchers) and ending (the 'i' vouchers). I need to maintain an array `min_cost_for_duration`, indexed by the duration itself, to keep track of the minimum cost of any finished voucher of that duration. When I look at a voucher starting at a particular time, I can query my `min_cost_for_duration` for a suitable matching voucher, as the array contains vouchers that have ended before the start of the current one. And as I finish up with my current time step, I need to update this array with new \"finished\" vouchers.\n\nThis sweep-line approach ensures the disjoint condition is met because only vouchers that have ended before a start time become valid pairs.  The core idea is to cleverly pair vouchers for which the `min_cost_for_duration` data structure allows O(1) lookups and updates on each time point. The algorithm is O(N) because the for loop goes from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in the worst case. And the space complexity seems to be dominated by the lists of vouchers indexed by their start and end points and is also O(N). Let's implement it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct vouchers, `i` and `j`, that satisfy three conditions:\n1.  They must not intersect. This means either `r_i < l_j` (voucher `i` ends before `j` begins) or `r_j < l_i` (voucher `j` ends before `i` begins).\n2.  The sum of their durations must be exactly `x`. The duration of voucher `k` is `d_k = r_k - l_k + 1`. So, `d_i + d_j = x`.\n3.  Their total cost (`cost_i + cost_j`) must be minimized.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\n**Constraints Analysis:**\n*   `n, x <= 2 * 10^5`: This suggests a solution with complexity around O(N log N) or O(N + MAX_COORD), where `MAX_COORD` is the maximum possible `l_i` or `r_i` value.\n*   `l_i, r_i <= 2 * 10^5`: `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`. This indicates that an approach iterating through time points up to `MAX_COORD` might be feasible.\n*   `cost_i <= 10^9`: Costs can be large, so the sum can exceed standard 32-bit integer limits, but Python handles large integers automatically. We use `float('inf')` for initial minimum cost.\n\n**Algorithm - Sweep-Line Approach:**\n\nWe can solve this problem using a sweep-line algorithm. The idea is to iterate through time points from 1 to `MAX_COORD`. At each `time_point`, we consider two types of events:\n1.  Vouchers that *start* at `time_point`.\n2.  Vouchers that *end* at `time_point`.\n\nLet's maintain an array, `min_cost_for_duration`, where `min_cost_for_duration[d]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has *already ended* (i.e., its `r` value is less than the current `time_point`).\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   `MAX_COORD_VAL = 2 * 10^5` (the maximum possible `r_i` or `l_i`).\n    *   `min_total_cost = float('inf')` (stores the overall minimum cost found).\n    *   `starts_at`: A list of lists, `starts_at[t]` will store `(r, cost, duration)` for all vouchers that start at time `t`.\n    *   `ends_at`: A list of lists, `ends_at[t]` will store `(l, cost, duration)` for all vouchers that end at time `t`.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration`: An array of size `x + 1`, initialized with `float('inf')`. `min_cost_for_duration[d]` will store the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has finished by the current `time_point`. We only need to store durations up to `x`.\n\n2.  **Pre-processing Input:**\n    *   Read `n` and `x`.\n    *   For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`:\n        *   Calculate its `duration = r - l + 1`.\n        *   Add `(r, cost, duration)` to `starts_at[l]`.\n        *   Add `(l, cost, duration)` to `ends_at[r]`.\n\n3.  **Sweep Line:**\n    *   Iterate `time_point` from `1` to `MAX_COORD_VAL`:\n        *   **Phase 1: Process vouchers starting at `time_point` (as voucher `j`)**\n            For each voucher `(r_j, cost_j, d_j)` in `starts_at[time_point]`:\n                *   We are looking for a voucher `i` such that `r_i < l_j` (which is `r_i < time_point`) and `d_i = x - d_j`.\n                *   Let `needed_duration = x - d_j`.\n                *   If `1 <= needed_duration <= x` (ensuring it's a valid duration and within our `min_cost_for_duration` array bounds):\n                    *   If `min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration]` is not `float('inf')`, it means we have found a valid voucher `i` that ended before `time_point` with the `needed_duration`.\n                    *   Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration] + cost_j)`.\n\n        *   **Phase 2: Process vouchers ending at `time_point` (as voucher `i`)**\n            For each voucher `(l_i, cost_i, d_i)` in `ends_at[time_point]`:\n                *   These vouchers have just finished. They are now candidates to be the first part of a pair (`i`) for any future voucher `j` that starts *after* `time_point`.\n                *   If `1 <= d_i <= x`:\n                    *   Update `min_cost_for_duration[d_i] = min(min_cost_for_duration[d_i], cost_i)`.\n\n4.  **Result:**\n    *   After the loop finishes, if `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no valid pair was found, so print `-1`.\n    *   Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   Pre-processing: O(N + MAX_COORD_VAL) for initializing lists and populating them.\n*   Sweep-line loop: The loop runs `MAX_COORD_VAL` times.\n    *   Inside the loop, each voucher is processed exactly once in Phase 1 (when its `l_j` equals `time_point`) and exactly once in Phase 2 (when its `r_i` equals `time_point`).\n    *   Each operation inside the loop (accessing `min_cost_for_duration` or `min` operation) is O(1).\n    *   Therefore, the total time for the sweep-line part is O(N + MAX_COORD_VAL).\n*   Overall time complexity: O(N + MAX_COORD_VAL + x). Given `N, MAX_COORD_VAL, x <= 2 * 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n*   `starts_at` and `ends_at` lists: O(N + MAX_COORD_VAL) to store the voucher information.\n*   `min_cost_for_duration` array: O(x).\n*   Overall space complexity: O(N + MAX_COORD_VAL + x). This is also efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # MAX_COORD_VAL is the maximum possible value for l_i or r_i.\n    # Given constraints: 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 2 * 10^5\n    MAX_COORD_VAL = 2 * 10**5\n\n    # Group vouchers by their start time and end time.\n    # starts_at[t] stores a list of (r, cost, duration) for vouchers starting at time t.\n    # ends_at[t] stores a list of (l, cost, duration) for vouchers ending at time t.\n    # Array size: MAX_COORD_VAL + 1 to allow indexing up to MAX_COORD_VAL.\n    starts_at = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD_VAL + 1)]\n    ends_at = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD_VAL + 1)]\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        starts_at[l].append((r, cost, duration))\n        ends_at[r].append((l, cost, duration))\n\n    # min_cost_for_duration[d] stores the minimum cost of a voucher\n    # that has duration 'd' and has already finished (i.e., its r_i < current_time).\n    # We only care about durations up to x.\n    # Array size: x + 1 to allow indexing up to x.\n    min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)\n\n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # Iterate through time points from 1 to MAX_COORD_VAL.\n    for time_point in range(1, MAX_COORD_VAL + 1):\n        # Phase 1: For all vouchers 'j' that start at 'time_point',\n        # try to find a suitable preceding voucher 'i'.\n        # The condition for disjoint vouchers is r_i < l_j.\n        # Since l_j = time_point, we need r_i < time_point.\n        # The 'min_cost_for_duration' array already holds minimum costs for vouchers\n        # that ended *before* 'time_point'.\n        for r_j, cost_j, d_j in starts_at[time_point]:\n            needed_duration = x - d_j\n            # Check if needed_duration is positive and within the bounds of our array.\n            # A duration must be at least 1.\n            if 1 <= needed_duration <= x:\n                if min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration] != float('inf'):\n                    min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration] + cost_j)\n\n        # Phase 2: For all vouchers 'i' that end at 'time_point',\n        # update the 'min_cost_for_duration' array.\n        # These vouchers are now candidates for being the first part of a pair\n        # for any future voucher 'j' that starts *after* 'time_point'.\n        for l_i, cost_i, d_i in ends_at[time_point]:\n            # Only consider durations that could potentially sum up to x.\n            # A duration must be at least 1.\n            if 1 <= d_i <= x:\n                min_cost_for_duration[d_i] = min(min_cost_for_duration[d_i], cost_i)\n    \n    if min_total_cost == float('inf'):\n        sys.stdout.write(\"-1\\n\")\n    else:\n        sys.stdout.write(str(min_total_cost) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
