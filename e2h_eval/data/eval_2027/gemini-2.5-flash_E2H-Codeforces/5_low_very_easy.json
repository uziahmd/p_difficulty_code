Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Colored Boots\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the \"Colored Boots\" problem. Let me break down my thought process here.  First, the constraints are key -  *n* can be up to 150,000.  This immediately suggests I need an efficient solution, likely linear or near-linear in time.  A brute-force approach or something too complex is out of the question.\n\nThe problem involves maximizing compatible boot pairs based on some color rules: exact matches are best, then wildcards are good, and non-matching colors are a no-go.  This feels like a matching problem at its core, something along the lines of bipartite matching. But general matching algorithms might be too slow for these large inputs.\n\nA greedy approach seems promising. The compatibility rules are relatively straightforward, and matching the most restrictive elements first often leads to optimal solutions in these types of scenarios.  The key is to minimize the potential for wasted matches, like pairing a specific color with a wildcard when it could have matched a similar color.\n\nMy strategy will be as follows:\n\n1. **Prioritize Specific Matches:**  I'll start by matching boots with *identical* specific colors (e.g., 'a' to 'a', 'b' to 'b'). These are the most restrictive pairs, so matching them first guarantees the most optimal outcome. I'll maintain lists for each color (left and right boots) to facilitate this.  I'll iterate through the alphabet and match as many pairs as possible.\n\n2. **Wildcard Augmentation:** After matching all the specific color pairs, I'll deal with any remaining specific boots.  These have no direct color matches, so they must be paired with wildcards. Here, I'll check to match a boot with color `c` with a wildcard on the other side. This is where I'll use up my '?' boots that are left over.\n\nThis two-step approach is designed to be efficient. It prioritizes the highest-value matches (specific colors) first and then uses wildcards as necessary. This greedy strategy should produce the maximum number of compatible pairs and meet the time complexity requirements.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and list these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific, identical colors are compatible (e.g., 'f', 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any specific color (e.g., '?', 'z' or 'a', '?').\n3. Two indefinite colors are compatible ('?', '?').\n4. Two different specific colors are not compatible (e.g., 'f', 'g').\n\nA greedy strategy works best here. We prioritize matches that are more restrictive, as these boots have fewer potential partners.\n\nThe order of matching should be:\n1. **Specific color to specific color (exact match):** For each color `c` from 'a' to 'z', match as many `left_c` boots with `right_c` boots as possible. These are the most restrictive matches.\n2. **Remaining specific colors to wildcards:** After step 1, some specific-colored boots might remain. These can only be matched with '?' boots.\n   - Match remaining `left_c` boots with `right_?` boots.\n   - Match remaining `right_c` boots with `left_?` boots.\n   It doesn't matter which order we do these two sub-steps, or which specific color `c` we process first, as wildcards are compatible with any specific color.\n3. **Wildcard to wildcard:** Finally, match any remaining `left_?` boots with `right_?` boots.\n\nTo implement this efficiently, we can store the indices of boots for each color. A list of lists (or a dictionary of lists) is suitable, where `boot_indices[color]` contains the 1-based indices of boots of that color.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialize data structures:**\n    *   `left_indices[char]` and `right_indices[char]` will be lists to store the 1-based indices of left/right boots of a given color `char`.\n    *   `pairs` will be a list to store the resulting `(left_idx, right_idx)` pairs.\n\n2.  **Populate `left_indices` and `right_indices`:**\n    *   Iterate through the input strings `l` and `r` from index `0` to `n-1`.\n    *   For each `l_i`, add `i+1` to `left_indices[l_i]`.\n    *   For each `r_i`, add `i+1` to `right_indices[r_i]`.\n\n3.  **Match specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a'):**\n    *   Iterate through all characters `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    *   While both `left_indices[c]` and `right_indices[c]` are not empty:\n        *   Pop an index `left_idx` from `left_indices[c]`.\n        *   Pop an index `right_idx` from `right_indices[c]`.\n        *   Add `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `pairs`.\n\n4.  **Match remaining specific colors with wildcards:**\n    *   Iterate through all characters `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    *   While `left_indices[c]` is not empty AND `right_indices['?']` is not empty:\n        *   Pop an index `left_idx` from `left_indices[c]`.\n        *   Pop an index `right_idx` from `right_indices['?']`.\n        *   Add `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `pairs`.\n    *   While `right_indices[c]` is not empty AND `left_indices['?']` is not empty:\n        *   Pop an index `left_idx` from `left_indices['?']`.\n        *   Pop an index `right_idx` from `right_indices[c]`.\n        *   Add `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `pairs`.\n\n5.  **Match wildcards with wildcards:**\n    *   While both `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices['?']` are not empty:\n        *   Pop an index `left_idx` from `left_indices['?']`.\n        *   Pop an index `right_idx` from `right_indices['?']`.\n        *   Add `(left_idx, right_idx)` to `pairs`.\n\n6.  **Output:**\n    *   Print the total number of pairs (`len(pairs)`).\n    *   For each pair `(a, b)` in `pairs`, print `a b`.\n\nThis greedy strategy is optimal because:\n*   Matching exact specific colors first ensures that these restrictive boots are used efficiently. If an 'a' boot is matched with a '?' instead of another 'a', then that 'a' cannot be matched with another 'a', and the '?' could have been used for a specific color that had no exact match.\n*   Once exact specific matches are exhausted, specific-colored boots can only match wildcards. Matching them with '?' boots next is the only option to use them.\n*   Finally, any remaining '?' boots can only be matched with other '?' boots.\n\nBy prioritizing matches with fewer options, we ensure that we don't \"waste\" a more flexible boot ('?') on a match that a more restrictive boot (specific color) could have made, thereby maximizing the total number of pairs.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store indices for each color.
