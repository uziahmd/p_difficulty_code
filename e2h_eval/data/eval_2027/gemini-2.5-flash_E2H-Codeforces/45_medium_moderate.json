There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tennis Championship Problem - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. We've got `n` players, a knockout tournament, and this rule about the difference in games played between opponents needing to be at most one. The goal is to maximize the number of games the eventual winner gets to play.\n\nLet's break it down:  Let `k` be the maximum games the winner plays.  I need to figure out the smallest number of players needed to have a winner who has played `k` games, call that `P(k)`. Essentially, I'm trying to find the highest value of `k` for which `P(k)` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nNow, if the winner has played `k` games, they've beaten `k` opponents. Each match, the opponents need to fit that difference rule. So, when the winner is about to play their `i`-th game, their previous games is `i-1`. The opponent must have played either `i-2`, `i-1`, or `i` games.  We need to look into a case-by-case analysis. Considering the knockout tournament, an opponent should not have more wins than the current winner in a match.\n\nI'm thinking, is there a way to reuse the players. Like, minimize the number of unique participants. But in a knockout, that's not possible, since a player is knocked out after a loss.\n\nThinking about it more strategically, I'll define `f(k)` as the minimum number of players needed to get a winner to win `k` games. So, the winner, let's call them W, has `k-1` wins when playing to win the `k`-th match. Let's start with some base cases.  `f(0) = 1` which is like a player who hasn't played yet.   `f(1) = 2` that's the winner and one player they beat. Now, I will trace this sequence for `f`. For the k-th round, I have to figure out the minimum number of players I need, and that should be smaller than just putting the sum together.\n\nAlright, a dynamic programming approach seems fitting. Let's call it `dp[k]`. This `dp[k]` is the *minimum* number of players required for a winner to have played `k` games.\n\n*   `dp[0] = 1`. A single player with 0 wins.\n*   `dp[1] = 2`. The winner (0 games played) versus an opponent (0 games played). Total: 2 players.\n*   To get a winner with `k` games, I need to figure out what the last match looks like, specifically the last opponent the winner faces and the current winner has to beat that person.  The opponents have to follow the constraint, so they must have played either `k-1` or `k-2` games.\n*   So, a recursive relationship emerges.  To have a winner with `k` games, I need:\n    *   A player who has played `k-1` games (this needs `dp[k-1]` players).\n    *   An opponent who has played either `k-1` or `k-2` games (this needs either `dp[k-1]` or `dp[k-2]` players).\n    *   I want the *minimum* number of players, so `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`.\n\nThis now looks like the Fibonacci sequence. So, I will define a Fibonacci relation. This recurrence `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` with base cases `dp[0]=1` and `dp[1]=2`\n\nI need to calculate this `dp` array. I will loop starting from dp[2] up to the point where dp[k] exceeds n. So, the maximum games a player can play must be the `k-1` when this condition is met.\n\nThe implementation involves starting with an initial `dp` table. I'm going to iteratively calculate the numbers, then stop when the number is larger than `n`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule for pairing players. The rule states that two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games to continue.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games (and thus won `k` games). We want to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`.\n\nLet's establish the base cases for `dp[k]`:\n*   **`dp[0]`**: A player who hasn't played any games yet. This requires `1` player. So, `dp[0] = 1`.\n*   **`dp[1]`**: A winner plays 1 game. This requires two players (the eventual winner and one opponent). Both start with 0 games played. They play, one wins, one loses. The winner has played 1 game. This requires `2` players. So, `dp[1] = 2`.\n\nNow, let's derive the recurrence relation for `k >= 2`:\nSuppose a player `W` is the eventual winner and is about to play their `k`-th game. Before this game, `W` has already played (and won) `k-1` games.\nLet `O` be `W`'s opponent for this `k`-th game. `O` must also have won all their previous games.\nAccording to the rule, the number of games `W` has played (`k-1`) and the number of games `O` has played (`j`) must satisfy `| (k-1) - j | <= 1`.\nThis implies `k-1-1 <= j <= k-1+1`, so `k-2 <= j <= k`.\n\nHowever, `O` is eliminated by `W`. If `O` had played `k` games, it means `O` had won `k` games. But `W` has only won `k-1` games so far. It's not possible for `W` to eliminate an opponent who is \"ahead\" of `W` in terms of total wins. Thus, `O` cannot have played `k` games.\nSo, the number of games `O` has played (`j`) can only be `k-1` or `k-2`.\n\nTo minimize the total number of players `dp[k]`, we consider two scenarios for `W`'s `k`-th game:\n1.  **`W` (k-1 games) vs `O` (k-1 games)**: This scenario requires `dp[k-1]` players to produce `W` and another `dp[k-1]` players to produce `O`. Total players: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1]`.\n2.  **`W` (k-1 games) vs `O` (k-2 games)**: This scenario requires `dp[k-1]` players to produce `W` and `dp[k-2]` players to produce `O`. Total players: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`.\n\nSince `dp` values are always positive, `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` will always be less than `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1]`. Therefore, to minimize the total players needed, we choose the second scenario.\nThe recurrence relation is: `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is a Fibonacci-like sequence. Let's list the first few values:\n*   `dp[0] = 1`\n*   `dp[1] = 2`\n*   `dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`\n*   `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5`\n*   `dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5 + 3 = 8`\n*   ... and so on.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`.\n`n` can be up to `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will be relatively small (around 90 for `10^18`). We can iteratively calculate `dp[k]` values until they exceed `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the input `n`.\n2.  Handle the base case: If `n = 2`, the winner can only play 1 game (e.g., player 1 vs player 2). Print `1` and exit.\n3.  Initialize `dp_k_minus_2 = 1` (representing `dp[0]`) and `dp_k_minus_1 = 2` (representing `dp[1]`).\n4.  Initialize `max_games_winner_can_play = 1` (since `n >= 2`, at least 1 game is always possible).\n5.  Enter a loop to calculate `dp[k]` for `k=2, 3, ...`:\n    *   Calculate `dp_k = dp_k_minus_1 + dp_k_minus_2`.\n    *   If `dp_k > n`, it means we don't have enough players for this many games. The loop should terminate. The `max_games_winner_can_play` value from the previous iteration is the answer.\n    *   If `dp_k <= n`, it means `k` games are possible. Increment `max_games_winner_can_play` by 1.\n    *   Update `dp_k_minus_2 = dp_k_minus_1` and `dp_k_minus_1 = dp_k` for the next iteration.\n6.  Print `max_games_winner_can_play`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`n=10`):**\n1.  `n = 10`.\n2.  `n != 2`.\n3.  `dp_k_minus_2 = 1` (`dp[0]`)\n4.  `dp_k_minus_1 = 2` (`dp[1]`)\n5.  `max_games_winner_can_play = 1`\n6.  **Loop 1 (calculating `dp[2]`):**\n    *   `dp_k = dp_k_minus_1 + dp_k_minus_2 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    *   `3 <= 10` is true.\n    *   `max_games_winner_can_play = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   `dp_k_minus_2 = 2`.\n    *   `dp_k_minus_1 = 3`.\n7.  **Loop 2 (calculating `dp[3]`):**\n    *   `dp_k = dp_k_minus_1 + dp_k_minus_2 = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n    *   `5 <= 10` is true.\n    *   `max_games_winner_can_play = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    *   `dp_k_minus_2 = 3`.\n    *   `dp_k_minus_1 = 5`.\n8.  **Loop 3 (calculating `dp[4]`):**\n    *   `dp_k = dp_k_minus_1 + dp_k_minus_2 = 5 + 3 = 8`.\n    *   `8 <= 10` is true.\n    *   `max_games_winner_can_play = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n    *   `dp_k_minus_2 = 5`.\n    *   `dp_k_minus_1 = 8`.\n9.  **Loop 4 (calculating `dp[5]`):**\n    *   `dp_k = dp_k_minus_1 + dp_k_minus_2 = 8 + 5 = 13`.\n    *   `13 > 10` is true. Break loop.\n10. Print `max_games_winner_can_play = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example output.
