On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"A Twisty Movement\" problem.** I need to write a Python script to tackle this competitive programming challenge.  The core idea is simple: we're given a sequence of 1s and 2s, and we can reverse a portion of it. The goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) *after* the reversal.\n\n**Understanding the Constraints and LNDS Dynamics:** The sequence's length is manageable (up to 2000), and each element is either 1 or 2.  An LNDS in a sequence of just 1s and 2s will *always* look like a bunch of 1s followed by a bunch of 2s. So, to maximize the LNDS, we need as many 1s as we can get, followed by as many 2s as we can manage. The key is to find the best split point where we transition from 1s to 2s. The final LNDS length will be the sum of 1s before the split and 2s after it.\n\n**The Strategy:**  My plan is to iterate through *every* possible interval `[l, r]` (the part we'll reverse). For each interval:\n1.  **Reverse:** Create the *new* sequence (`b`) by reversing the selected interval.\n2.  **Calculate LNDS:** Figure out the LNDS for this new sequence.\n3.  **Update Max:** Keep track of the maximum LNDS found so far.\n\n**Efficient LNDS Calculation:**  Since we're only dealing with 1s and 2s, calculating the LNDS is fairly straightforward. I'll precompute:\n*   `prefix_ones[i]` = count of 1s from the start of the sequence to index `i-1`.\n*   `suffix_twos[i]` = count of 2s from index `i` to the end of the sequence.\nFor each possible split point (`k`), I can calculate `LNDS_k = prefix_ones[k] + suffix_twos[k]`. The *actual* LNDS for that `b` is then just the maximum of these `LNDS_k` values.\n\n**Initial Complexity Concerns:**  The naive approach (iterating through all `l, r` intervals and then calculating LNDS for each) would lead to an O(n^3) time complexity, which would be too slow. This won't work.\n\n**Optimization is Crucial!** We need to make this faster. The key insight is that we can precompute `prefix_ones` and `suffix_twos` which will allow us to calculate LNDS in O(n). To optimize, I realized that we don't have to rebuild and recompute the new LNDS every time. Instead, for a fixed `l` and `r`, we'll iterate through `k` the split point, to find the maximum `max(LNDS_k)`.\n\n**More Clarification and Final Approach:** After doing a lot of iterations, and simplifying. I realized that the core problem is figuring out the counts of 1s and 2s around our reversal. We have an O(n^2) loop where we iterate through all possible intervals. For a given l and r, and a given split point `k`, we calculate the counts of 1s and 2s before and after the split point for the new sequence. Since 1s and 2s are not swapped, only their position, calculating LNDS is simplified. The calculation and logic are explained in detail, in order to show my thinking and the key decisions. \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence after reversing a chosen subsegment `a[l...r]` of the original sequence `a`. The sequence elements `a_i` are restricted to be either 1 or 2.\n\n**Understanding the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) for 1s and 2s:**\n\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. This means all chosen 1s must appear before all chosen 2s in the final sequence.\nTo find the LNDS of a sequence `b` (which is `a` after reversal), we can iterate through all possible \"split points\" `k` (from `0` to `n`). A split point `k` means we consider all 1s from `b[0...k-1]` and all 2s from `b[k...n-1]`.\nThe length of the LNDS for a given split point `k` is `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`.\nThe overall LNDS length for sequence `b` is the maximum of these values over all possible `k`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Precompute Prefix Counts:** We can efficiently count 1s and 2s in any prefix of the original array `a`.\n    Let `prefix_ones[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\n    Let `prefix_twos[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`.\n    (Using 0-indexed arrays, `prefix_ones[0] = prefix_twos[0] = 0`).\n    These can be computed in `O(n)` time.\n\n2.  **Iterate Over All Reversal Intervals `[l, r]`:**\n    There are `O(n^2)` possible intervals `[l, r]`. For each `l` from `0` to `n-1` and `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n\n    a.  **Calculate LNDS for the modified sequence:**\n        For a fixed `l` and `r`, the new sequence `b` is formed by:\n        `a[0...l-1]` (unchanged prefix)\n        `reversed(a[l...r])` (the reversed segment)\n        `a[r+1...n-1]` (unchanged suffix)\n\n        We need to find `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count of 1s in b[0...k-1] + count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`.\n        Let's analyze `count_ones_b(0, k-1)` and `count_twos_b(k, n-1)` for different `k` values:\n\n        *   **Case 1: `k <= l` (split point before the reversed segment)**\n            `count_ones_b(0, k-1)` = `prefix_ones[k]`\n            `count_twos_b(k, n-1)` = `(prefix_twos[l] - prefix_twos[k])` (from `a[k...l-1]`)\n                                   `+ (prefix_twos[r+1] - prefix_twos[l])` (from `reversed(a[l...r])`, which is `a[l...r]` in terms of counts of 2s)\n                                   `+ (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1])` (from `a[r+1...n-1]`)\n                                   This simplifies to `prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k]`.\n            So, for `k <= l`, the length is `prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k])`.\n\n        *   **Case 2: `l < k <= r+1` (split point inside the reversed segment)**\n            `count_ones_b(0, k-1)` = `prefix_ones[l]` (from `a[0...l-1]`)\n                                   `+ (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l+r-k+1])` (from `reversed(a[l...k-1])`, which corresponds to `a[l+r-(k-1)...r]`)\n            `count_twos_b(k, n-1)` = `(prefix_twos[l+r-k+1] - prefix_twos[l])` (from `reversed(a[k...r])`, which corresponds to `a[l...l+r-k]`)\n                                   `+ (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1])` (from `a[r+1...n-1]`)\n            So, for `l < k <= r+1`, the length is `prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l+r-k+1]) + (prefix_twos[l+r-k+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1])`.\n\n        *   **Case 3: `k > r+1` (split point after the reversed segment)**\n            `count_ones_b(0, k-1)` = `prefix_ones[k]`\n            `count_twos_b(k, n-1)` = `prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k]`\n            So, for `k > r+1`, the length is `prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k])`.\n\n        Notice that Case 1 and Case 3 are identical in formula: `prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k])`. This is the LNDS of the original sequence `a` if the split point is outside `[l, r]`.\n\n        We can calculate `current_lnds_for_lr` by taking the maximum over all `k` using these formulas. This loop for `k` takes `O(n)` time.\n\n3.  **Overall Maximum:** Keep track of the maximum `current_lnds_for_lr` found across all `[l, r]` intervals.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n\n*   Precomputation: `O(n)`\n*   Outer loops for `l` and `r`: `O(n^2)` pairs.\n*   Inner loop for `k`: `O(n)` iterations.\n*   Total complexity: `O(n^2 * n) = O(n^3)`.\n    Given `n <= 2000`, `n^3` is `8 * 10^9`, which is too slow.\n\n**Optimization to O(N^2):**\n\nLet's fix `l`. We want to find the best `r` for this `l`.\nThe LNDS length for a fixed `l, r, k` is `ones_before_k + twos_after_k`.\nLet `fixed_part_ones_left = prefix_ones[l]`\nLet `fixed_part_twos_right = prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1]`\n\nFor `l < k <= r+1`:\n`LNDS_k = fixed_part_ones_left + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l+r-k+1]) + (prefix_twos[l+r-k+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + fixed_part_twos_right`\n\nLet `j = l+r-k+1`. As `k` goes from `l+1` to `r+1`, `j` goes from `r` down to `l`.\nSo, `LNDS_j = fixed_part_ones_left + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[j]) + (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_twos[l]) + fixed_part_twos_right`\n`LNDS_j = (prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] + prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1]) + (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`LNDS_j = (prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] + suffix_twos[r+1]) + (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`\n\nLet `val_j = prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j]`.\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`, we need to find `max_{l <= j <= r} (val_j)`.\nThis part can be computed efficiently.\nFor a fixed `l`, as `r` increases, the range `[l, r]` for `j` expands. We can maintain `max_val_j` in `O(1)` time.\n\nSo, the overall LNDS for a fixed `l, r` is:\n`max(max_{0 <= k <= l} (prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k])),`\n    `max_{l+1 <= k <= r+1} ( (prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1])) + (prefix_twos[l+r-k+1] - prefix_ones[l+r-k+1]) ),`\n    `max_{r+2 <= k <= n} (prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k])) )`\n\nLet `current_max_lnds_overall = 0`.\n`prefix_ones` and `prefix_twos` are 0-indexed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s\n    # prefix_ones[i] = count of 1s in a[0...i-1]\n    # prefix_twos[i] = count of 2s in a[0...i-1]\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i]\n        prefix_twos[i+1] = prefix_twos[i]\n        if a[i] == 1:\n            prefix_ones[i+1] += 1\n        else:\n            prefix_twos[i+1] += 1\n\n    # Initialize max_lnds with the LNDS of the original sequence\n    # This is equivalent to choosing l=0, r=-1 (empty reversal)\n    # or any l, r where the split point k is outside [l, r]\n    max_lnds = 0\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        # count 1s in a[0...k-1] + count 2s in a[k...n-1]\n        max_lnds = max(max_lnds, prefix_ones[k] + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k]))\n\n    # Iterate over all possible reversal intervals [l, r] (0-indexed)\n    for l in range(n):\n        # max_val_j = max(prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j]) for j in [l, r]\n        # This part will be updated as r increases for a fixed l\n        max_val_j_in_reversed_segment = -float('inf') \n\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Update max_val_j_in_reversed_segment for the current r\n            # j corresponds to the original index in a[l...r] that becomes the split point\n            # in the reversed segment.
