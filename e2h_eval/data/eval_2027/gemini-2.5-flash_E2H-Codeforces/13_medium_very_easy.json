For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Reflecting on the Triad Classifier**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with creating a Python script that can classify a musical triad as \"major,\" \"minor,\" or \"strange.\" The core of this problem lies in understanding the relationships between notes in terms of semitones and the definitions of major and minor triads.\n\nFirst, I'll need a way to map the notes (C, C#, D, etc.) to numerical values, probably using a dictionary where C is 0, C# is 1, and so on. This makes calculating semitone distances much easier.  The crucial part is figuring out how to handle the cyclical nature of notes – so that C to E is the same as E to the C above.  The formula `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12` will be key here.\n\nThe key insight is treating the triad as an unordered set of three notes. I *could* generate all possible permutations of the three notes, but it looks like I can simplify things by sorting the notes numerically first. That way, I only need to consider a few cyclic shifts of the intervals between the notes. This is a very elegant solution!\n\nI can calculate the three intervals between the notes after sorting them, and then check each combination to see if it matches the major or minor pattern. The problem guarantees an unambiguous answer, which makes this much simpler. If none of the patterns match, it's \"strange.\"\n\nThe detailed plan: map notes to numbers, sort, find intervals, and then check to see if those intervals match major or minor patterns.  This interval check seems efficient because I only need to check three possible orderings of the notes.  I'll need a loop or if-else statement to efficiently check each permutation. I can test my code easily using example triads and ensuring correct distance calculations.  The code will handle any musical triad with ease.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given three-note triad as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" based on the semitone distances between its notes.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1.  **Map Notes to Integers:** We first convert the musical notes into numerical values. Since there are 12 notes and they repeat cyclically, we can assign integers from 0 to 11.\n    *   C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F: 5, F#: 6, G: 7, G#: 8, A: 9, B: 10, H: 11.\n\n2.  **Calculate Semitone Distances:** The distance between two notes `n1` and `n2` (in semitones, moving upwards) can be calculated as `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. For example, C (0) to E (4) is `(4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4`. E (4) to C (0) is `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8`.\n\n3.  **Handle Unordered Triads:** A triad is an unordered set of three notes. To check its type, we need to consider all possible orderings of these notes as (X, Y, Z). A convenient way to do this is to:\n    *   Convert the three input notes to their integer representations.\n    *   Sort these three integer values: `s1, s2, s3`.\n    *   Calculate the three fundamental intervals between these notes on the 12-semitone circle:\n        *   `i1 = s2 - s1`\n        *   `i2 = s3 - s2`\n        *   `i3 = (s1 - s3 + 12) % 12` (this is the wrap-around interval from `s3` back to `s1` an octave higher)\n    *   The sum `i1 + i2 + i3` will always be 12.\n\n4.  **Check for Major/Minor Patterns:**\n    *   A **major triad** has an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance X-Y is 4 semitones and Y-Z is 3 semitones. This means the sequence of intervals is (4, 3, 5) (since 4+3+5 = 12).\n    *   A **minor triad** has an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance X-Y is 3 semitones and Y-Z is 4 semitones. This means the sequence of intervals is (3, 4, 5).\n\n    We iterate through the three cyclic permutations of the calculated intervals `[i1, i2, i3]` and check if any pair `(first_interval, second_interval)` matches `(4, 3)` for major or `(3, 4)` for minor.\n\n    *   Check `(i1, i2)`\n    *   Check `(i2, i3)`\n    *   Check `(i3, i1)`\n\n5.  **Output:** As soon as a match is found, we print \"major\" or \"minor\" and terminate. If no match is found after checking all permutations, the triad is \"strange\". The problem guarantees that the answer will be unambiguous.\n\n**Example: C E G**\n1.  Notes to integers: C=0, E=4, G=7.\n2.  Sorted integers: `[0, 4, 7]`.\n3.  Intervals:\n    *   `i1 = 4 - 0 = 4`\n    *   `i2 = 7 - 4 = 3`\n    *   `i3 = (0 - 7 + 12) % 12 = 5`\n    *   Intervals list: `[4, 3, 5]`\n4.  Check permutations:\n    *   `(4, 3)`: Matches major pattern. Output: \"major\".\n\n**Example: C# B F**\n1.  Notes to integers: C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n2.  Sorted integers: `[1, 5, 10]`.\n3.  Intervals:\n    *   `i1 = 5 - 1 = 4`\n    *   `i2 = 10 - 5 = 5`\n    *   `i3 = (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    *   Intervals list: `[4, 5, 3]`\n4.  Check permutations:\n    *   `(4, 5)`: No match.\n    *   `(5, 3)`: No match.\n    *   `(3, 4)`: Matches minor pattern. Output: \"minor\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    note_to_int = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Convert notes to integer values and sort them\n    notes_int = sorted([note_to_int[n] for n in notes_str])\n\n    # Calculate the three intervals between the sorted notes on the circle\n    # s1, s2, s3 are notes_int[0], notes_int[1], notes_int[2]\n    intervals = []\n    intervals.append(notes_int[1] - notes_int[0])\n    intervals.append(notes_int[2] - notes_int[1])\n    intervals.append((notes_int[0] - notes_int[2] + 12) % 12)\n\n    # Check all three cyclic permutations of intervals for major/minor patterns\n    for i in range(3):\n        first_interval = intervals[i]\n        second_interval = intervals[(i + 1) % 3]\n\n        if first_interval == 4 and second_interval == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if first_interval == 3 and second_interval == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    \n    # If no pattern matches, it's strange\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
