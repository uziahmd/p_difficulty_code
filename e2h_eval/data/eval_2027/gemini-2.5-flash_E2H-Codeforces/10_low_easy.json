Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Golorp Feeding Frenzy - My Plan of Attack**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to tackle this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem. My understanding is solid now. The core is all about finding the *lexicographically smallest* sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfy a Golorp's dietary needs, represented as a string. If no satisfying sequence exists, I need to output \"false.\" The \"lexicographically smallest\" part screams greedy or backtracking with early pruning. I'm leaning toward backtracking since the condition checks seem fairly complex.\n\nThe Golorp \"name\" has a distinct structure: `?(<expression>):-<condition1>,<condition2>,...,<conditionN>.` This seems to be the key to understanding the problem. Let's break this down:\n\n*   The `?(` and `):-` are just markers.\n*   The `<expression>` part *before* `):-` defines the variables. Each `_` in that expression *corresponds* to a variable. The number of `_` characters dictates the total number of variables needed.  The examples and problem statement clarity that the number of variables required is defined by the shape of the jaws, i.e. number of underscores, not by the operators in that first expression.\n*   The `<condition1>,<condition2>,...,<conditionN>.` part *after* `):-` are the constraints. These are a comma-separated list of conditions, ending with a period. Each condition involves variable expressions and comparison operators like `>` and `<`. It's all about how these conditions restrict the valid variable assignments.\n\nI'm thinking: The number of underscores gives me my *variables* and their order. I need to iterate through possible digit assignments (0-9) for each variable, keeping the lexicographical order in mind. I can apply backtracking with pruning: If I hit a partial assignment that immediately violates any condition, I need to backtrack. Since it's about *lexicographical* order, I should prioritize assigning smaller digits first. If the problem has a solution I should find it this way.\n\nSo, in summary: I need to parse the Golorp name, identify the variables (number of underscores), interpret the conditions, and then use backtracking (or possibly a greedy approach with constraint checks) to generate the lexicographically smallest satisfying digit sequence. If I exhaust all possibilities without finding a valid assignment, then I output \"false\". I'll be implementing this in Python! Let's get coding.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies a golorp's diet, defined by its name. If no such sequence exists, we output \"false\".\n\nThe golorp's name follows a specific structure: `?(<expression>):-<conditions>.`\n\n1.  **Variables:** The `<expression>` part (between `?(` and `):-`) contains one or more underscore characters (`_`). Each `_` represents a distinct variable that needs to be assigned a digit from 0 to 9. The order of `_` characters in the expression defines the order in which values are assigned, which is crucial for determining the lexicographically smallest sequence. For example, `_-_` means we need to assign values to two variables, say `v0` and `v1`. The sequence `v0v1` is what we output.\n\n2.  **Conditions:** The `<conditions>` part (after `):-` and before the final `.`) is a comma-separated list of inequalities. Each inequality is of the form `___<___` or `___>___`.\n    *   Each group of underscores (`_`) in a condition represents a *sum* of variable values. For example, `___` means `v_i + v_j + v_k` for some variables `v_i, v_j, v_k`.\n    *   The variables used in these sums are the same variables defined by the `_` characters in the initial `<expression>`. The problem statement implies that `_` characters in the conditions refer to the *same* variables as in the expression part, and their position within the condition (e.g., first group of `_` vs. second group) does not introduce new variables. Instead, each `_` in a condition refers to one of the variables `v0, v1, ..., vN-1` that we are trying to assign values to. The simplest interpretation, given the \"easy question\" hint and typical competitive programming conventions for such problems, is that each `_` in a condition refers to one of the variables `v0, ..., vN-1`, and the sum is simply counting how many times each variable appears. However, a more common interpretation in similar problems (and one that makes the problem more interesting) is that *each `_` in a condition refers to a *new instance* of one of the variables from the main expression*. Without explicit indexing, the most robust interpretation that is consistent with the example `0250341` (where the sum `___` might be `v0+v1+v2` or `v0+v0+v0` etc.) is that `_` in conditions refers to variables by their *index*. Since the problem description is vague on this specific point, and given the \"easy\" tag, we'll assume the simplest interpretation: `_` in conditions refer to the *same* variables as in the main expression, and there's no complex mapping. The example output `0250341` for `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` strongly suggests that `_` in conditions refer to the *first* variables defined in the main expression. For instance, if the main expression has `N` variables `v0, v1, ..., vN-1`, then `_` in a condition refers to `v0`, `__` refers to `v0+v1`, `___` refers to `v0+v1+v2`, and so on. This is a common simplification when variable names are not explicitly given.\n\nLet's refine the interpretation of `_` in conditions based on the examples and the \"easy\" tag:\n*   The number of `_` in the main expression defines `N`, the total number of variables `v0, v1, ..., vN-1`.\n*   A group of `k` underscores in a condition (e.g., `___`) represents the sum of the first `k` variables: `v0 + v1 + ... + v(k-1)`. This is the most consistent interpretation that makes sense for the given examples and avoids ambiguity with variable indexing.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse the Golorp Name:**\n    *   Extract the `<expression>` part to count the total number of variables (`N`). Each `_` in this part defines a variable `v_i`.\n    *   Extract the `<conditions>` part. Split it by `,` to get individual conditions. For each condition, parse the two groups of `_` and the operator (`<` or `>`).\n\n2.  **Backtracking/Depth-First Search (DFS):**\n    *   We need to assign values (0-9) to `N` variables: `v0, v1, ..., v(N-1)`.\n    *   Since we want the lexicographically smallest sequence, we iterate through possible values for `v_i` from 0 to 9 in increasing order.\n    *   A recursive function `solve(k, current_values)` will try to assign a value to `v_k`.\n        *   **Base Case:** If `k == N`, all variables have been assigned values. Check if `current_values` satisfy *all* conditions. If they do, we've found a valid solution. Since we are iterating values from 0-9 and variables in order, the first valid solution found will be the lexicographically smallest. Return `True` (and store the solution).\n        *   **Recursive Step:** For `v_k`, iterate `digit` from 0 to 9.\n            *   Assign `v_k = digit`.\n            *   Recursively call `solve(k + 1, current_values + [digit])`.\n            *   If the recursive call returns `True`, it means a solution was found down that path, so propagate `True` upwards.\n        *   If no `digit` leads to a solution, return `False`.\n\n3.  **Condition Evaluation:**\n    *   To evaluate a condition like `L_sum < R_sum`:\n        *   Calculate `L_sum`: If `L` is `k` underscores, calculate `sum(current_values[0:k])`.\n        *   Calculate `R_sum`: If `R` is `m` underscores, calculate `sum(current_values[0:m])`.\n        *   Compare `L_sum` and `R_sum` based on the operator.\n    *   **Important Optimization:** During the DFS, when assigning a value to `v_k`, we should check if the *partial* assignment `current_values[0:k+1]` already violates any condition that *only depends on variables up to `v_k`*. This can prune the search space. However, since conditions are sums of `v0` through `v(k-1)`, a condition like `_ < ___` (i.e., `v0 < v0+v1+v2`) cannot be fully checked until `v2` is assigned. Therefore, we must check all conditions only at the base case (`k == N`). The \"easy\" tag usually implies that `N` is small enough for this. The maximum `N` in examples is 7. `10^7` is too large, but `N` might be smaller than the total `_` count. Let's re-examine: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` This has 22 `_` in the expression. `10^22` is definitely too large.\n\n    *   **Revised Interpretation of underscores in `<expression>`:** The problem states \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\" And \"Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.\" This strongly suggests that the `_` in the `<expression>` part *only* define the number of variables. The operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` in that part are mere separators or part of the \"shape\" and do not imply arithmetic operations for *that* part. So, we simply count the `_` characters in the expression part to get `N`.\n        For `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-...`, there are `22+4+7+2+5+6+3 = 49` underscores. This is too many for `10^49`.\n\n    *   **Alternative Interpretation: `_` in expression are *placeholders* for actual variables (e.g., `x, y, z`) and the operators define a structure, but the variables that are *fed* are implicitly numbered based on the *number of `_` characters in the first part that are not part of an operator*.** This is getting complex.\n\n    *   **Simplest interpretation (most likely for \"easy\"):** The number of variables `N` is simply the *total count of `_` characters in the entire string up to the `):-` marker*. The operators are ignored.\n        *   Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n            `_-_/___*__` has 1+1+3+2 = 7 underscores. So `N=7`.\n            Output: `0010` (length 4). This contradicts `N=7`.\n\n    *   **The example outputs are shorter than the number of `_` in the expression part.**\n        *   Input: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` (7 underscores in expression)\n        *   Output: `0010` (length 4)\n        *   Input: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` (49 underscores in expression)\n        *   Output: `0250341` (length 7)\n\n    This implies that the *number of variables `N`* is determined by something else, or `_` in the expression are not all distinct variables.\n    \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n    The \"jaws\" must be the part before `):-`.\n    The crucial insight might be that the *number of variables* `N` is determined by the *maximum number of `_` in any single sum in the conditions*.\n    Let's check this hypothesis:\n    *   Input 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n        Conditions: `___>__`\n        Max `_` in a sum is 3 (from `___`). So `N=3`.\n        Output: `0010`. This is length 4, not 3. Hypothesis failed.\n\n    *   Input 3: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n        Conditions: `__<___`, `___<____`, `____<_____`, `_____<______`, `______<_______`.\n        Max `_` in a sum is 7 (from `_______`). So `N=7`.\n        Output: `0250341`. This is length 7. This matches!\n\n    *   Input 4: `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\n        Conditions: `___>__`\n        Max `_` in a sum is 3 (from `___`). So `N=3`.\n        Output: `0101`. This is length 4. Hypothesis failed again.\n\n    The hypothesis about `N` being the max `_` in a condition is inconsistent.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate the very first problem statement: \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n    The \"jaws\" is the part between `?(` and `):-`. The *shape* could be related to the number of `_` *groups* or something else.\n    What if the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` *do* matter, and they define *groups* of variables?\n    `_-_/___*__`\n    This has 4 groups of underscores: `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`.\n    If each group represents a variable, then `N=4`.\n    *   Input 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n        Groups: `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`. Count = 4.\n        Output: `0010`. Length 4. **MATCH!**\n\n    *   Input 2: `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`\n        Groups: `__`, `_`, `_`, `_____`. Count = 4.\n        Output: `false`. If `N=4`, this is consistent.\n\n    *   Input 3: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\n        Groups: `______________________`, `____`, `_______`, `__`, `_____`, `______`, `___`. Count = 7.\n        Output: `0250341`. Length 7. **MATCH!**\n\n    *   Input 4: `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.`\n        Groups: `__`, `___`, `__`, `___`. Count = 4.\n        Output: `0101`. Length 4. **MATCH!**\n\n    **This interpretation seems to be correct!**\n    1.  **Count `N`:** The number of variables `N` is the count of distinct groups of underscores in the `<expression>` part (between `?(` and `):-`), where groups are separated by `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.\n    2.  **Condition Interpretation:** Each `k` underscores in a condition (e.g., `___`) refers to the sum `v0 + v1 + ... + v(k-1)`. This is a common pattern for \"anonymous\" variables.\n\n**Refined Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse `N` (number of variables):**\n    *   Find the substring between `?(` and `):-`. Let this be `expr_part`.\n    *   Replace all operator characters (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) in `expr_part` with a space.\n    *   Split the resulting string by spaces. Each non-empty token will be a group of underscores. Count these groups. This count is `N`.\n\n2.  **Parse Conditions:**\n    *   Find the substring between `):-` and `.`. Let this be `cond_part`.\n    *   Split `cond_part` by `,` to get individual condition strings.\n    *   For each condition string (e.g., `___>__`):\n        *   Identify the operator (`<` or `>`).\n        *   The string before the operator is `L_str`, after is `R_str`.\n        *   `L_count = len(L_str)` (number of underscores).\n        *   `R_count = len(R_str)` (number of underscores).\n        *   Store these as `(L_count, operator, R_count)`.\n\n3.  **Backtracking/DFS:**\n    *   `result = []` (to store the final sequence of digits).\n    *   `found_solution = False`\n    *   `dfs(k, current_values)`:\n        *   `k`: current variable index we are trying to assign (from 0 to `N-1`).\n        *   `current_values`: list of digits assigned so far (`v0, ..., v(k-1)`).\n        *   **Base Case:** If `k == N`:\n            *   Check if `current_values` satisfy all parsed conditions.\n                *   For each condition `(L_count, op, R_count)`:\n                    *   Calculate `sum_L = sum(current_values[0:L_count])`.\n                    *   Calculate `sum_R = sum(current_values[0:R_count])`.\n                    *   If `op == '<'` and `sum_L >= sum_R`, condition failed.\n                    *   If `op == '>''` and `sum_L <= sum_R`, condition failed.\n                *   If all conditions pass:\n                    *   `result = list(current_values)` (store the solution).\n                    *   `found_solution = True`.\n                    *   Return `True`.\n            *   Return `False` (conditions not met).\n        *   **Recursive Step:**\n            *   For `digit` from 0 to 9:\n                *   `current_values.append(digit)`\n                *   If `dfs(k + 1, current_values)` returns `True`:\n                    *   Return `True` (solution found).\n                *   `current_values.pop()` (backtrack).\n            *   Return `False` (no digit for `v_k` leads to a solution).\n\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   Call `dfs(0, [])`.\n    *   If `found_solution` is `True`, print `\"\".join(map(str, result))`.\n    *   Else, print `\"false\"`.\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   Input string length: 13 to 1024 characters.\n*   Maximum `N` (number of variables): In example 3, `N=7`. For `N=7`, `10^7` operations is feasible for a competitive programming problem (typically up to `10^8` operations). Each check involves summing a few numbers and comparisons. Summing `N` numbers takes `O(N)`. There are `C` conditions. So each base case check is `O(C*N)`. Total complexity `O(10^N * C * N)`. For `N=7`, `10^7 * C * 7` should pass if `C` is small (e.g., `C < 10`). Example 3 has `C=5`. So `10^7 * 5 * 7` is about `3.5 * 10^8`, which might be pushing it but could pass if constants are small.\n\nLet's carefully implement this.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # 1.
