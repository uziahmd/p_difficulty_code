The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Ringroad Problem: My Solution Path**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's see... the core of it is simulating movement on a circular track of houses.  We're given the number of houses (`n`), the tasks (`m`), and a sequence of houses (`a_i`) Xenia needs to visit in order. Starting at house 1, Xenia can only move clockwise and needs to complete the tasks in the given order. The goal is to figure out the minimum time it takes to get everything done.\n\nThe key is in the movement. Moving between adjacent houses is one time unit.  Since we move clockwise, the distance calculation is going to be important. I need to keep track of Xenia's current position and the total elapsed time. Seems straightforward enough. I can initialize `current_pos` to 1 and `total_time` to 0.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, I'll loop through each task. For each task, I calculate the distance from Xenia's current position to the target house (`a_i`). That's where the trick is. Calculating the distance. If the target house is \"ahead\" (higher house number), then it's just the difference. But if the target house is \"behind\" (lower house number), it's more complicated because of the circular nature.  The provided example highlighted this perfectly.\n\nMy initial idea for the circular case was the one with `n - current_pos + target_pos`. That gives the number of spaces between current and target positions in that clockwise rotation, but it's not the cleanest or simplest.  I can probably simplify that calculation. Maybe `(target_pos - current_pos + n) % n` will handle all cases. Let me double-check that to be sure.\n\nOnce the time for each move is calculated, I update `total_time` and `current_pos`. That's essentially it.  I'll need to make sure the time is calculated correctly in both cases (target ahead, target behind) so it works correctly. I think I have a solid algorithm in mind, now I can get to work on the Python code. I'm confident I can whip up a neat solution for this.\n",
