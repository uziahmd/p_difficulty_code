After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's the breakdown of my thinking:** I'm tasked with solving the \"Marks\" problem. First, I need to thoroughly understand the problem's requirements.  It involves identifying \"successful\" students based on their marks in different subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best at *at least one* subject. The input format, output format, and constraints are clearly defined, which is helpful.  I've analyzed the example provided, meticulously stepping through the logic to confirm my understanding.\n\nMy strategy involves a straightforward approach: read the input data (n, m, and the gradebook), find the maximum mark for each subject, and then check which students achieved those maximums.  I've chosen to use a list of strings to represent the gradebook, which seems efficient for character-based single-digit marks.  My algorithm will iterate through the subjects, then students, comparing marks to identify and count the successful ones.\n\nI've carefully considered the time and space complexity of my algorithm, ensuring it's efficient enough to meet the problem's constraints. It's an O(n*m) approach, which should work. The edge cases are considered. The detailed code is written to be clear and concise. The refined implementation has been re-tested with a more involved test case.  Finally, I'm confident in my solution's correctness and efficiency.\n",
