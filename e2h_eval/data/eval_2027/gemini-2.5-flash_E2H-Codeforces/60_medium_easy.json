Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on Counting Sequences in Growing Strings**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a competitive programming problem where the goal is to count the number of valid letter sequences within substrings of an expanding string, `S`.  `S` starts empty and we're adding '0's and '1's one at a time.  We need the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each append.  It's like a Morse code conversion problem.\n\nFirst, I clarified the setup.  Dots are '0', dashes '1', and letter lengths are 1 to 4 characters.  There are 30 possible Morse code strings of lengths 1-4, but 4 are invalid (specifically \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\"). This leaves 26 valid codes corresponding to the 26 English letters.\n\nThe core of the problem involves identifying sequences of English letters within substrings of `S`. A substring, `S[i:j]`, can form a sequence if it can be broken down into valid Morse codes representing letters.\n\nMy initial instinct was dynamic programming (DP). Let's define `dp[k]` as the number of ways to parse the prefix `S[0:k]`.  Then,  `dp[k]` would be the sum of `dp[k - len(c)]` for every valid code `c` that ends at index `k`. The base case is `dp[0] = 1`. The total count for any prefix would be `sum(dp[i])` for `i` from `1` to `k`. However, the question demands for all possible substrings.\n\nSo, I had to expand that to all substrings. For each substring `S[i:j]`, count the number of valid parse sequences and sum them all.\n\nThis approach looked like it would result in `O(M * N^2 * max_len_code)` complexity (where `M` is the number of appends and `N` is string length), which is probably too slow given the problem's constraints.\n\nI then realized I needed to rethink this incrementally. When we append a character, how do we update our count efficiently?  Let `ans[k]` be the total count after k appends. When a character is added to `S_k` to create `S_{k+1}`, only new substrings ending at the new character will change.  This implies using a suffix DP, where `dp_suffix[i]` is the number of ways to parse `S[i:current_len]`. But I got confused because it does not cover all substrings.\n\nSo I went back to a fresh DP: Let `f(i,j)` be the number of ways to parse the substring `S[i:j]`. Then the total answer is the sum of `f(i, j)` for `0 <= i < j <= N`.\nThen I wanted to find a relation to update the count when the string grows.\nI decided that the right way to think about `f(i, j)` is:\n`f(i, j) = sum(f(i, j-L) for L in {1,2,3,4} if S[j-L:j] is a valid code)`.\nAnd `f(i, i) = 0`.  This is for non-empty sequences.\nSo, I re-defined the problem as an incremental string problem.\n\nThe key insight seems to be updating a DP array representing suffixes. Define `dp[k]` as the number of ways to parse the suffix of length `k`, i.e., `S[len-k:len]`.\nWhenever the string `S` is appended with a new character `c`, its length becomes `len + 1`.\n\nThe idea is that new substrings always end at the latest appended character. So, we'll maintain and update `dp` to account for these strings.\n\nAfter some analysis I think this is it: Maintain a `dp` array which represents the counts to parse the *suffixes* of the current string. Add one element at a time using this DP technique. Compute the count for the newly added char, update the string, and update the existing answer.\n\nI believe the correct approach is as follows. When a new character is appended, compute the parse counts for the new suffixes and add them to the total. And I should keep track of valid Morse codes to test against.\n\nLet's test this carefully with examples. Let me implement this and see how it works.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of unique non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing any substring of a given Morse code string `S`. The string `S` grows by appending one character ('0' or '1') at a time, and we need to report the total count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each append operation.\n\nA Morse code for an English letter is a string of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4. There are 30 such strings in total. Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") do not correspond to any English letter. The remaining 26 strings each correspond to a distinct English letter.\n\nLet's clarify what \"sequences of English letters\" means. If a substring `sub` can be parsed into `L1 L2 ... Lk` where each `Li` is a valid Morse code for an English letter, then `(L1, L2, ..., Lk)` is one such sequence. We need to count the total number of *distinct* sequences across all substrings.\n\nThe crucial detail is \"distinct sequences\". This means if substring `S[i:j]` can be parsed as `(\"1\", \"1\")` and substring `S[k:l]` can also be parsed as `(\"1\", \"1\")`, we only count `(\"1\", \"1\")` once. This implies we should use a `set` to store the unique sequences found. However, `m` can be up to 3000, and the number of sequences can be very large. Storing them in a set would be too slow and memory-intensive. The problem asks for a count modulo `10^9 + 7`, which strongly suggests that we should be counting distinct sequences *by value*, not by their origin (i.e., not distinguishing between `(\"1\", \"1\")` from `S[0:2]` and `(\"1\", \"1\")` from `S[1:3]`). The example output confirms this interpretation.\n\nLet's re-examine the example: `S = \"111\"`.\nValid codes:\n\"1\" -> T\n\"11\" -> M\n\"111\" -> O\n\nSubstrings of \"111\":\n1.  `\"1\"` (from `S[0:1]`): Sequence `(\"T\")`.\n2.  `\"1\"` (from `S[1:2]`): Sequence `(\"T\")`.\n3.  `\"1\"` (from `S[2:3]`): Sequence `(\"T\")`.\n4.  `\"11\"` (from `S[0:2]`):\n    *   `(\"M\")`\n    *   `(\"T\", \"T\")` (parsing \"11\" as \"1\" + \"1\")\n5.  `\"11\"` (from `S[1:3]`):\n    *   `(\"M\")`\n    *   `(\"T\", \"T\")`\n6.  `\"111\"` (from `S[0:3]`):\n    *   `(\"O\")`\n    *   `(\"M\", \"T\")` (parsing \"111\" as \"11\" + \"1\")\n    *   `(\"T\", \"M\")` (parsing \"111\" as \"1\" + \"11\")\n    *   `(\"T\", \"T\", \"T\")` (parsing \"111\" as \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\")\n\nUnique sequences found:\n`(\"T\")`\n`(\"M\")`\n`(\"T\", \"T\")`\n`(\"O\")`\n`(\"M\", \"T\")`\n`(\"T\", \"M\")`\n`(\"T\", \"T\", \"T\")`\nTotal count = 7. This matches the example output.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let `S` be the current string of length `N`.\nFor each starting position `i` (from `0` to `N-1`), we want to find all sequences of letters that can be formed from `S[i:]`.\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the set of all unique sequences of letters that can be formed from the substring `S[i:j]`.\n`dp[i][j]` can be computed by considering the last letter in the sequence. If `S[j-L:j]` is a valid Morse code `C` of length `L` (where `L` is 1, 2, 3, or 4):\n  *   If `L == j-i` (i.e., `S[i:j]` itself is a single letter `C`), then `dp[i][j]` contains `(C)`.\n  *   Otherwise, for each sequence `seq` in `dp[i][j-L]`, we add `seq + (C)` to `dp[i][j]`.\n\nThis `set` approach is too slow. The key insight is that we only need the *count* of distinct sequences.\nThe problem can be modeled as finding paths in a graph or using a custom string data structure like a Trie or Aho-Corasick automaton. Since the maximum length of a Morse code is 4, we can use a small finite state automaton.\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nWe can use a map (dictionary in Python) to store the counts of sequences.\nLet `counts` be a map where `counts[sequence]` stores the number of ways `sequence` can be formed by parsing a substring of `S`. We want `len(counts)`.\nThis is still too complex.\n\nThe typical way to count distinct strings/sequences modulo `P` is using polynomial hashing. Each sequence `(L1, L2, ..., Lk)` can be represented by a polynomial hash `(hash(L1) * B^(k-1) + hash(L2) * B^(k-2) + ... + hash(Lk)) % P`. We can then store these hashes in a `set` to count distinct sequences.\n\nLet's define `hash_val(code)` for each valid Morse code. We can map each of the 26 valid codes to an integer from 1 to 26.\n`hash_val(S[j-L:j])` for a valid code.\nLet `B` be a base (e.g., 31, 37, 53, or a larger prime) and `P` be `10^9 + 7`.\nLet `h[k]` be the set of hashes of all unique sequences that can be formed by parsing `S[k:]`. This is not what we want.\n\nLet `current_S` be the string of length `N` after `N` appends.\nWhen a new character `char` is appended, `current_S` becomes `current_S + char`, and its length becomes `N+1`.\nWe need to consider all new substrings ending at `N`. These are `current_S[0:N+1]`, `current_S[1:N+1]`, ..., `current_S[N:N+1]`.\nFor each `i` from `0` to `N`, let `sub = current_S[i:N+1]`. We need to find all unique sequences represented by `sub`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be a set of hashes of sequences that can be formed by parsing the suffix `current_S[N+1-k : N+1]`.\n`dp[0]` would contain the hash of the empty sequence (e.g., 0).\nFor `k` from `1` to `N+1`:\n  `dp[k]` is initialized as an empty set.\n  For `L` in `{1,2,3,4}`:\n    If `k >= L`:\n      Let `code_str = current_S[N+1-L : N+1]`.\n      If `code_str` is a valid Morse code:\n        Let `code_hash = get_code_hash(code_str)`.\n        If `k == L`: // `code_str` is the entire substring\n          `dp[k].add(code_hash)`\n        Else (`k > L`): // `code_str` is the last part of the substring\n          For `prev_seq_hash` in `dp[k-L]`:\n            `new_seq_hash = (prev_seq_hash * B + code_hash) % P`\n            `dp[k].add(new_seq_hash)`\n\nAfter computing `dp[k]` for all `k`, we add all hashes from `dp[k]` (for `k > 0`) to a global set `all_hashes`. The answer is `len(all_hashes)`.\nThis approach would be `O(M * N * max_len_code * (size of dp[k]))`. The size of `dp[k]` can be large.\n`N` can be `M`, so `M^2 * max_len_code * max_sequences_per_substring`. This is too slow.\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is 3000. `max_len_code` is 4.\nThe number of valid codes is 26.\nLet's pre-assign integer IDs to valid codes:\n`code_to_id = {}`\n`id_counter = 1`\n`for len in range(1, 5):`\n  `for num in range(2**len):`\n    `s = bin(num)[2:].zfill(len)`\n    `if s not in INVALID_CODES:`\n      `code_to_id[s] = id_counter`\n      `id_counter += 1`\nThis gives us a unique ID from 1 to 26 for each valid code.\n\nLet `current_S` be the string.\nLet `total_unique_hashes` be a `set` to store all unique hashes found so far.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `current_S`:\n  `current_S.append(c)`\n  `N = len(current_S)`\n\n  Let `hashes_ending_at_N[i]` be the set of hashes of sequences that can be formed from `current_S[i:N]`.\n  We can compute this for `i` from `N-1` down to `0`.\n  `hashes_ending_at_N` will be a list of sets, `hashes_ending_at_N[k]` corresponds to `current_S[k:N]`.\n\n  For `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `current_substring_hashes = set()`\n    For `L` from `1` to `min(4, N-i)`:\n      `code_str = \"\".join(current_S[N-L:N])` (this is the suffix of length `L` of `current_S[i:N]`)\n      Wait, this is wrong. `code_str` should be `current_S[N-L:N]` if we are parsing `current_S[N-k:N]`.\n      If we are parsing `current_S[i:N]`, the last code is `current_S[N-L:N]`.\n      The previous part is `current_S[i:N-L]`.\n\nThis structure is what we need:\n`dp[k]` = set of hashes of sequences that parse `S[k:]`. No, this is not right.\nWe need `dp[k]` to be a set of hashes of sequences that parse `S[current_len-k : current_len]`.\nLet `current_S` be the list of characters. `N = len(current_S)`.\n`dp_suffix_hashes = [set() for _ in range(N + 1)]`\n`dp_suffix_hashes[0]` represents the empty prefix for parsing, it contains a hash for the empty sequence (e.g., 0).\n\nFor `k` from `1` to `N`: (current suffix length `k`, substring `current_S[N-k : N]`)\n  For `L` from `1` to `min(4, k)`:\n    `code_str = \"\".join(current_S[N-L : N])`\n    If `code_str` is a valid Morse code:\n      `code_id = code_to_id[code_str]`\n      If `k == L`: // The entire suffix is just this one code\n        `dp_suffix_hashes[k].add(code_id)`\n      Else: // The suffix is `S[N-k : N-L]` followed by `code_str`\n        For `prev_seq_hash` in `dp_suffix_hashes[k-L]`:\n          `new_seq_hash = (prev_seq_hash * B + code_id) % P`\n          `dp_suffix_hashes[k].add(new_seq_hash)`\n\n  `total_unique_hashes.update(dp_suffix_hashes[k])`\n  `print(len(total_unique_hashes))`\n\nThis is `O(M * N * max_len_code * max_hashes_in_set)`. `max_hashes_in_set` can grow up to `2^4 = 16` for sequences of length 4.\nFor `k=1`, `dp_suffix_hashes[1]` has at most 1 hash.\nFor `k=2`, `dp_suffix_hashes[2]` has at most `1 + 1*1 = 2` hashes. (`(\"11\")`, `(\"1\", \"1\")`)\nFor `k=3`, `dp_suffix_hashes[3]` has at most `1 + 1*1 + 2*1 = 4` hashes.\nFor `k=4`, `dp_suffix_hashes[4]` has at most `1 + 1*1 + 2*1 + 4*1 = 8` hashes.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for a substring of length `k` is `fib(k+1)` (approximately `phi^k`).\nFor `k=3000`, this is too large. `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` can contain many hashes.\n\nThe issue is that `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` needs to store *all* sequences for `S[N-k:N]`.\nThe example output for `S = \"111\"` is `7`.\nMy `dp_suffix_hashes` calculations for `S = \"111\"`:\n`B = 31`, `P = 10^9 + 7`.\n`code_to_id`: `{\"1\":1, \"11\":2, \"111\":3, ...}`\n\n`S = []`, `total_unique_hashes = set()`.\n\n1.

This is `1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8` (for a string like \"1111\" if all codes were valid).\nNo, the maximum number of sequences for `S[N-k:N]` can be larger. For `k=3000`, the number of ways to parse it can be very large.\nHowever, `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` is the set of hashes for sequences that parse `current_S[N-k : N]`.\nThe length of `current_S[N-k : N]` is `k`.\nThe number of sequences for a string of length `k` is `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + f(k-3) + f(k-4)` (if all codes of length 1 to 4 are valid). This grows exponentially.\nFor `k=3000`, `f(3000)` is huge. The number of distinct hashes in `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` can be large.\nThe total `len(total_unique_hashes)` is what matters. This can be up to `M * f(max_len_code)`.\nThe maximum length of `S` is `M = 3000`.\n`dp_suffix_hashes[k]` refers to `current_S[N-k:N]`.\nThe values `k` range from `1` to `N`.\nThe inner loop iterates `L` from `1` to `min(4, k)`.\nSo `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` depends on `dp_suffix_hashes[k-1]`, `dp_suffix_hashes[k-2]`, `dp_suffix_hashes[k-3]`, `dp_suffix_hashes[k-4]`.\nThe max size of `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` is `26^4` (max sequence length 4).\nMax length of a sequence is `k`. If `k=3000`, a sequence can have 3000 letters.\nThe number of distinct hashes could be `~ 26^3000` in theory.\nBut `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` stores the hashes of sequences for `current_S[N-k:N]`.\nThe maximum number of actual distinct sequences for a string of length `k` is `fib(k+1)`.\nFor `k=3000`, `fib(3001)` is massive. So `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` can be very large.\nThis means `dp_suffix_hashes[k].add(...)` and `total_unique_hashes.update(...)` operations could be slow.\n\nThe constraint `M=3000` suggests an `O(M^2)` solution is acceptable, or `O(M * log M)` or `O(M * sqrt M)`.\nMy current approach is `O(M * N * max_len_code * (avg_set_size))`.\nIf `avg_set_size` is `O(N)`, then it's `O(M^3)`.\nIf `avg_set_size` is constant, it's `O(M^2 * max_len_code)`. `3000^2 * 4 = 3.6 * 10^7`, which is acceptable.\n\nWhy would `avg_set_size` be constant?\nThe number of distinct sequences for `S[N-k:N]` can be large.\nHowever, the actual number of sequences that can be parsed for a string of length `k` is `f(k)` where `f(k) = sum_{L=1 to 4, if code_L is valid} f(k-L)`.\nThe number of distinct sequences is `f(k)`.\n`f(1)=1`\n`f(2)=2` (`11` -> `M`, `TT`)\n`f(3)=4` (`111` -> `O`, `MT`, `TM`, `TTT`)\n`f(4)=8` (for \"1111\", if all are valid)\nThe number of distinct sequences for a string of length `k` is `f(k)`.\nSo `len(dp_suffix_hashes[k])` is `f(k)`.\nThe maximum `k` is `N=3000`. `f(3000)` is huge.\nThis means `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` will contain too many elements.\n\nThe problem states \"an English letter is represented as a string of some length from 1 to 4\".\nThis means `L` can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\nThis means the maximum length of a sequence is `k`.\nThe number of elements in `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` is actually `f(k)`.\nThe total number of unique sequences is `sum_{i=0 to N-1} f(N-i)`.\nThis is exactly `total_unique_hashes` in my DP.\nThe sum `sum_{i=1 to N} f(i)` can also be very large.\n\nThe only way `O(M^2)` passes is if the maximum size of `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` is small, like `O(1)` or `O(log M)`.\nBut `f(k)` grows exponentially.\nFor `M=3000`, `f(3000)` is huge.\nThis implies my understanding of `dp_suffix_hashes[k]` or the problem statement is flawed.\n\n\"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\"\nThe example output for `S=\"111\"` is 7.\n`f(1)=1` (`T`)\n`f(2)=2` (`M`, `TT`)\n`f(3)=4` (`O`, `MT`, `TM`, `TTT`)\nTotal `1+2+4 = 7`. This is `sum(f(k))` for `k=1 to N`.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for `sum(f_sub(sub))`, where `f_sub(sub)` is the number of ways `sub` can be parsed, and `sub` ranges over all suffixes of `S`.\nLet `current_S` be the string of length `N`.\nLet `f[k]` be the number of ways `current_S[N-k : N]` can be parsed.\n`f[0] = 1` (empty string)\nFor `k` from `1` to `N`:\n  `f[k] = 0`\n  For `L` from `1` to `min(4, k)`:\n    `code_str = \"\".join(current_S[N-L : N])`\n    If `code_str` is a valid Morse code:\n      `f[k] = (f[k] + f[k-L]) % MOD`\n  `total_ans = (total_ans + f[k]) % MOD`\n\nThis is `O(M * N * max_len_code)`.\n`3000 * 3000 * 4 = 3.6 * 10^7`. This is perfectly acceptable.\n\nLet's re-verify the example with this simpler `f[k]` definition.\n`S = \"\"` initially. `total_ans = 0`.\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n`current_S = []`.\n\n1.

My `f[k]` calculation gives `1, 4, 7`.\nThe discrepancy is at `S = \"11\"`.\nExample:\n`S = \"1\"` -> `(\"T\")` -> 1 sequence.\n`S = \"11\"` -> `(\"T\")`, `(\"M\")`, `(\"T\", \"T\")`.

This matches the example!\n\nWhat was wrong in my trace?\nMy `total_ans` for \"11\" was `(1 + f[1]) + f[2] = (1+1) + 2 = 4`.\nThe `total_ans` should be the sum of `f[k]` for all *substrings*, not just suffixes ending at `N`.\n`total_ans` must be the sum of `f(i, j)` for all `0 <= i < j <= N`.\n`f(i, j)` is the number of ways `S[i:j]` can be parsed.\nLet `dp_val[i]` be an array where `dp_val[i]` stores the number of ways `S[i:N]` can be parsed.\nWhen `char` is appended to `S` (length `N-1`), `S` becomes `S+char` (length `N`).\nWe need to calculate `dp_val[i]` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n`dp_val[i]` depends on `dp_val[i+L]`.\n`dp_val[N] = 1` (empty string).\nFor `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_val[i] = 0`\n  For `L` from `1` to `min(4, N-i)`:\n    `code_str = \"\".join(S[i : i+L])`\n    If `code_str` is a valid Morse code:\n      `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i+L]) % MOD`\n  `current_total_for_S = (current_total_for_S + dp_val[i]) % MOD`\n\nThis `current_total_for_S` is the sum of parse counts for all *suffixes* of `S`.\nThis is exactly what the example output seems to be.\nLet's try this DP definition for `S = \"11\"`.\n`S = [\"1\", \"1\"]`. `N = 2`.\n`dp_val = [0]*(N+1) = [0,0,0]`.\n`dp_val[N] = dp_val[2] = 1`.\n`i = 1`: `S[1:2] = \"1\"`. `N-i = 1`.\n  `dp_val[1] = 0`.\n  `L = 1`: `code_str = S[1:2] = \"1\"`. `is_valid(\"1\")` true.\n    `dp_val[1] = (dp_val[1] + dp_val[1+1]) % MOD = (0 + dp_val[2]) % MOD = 1`.\n  `dp_val[1] = 1`.

Let `S_k` be the string after `k` appends.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways `S_k[i:k]` can be parsed.\nWhen a new character `char` is appended, `S_{k+1}` has length `k+1`.\nWe need to compute `dp_new[i]` for `S_{k+1}[i:k+1]`.\n`dp_new[k+1] = 1` (base case for empty string `S_{k+1}[k+1:k+1]`).\nFor `i` from `k` down to `0`:\n  `dp_new[i] = 0`\n  For `L` from `1` to `min(4, k+1-i)`:\n    `code_str = \"\".join(S_{k+1}[i : i+L])`\n    If `code_str` is a valid Morse code:\n      `dp_new[i] = (dp_new[i] + dp_new[i+L]) % MOD`\nThe total answer for `S_{k+1}` is `sum(dp_new[i] for i in range(k+1)) % MOD`.\n\nThis is `O(M * N * max_len_code)`. `N` is the current length of `S`.\n`M` iterations.

Print `current_total_ans`.\n\nLet's quickly check the constraints: `m <= 3000`.\n`current_S` can grow to length 3000.\n`\"\".join(current_S[i : i+L])` creates a string slice. This is `O(L)` operation.\nOverall `O(M * N * max_len_code * max_len_code) = O(M^2 * max_len_code^2)` if string slicing creates a new string.\n`3000^2 * 4^2 = 3.6 * 10^7 * 16 = 5.76 * 10^8`. This might be too slow.\nString slicing in Python for `\"\".join` is `O(L)`. So `\"\".join(current_S[i : i+L])` is `O(L)`.\nThe `in INVALID_CODES` check is `O(L)` on average for string hashes, or `O(max_len_code)` for a small set.\nSo `O(M * N * max_len_code * max_len_code)`.\nTo optimize `\"\".join(current_S[i : i+L])`:\nWe can maintain a sliding window string or use string hashing to check validity.\nSince `max_len_code` is only 4, we can just build the string.\n`s_len_1 = current_S[i]`\n`s_len_2 = current_S[i] + current_S[i+1]`\netc.\nThis avoids `\"\".join` repeatedly on slices.\nLet's define `get_substring(start, length)` function.\n`get_substring(i, L)`:\n  `if L == 1: return current_S[i]`\n  `if L == 2: return current_S[i] + current_S[i+1]`\n  `if L == 3: return current_S[i] + current_S[i+1] + current_S[i+2]`\n  `if L == 4: return current_S[i] + current_S[i+1] + current_S[i+2] + current_S[i+3]`\nThis makes it `O(L)` still.\n`\"\".join` is generally efficient. Let's assume `O(L)` for `\"\".join(list_slice)`.\nThe `in` check for a small set of strings is also efficient.\nThe total operations would be roughly `M * (sum_{N_cur=1 to M} N_cur * max_len_code * max_len_code)`.\nNo, it's `M` iterations. In each iteration, `N_cur` (current length) positions `i`. For each `i`, `max_len_code` lengths `L`. For each `L`, `O(L)` to form string.\n`M * N_cur * max_len_code * max_len_code`.\nSo it's `M * (M * 4 * 4)` in the worst case. `3000 * 3000 * 16 = 1.44 * 10^8`. This might be cutting it close, but Python's constant factors are usually higher.\nIt's possible this is the intended solution given the \"easy\" tag.\n\nLet's consider possible optimizations for `\"\".join`.\nInstead of `\"\".join(current_S[i : i+L])`, we can just access `current_S[i]` to `current_S[i+3]` directly.\n```python\n# Inside the loop for i from N-1 down to 0:\n#   For L from 1 to min(4, N-i):\n#     code_str = \"\"\n#     if L == 1:\n#       code_str = current_S[i]\n#     elif L == 2:\n#       code_str = current_S[i] + current_S[i+1]\n#     elif L == 3:\n#       code_str = current_S[i] + current_S[i+1] + current_S[i+2]\n#     elif L == 4:\n#       code_str = current_S[i] + current_S[i+1] + current_S[i+2] + current_S[i+3]\n#     if code_str not in INVALID_CODES:\n#       dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+L]) % MOD\n```\nThis is `O(L)` for string concatenation, but it's small `L` (max 4).
