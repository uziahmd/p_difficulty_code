Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Competitive Programming Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Leha voucher problem to tackle. The goal is to find two non-intersecting vouchers whose durations sum up to a target `x`, minimizing their combined cost. If no such pair exists, I need to output -1.  The problem description is clear: input is `n` vouchers, each with a start time `li`, end time `ri`, and cost `costi`.  `n` and `x` are up to 2 * 10^5, which immediately makes me think about time complexity. O(n^2) is out; I need something faster, like O(n log n) or O(n) or something similar.\n\nI've defined the duration of a voucher as `ri - li + 1` and the key condition is non-intersection, meaning one voucher must end before the other begins (`ri < lj` or `rj < li`).\n\nThe brute-force O(n^2) approach of checking all pairs is too slow. I need a more clever strategy.  I'm thinking I should fix one voucher, say voucher `i`, and then efficiently search for a suitable second voucher `j`.  For voucher `i`, I can calculate its duration `d_i`.  Then I need to find voucher `j` such that `d_j = x - d_i`, that `j` doesn't intersect with `i`, and also minimizes the cost.\n\nSo, for each `i`, I need to find the cheapest `j` that satisfies these conditions.  The non-intersection condition is a constraint I must not forget.\n\nGiven the coordinate ranges are up to `2 * 10^5`, I'm exploring the idea of using the start or end points for iteration. Maybe sorting the vouchers could help? If I sort by start time (`li`) or end time (`ri`), maybe I can find the second voucher efficiently. Sorting by duration doesn't seem to make sense here. I think sorting by start or end time will allow me to quickly check for non-intersecting vouchers.  I'm leaning towards the idea of iterating through possible end points or start points to make the search more efficient. Let me focus on this area.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct, non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration is exactly `x` and whose total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\nLet's denote a voucher `i` by `(l_i, r_i, cost_i)`. Its duration is `d_i = r_i - l_i + 1`.\nTwo vouchers `i` and `j` are non-overlapping if `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i`.\n\nThe constraints are `n, x <= 2 * 10^5` and `l_i, r_i <= 2 * 10^5`. This suggests a solution better than O(N^2), likely O(N log N) or O(N * max_coordinate).\n\n**Algorithm Idea:**\n\nWe need to find two vouchers, say `A` and `B`, such that `d_A + d_B = x` and they don't overlap.\nLet's iterate through all vouchers `A`. For each voucher `A`, we know its duration `d_A = r_A - l_A + 1`. We then need to find a voucher `B` such that:\n1. `d_B = x - d_A`.\n2. Voucher `B` does not overlap with `A`.\n3. `cost_B` is minimal among all such `B`.\n\nThe non-overlapping condition `r_A < l_B` or `r_B < l_A` is key.\n\nLet's maintain, for each possible duration `D`, the minimum cost of a voucher with that duration `D` that *ends at or before* a certain day, or *starts at or after* a certain day.\n\nWe can process vouchers efficiently by sorting them. A good strategy is to sort them by their start day `l_i`.\n\n**Detailed Approach:**\n\n1.  **Data Structures:**\n    *   `vouchers_by_duration`: A list of lists, where `vouchers_by_duration[d]` stores all vouchers with duration `d`. Each element in the inner list will be a tuple `(l, r, cost)`.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d][r]`: This would be too large if `r` is an index. Instead, we can use a `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d]` array where `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d][k]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that ends at day `k`. Initialize with infinity.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration_starting_at[d][l]`: Similar to the above, but for vouchers starting at `l`.\n\n2.  **Preprocessing:**\n    *   Group vouchers by duration. For `d` from 1 to `x-1`, `vouchers_by_duration[d]` will contain `(l, r, cost)` for all vouchers with duration `d`.\n    *   Initialize `min_cost_ending_at[d]` and `min_cost_starting_at[d]` arrays. These arrays will store the minimum cost for a voucher of duration `d` ending/starting at a specific day. The size of these arrays will be `MAX_COORD + 1` (where `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`). Initialize all entries to infinity.\n\n3.  **Iterate and Update:**\n    We need to find a pair `(A, B)` such that `d_A + d_B = x`.\n    Let's iterate through all possible values of `r_A` (the end day of voucher A) from 1 to `MAX_COORD`.\n    For each `r_A`:\n    *   **Update `min_cost_ending_at`:** Consider all vouchers `v_k = (l_k, r_k, cost_k)` such that `r_k = r_A`. For each such voucher, update `min_cost_ending_at[d_k][r_k] = min(min_cost_ending_at[d_k][r_k], cost_k)`.\n        After processing all vouchers ending at `r_A`, we can propagate minimums: `min_cost_ending_at[d][r_A] = min(min_cost_ending_at[d][r_A], min_cost_ending_at[d][r_A - 1])` for all `d`. This ensures that `min_cost_ending_at[d][k]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` ending *at or before* day `k`. This is useful for `r_j < l_i` condition.\n    *   **Find potential pairs:** Now, consider any voucher `v_A = (l_A, r_A, cost_A)` that *starts* at `l_A` and *ends* at `r_A`. Its duration is `d_A = r_A - l_A + 1`.\n        We need a voucher `v_B` with duration `d_B = x - d_A`.\n        For `v_B` not to overlap with `v_A`, we have two cases:\n        1.  `r_A < l_B`: `v_B` starts after `v_A` ends. The earliest `l_B` can be is `r_A + 1`. We need to find `min_cost_starting_at[d_B][l_B]` for `l_B >= r_A + 1`. This is equivalent to finding the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d_B` that starts at `r_A + 1` or later.\n        2.  `r_B < l_A`: `v_B` ends before `v_A` begins. The latest `r_B` can be is `l_A - 1`. We need to find `min_cost_ending_at[d_B][r_B]` for `r_B <= l_A - 1`. This is equivalent to finding the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d_B` that ends at `l_A - 1` or earlier.\n\nThe maximum coordinate value is `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`.\nLet's use an array `min_cost_for_duration_starting_at[d]` where `min_cost_for_duration_starting_at[d][k]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that starts at day `k`.\nAnd an array `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d]` where `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d][k]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that ends at day `k`.\n\nWe can iterate through all `l_i` values.\nLet `min_cost_ending_at_day[duration][day]` be the minimum cost of a voucher with `duration` that ends on `day`.\nLet `min_cost_starting_at_day[duration][day]` be the minimum cost of a voucher with `duration` that starts on `day`.\n\nInitialize `min_cost_ending_at_day` and `min_cost_starting_at_day` with infinity.\n\n**Revised Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n, x`.\n2.  Store vouchers grouped by their start day `l_i`. `vouchers_by_start_day[l]` will be a list of `(r, cost, duration)` for vouchers starting on day `l`.\n3.  Initialize `min_total_cost = infinity`.\n4.  Initialize `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[duration]` array of size `MAX_COORD + 1` with infinity. This array will store `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d][k]` as the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that ends at day `k`.\n5.  Iterate `current_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`:\n    a.  **Update `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at` for current_day-1 (propagation):** For each `d` from 1 to `x-1`, `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d][current_day-1]` should store the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that ends *at or before* `current_day-1`.\n        `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d][current_day-1] = min(min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d][current_day-1], min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d][current_day-2])` (if `current_day > 1`). This step is critical.\n    b.  **Process vouchers starting on `current_day`:** For each voucher `(r, cost, duration)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]`:\n        i.  Let `d_A = duration`. We need a second voucher `B` with `d_B = x - d_A`.\n        ii. If `d_B > 0` and `d_B < x`:\n            *   We are looking for a voucher `B` such that `r_B < current_day` (non-overlapping condition `r_B < l_A`).\n            *   The minimum cost for such a voucher `B` with duration `d_B` that ends at or before `current_day - 1` is `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d_B][current_day - 1]`.\n            *   If this cost is not infinity, `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost + min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[d_B][current_day - 1])`.\n    c.  **Update `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at` for current_day (direct updates):** For each voucher `(r, cost, duration)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]`:\n        *   `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[duration][r] = min(min_cost_for_duration_ending_at[duration][r], cost)`.\n        This step updates the minimum cost for a voucher of `duration` ending *exactly* at `r`.\n\nThe maximum coordinate value is `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`.\n`min_cost_for_duration_ending_at` should be an array of size `x` (for durations) by `MAX_COORD + 1` (for `r` values).\nThis will be `x * MAX_COORD` in size, which is `2 * 10^5 * 2 * 10^5 = 4 * 10^10`, too large for memory.\n\n**Corrected Data Structure for `min_cost_for_duration_ending_at`:**\n\nInstead of a 2D array, we can use a 1D array for each duration `d`.\n`min_cost_ending_at_day[d]` will be a 1D array of size `MAX_COORD + 1`.\n`min_cost_ending_at_day[d][k]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that ends *at or before* day `k`.\nThis means `min_cost_ending_at_day[d][k]` is always `min(min_cost_ending_at_day[d][k], min_cost_ending_at_day[d][k-1])`.\n\n1.  Read `n, x`.\n2.  `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`.\n3.  `vouchers_by_start_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]`.\n    For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`:\n    `duration = r - l + 1`.\n    `vouchers_by_start_day[l].append((r, cost, duration))`.\n4.  `min_total_cost = float('inf')`.\n5.  `min_cost_ending_at_day = [[float('inf')] * (MAX_COORD + 1) for _ in range(x + 1)]`.\n    (Note: `min_cost_ending_at_day[d][k]` means min cost for duration `d` ending *exactly* on `k`. We will propagate this to mean \"ending at or before\" in the loop.)\n\n6.  Iterate `current_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`:\n    a.  **Propagate `min_cost_ending_at_day` from `current_day - 1` to `current_day`:**\n        For `d` from 1 to `x`:\n            `min_cost_ending_at_day[d][current_day] = min(min_cost_ending_at_day[d][current_day], min_cost_ending_at_day[d][current_day - 1])`.\n        This ensures that `min_cost_ending_at_day[d][k]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that ends *at or before* day `k`.\n\n    b.  **Process vouchers starting on `current_day`:**\n        For each voucher `(r, cost, duration)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]`:\n            `d_A = duration`.\n            `d_B = x - d_A`.\n            If `d_B > 0` and `d_B < x`: // `d_A` and `d_B` must be positive\n                // We need a voucher B that ends before `current_day` (i.e., `r_B < current_day`).\n                // This means `r_B` can be at most `current_day - 1`.\n                `cost_B = min_cost_ending_at_day[d_B][current_day - 1]`.\n                If `cost_B != float('inf')`:\n                    `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost + cost_B)`.\n\n            // Update `min_cost_ending_at_day` for current voucher\n            // This voucher has duration `d_A` and ends at `r`.\n            `min_cost_ending_at_day[d_A][r] = min(min_cost_ending_at_day[d_A][r], cost)`.\n\n7.  If `min_total_cost == float('inf')`, print -1. Else, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Initialization:** `vouchers_by_start_day` takes O(N) to build. `min_cost_ending_at_day` takes O(x * MAX_COORD) to initialize. This is still too large. `2 * 10^5 * 2 * 10^5 = 4 * 10^10` elements.\n\n**The `min_cost_ending_at_day` array must be optimized.**\nWe don't need `min_cost_ending_at_day[d][k]` for all `k`. We only need `min_cost_ending_at_day[d][current_day-1]` when processing vouchers starting at `current_day`.\n\n**Final Optimized Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n, x`.\n2.  `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`.\n3.  `vouchers_by_start_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]`.\n    For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`:\n    `duration = r - l + 1`.\n    `vouchers_by_start_day[l].append((r, cost, duration))`.\n4.  `min_total_cost = float('inf')`.\n5.  `min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)`. This will store `min_cost_for_duration[d]` as the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that *has been processed so far and can potentially be the first voucher in a pair*.\n\n6.  Iterate `current_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`:\n    a.  **Process vouchers starting on `current_day`:**\n        For each voucher `(r, cost, duration)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]`:\n            `d_A = duration`.\n            `d_B = x - d_A`.\n            If `d_B > 0` and `d_B < x`: // `d_A` and `d_B` must be positive\n                // We are looking for a voucher B that ends before `current_day` (i.e., `r_B < current_day`).\n                // `min_cost_for_duration[d_B]` stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d_B` that\n                // has already been encountered (i.e., `r_B` was `current_day-1` or less).\n                `cost_B = min_cost_for_duration[d_B]`.\n                If `cost_B != float('inf')`:\n                    `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost + cost_B)`.\n\n    b.  **Update `min_cost_for_duration` with vouchers ending on `current_day`:**\n        For each voucher `(r, cost, duration)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]`:\n            // This voucher `(current_day, r, cost)` ends at `r`.\n            // We want to update `min_cost_for_duration[duration]` to reflect the minimum cost\n            // of a voucher with this duration that ends at `r`.\n            // This voucher can be the first voucher for any future voucher starting at `r+1` or later.\n            // So, we update `min_cost_for_duration[duration]` if `r == current_day` (i.e. `duration = 1`).\n            // No, this is not quite right. `min_cost_for_duration[d]` should store min cost for duration `d`\n            // that *ends at or before current_day-1*.\n\nLet's rethink `min_cost_for_duration`. It should store `min_cost_for_duration[d]` as the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has `r < current_day`.\n\n**Corrected Optimized Algorithm (Sweep Line Approach):**\n\n1.  Read `n, x`.\n2.  `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`.\n3.  `events = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 2)]`.\n    Each `event` will be `(type, duration, cost)`, where `type` is +1 for start and -1 for end.\n    For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`:\n    `duration = r - l + 1`.\n    `events[l].append((+1, duration, cost))`. // Voucher starts at `l`\n    `events[r + 1].append((-1, duration, cost))`. // Voucher ends conceptually before `r+1`\n\n    This is not quite right either, as we need to find pairs `(A, B)` where `r_A < l_B`.\n    This means `l_B` must be at least `r_A + 1`.\n\nLet's stick to iterating `current_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`.\nWe need to maintain for each duration `d`, the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has *already ended*.\n\n1.  Read `n, x`.\n2.  `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`.\n3.  `vouchers_starting_at = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]`.\n    `vouchers_ending_at = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]`.\n    For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`:\n    `duration = r - l + 1`.\n    `vouchers_starting_at[l].append((r, duration, cost))`.\n    `vouchers_ending_at[r].append((duration, cost))`.\n4.  `min_total_cost = float('inf')`.\n5.  `min_cost_available_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)`.\n    This array will store `min_cost_available_for_duration[d]` as the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that *has ended by `current_day - 1`*.\n\n6.  Iterate `current_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`:\n    a.  **Process vouchers that *start* on `current_day`:**\n        For each voucher `(r_A, d_A, cost_A)` in `vouchers_starting_at[current_day]`:\n            `d_B = x - d_A`.\n            If `d_B > 0` and `d_B < x`:\n                `cost_B = min_cost_available_for_duration[d_B]`.\n                If `cost_B != float('inf')`:\n                    `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_A + cost_B)`.\n\n    b.  **Update `min_cost_available_for_duration` with vouchers that *end* on `current_day`:**\n        For each voucher `(d, cost)` in `vouchers_ending_at[current_day]`:\n            `min_cost_available_for_duration[d] = min(min_cost_available_for_duration[d], cost)`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the non-overlapping condition `r_A < l_B`. When we process a voucher `A` starting at `l_A = current_day`, `min_cost_available_for_duration[d_B]` already contains costs of vouchers `B` that ended at `current_day - 1` or earlier.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: O(N + MAX_COORD)\n*   Loop `current_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`:\n    *   Step a (processing starts): Each voucher is processed once when its `l_i` is `current_day`. Total O(N) over all `current_day`. Inside, array lookup is O(1).\n    *   Step b (processing ends): Each voucher is processed once when its `r_i` is `current_day`. Total O(N) over all `current_day`. Inside, array update is O(1).\n*   Total time complexity: O(N + MAX_COORD).\n*   Space complexity: O(N + MAX_COORD) for `vouchers_starting_at`, `vouchers_ending_at`, and `min_cost_available_for_duration`.\n\nGiven `N, X, MAX_COORD <= 2 * 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MAX_COORD = 2 * 10**5\n\n    # vouchers_starting_at[l] stores list of (r, duration, cost) for vouchers starting on day l\n    vouchers_starting_at = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]\n    # vouchers_ending_at[r] stores list of (duration, cost) for vouchers ending on day r\n    vouchers_ending_at = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers_starting_at[l].append((r, duration, cost))\n        vouchers_ending_at[r].append((duration, cost))\n\n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # min_cost_available_for_duration[d] stores the minimum cost of a voucher\n    # with duration 'd' that has ended by 'current_day - 1'.\n    min_cost_available_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)\n\n    for current_day in range(1, MAX_COORD + 1):\n        # Phase 1: Process vouchers that START on current_day\n        # For each such voucher (A), we try to find a suitable second voucher (B)\n        # B must have ended by current_day - 1.\n        for r_A, d_A, cost_A in vouchers_starting_at[current_day]:\n            d_B = x - d_A\n            # d_A and d_B must both be positive durations\n            if 1 <= d_B < x: # d_A is implicitly 1 <= d_A < x here\n                cost_B = min_cost_available_for_duration[d_B]\n                if cost_B != float('inf'):\n                    min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_A + cost_B)\n\n        # Phase 2: Update min_cost_available_for_duration with vouchers that END on current_day\n        # These vouchers become available to be the \"first\" voucher for future vouchers\n        # that start on current_day + 1 or later.\n        for d, cost in vouchers_ending_at[current_day]:\n            if d <= x: # Only care about durations relevant to x\n                 min_cost_available_for_duration[d] = min(min_cost_available_for_duration[d], cost)\n\n    if min_total_cost == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total_cost)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
