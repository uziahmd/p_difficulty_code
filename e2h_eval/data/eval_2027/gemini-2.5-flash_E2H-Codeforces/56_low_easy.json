Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Guard Duty Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and immediately, it's screaming \"geometric matching.\" They're giving me Rebel spaceship coordinates (R) and base coordinates (B), and the goal is to make a perfect one-to-one assignment – each ship to one base, each base to one ship – *without* the connecting lines intersecting.  The constraint that no three points are collinear is helpful, it prevents a few annoying edge cases.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure the problem makes sense.  The setup implies a perfect matching, meaning `R` has to equal `B`. If `R` doesn't equal `B`, the answer is definitely \"No.\" That's a quick check I need to build in. If they *are* equal, let's call that number `N`.  So now, the goal becomes finding `N` pairs of (spaceship, base) connections that don't cross each other.\n\nThe key to non-intersecting segments is the order.  Two segments intersect if they form the diagonals of a convex quadrilateral. If you connect them as the sides instead, no intersection.  Sorting the points in a smart way is often the trick.  Since they didn't specify the order to put the points in, I assume I'm free to create an order of my own.  I need to consider the geometric properties to determine a good sort.\n\nA few ideas are floating around. If all the points were on a convex hull, or one set of points was entirely inside another, it could make this much easier, but that's not guaranteed. My first instinct would be to sort all the points (Rebels and Bases together) by x-coordinate, and then y-coordinate for ties. Then, there should be some elegant way to pair them.  The constraint that no three points are on the same line helps keep the comparisons clean.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about how to implement that sort-and-match strategy.  I'm envisioning the Python script taking the coordinates as input, validating that R equals B, then sorting and systematically checking for intersections while creating the matching.  This looks like a doable problem. I will first implement a function to check if two segments intersect. After that, create a function to generate a valid matching if possible. I'll probably end up using a backtracking or a graph algorithm to generate the valid assignment.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a perfect matching exists between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two segments connecting matched pairs intersect.\n\n**1. Basic Condition:**\nFor a perfect matching to exist, the number of Rebel spaceships `R` must be equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible to satisfy the condition \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So, if `R != B`, the answer is `No`.\n\n**2. Non-Intersecting Segments:**\nWhen `R = B = N`, we need to find a permutation `P` of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` such that connecting `Rebel[i]` to `Base[P[i]]` for all `i` results in non-intersecting segments.\nThe constraint `N <= 10` suggests that a solution with a complexity involving `N!` (like trying all permutations) might be acceptable.\n\nA key property of non-intersecting matchings in 2D is related to the concept of \"crossing\" segments. Two segments `P1Q1` and `P2Q2` intersect if and only if `P1` and `P2` are on opposite sides of the line `Q1Q2`, AND `Q1` and `Q2` are on opposite sides of the line `P1P2`. This can be efficiently checked using the cross product (or `ccw` / `orientation` function).\n\nGiven the small constraints (`N <= 10`), we can iterate through all possible permutations of base assignments for the Rebel spaceships and check if any permutation yields a non-intersecting matching.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `R` and `B`.\n2. Read `R` Rebel spaceship coordinates into a list `rebels`.\n3. Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n4. **Check `R == B`:** If `R != B`, print `No` and exit.\n5. If `R == B`, let `N = R`.\n6. Iterate through all permutations of the indices `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` for the `bases` list. For each permutation `p`:\n   a. Assume `rebels[i]` is matched with `bases[p[i]]` for all `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n   b. Check for intersections: For every distinct pair of indices `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < N`:\n      i. Let `P1 = rebels[i]`, `Q1 = bases[p[i]]`.\n      ii. Let `P2 = rebels[j]`, `Q2 = bases[p[j]]`.\n      iii. Use a geometric `intersect` function to determine if segment `P1Q1` intersects segment `P2Q2`.\n      iv. If any intersection is found, this permutation `p` is invalid. Break from the inner loop and try the next permutation.\n   c. If no intersections are found for all pairs `(i, j)`, then a valid non-intersecting matching has been found. Print `Yes` and exit.\n7. If all permutations are checked and none yield a non-intersecting matching, print `No`.\n\n**Geometric `intersect` function:**\nThe `intersect` function typically relies on the `orientation` (or `ccw`) function.\n`orientation(p, q, r)` returns:\n* `0` if `p, q, r` are collinear.\n* `1` if `p, q, r` are clockwise.\n* `2` if `p, q, r` are counter-clockwise.\n\nTwo segments `p1q1` and `p2q2` intersect if:\n1. `orientation(p1, q1, p2) != orientation(p1, q1, q2)` AND\n2. `orientation(p2, q2, p1) != orientation(p2, q2, q1)`\n\nThis covers general intersections. We also need to handle collinear cases (e.g., one endpoint lying on the other segment). The problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", which simplifies things slightly as we don't need to worry about segments overlapping perfectly or sharing an endpoint and being collinear. For non-collinear segments, the condition above is sufficient.\n\n**Example of `orientation` and `intersect`:**\n\n```python\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n          (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0: return 0  # Collinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2 # Clockwise or Counterclockwise\n\ndef on_segment(p, q, r):\n    # Given that p, q, r are collinear, check if q lies on segment pr\n    return (q[0] <= max(p[0], r[0]) and q[0] >= min(p[0], r[0]) and\n            q[1] <= max(p[1], r[1]) and q[1] >= min(p[1], r[1]))\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case\n    if o1 != 0 and o2 != 0 and o3 != 0 and o4 != 0 and \\\n       o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Collinear cases (not strictly needed due to problem constraints \"no three points on same line\",\n    # but good practice for robustness, though simplified here because of the guarantee)\n    # The problem guarantees no three points are collinear.\n    # This means if o1, o2, o3, o4 are all non-zero, then they can only intersect if o1!=o2 and o3!=o4.\n    # If any orientation is 0, it means three points are collinear, which is ruled out by the problem.\n    # Therefore, we only need to check the general case.\n    return False\n```\n\nWith the \"no three points on the same line\" guarantee, the `orientation` function will never return `0` for any three distinct points from the input. This simplifies `segments_intersect` to just checking `o1 != o2 and o3 != o4`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Point representation: (x, y)\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # Returns 1 if p, q, r are clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise.\n    # Returns 0 if collinear (not expected due to problem constraints).\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n          (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # Collinear - problem guarantees this won't happen for 3 distinct points.\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2 # Clockwise or Counterclockwise\n\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Check if segment p1q1 intersects segment p2q2.\n    # Due to \"no three points are on the same line\" guarantee,\n    # we don't need to handle collinear cases (e.g., an endpoint on another segment).\n    # Two segments intersect if and only if their endpoints are separated by the other segment's line.\n\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if orientations are different for both segments\n    # (i.e., p2 and q2 are on opposite sides of p1q1, AND p1 and q1 are on opposite sides of p2q2).\n    return o1 != o2 and o3 != o4\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        rebels.append(tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        bases.append(tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    N = R\n    \n    # Iterate through all permutations of base assignments to rebels\n    # p is a permutation of (0, 1, ..., N-1)\n    # rebels[i] will be matched with bases[p[i]]\n    for p in permutations(range(N)):\n        is_valid_matching = True\n        \n        # Check for intersections among all pairs of segments\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i + 1, N):\n                # Segment 1: rebels[i] to bases[p[i]]\n                p1_seg1 = rebels[i]\n                q1_seg1 = bases[p[i]]\n\n                # Segment 2: rebels[j] to bases[p[j]]\n                p2_seg2 = rebels[j]\n                q2_seg2 = bases[p[j]]\n\n                # Ensure segments are distinct (i.e., not matching the same points)\n                # This is implicitly handled by i != j and p[i] != p[j] in a permutation.\n                # Also, problem guarantees no two points coincide.\n                \n                if segments_intersect(p1_seg1, q1_seg1, p2_seg2, q2_seg2):\n                    is_valid_matching = False\n                    break # Found an intersection, this permutation is invalid\n            if not is_valid_matching:\n                break # Break from outer loop if inner loop found intersection\n\n        if is_valid_matching:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\") # No valid matching found after checking all permutations\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
