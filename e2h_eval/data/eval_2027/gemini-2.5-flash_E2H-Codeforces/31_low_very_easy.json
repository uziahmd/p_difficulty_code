Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The core idea is pretty straightforward. Vanya has a set of cards, and the sum of their values isn't zero. My goal is to figure out the minimum number of new cards Vanya needs to add to make the total sum zero.  The catch?  The new cards can only have values between -x and x, inclusive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the problem. The inputs are 'n', the number of existing cards; 'x', the maximum absolute value allowed on any card; and then the list of card values themselves.  The output needs to be the smallest number of cards Vanya needs to add.\n\nMy plan to solve this is:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Initial Sum:**  I'll start by summing up all the values on the cards Vanya already has. Let's call this `current_sum`.\n2.  **Determine the Target:**  Vanya wants a final sum of zero, so the additional cards need to sum to `-current_sum`.\n3.  **Minimize the Card Count:**  To minimize the number of cards, I need to use the largest possible values (in absolute terms) from -x to x. If `current_sum` is positive, I'll add cards with value -x. If `current_sum` is negative, I'll add cards with value x.\n4.  **Calculate the Required Cards:** I'll determine the absolute value of `current_sum` (`target_sum_abs`). The number of new cards needed is basically `ceil(target_sum_abs / x)`.  Integer division with a small adjustment is the most efficient way to achieve this `ceil` function in Python.\n\nFor instance, if `current_sum` is positive, I need to reach `-current_sum`.  I would add cards with the value of -x. If `current_sum` is negative, then I add cards with the value of x. This strategy, always selecting the card value that is closest to zero while maintaining the sign of the target, will give the fewest cards. This all makes sense, and I think I'm ready to code this up efficiently.\n",
