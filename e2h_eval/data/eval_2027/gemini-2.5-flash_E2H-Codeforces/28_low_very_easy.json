String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Decoding the \"Beautiful Strings\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to count \"beautiful strings.\"  Let's break down the rules:  a beautiful string is one composed only of '0's and '1's, containing precisely `n` zeros and `m` ones. The real challenge, though, lies in the modification rule: we repeatedly merge the last two characters according to this specific XOR-like logic, and the final single character must be `g`.  My initial thought was to quickly relate this to the standard XOR, but the operations don't completely align.\n\nInitially, I thought of trying `(a + b + 1) % 2`, but it fails on the '11' case.  Then, I considered  `1 - (a XOR b)`, still no luck with the '11' case. This calls for a shift in perspective.  Instead of trying to find a direct formula, let's analyze the effect of this modification on the overall structure. It seemed like the number of ones is key here.\n\nLet's look at the effect the modifcation rules have on the parity of the string.\n00 -> 1, total_ones - 0 or 2, parity change\n01 -> 0, total_ones - 1, parity change\n10 -> 0, total_ones - 1, parity change\n11 -> 0, total_ones - 2, parity change\n\nLet's denote the number of ones in the string as `ones`. The final string will be either a 0 or 1, dependign on the parity.\n- `0` means the parity is even (`ones % 2 == 0`)\n- `1` means the parity is odd  (`ones % 2 == 1`)\n\nThe number of operations is `n + m - 1`. If `g` is zero, there must have been an even number of 1's left in the final step.\nIf the number of operations is even the parity doesn't change from the initial step. If the number of operations is odd, the parity will flip.\nTherefore, `g` will be `(m + n -1 + ones) % 2` where `ones = m`.\n\nOkay, the string will be beautiful if  `g == (m + n -1 + ones) % 2`. This should lead us to a quick solution.\n\nI believe I can now translate this logic directly into a Python script and have an efficient solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings containing exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, such that after repeatedly applying a specific modification operation, the final single character is `g`. The result should be modulo 1000000007.\n\nLet's analyze the modification operation:\nWe replace the two last characters `s_{k-1}s_k` with a new character `s'`.\n- If `s_{k-1}s_k` is \"00\", `s'` is \"1\".\n- Otherwise (if `s_{k-1}s_k` is \"01\", \"10\", or \"11\"), `s'` is \"0\".\n\nLet's interpret '0' as the integer 0 and '1' as the integer 1.\nThe operation can be described as: `s' = 1` if `s_{k-1}=0` and `s_k=0`, otherwise `s' = 0`.\nThis is equivalent to `s' = (s_{k-1} == 0 && s_k == 0) ? 1 : 0`.\nOr, using arithmetic: `s' = (1 - s_{k-1}) * (1 - s_k)`.\n\nConsider the effect of this operation on the *sum* of the bits modulo 2.\nLet `S` be the sum of bits in the string.\nWhen we replace `s_{k-1}, s_k` with `s'`, the sum changes from `S_{old} = S_{prefix} + s_{k-1} + s_k` to `S_{new} = S_{prefix} + s'`.\nThe change in sum modulo 2 is `(s' - s_{k-1} - s_k) mod 2`.\n\nLet's check this for each case:\n1. `s_{k-1}=0, s_k=0`: `s'=1`. Change: `(1 - 0 - 0) mod 2 = 1`.\n2. `s_{k-1}=0, s_k=1`: `s'=0`. Change: `(0 - 0 - 1) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1`.\n3. `s_{k-1}=1, s_k=0`: `s'=0`. Change: `(0 - 1 - 0) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1`.\n4. `s_{k-1}=1, s_k=1`: `s'=0`. Change: `(0 - 1 - 1) mod 2 = -2 mod 2 = 0`.\n\nThis means that for every modification, the sum of bits modulo 2 either changes by 1 (cases 1, 2, 3) or by 0 (case 4).\nMore specifically, if the last two bits are `11`, the sum modulo 2 remains the same. Otherwise, it flips.\n\nThis transformation is equivalent to computing `1 - (s_{k-1} | s_k)` where `|` is bitwise OR.\nLet's consider the final character `X` obtained after all operations.\nIf the string has length `L`, we perform `L-1` operations.\nThe final character `X` can be calculated by applying the operation repeatedly from right to left.\nExample: `s_1 s_2 s_3 s_4`\n`s_1 s_2 s_3 (f(s_3, s_4))`\n`s_1 s_2 (f(s_2, f(s_3, s_4)))`\n`s_1 (f(s_1, f(s_2, f(s_3, s_4))))`\n\nThis is equivalent to `1 - (s_1 | (1 - (s_2 | (1 - (s_3 | s_4)))))`. This pattern is complex.\n\nA simpler observation:\nThe operation `f(a, b)` is `1` if `a=0, b=0`, and `0` otherwise.\nThis is equivalent to `1` if `a+b=0`, and `0` if `a+b > 0`.\nLet's analyze the *parity* of the number of zeros.\nLet `N_0` be the count of zeros and `N_1` be the count of ones.\nThe total length of the string is `L = N_0 + N_1`.\n\nCase 1: `m = 0`. The string consists only of zeros.\nString is `00...0` (`n` times).\n- If `n=1`, string is \"0\". No modifications possible. Final char is \"0\".\n  - If `g=0`, count 1.\n  - If `g=1`, count 0.\n- If `n > 1`:\n  The last two characters are \"00\". They are replaced by \"1\".\n  The string becomes `00...01`. (n-2 zeros, 1 one).\n  The next operation: `01` -> `0`.\n  The string becomes `00...0`. (n-3 zeros).\n  The next operation: `00` -> `1`.\n  The pattern is `00...0` -> `00...01` -> `00...0` -> `00...01` ...\n  The last character will always be \"0\" if `n` is odd, and \"1\" if `n` is even.\n  Let's trace:\n  `00` -> `1` (n=2, final 1)\n  `000` -> `01` -> `0` (n=3, final 0)\n  `0000` -> `001` -> `00` -> `1` (n=4, final 1)\n  So, if `m=0`:\n  - If `n` is odd, final character is '0'.\n  - If `n` is even, final character is '1'.\n  Thus, if `m=0`:\n    - If `g=0`: answer is 1 if `n` is odd, 0 if `n` is even.\n    - If `g=1`: answer is 1 if `n` is even, 0 if `n` is odd.\n  (Special case: `n=0, m=0` is forbidden by `n+m >= 1`).\n  (Special case: `n=0, m=1` means string \"1\". Final char \"1\". If `g=1`, count 1.) This is covered by `m=1` case below.\n\nCase 2: `m > 0`. The string contains at least one '1'.\nIf there is at least one '1' in the string, and we apply the operation repeatedly, the final character will *always* be '0'.\nWhy?\nThe operation `f(a,b)` returns '1' only if `a=0` and `b=0`. Otherwise, it returns '0'.\nIf at any point the string contains a '1', say `s_i = 1`, and we are performing `f(s_{k-1}, s_k)`:\n- If `s_k = 1` or `s_{k-1} = 1`, then `f(s_{k-1}, s_k)` will be '0'.\nThis means that if a '1' ever participates in an operation, the result is '0'.\nConsider the rightmost '1' in the string. Let its position be `p`.\n`... s_{p-1} 1 0 0 ... 0` (where `0 ... 0` has `k` zeros).\nIf `k >= 2`: `... s_{p-1} 1 0 0 ... 0` -> `... s_{p-1} 1 0 ... 0 1` (last two `00` become `1`).\nIf `k = 1`: `... s_{p-1} 1 0` -> `... s_{p-1} 0` (last two `10` become `0`).\nIf `k = 0`: `... s_{p-1} 1` (no trailing zeros).\n\nLet's track the *presence* of '1's.\nIf the string contains at least one '1', and we perform an operation `f(a,b)`:\n- If `a=0, b=0`, then `s'` is '1'. The number of '1's might increase.\n- If `a=0, b=1`, then `s'` is '0'. The number of '1's might decrease.\n- If `a=1, b=0`, then `s'` is '0'. The number of '1's might decrease.\n- If `a=1, b=1`, then `s'` is '0'. The number of '1's might decrease.\n\nCrucially, if the string contains *any* '1', and we are reducing the length, the final character will be '0'.\nProof by induction:\nBase case: String of length 2. `nm >= 1`.\n- \"01\": `f(0,1) = 0`. Final char '0'.\n- \"10\": `f(1,0) = 0`. Final char '0'.\n- \"11\": `f(1,1) = 0`. Final char '0'.\nIn all cases where `m > 0`, the final char is '0'.\n\nInductive step: Assume for any string of length `k` with `m > 0`, the final character is '0'.\nConsider a string of length `k+1` with `m > 0`. `s_1 ... s_{k-1} s_k s_{k+1}`.\nLet `s' = f(s_k, s_{k+1})`. The string becomes `s_1 ... s_{k-1} s'`.\nCase A: `s_k=0, s_{k+1}=0`. Then `s'=1`.\n  The original string had `m` ones. The new string `s_1 ... s_{k-1} 1` has `m+1` ones (if `s_k, s_{k+1}` were the only zeros, `m` becomes `m+1`).\n  Since `m > 0`, `m+1 > 0`. The new string has length `k` and contains at least one '1'. By inductive hypothesis, its final character is '0'.\nCase B: `s_k` or `s_{k+1}` is '1'. Then `s'=0`.\n  The new string `s_1 ... s_{k-1} 0` has length `k`.\n  If the original string had `m > 0` ones, and `s_k` or `s_{k+1}` was '1', then the new string `s_1 ... s_{k-1} 0` still contains at least `m-1` ones.\n  If `m-1 > 0`, then the new string has `m-1` ones and length `k`. By inductive hypothesis, its final character is '0'.\n  What if `m-1 = 0`? This means `m=1`. The original string contained exactly one '1'.\n  And this '1' was either `s_k` or `s_{k+1}`.\n  Example: `00...010` (the '1' is `s_k`, `s_{k+1}=0`). New string `00...00`. This case is `m=0` for the new string.\n  So if the original string was `...010` (length `k+1`, `m=1`), it becomes `...00` (length `k`, `m=0`).\n  From Case 1, if a string of `N` zeros results in '0' if `N` is odd, '1' if `N` is even.\n  So if `...010` becomes `...00`, the final character depends on the number of zeros.\n  Let the string be `s_1...s_{p-1}10...0` where there are `z` zeros after the `1`.\n  `s_1...s_{p-1}10...0` -> `s_1...s_{p-1}10...0` (z-2 zeros, 1 one) -> `s_1...s_{p-1}10...0` (z-3 zeros) -> ...\n  This process continues until the '1' is involved in an operation.\n  Example: `0100`. `m=1`. `n=3`.\n  `0100` -> `011` (00 -> 1)\n  `011` -> `00` (11 -> 0)\n  `00` -> `1` (00 -> 1)\n  Final '1'. This contradicts the \"always '0' if `m > 0`\" hypothesis.\n\nMy initial analysis of the operation was flawed. The property `s' = 0` if `s_{k-1} > 0` or `s_k > 0` (i.e. `s_{k-1} | s_k = 1`) is correct.\nThe property `1 - (a | b)` is the correct one.\n`00 -> 1`\n`01 -> 0`\n`10 -> 0`\n`11 -> 0`\n\nLet's re-examine the example `0100` (`n=3, m=1`).\n`0100`\n1. `00` -> `1`. String becomes `011`.\n2. `11` -> `0`. String becomes `00`.\n3. `00` -> `1`. String becomes `1`. Final char is '1'.\n\nSo, if `m > 0`, the final character is not necessarily '0'.\n\nLet's consider the parity of the number of zeros (`n`) and ones (`m`).\nThe operation `f(a,b)` is `1 - (a | b)`.\nLet `X_i` be the character at index `i`.\nThe final character is `f(X_1, f(X_2, f(..., f(X_{L-1}, X_L)...)))`.\n\nThis is a known operation: `NAND`.\n`a NAND b = 1 - (a | b)`.\nThe sequence of operations is `X_1 NAND (X_2 NAND (X_3 NAND ... (X_{L-1} NAND X_L)...))`.\nThis is equivalent to `X_1 NAND X_2 NAND ... NAND X_L` where NAND is right-associative.\n\nConsider the parity of `m`.\nIf `m` is even:\n  The final character is `1` if `n=0` (string `11...1`, `m` ones).\n  `1 NAND 1 = 0`\n  `1 NAND (1 NAND 1) = 1 NAND 0 = 1`\n  `1 NAND (1 NAND (1 NAND 1)) = 1 NAND 1 = 0`\n  ...\n  If `m` is even, string `11...1` results in `0`.\n  If `m` is odd, string `11...1` results in `1`.\n  So if `n=0`:\n    - If `g=0`: answer is 1 if `m` is even, 0 if `m` is odd.\n    - If `g=1`: answer is 1 if `m` is odd, 0 if `m` is even.\n\nIf `m` is odd and `n > 0`:\n  The final character is `0`.\n  Proof:\n  If there is at least one '0', say `X_k = 0`.\n  The expression is `X_1 NAND (X_2 NAND ... (X_k NAND ... (X_{L-1} NAND X_L)...))`.\n  Let `R_k = X_k NAND (X_{k+1} NAND ... (X_L)...)`.\n  If `X_k = 0`, then `R_k = 0 NAND (something) = 1 - (0 | something) = 1 - something`.\n  The expression becomes `X_1 NAND (X_2 NAND ... (X_{k-1} NAND R_k)...)`.\n  This is still complicated.\n\nLet's use the property `a NAND b = 1` iff `a=0` and `b=0`.\nThe final character is `1` if and only if:\n`X_1 = 0` AND `(X_2 NAND (X_3 NAND ...)) = 0`.\nThis implies `X_1 = 0` AND (`X_2 = 1` OR `(X_3 NAND ...) = 1`).\nThis is becoming a complex recursive definition.\n\nA simpler property of `a NAND b`:\n`a NAND b` is `1` if `a=0, b=0`.\n`a NAND b` is `0` if `a=1` or `b=1`.\n\nThe final result is `1` if and only if *all* characters are '0' AND the number of operations leads to '1'.\nNo, this is not true. Example `0100` -> `1`. Not all zeros.\n\nLet's look at the problem constraint `n,m <= 10^5`. This suggests a combinatorial solution, likely involving `nCr` (combinations).\nThe total number of strings is `C(n+m, n)`.\n\nConsider the final character `g`.\nIf `g=1`:\n  The only way to get a '1' is if the two inputs to the `NAND` operation are both '0'.\n  `f(A,B)=1` iff `A=0` and `B=0`.\n  So, the final `1` means `X_1=0` AND `f(X_2, f(...,X_L))=0`.\n  This means `X_1=0` AND (`X_2=1` OR `f(X_3,...) = 1`).\n  This is `X_1=0` AND (`X_2=1` OR (`X_3=0` AND `f(X_4,...) = 0`)).\n  This looks like a pattern: `010101...` or `0100100...`\n  A string `s_1 s_2 ... s_L` results in `1` if and only if `s_1=0` and `s_2=1` and `s_3=0` and `s_4=1` and so on, i.e., `s_i = (i-1)%2`. This is `010101...`.\n  Let's test this:\n  `01` -> `0` (not `1`)\n  `010` -> `00` -> `1` (This one works!)\n  `0101` -> `010` -> `00` -> `1` (This one works!)\n  `01010` -> `0101` -> `010` -> `00` -> `1` (This one works!)\n  It seems if the string is `(01)^k 0` or `(01)^k`, it results in `1`.\n  The string `(01)^k` means `0101...01`.\n  `f(0,1)=0`.\n  `f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,0)=1`. String `010`.\n  `f(0, f(1, f(0,1))) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,0)=1`. String `0101`.\n  `f(0, f(1, f(0, f(1,0)))) = f(0, f(1, f(0,0))) = f(0, f(1,1)) = f(0,0)=1`. String `01010`.\n  It seems that for strings `0101...` (alternating `0` and `1` starting with `0`), the result is `1`.\n  Specifically, if `s_i = (i-1)%2` (0-indexed `s_i = i%2`), i.e., `010101...`\n  The result is `1`.\n  Let `A_k` be the result for `0101...` of length `k`.\n  `A_1 = 0` (\"0\")\n  `A_2 = f(0,1) = 0` (\"01\")\n  `A_3 = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,0) = 1` (\"010\")\n  `A_4 = f(0, f(1, f(0,1))) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,0) = 1` (\"0101\")\n  `A_5 = f(0, f(1, f(0, f(1,0)))) = f(0, f(1, f(0,0))) = f(0, f(1,1)) = f(0,0) = 1` (\"01010\")\n  It seems `A_k = 1` for `k >= 3` and `k` odd.\n  `A_k = 1` for `k >= 3` and `k` even.\n  No, `A_1=0, A_2=0, A_3=1, A_4=1, A_5=1`.\n  This pattern is `A_k = 1` for `k >= 3`.\n\n  What if `X_1=1`? Then `f(1, B) = 0`. So if a string starts with `1`, the result is `0`.\n  What if `X_1=0, X_2=0`? Then `f(0, f(0, B)) = f(0, (1-(0|B))) = f(0, (1-B))`.\n  If `B=0`, `f(0,1)=0`. Result is `0`.\n  If `B=1`, `f(0,0)=1`. Result is `1`.\n  So `00B` -> `0(1-B)`.\n  If `000`: `01` -> `0`.\n  If `001`: `00` -> `1`.\n  This is the key.\n  A string `s` results in `1` if and only if `s` is of the form `00...01` (where the number of leading zeros is `n-1`, and `m=1`).\n  Let's check this hypothesis:\n  `0...01` (n-1 zeros, 1 one).\n  `f(0,1)=0`.\n  String becomes `0...00` (n zeros).\n  Now we have `n` zeros. From Case 1:\n    If `n` is odd, `0...0` -> `0`.\n    If `n` is even, `0...0` -> `1`.\n  So, if the string is `0...01` (with `n` zeros and `m=1`):\n    - If `n` is odd, final char is `0`.\n    - If `n` is even, final char is `1`.\n\nThis means:\nIf `g=1`:\n  Only possible if `m=1` and `n` is even. In this case, there is only one such string: `00...01`. So the count is 1.\n  What about `0100` -> `1`? Here `n=3, m=1`. `n` is odd. This contradicts the above.\n\nLet's track the *parity of the sum of bits*.\n`f(a,b)`: `00->1`, `01->0`, `10->0`, `11->0`.\nSum parity change `(s' - a - b) mod 2`:\n`00->1`: `(1-0-0) mod 2 = 1`. Sum flips.\n`01->0`: `(0-0-1) mod 2 = 1`. Sum flips.\n`10->0`: `(0-1-0) mod 2 = 1`. Sum flips.\n`11->0`: `(0-1-1) mod 2 = 0`. Sum stays same.\n\nThe sum of bits modulo 2 is `m mod 2`.\nIf `m` is even, `m mod 2 = 0`.\nIf `m` is odd, `m mod 2 = 1`.\n\nConsider the number of `11` pairs in a string. Let it be `k_{11}`.\nThe number of operations is `L-1 = n+m-1`.\nEach operation flips the sum parity, *unless* it's a `11` pair.\nSo the final character `X_f` has sum parity `m mod 2`.\n`X_f mod 2 = (m mod 2 + (n+m-1 - k_{11}) mod 2) mod 2`.\nThis is `X_f = (m + (n+m-1 - k_{11})) mod 2`.\nThis means `X_f = (n-1-k_{11}) mod 2`.\nThis is `X_f = (n-1 - (\\text{number of 11 pairs})) mod 2`.\nThis is the parity of the final result.\n\nThis means if `g=1`, we need `(n-1 - k_{11}) mod 2 = 1`.\nIf `g=0`, we need `(n-1 - k_{11}) mod 2 = 0`.\n\nThis approach is still complicated because `k_{11}` depends on the specific string and the order of operations (which is fixed to right-to-left).\n\nLet's look at the example cases:\n1. `n=1, m=1, g=0`. Output: 2.\n   Strings: \"01\", \"10\".\n   \"01\" -> `f(0,1) = 0`. Final '0'.\n   \"10\" -> `f(1,0) = 0`. Final '0'.\n   Both strings result in '0'. Count = 2. Correct.\n\n2. `n=2, m=2, g=0`.

So for `g=0`, count 6.\n   Wait, example output is 4. Why?\n   The example output strings for `n=2, m=2, g=0` are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".\n   My calculation for \"0101\" and \"0110\" also resulted in '0'. Why are they not included?\n   Let's double check `0101`.\n   `0101` -> `010` (`f(0,1)=0`)\n   `010` -> `00` (`f(1,0)=0`)\n   `00` -> `1` (`f(0,0)=1`)\n   Final char is '1'. So \"0101\" should NOT be counted for `g=0`.\n   Let's double check `0110`.\n   `0110` -> `010` (`f(1,0)=0`)\n   `010` -> `00` (`f(1,0)=0`)\n   `00` -> `1` (`f(0,0)=1`)\n   Final char is '1'. So \"0110\" should NOT be counted for `g=0`.\n   This means my general rule for `m > 0` resulting in `0` was incorrect.\n   The example output is correct based on my re-calculation. `C(4,2) - 2 = 6-2=4`.\n\n3. `n=1, m=1, g=1`. Output: 0.\n   Strings: \"01\", \"10\". Both result in '0'. So for `g=1`, count 0.

Let's look at the structure of the `NAND` operation.\n`X_1 NAND (X_2 NAND (X_3 NAND ...))`.\nThis is `1` iff `X_1 = 0` and `X_2 NAND (X_3 NAND ...) = 0`.\nThe right part `(X_2 NAND (X_3 NAND ...))` is `0` iff `X_2 = 1` or `X_3 NAND ... = 1`.\n\nConsider the final character `g`.\n\nCase 1: `g=1`.\nThe final character is `1` if and only if the string `s` contains an alternating prefix of `0101...` of some length `k`, followed by a suffix `t` that evaluates to `0`.\n`s = s_1 s_2 ... s_L`.\n`R(s) = 1` iff `s_1=0` and `R(s_2...s_L)=0`.\n`R(s_2...s_L)=0` iff `s_2=1` or `R(s_3...s_L)=1`.\nSo `R(s)=1` iff `s_1=0` AND (`s_2=1` OR `R(s_3...s_L)=1`).\n\nThis means the string must start with `0`. If `s_1=1`, `R(s)=0`.\nIf `s_1=0`:\n  `R(s)=1` iff `R(s_2...s_L)=0`.\n  So `s_2...s_L` must result in `0`.\n  When does `R(t)=0`?\n  `R(t)=0` iff `t_1=1` OR `R(t_2...t_L)=1`.\n\nThis is the key insight:\nThe string `s` results in `1` if and only if:\n1. `s` starts with `0`. (`s_1 = 0`)\n2. The remaining suffix `s_2...s_L` results in `0`. (`R(s_2...s_L) = 0`)\n3. The string `s_2...s_L` resulting in `0` means that `s_2 = 1` OR `R(s_3...s_L) = 1`.\n\nLet `f(s)` be the result of `s`.\n`f(s_1 s_2 ... s_L) = 1` iff `s_1 = 0` AND `f(s_2 ... s_L) = 0`.\n`f(s_1 s_2 ... s_L) = 0` iff `s_1 = 1` OR `f(s_2 ... s_L) = 1`.\n\nLet's define `S_0(n,m)` as the count of strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that result in `0`.\nLet `S_1(n,m)` as the count of strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that result in `1`.\nTotal strings `C(n+m, n) = S_0(n,m) + S_1(n,m)`.\n\n`S_1(n,m)`:\n  Strings must start with `0`. So we use one `0`. Remaining `n-1` zeros, `m` ones.\n  The suffix must result in `0`.\n  So `S_1(n,m) = S_0(n-1, m)` (for `n >= 1`).\n  If `n=0`, `S_1(0,m) = 0` (string starts with `1`).\n\n`S_0(n,m)`:\n  Strings can start with `0` or `1`.\n  If starts with `0`: `0` is used. Remaining `n-1` zeros, `m` ones. Suffix must result in `1`.\n    Count is `S_1(n-1, m)`.\n  If starts with `1`: `1` is used. Remaining `n` zeros, `m-1` ones. Suffix can result in `0` or `1`.\n    Count is `S_0(n, m-1) + S_1(n, m-1) = C(n+m-1, n)`.\n  So `S_0(n,m) = S_1(n-1, m) + C(n+m-1, n)` (for `m >= 1`).\n  If `m=0`:\n    `S_0(n,0)`: String is `00...0`.\n    `f(0)=0`, `f(00)=1`, `f(000)=0`, `f(0000)=1`.\n    So `S_0(n,0) = 1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even.
