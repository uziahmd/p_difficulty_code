Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The \"TV Game\" Problem: A Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nAlright, I'm facing the \"TV Game\" problem, a competitive programming challenge.  The core of this problem revolves around optimizing the total prize (sum of two numbers) formed by two players, Homer and Marge, taking digits from a given number. It all boils down to finding the optimal sequence of digit assignments, where each player gets exactly *n* moves and the goal is to *maximize* the sum of the resulting numbers.\n\nI've analyzed the constraints: *n* can be up to 18, meaning a number with up to 36 digits.  Crucially, attempting a brute-force approach, which would be trying every possible sequence, is completely out of the question due to the combinatorial explosion. The number of combinations is roughly 9 billion for n=18. Clearly, this needs a much more intelligent approach.\n\nAfter some thought, I've realized dynamic programming offers the best solution here. The problem has optimal substructure (the optimal solution for a portion of the problem contributes to the overall optimum), and it has overlapping subproblems.\n\nMy idea is to define a DP state: `dp(idx, h_rem, m_rem)`. Here, `idx` is the current digit's index, `h_rem` is the number of moves Homer still has, and `m_rem` is the number of moves Marge has left. The DP table will store the *maximum* prize achievable from the digits starting from `idx`, with the given number of remaining moves for each player.\n\nThe base case will be when there are no more digits and no more moves, and the recursive step will consider the current digit's contribution to the prize based on if Homer or Marge picks the digit. Crucially, the power of 10 used to position each digit in the final numbers must be calculated properly, making sure to account for where it lands based on the moves that come after it.\n\nThe overall time complexity is calculated at O(n^3) - that’s great, especially since n <=18. Also, I'll need to store the choice (Homer or Marge) at each step to reconstruct the solution. In general, all calculations fit within the capacity of a standard 64-bit integer.\n\nAfter I compute the DP table, I can reconstruct the optimal sequence. This plan seems solid, and I'm confident this Python script will solve this problem efficiently and correctly. Now, time to start coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer ('H') and Marge ('M') to maximize the total sum of the two numbers they form, S1 and S2. Each player must make exactly `n` moves out of a total of `2n` digits available. The digits are taken from left to right from the initial number `A`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let's define a state `dp(idx, h_rem, m_rem)` as the maximum possible sum `S1 + S2` that can be achieved considering the digits from `A[idx:]` onwards, given that Homer still needs to make `h_rem` moves and Marge still needs to make `m_rem` moves.\n\nThe base case for our recursion is when `idx == 2 * n`, meaning all digits have been processed. In this case, no more moves are needed, and the additional sum is 0. So, `dp(2 * n, 0, 0) = 0`.\n\nFor a general state `dp(idx, h_rem, m_rem)`:\nWe consider the current digit `A_digits[idx]`.\n1.  **Homer takes the digit:** If `h_rem > 0` (Homer still needs to make moves), Homer can take `A_digits[idx]`. This digit will be the `(n - h_rem)`-th digit (0-indexed) in Homer's final number `S1`. Therefore, it contributes `A_digits[idx] * 10^(h_rem - 1)` to `S1`. The remaining problem is `dp(idx + 1, h_rem - 1, m_rem)`.\n    `val_H = A_digits[idx] * (10**(h_rem - 1)) + dp(idx + 1, h_rem - 1, m_rem)`\n\n2.  **Marge takes the digit:** If `m_rem > 0` (Marge still needs to make moves), Marge can take `A_digits[idx]`. This digit will be the `(n - m_rem)`-th digit (0-indexed) in Marge's final number `S2`. It contributes `A_digits[idx] * 10^(m_rem - 1)` to `S2`. The remaining problem is `dp(idx + 1, h_rem, m_rem - 1)`.\n    `val_M = A_digits[idx] * (10**(m_rem - 1)) + dp(idx + 1, h_rem, m_rem - 1)`\n\nThe value `dp(idx, h_rem, m_rem)` will be the maximum of `val_H` (if Homer can move) and `val_M` (if Marge can move). We store this maximum value and the corresponding choice ('H' or 'M') in memoization tables to avoid redundant computations and to reconstruct the path later.\n\nThe state space for the DP is `(2n + 1) * (n + 1) * (n + 1)`. For `n=18`, this is `37 * 19 * 19`, which is approximately 13,369 states. Each state computation involves a few arithmetic operations and two recursive calls. This makes the total time complexity `O(n^3)`, which is efficient enough for `n <= 18`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the large sums `S1 + S2` without overflow.\n\nAfter computing the `dp` table, we reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves by backtracking through the `memo_choice` table, starting from `(0, n, n)` until all `2n` moves are made.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set a high recursion limit for deep recursion, though for n=18 the depth is 2n=36, which is fine.\n# sys.setrecursionlimit(2000) \n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    A_digits = [int(d) for d in A_str]\n\n    # memo[idx][h_rem][m_rem] stores the maximum total prize\n    # memo_choice[idx][h_rem][m_rem] stores 'H' or 'M' for the optimal choice\n    memo = {}\n    memo_choice = {}\n\n    def dp(idx, h_rem, m_rem):\n        # Base case: All digits processed\n        if idx == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n\n        # Check memoization table\n        if (idx, h_rem, m_rem) in memo:\n            return memo[(idx, h_rem, m_rem)]\n\n        current_digit = A_digits[idx]\n        \n        max_val = -1 # Initialize with a value that will be surely overwritten\n        choice = ''\n\n        # Option 1: Homer takes the digit\n        if h_rem > 0:\n            # The power of 10 for this digit is (h_rem - 1) because h_rem is the count of remaining moves\n            # including the current one.
