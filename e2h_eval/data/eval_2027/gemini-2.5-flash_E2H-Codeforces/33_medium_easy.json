You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Algorithm for Replacing Digits to Maximize a Number**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to make the largest possible number by swapping digits from a pool (`s`) into another number (`a`). The core idea is greedy: prioritize the most significant digits. I'll convert `a` and `s` into lists. First, I'll sort `s` *descendingly* because I want the *largest* digits first. This sets up the replacements. Then, I go through `a` digit-by-digit, left to right. At each position, I grab the *largest available* digit from `s` (tracked by `s_ptr`). I compare. If the largest available digit in `s` is greater than the current digit in `a`, *replace it*. I advance the `s_ptr` to the *next* largest available `s` digit. If the `s` digit is *not* greater, I *leave* the `a` digit as is and keep the `s` digit for a *later* potential replacement. This ensures I never *decrease* the number, only increase it or leave it. This greedy approach is optimal because changing the leftmost digits to the largest possible values has the biggest impact. The final result will be joined back into a string and printed.\n",
