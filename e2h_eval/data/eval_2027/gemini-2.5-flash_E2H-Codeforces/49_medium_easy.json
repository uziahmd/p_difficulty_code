They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The Mushroom Strife Problem: My Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're given a graph where the edges represent mushroom roads, and each road tells us the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. Our goal is to figure out the number of mushrooms on each lawn, or determine if it's impossible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the fundamental relationship: `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`.  This is key. Let's say `x_u` and `x_v` are the mushroom counts on two connected lawns `u` and `v`, and the edge connecting them has a GCD of `g` and an LCM of `l`. Then, `g * l = x_u * x_v`. Also, `x_u` and `x_v` must both be multiples of `g`, and both must divide `l`.\n\nTo make the problem easier, let's express `x_u` and `x_v` as multiples of `g`. `x_u = g * a` and `x_v = g * b`. This gives us `g * l = g^2 * a * b`, which simplifies to `l / g = a * b`.  Furthermore, since `GCD(a,b)` needs to be 1.  It's clear that if `l % g != 0` then we have \"NO\" solution.\n\nNow, we need to find `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` partition the prime factors of `l/g`. To find `a` and `b`, we're essentially looking at the prime factorization of `l/g`. We need to divide the prime powers between `a` and `b` in such a way that they don't share any prime factors.  There are a limited number of possibilities for `a`. We also need to check this condition, `a | l/g`.\n\nSince the problem asks for any valid solution, I think we can choose any one pair of `a` and `b` for each edge.\n\nMy plan now is this:\n\n1.  **Preprocessing:** Precompute primes and store all the factors.\n2.  **Iterate through Edges:** For each edge (u, v) with a GCD and LCM:\n    *   Check for infeasibility (l % g != 0).\n    *   Calculate `k = l / g`.\n    *   Find the prime factors of k and determine a candidate set for (a,b).\n\n3.  **Graph Propagation:**\n    *   I'll initialize some data structure to hold the solution, i.e., number of mushrooms for each lawn `x_u`.\n    *   I'll then use BFS or DFS, starting from an unvisited lawn, try each possible solution for a,b based on the constraints.\n    *   While processing, If any of the constraints are violated (e.g. there is no GCD, or there isn't a LCM). Output \"NO\".\n    *   We need to keep track of the mushroom counts and check with the neighbors to make sure everything's correct.\n\nThis looks like a constraint satisfaction problem, so let's get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to restore the number of mushrooms `x_i` on each lawn `i`, given `m` roads. For each road connecting lawns `u` and `v`, we are given `g = GCD(x_u, x_v)` and `l = LCM(x_u, x_v)`. If a solution exists, print \"YES\" and one such assignment; otherwise, print \"NO\". The mushroom counts are between 1 and 10^6.\n\n**Key Property:**\nFor any two positive integers `a` and `b`, `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`.\nSo, for an edge between `u` and `v` with given `g` and `l`, we must have `x_u * x_v = g * l`.\n\nAlso, for any prime `p`, let `v_p(N)` denote the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `N`.\nFrom the properties of GCD and LCM:\n1. `v_p(g) = min(v_p(x_u), v_p(x_v))`\n2. `v_p(l) = max(v_p(x_u), v_p(x_v))`\n\nCombining these with `v_p(x_u) + v_p(x_v) = v_p(g) + v_p(l)`, we can deduce that for each prime `p`:\nEither `(v_p(x_u), v_p(x_v)) = (v_p(g), v_p(l))` OR `(v_p(x_u), v_p(x_v)) = (v_p(l), v_p(g))`.\n\n**Algorithm Strategy:**\nThis problem can be solved by determining the exponent `v_p(x_i)` for each prime `p` and each lawn `i` independently.\n\n1.  **Precomputation:**\n    *   Find all prime numbers up to `10^6` using a sieve.\n    *   For each number `N` up to `10^6`, precompute its prime factorization. Store `spf[N]` (smallest prime factor of `N`) to efficiently factorize numbers.\n\n2.  **Initial Checks and Data Structures:**\n    *   For each edge `(u, v)` with `g, l`:\n        *   Check if `l % g != 0`. If not, no solution exists, print \"NO\" and exit.\n        *   Store the edge information. An adjacency list `adj[u]` will store `(v, g, l)`.\n    *   `final_exponents[i]` will be a dictionary mapping prime `p` to `v_p(x_i)`. Initialize `final_exponents[i]` as an empty dictionary for all `i`.\n    *   `q = deque()`: A queue for nodes whose `v_p(x_i)` for some prime `p` has been determined and needs to be propagated.\n    *   `prime_factors_to_check`: A set of all distinct prime factors encountered in any `g` or `l` value.\n\n3.  **Processing Fixed Exponents:**\n    For each edge `(u, v)` with `g, l`:\n    *   Factorize `g` and `l` to get `v_p(g)` and `v_p(l)` for all relevant primes `p`.\n    *   For each prime `p` that divides `g` or `l`:\n        *   If `v_p(g) == v_p(l)`: This means `v_p(x_u)` and `v_p(x_v)` must both be `v_p(g)`.\n            *   Try to set `final_exponents[u][p] = v_p(g)`. If `final_exponents[u][p]` was already set to a different value, it's a contradiction, print \"NO\" and exit. If it was just set, add `(u, p)` to `q`.\n            *   Similarly for `v`: Try to set `final_exponents[v][p] = v_p(g)`. If contradiction, print \"NO\" and exit.
