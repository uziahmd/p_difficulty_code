They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Playoff Problem Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of how to tackle this Playoff problem. My goal is to find all the \"winning integers\" x â€“ skill levels that *could* win the whole tournament given the right arrangement of skills. \n\nThe crux of the problem is a single-elimination tournament with a very specific rule system. We have $2^n$ teams with distinct skill levels, represented by a permutation. There's a string 's' of length 'n' that determines the winner of *each phase* of the tournament.  If the string element is '0', the *lower* skilled team wins; if it's '1', the *higher* skilled team wins.\n\nMy intuition says it has to do with how many times the lower skill wins ('0' in 's') vs. the number of times the higher skill wins ('1' in 's'). I've realized that the initial, or \"relative\" positions of the teams in the bracket don't change -- it's who they face that matters, and *we* can manipulate this through the original permutation. The winning integer, call it *X*, just needs to win its matches. \n\nHere's my thought process. If *X* wins, it has to win n games against opponents, so there's a fixed path that *X* takes through the tournament. It's not *just* about being greater or less than specific numbers, like I initially thought. It's about beating the right people in the right sub-brackets.\n\n*   **Key Concept:** *X* must be greater than $count_1$ skills, where $count_1$ is the count of '1's in the string 's'. *X* must also be less than $count_0$ skills. It means $X \\geq count_1 + 1$ and $X \\leq 2^n - count_0$.\n*   **Brackets:** These opponents in the specific brackets are *themselves* winners of their own previous games. They've *also* got winning conditions to satisfy. This creates a nested structure.\n*   **Permutation Power:** Because we can choose any permutation, *we* get to define the relative skill of *X* and its opponents.\n*   **Boundaries:** Based on these rules, I have a range. It can be shown that the winning integers will be on a contiguous range based on the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nThus, based on the counts of '0' and '1' in *s*, I can now find the winning skill range, and this approach applies. The final answer lies within the range $count_1+1$ and $2^n - count_0$.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) that can win a playoff tournament, given that we can arbitrarily assign skill levels to the initial $2^n$ teams. The tournament has $n$ phases. In phase $i$, $2^{n-i}$ games are played. The rule for winning a game in phase $i$ is determined by $s_i$: if $s_i = '0'$, the team with lower skill wins; if $s_i = '1'$, the team with higher skill wins.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of a winning skill $X$.\nA team with skill $X$ must win $n$ games to become the champion.\nFor each phase $i$ from $1$ to $n$:\n- If $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must defeat an opponent $Y_i$ such that $X > Y_i$.\n- If $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must defeat an opponent $Y_i$ such that $X < Y_i$.\n\nLet $count_0$ be the number of '0's in the string $s$, and $count_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$. Note that $count_0 + count_1 = n$.\nFor $X$ to win the tournament, it must be greater than $count_1$ distinct skills (its opponents in phases where $s_i='1'$) and smaller than $count_0$ distinct skills (its opponents in phases where $s_i='0'$).\n\nThe crucial part is that we can choose the permutation $p$. This means we can assign skills $1, \\dots, 2^n$ to the $2^n$ initial team slots in any way we want. This freedom simplifies the problem greatly. We don't need to worry about the specific bracket structure beyond the fact that $X$ needs $n$ opponents. We can choose any $n$ distinct skills to be $X$'s opponents, as long as they satisfy the conditions relative to $X$. The remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skills can be assigned to other teams in a way that they eventually get eliminated, allowing $X$ and its chosen opponents to meet as required.\n\nLet's find the minimum possible winning skill $X_{min}$.\nTo minimize $X$:\n1. $X$ must be greater than $count_1$ distinct skills. To make $X$ as small as possible, these $count_1$ skills should be the smallest available: $1, 2, \\dots, count_1$. This implies $X \\ge count_1 + 1$.\n2. $X$ must be smaller than $count_0$ distinct skills. To make $X$ as small as possible, these $count_0$ skills should be the smallest possible values greater than $X$: $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+count_0$.\n\nCombining these, the set of $n+1$ skills involved in $X$'s path to victory would be $\\{1, 2, \\dots, count_1\\} \\cup \\{X\\} \\cup \\{X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+count_0\\}$.\nFor these $n+1$ skills to be distinct and valid within the range $[1, 2^n]$, the maximum skill used, $X+count_0$, must be less than or equal to $2^n$.\nSo, we need $X \\ge count_1 + 1$ and $X+count_0 \\le 2^n$.\nThe minimum $X$ satisfying these conditions is $X_{min} = count_1 + 1$.\nThis value is valid if $(count_1 + 1) + count_0 \\le 2^n$, which simplifies to $n+1 \\le 2^n$. This inequality holds for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum possible winning skill $X_{max}$.\nTo maximize $X$:\n1. $X$ must be greater than $count_1$ distinct skills. To make $X$ as large as possible, these $count_1$ skills should be the largest possible values less than $X$: $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-count_1$.\n2. $X$ must be smaller than $count_0$ distinct skills. To make $X$ as large as possible, these $count_0$ skills should be the largest available: $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-count_0+1$. This implies $X \\le 2^n - count_0$.\n\nCombining these, the set of $n+1$ skills involved in $X$'s path to victory would be $\\{X-count_1, \\dots, X-1\\} \\cup \\{X\\} \\cup \\{2^n-count_0+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nFor these $n+1$ skills to be distinct and valid within the range $[1, 2^n]$, the minimum skill used, $X-count_1$, must be greater than or equal to $1$.\nSo, we need $X \\le 2^n - count_0$ and $X-count_1 \\ge 1$.\nThe maximum $X$ satisfying these conditions is $X_{max} = 2^n - count_0$.\nThis value is valid if $(2^n - count_0) - count_1 \\ge 1$, which simplifies to $2^n - n \\ge 1$. This inequality holds for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nSo, any integer $X$ such that $count_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - count_0$ can be a winning skill.\nTo demonstrate that all integers in this range are winning:\nFor a given $X$ in this range, we can assign skills as follows:\n- For the $count_1$ opponents $X$ must beat (where $X$ is higher skill), assign skills $1, \\dots, count_1$. These are all $<X$ because $X \\ge count_1+1$.\n- For the $count_0$ opponents $X$ must beat (where $X$ is lower skill), assign skills $2^n-count_0+1, \\dots, 2^n$. These are all $>X$ because $X \\le 2^n-count_0$.\n- Assign skill $X$ to the chosen winning team.\nThe set of skills used for $X$ and its opponents is $\\{1, \\dots, count_1\\} \\cup \\{X\\} \\cup \\{2^n-count_0+1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nAre these skills distinct?\nThe maximum skill in the first set is $count_1$.\nThe minimum skill in the third set is $2^n-count_0+1$.\nSince $count_1+count_0 = n$, we have $2^n-count_0+1 = 2^n-(n-count_1)+1 = 2^n-n+count_1+1$.\nFor these sets to be disjoint, we need $count_1 < 2^n-n+count_1+1$, which simplifies to $0 < 2^n-n+1$. This is true for all $n \\ge 1$.\nAlso, $X$ must be distinct from both sets. This is guaranteed by $X \\ge count_1+1$ and $X \\le 2^n-count_0$.\nThe total number of skills used is $count_1 + 1 + count_0 = n+1$.\nThe remaining $2^n-(n+1)$ skills can be assigned to other teams in such a way that they are eliminated before they meet $X$ or its designated opponents.\n\nTherefore, the winning integers are all integers $x$ in the range $[count_1 + 1, 2^n - count_0]$.\n\nLet's recheck the example: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$count_0 = 1$ (for $s_2='0'$)\n$count_1 = 2$ (for $s_1='1', s_3='1'$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\n$X_{min} = count_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n$X_{max} = 2^n - count_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe range is $[3, 7]$.\nThe example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$. My range includes $3$ but the example output does not.\nThis suggests my interpretation of \"arbitrary permutation $p$\" is too broad, or there's a subtle constraint I missed.\n\nThe interpretation of \"arbitrary permutation $p$\" is usually that we can assign any skill value to any initial team slot.\nThe example output $4,5,6,7$ for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is from an actual contest. This means my simple calculation of $X_{min}$ and $X_{max}$ is incorrect.\n\nThe error must be in assuming that the $n$ opponents of $X$ are just $n$ arbitrary skills. They are not. Each opponent $Y_k$ in phase $k$ is itself a winner of a sub-bracket of size $2^{k-1}$. This means $Y_k$ has already won $k-1$ games. $Y_k$ also needs to satisfy conditions for its own path to victory within its sub-bracket.\n\nLet's re-evaluate what an opponent $Y_k$ needs to do.\nSuppose $X$ is the winner.\nIn phase $i$, $X$ plays against $Y_i$.\n$Y_i$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of size $2^{i-1}$.\nThis means $Y_i$ had to win $i-1$ games.\nLet $s_{sub} = s_1 s_2 \\dots s_{i-1}$ be the rules for $Y_i$'s path.\nThe number of '1's in $s_{sub}$ is $count_1(s_1 \\dots s_{i-1})$.\nThe number of '0's in $s_{sub}$ is $count_0(s_1 \\dots s_{i-1})$.\nSo, $Y_i$ must be greater than $count_1(s_1 \\dots s_{i-1})$ skills and smaller than $count_0(s_1 \\dots s_{i-1})$ skills.\nThe minimum possible skill for $Y_i$ would be $count_1(s_1 \\dots s_{i-1}) + 1$.\nThe maximum possible skill for $Y_i$ would be $2^{i-1} - count_0(s_1 \\dots s_{i-1})$.\n\nThis is still not quite right. The $s_i$ refers to the $i$-th phase of the *overall* tournament.\nFor any game at depth $d$ (root is depth 0, leaves depth $n$), the rule $s_{d+1}$ applies.\nSo if $X$ plays its $k$-th game (in phase $k$), the rule $s_k$ applies.\nIts opponent $Y_k$ has won $k-1$ games. The rules $s_1, \\dots, s_{k-1}$ applied to $Y_k$'s path.\n\nLet's count how many teams must be smaller than $X$ and how many must be larger than $X$.\nIf $s_k = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than $Y_k$. So $Y_k < X$.\nIf $s_k = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than $Y_k$. So $Y_k > X$.\n\nConsider the total number of teams that must be strictly smaller than $X$.\nThese include $count_1$ opponents $Y_k$ where $s_k='1'$.\nEach such $Y_k$ itself won $k-1$ games. In these $k-1$ games, $Y_k$ also defeated some opponents.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ and its \"lineage\" of opponents must defeat determines the minimum/maximum $X$.\n\nLet's count the number of teams that must be smaller than $X$.\n$X$ itself must be greater than $count_1$ opponents.\nEach of these $count_1$ opponents $Y_k$ (where $s_k='1'$) must have won $k-1$ games.\nThe total number of teams $X$ directly or indirectly defeats is $2^{count_1}$.\nThis is because in each phase $k$ where $s_k='1'$, $X$ takes the larger skill. The smaller skill is eliminated. This means $X$ \"dominates\" that branch. If $X$ wins $count_1$ games as the higher skill, it means $X$ effectively claims $2^{count_1}$ slots in the tournament bracket. The skills in these $2^{count_1}$ slots must be such that $X$ can win all these games.\nThe smallest possible skill $X$ can have is $1$. If $X=1$, it can only win if all $s_i='0'$.\nThe largest possible skill $X$ can have is $2^n$. If $X=2^n$, it can only win if all $s_i='1'$.\n\nLet $N_{small}$ be the number of teams whose skills must be strictly smaller than $X$.\nLet $N_{large}$ be the number of teams whose skills must be strictly larger than $X$.\nThe number of teams in total is $2^n$.\nThe winning skill $X$ must be chosen from the range $[N_{small}+1, 2^n - N_{large}]$.\n\nConsider a specific path in the tournament bracket from an initial team slot to the final champion slot. This path consists of $n$ games.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill wins. This means the winner \"consumes\" the other half of the bracket.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill wins. This means the winner is \"consumed\" by the other half of the bracket in terms of skill value.\n\nLet's denote $N_1$ as the number of '1's in $s$ and $N_0$ as the number of '0's in $s$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the winner $X$ must be greater than its opponent $Y_i$. $Y_i$ is the winner of a sub-bracket of size $2^{i-1}$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the winner $X$ must be smaller than its opponent $Y_i$. $Y_i$ is the winner of a sub-bracket of size $2^{i-1}$.\n\nThe crucial observation from similar problems:\nThe number of teams that must be *smaller* than the winner $X$ is $2^{count_1}-1$.\nThe number of teams that must be *larger* than the winner $X$ is $2^{count_0}-1$.\nWhy?\nConsider a game where $s_i = '1'$. The winner $W$ has skill $X$. Its opponent $L$ has skill $Y_i$. $X > Y_i$. All teams that $L$ defeated to reach this game must also be smaller than $X$. The sub-bracket that $L$ comes from has $2^{i-1}$ initial teams. $L$ is one of them, and it defeated $2^{i-1}-1$ teams. All these $2^{i-1}$ skills must be smaller than $X$.\nNo, this is not right. $L$ is just one skill. It defeated $i-1$ teams. The skills of these $i-1$ teams and $L$ must be smaller than $X$. This is not $2^{i-1}$ teams.\n\nLet's trace the skills.\n$X$ plays $n$ games.\nIn $count_1$ games, $X$ is the higher skill.\nIn $count_0$ games, $X$ is the lower skill.\n\nConsider the $count_1$ games where $X$ is the higher skill. Each such game eliminates one team whose skill is less than $X$.\nConsider the $count_0$ games where $X$ is the lower skill. Each such game eliminates one team whose skill is greater than $X$.\n\nThe number of skills that must be smaller than $X$ is $2^{count_1}-1$.\nThe number of skills that must be larger than $X$ is $2^{count_0}-1$.\nThis is a standard result for these problems. Let's try to prove it.\nLet $S_1$ be the set of indices $i$ where $s_i = '1'$. Let $S_0$ be the set of indices $i$ where $s_i = '0'$.\nIf $X$ wins, it means it is the champion of a $2^n$ team bracket.\nConsider the $count_1$ phases where $X$ wins as the higher skill. For each such phase $i \\in S_1$, $X$ plays against a winner $Y_i$ of a $2^{i-1}$-team sub-bracket. $X > Y_i$. All $2^{i-1}$ teams that could have potentially won that sub-bracket (i.e., the $2^{i-1}$ teams in $Y_i$'s initial sub-bracket) must be assigned skills such that $Y_i$ wins, and $Y_i < X$.\nThis is what enables $X$ to win as the higher skill. The $2^{i-1}$ teams in $Y_i$'s sub-bracket must all be smaller than $X$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins. The $2^{i-1}$ initial teams in the other sub-bracket must have skills smaller than $X$.The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ that can win a playoff tournament. There are $2^n$ teams, and $p$ is a permutation of $1, \\dots, 2^n$ representing their skill levels. The tournament proceeds in $n$ phases. In phase $i$, $2^{n-i}$ games are played. The rule for winning a game in phase $i$ is given by $s_i$: if $s_i = '0'$, the team with lower skill wins; if $s_i = '1'$, the team with higher skill wins. We can choose the permutation $p$ arbitrarily.\n\nLet $count_0$ be the number of '0's in the string $s$, and $count_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$. We know $count_0 + count_1 = n$.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of a team with skill $X$ that wins the tournament.\nTo win, $X$ must win $n$ games.\n- In $count_1$ of these games (where $s_i = '1'$), $X$ must have a higher skill than its opponent.\n- In $count_0$ of these games (where $s_i = '0'$), $X$ must have a lower skill than its opponent.\n\nThe crucial part is that we can choose the permutation $p$. This allows us to assign skill values to the initial team slots in any way that facilitates $X$ winning.\n\nConsider the range of skills that can win.\nLet $X$ be the skill of the winning team.\nThe winner $X$ plays $n$ games. In each game, $X$ plays against the winner of an opposing sub-bracket.\nLet's determine the minimum number of skills that must be smaller than $X$, and the minimum number of skills that must be larger than $X$.\n\n1.  **Skills smaller than $X$**:\n    For each phase $i$ where $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must win by having a higher skill than its opponent, say $Y_i$. So $X > Y_i$.\n    The opponent $Y_i$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of size $2^{i-1}$. All $2^{i-1}$ initial teams in $Y_i$'s sub-bracket must be assigned skills such that $Y_i$ can win its sub-bracket, and $Y_i < X$.\n    To make $X$ win as the higher skill, we can assign skills such that $Y_i$ is the maximum possible skill in its $2^{i-1}$-team sub-bracket, and all $2^{i-1}$ skills in that sub-bracket are less than $X$.\n    This means that for each $i$ where $s_i = '1'$, there are $2^{i-1}$ initial team slots in the opponent's sub-bracket. All skills assigned to these $2^{i-1}$ slots must be less than $X$.\n    The $count_1$ phases where $X$ wins as the higher skill are independent in terms of the initial team slots involved. Each such phase $i$ corresponds to $X$ defeating a sub-bracket of size $2^{i-1}$.\n    The total number of initial teams that must have skills less than $X$ (excluding $X$ itself) is the sum of $2^{i-1}$ for all $i$ where $s_i = '1'$.\n    This sum is $\\sum_{i \\in S_1} 2^{i-1}$.\n    For example, if $s = \"101\"$, $n=3$. $S_1 = \\{1, 3\\}$.\n    Number of skills less than $X$ is $2^{1-1} + 2^{3-1} = 2^0 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$.\n    This implies $X$ must be at least $5+1=6$.\n\n2.  **Skills larger than $X$**:\n    For each phase $i$ where $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must win by having a lower skill than its opponent, say $Y_i$. So $X < Y_i$.\n    The opponent $Y_i$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of size $2^{i-1}$. All $2^{i-1}$ initial teams in $Y_i$'s sub-bracket must be assigned skills such that $Y_i$ can win its sub-bracket, and $Y_i > X$.\n    Similarly, for each $i$ where $s_i = '0'$, there are $2^{i-1}$ initial team slots in the opponent's sub-bracket. All skills assigned to these $2^{i-1}$ slots must be greater than $X$.\n    The total number of initial teams that must have skills greater than $X$ (excluding $X$ itself) is the sum of $2^{i-1}$ for all $i$ where $s_i = '0'$.\n    This sum is $\\sum_{i \\in S_0} 2^{i-1}$.\n    For example, if $s = \"101\"$, $n=3$. $S_0 = \\{2\\}$.\n    Number of skills greater than $X$ is $2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n    This implies $X$ must be at most $2^n - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6$.\n\nLet $K_L = \\sum_{i: s_i='1'} 2^{i-1}$ be the number of skills that must be smaller than $X$.\nLet $K_G = \\sum_{i: s_i='0'} 2^{i-1}$ be the number of skills that must be larger than $X$.\n\nFor $X$ to be a winning skill:\n- $X$ must be greater than $K_L$ distinct skills. The smallest $K_L$ skills are $1, \\dots, K_L$. So $X \\ge K_L + 1$.\n- $X$ must be smaller than $K_G$ distinct skills. The largest $K_G$ skills are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-K_G+1$. So $X \\le 2^n - K_G$.\n\nThus, the range of winning skills is $[K_L+1, 2^n-K_G]$.\nAll integers in this range are winning skills. To show this, for any $X$ in this range, we can construct a permutation $p$:\n1. Assign $X$ to the winning team's slot.\n2. Assign skills $1, \\dots, K_L$ to the $K_L$ slots that must be smaller than $X$. (This is possible because $X \\ge K_L+1$).\n3. Assign skills $2^n-K_G+1, \\dots, 2^n$ to the $K_G$ slots that must be larger than $X$. (This is possible because $X \\le 2^n-K_G$).\nThe skills assigned in steps 2 and 3 are distinct from each other and from $X$. The total number of skills used is $K_L + 1 + K_G$. This sum must be $\\le 2^n$.\n$K_L+K_G = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2^{i-1} = 2^n-1$.\nSo, total skills used are $(2^n-1)+1 = 2^n$. All $2^n$ skills are used.\nThis construction assigns all skills $1, \\dots, 2^n$ to the initial $2^n$ slots such that $X$ wins.\n\nExample: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$K_L = 2^{1-1} + 2^{3-1} = 2^0 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$.\n$K_G = 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nMinimum winning skill: $K_L + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - K_G = 8 - 2 = 6$.\nSo, for $s=\"101\"$, only skill $6$ can win.\nThis still doesn't match the example output $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"the winner of the game \"$1$ vs $2$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$3$ vs $4$\"\"\nThis implies a fixed bracket structure.\nThe $i$-th phase refers to the $i$-th \"round\" of the tournament.\nThe first phase involves games like $(1,2)$, $(3,4)$, etc. ($2^{n-1}$ games). The rule $s_1$ applies.\nThe second phase involves games like $(W(1,2), W(3,4))$, $(W(5,6), W(7,8))$, etc. ($2^{n-2}$ games). The rule $s_2$ applies.\nAnd so on.\n\nThe number of teams that must be smaller than $X$ is $2^{count_1}-1$.\nThe number of teams that must be larger than $X$ is $2^{count_0}-1$.\nThis is a common pattern for \"number of skills that must be less/greater than the winner\".\n$count_1$ is the number of '1's in $s$.\n$count_0$ is the number of '0's in $s$.\n\nLet's test this interpretation:\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$count_1 = 2$ (for $s_1, s_3$)\n$count_0 = 1$ (for $s_2$)\nMinimum winning skill: $2^{count_1}-1 + 1 = 2^2-1+1 = 4$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - (2^{count_0}-1) = 2^3 - (2^1-1) = 8 - (2-1) = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe range is $[4, 7]$. This matches the example output!\n\nLet's try to justify this formula.\nA team with skill $X$ wins.\nIn $count_1$ matches, $X$ is the higher skill. For example, $X$ beats $Y$.\nIn $count_0$ matches, $X$ is the lower skill. For example, $X$ beats $Z$.\n\nConsider the $count_1$ matches where $X$ is the higher skill.\nEach such match means $X$ is \"stronger\" than its opponent.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins by having higher skill. This means $X$ is in a branch where it is the strongest.\nThe total number of teams in this \"stronger\" branch that $X$ comes from is $2^{count_1}$.\nAll $2^{count_1}$ skills (including $X$) in this branch must be greater than all skills in the $2^{count_1}-1$ other branches that $X$ \"dominates\" by winning as the higher skill.\nSo, $X$ must be greater than $2^{count_1}-1$ skills.\nMinimum $X = (2^{count_1}-1) + 1 = 2^{count_1}$.\n\nConsider the $count_0$ matches where $X$ is the lower skill.\nEach such match means $X$ is \"weaker\" than its opponent.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ wins by having lower skill. This means $X$ is in a branch where it is the weakest.\nThe total number of teams in this \"weaker\" branch that $X$ comes from is $2^{count_0}$.\nAll $2^{count_0}$ skills (including $X$) in this branch must be smaller than all skills in the $2^{count_0}-1$ other branches that $X$ \"dominates\" by winning as the lower skill.\nSo, $X$ must be smaller than $2^{count_0}-1$ skills.\nMaximum $X = 2^n - (2^{count_0}-1)$.\n\nThis is the correct logic. The number of skills $X$ must be greater than is $2^{count_1}-1$. The number of skills $X$ must be smaller than is $2^{count_0}-1$.\nThe minimum possible winning skill is $X_{min} = (2^{count_1}-1) + 1 = 2^{count_1}$.\nThe maximum possible winning skill is $X_{max} = 2^n - (2^{count_0}-1)$.\nAll integers in the range $[2^{count_1}, 2^n - (2^{count_0}-1)]$ are winning integers.\n\nLet's test with the other examples:\n1. $n=1, s=\"1\"$:\n   $count_0=0, count_1=1$. $2^n=2^1=2$.\n   $X_{min} = 2^{count_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   $X_{max} = 2^n - (2^{count_0}-1) = 2 - (2^0-1) = 2 - (1-1) = 2 - 0 = 2$.\n   Range is $[2, 2]$. Output: $2$. Matches.\n\n2. $n=2, s=\"01\"$:\n   $count_0=1, count_1=1$. $2^n=2^2=4$.\n   $X_{min} = 2^{count_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   $X_{max} = 2^n - (2^{count_0}-1) = 4 - (2^1-1) = 4 - (2-1) = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n   Range is $[2, 3]$. Output: $2 \\ 3$. Matches.\n\nThe logic seems sound and matches all examples.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Read $n$.\n- Read string $s$.\n- Count $count_0$ and $count_1$.\n- Calculate $X_{min} = 2^{count_1}$.\n- Calculate $X_{max} = 2^n - (2^{count_0}-1)$.\n- Print integers from $X_{min}$ to $X_{max}$ inclusive, separated by spaces.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_0 = s.count('0')\n    count_1 = s.count('1')\n\n    # Calculate the minimum possible winning skill\n    # If s_i = '1', the winner X must be greater than its opponent.\n    # This means X must be greater than all teams in the opponent's sub-bracket.\n    # The number of teams in such a sub-bracket is 2^(i-1).\n    # The total number of teams that X must be greater than is 2^count_1 - 1.\n    # So, the minimum X is (2^count_1 - 1) + 1 = 2^count_1.\n    min_winning_skill = 2**count_1\n\n    # Calculate the maximum possible winning skill\n    # If s_i = '0', the winner X must be smaller than its opponent.\n    # This means X must be smaller than all teams in the opponent's sub-bracket.\n    # The number of teams in such a sub-bracket is 2^(i-1).\n    # The total number of teams that X must be smaller than is 2^count_0 - 1.\n    # So, the maximum X is 2^n - (2^count_0 - 1).\n    max_total_skill = 2**n\n    max_winning_skill = max_total_skill - (2**count_0 - 1)\n\n    # All integers in the range [min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill] are winning.\n    # Print them in ascending order.\n    result = [str(x) for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1)]\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
