    "thought": "**Finding the Minimal LCM**\n\nOkay, so the problem is to find a non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple (`lcm`) of `a+k` and `b+k`. The trick here is that the `lcm` is linked to the greatest common divisor (`gcd`). Specifically, `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. Our goal is therefore to find a `k` that makes the `gcd` as large as possible without letting the product of the two terms grow too large, since that increases the `lcm`.\n\nWe can simplify the problem by realizing that `y - x = b - a`, and the `gcd` must divide this difference. I can start by ensuring `a` is less than or equal to `b`, this keeps the math from being confusing.\n\nSo, I iterate through all the divisors of `b - a`, since the `gcd` of `a+k` and `b+k` must be a divisor of `b-a`. For each divisor `g`, I calculate the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a + k` is a multiple of `g`.  That `k` will also make `b + k` a multiple of `g`. And how do I compute this key `k`? It is `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`, and it will ensure that I pick the smallest such value.\n\nThen, I use that `k` to compute the `lcm` and store both the smallest `lcm` value and the `k` that created it. And if I find any smaller `lcm`, or an equal `lcm` with a smaller corresponding `k`, I update my result.\n\nI just need to make sure to handle the edge case where `a == b` correctly (in which case the answer is `k = 0`). Also, for a given a and b, I know that the number of divisors of `b-a` is not that large, so this approach will be efficient enough. Finally, I've got to make sure I am using integer arithmetic and not get overflows. I should be able to rely on Python's built-in arbitrary precision for this.\n\nOnce I've done all that, I'm simply printing out the best `k` value.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we should choose the smallest such `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\nAlso, `gcd(x, y)` must divide their difference `y - x`.\n`y - x = (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`.\nSo, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `abs(b - a)`.\n\nLet's break down the solution:\n\n1.  **Handle the `a = b` case:**\n    If `a = b`, then `a+k = b+k`. In this case, `lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k`, we should choose the smallest non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`. So, if `a=b`, the answer is `0`.\n\n2.  **Assume `a < b` (without loss of generality):**\n    If `a > b`, we can swap `a` and `b` because `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is symmetric. So, we can always assume `a < b`.\n    Let `diff = b - a`. As established, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `diff`.\n\n3.  **Iterate through possible `gcd` values:**\n    The core idea is to iterate through all possible values `g` that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` could take. Since `g` must be a divisor of `diff`, we can find all divisors of `diff`.\n    For each divisor `g` of `diff`:\n    *   We need `a+k` to be a multiple of `g`, and `b+k` to be a multiple of `g`.\n    *   The condition `a+k` being a multiple of `g` means `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`, which simplifies to `k \\equiv -a \\pmod g`.\n    *   The smallest non-negative `k` satisfying this is `k_g = (g - (a \\pmod g)) \\pmod g`.\n        *   If `a % g == 0`, then `k_g = 0`.\n        *   If `a % g != 0`, then `k_g = g - (a % g)`.\n    *   With this `k_g`, `a+k_g` is a multiple of `g`. Since `b-a` is also a multiple of `g` (because `g` is a divisor of `diff = b-a`), `b+k_g = (a+k_g) + (b-a)` will also be a multiple of `g`.\n    *   Now, we calculate `cur_a = a + k_g` and `cur_b = b + k_g`.\n    *   We then compute `current_lcm = (cur_a * cur_b) // math.gcd(cur_a, cur_b)`. Note that `math.gcd(cur_a, cur_b)` might be a multiple of `g`, not necessarily `g` itself. This is fine, as our goal is to find the *actual* LCM.\n\n4.  **Track minimum LCM and smallest `k`:**\n    We maintain `min_lcm_val` (initialized to infinity) and `best_k` (initialized to an invalid value like -1).\n    For each `current_lcm` calculated:\n    *   If `current_lcm < min_lcm_val`, we update `min_lcm_val = current_lcm` and `best_k = k_g`.\n    *   If `current_lcm == min_lcm_val`, we update `best_k = min(best_k, k_g)` to ensure we pick the smallest `k` in case of ties.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `a` and `b`.\n2.  If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n3.  If `a > b`, swap `a` and `b`.\n4.  Calculate `diff = b - a`.\n5.  Find all divisors of `diff`. This can be done efficiently by iterating from `1` to `sqrt(diff)`. If `i` divides `diff`, then both `i` and `diff // i` are divisors. Store them in a set to handle duplicates.\n6.  Initialize `min_lcm_val = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n7.  For each `g` in the set of divisors:\n    a.  Calculate `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n    b.  Let `cur_a = a + k` and `cur_b = b + k`.\n    c.  Calculate `current_lcm = (cur_a * cur_b) // math.gcd(cur_a, cur_b)`.\n    d.  Update `min_lcm_val` and `best_k` based on `current_lcm` and `k`.\n8.  Print `best_k`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n\n*   `a, b` up to `10^9`.\n*   `diff` up to `10^9`.\n*   Finding divisors takes `O(sqrt(diff))` time, which is `O(sqrt(10^9))` â‰ˆ `31622` operations.\n*   The maximum number of divisors for a number up to `10^9` is relatively small (e.g., `735134400` has 1344 divisors).\n*   For each divisor, `math.gcd` takes `O(log(max(a,b)))` time.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(sqrt(diff) + num_divisors * log(max(a,b)))`, which is very efficient for the given constraints.\n*   Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle potential overflow from `cur_a * cur_b` (up to `(2*10^9)^2 = 4*10^{18}`).\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read integers a and b from standard input\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # If a and b are equal, lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k.\n    # To minimize a+k, we choose the smallest non-negative k, which is 0.\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a < b for consistent calculation of diff = b - a.\n    # The problem is symmetric with respect to a and b.\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    # Calculate the absolute difference between a and b.\n    # gcd(a+k, b+k) must be a divisor of (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a.\n    diff = b - a\n\n    # Initialize variables to track the minimum LCM found and the corresponding k.\n    min_lcm_val = float('inf') # Use float('inf') for initial minimum LCM\n    best_k = -1 # Initialize best_k to an invalid value, will be updated.\n\n    # Find all divisors of 'diff'.
