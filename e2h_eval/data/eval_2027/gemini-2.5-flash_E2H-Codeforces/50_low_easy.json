    "thought": "**Deconstructing \"Good\" Trees: A Journey in Weights and Constraints**\n\nAlright, so the user wants me to tackle this competitive programming problem involving \"good\" edge-weighted trees. The core challenge is calculating the sum of $d(1, n)$ across all these \"good\" trees, all modulo 998244353. Let's dig in.\n\nMy initial thought is to grasp the essence of what constitutes a \"good\" tree. It's an edge-weighted tree with $n$ vertices, and it needs to satisfy two key constraints. Firstly, each edge weight must be either $1$ or $-1$. Secondly, the product of edge weights incident to each vertex has to equal $-1$. Formally, if $w(u, v)$ represents the weight of the edge between vertices $u$ and $v$, then for every vertex $i$, the product of all $w(i,j)$ for edges $(i,j)$ in the tree equals $-1$.\n\nThe immediate insight pops up: let's analyze the implications of these conditions. By taking the product of the vertex conditions across all vertices, we get this: the product of all edge weight products equals the product of $(-1)$ over $n$ terms. The key here is noticing that each edge's weight appears twice in this overall product, once for each endpoint. This simplifies down to the product of all edge weights squared, so this product is always 1.\n\nThus, we have $1 = (-1)^n$, which tells me that $n$ *must* be even for a \"good\" tree to even exist!  If $n$ is odd, forget it, there's no solution, and the answer is 0.\n\nChecking this with the provided examples gives me a good confidence boost. The $n=1$ case correctly returns 0. The $n=2$ example returns -1. Since I know $n=2$ works, I just need to verify that for $n=2$ with only two vertices, there's only a single way to satisfy the conditions: the edge between the vertices must have weight $-1$. This gives a distance of $-1$, which, modulo 998244353, is indeed 998244352. Perfect!\n\nI can now safely assume that if $n$ is odd, the answer is 0, and I've got this base case handled. From here on, I'll focus on the more interesting case where $n$ is even. I'll need to figure out how to count these things and sum their contributions.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of $d(1, n)$ over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo $998244353$.\nAn edge-weighted tree is \"good\" if:\n1. Each edge weight $w(u, v)$ is either $1$ or $-1$.\n2. For each vertex $i$, the product of the weights of all edges incident to $i$ is $-1$.\n\nLet's first analyze the condition for a \"good\" tree.\nConsider the product of the conditions for all vertices:\n$\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (-1)$.\nThe right side is $(-1)^n$.\nThe left side: each edge $(u, v)$ has its weight $w(u, v)$ appear twice in this product (once for vertex $u$ and once for vertex $v$). So the left side is $\\prod_{(u, v) \\in E} w(u, v)^2$.\nSince $w(u, v) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, $w(u, v)^2 = 1$.\nThus, the left side simplifies to $1$.\nSo, we must have $1 = (-1)^n$. This implies that $n$ must be an even number.\nIf $n$ is odd, there are no good trees, and therefore the sum $d(1, n)$ is $0$.\n\nNow, assume $n$ is even.\nFor a fixed tree structure $T$ (a set of $n-1$ edges), let's see how many ways we can assign weights to make it good.\nLet $w(u, v)$ be the weight of an edge $(u, v)$.\nFor any vertex $i$, $\\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) = -1$.\nLet's pick an arbitrary vertex, say vertex $n$. Its condition is $\\prod_{(n, j) \\in E} w(n, j) = -1$.\nFor any other vertex $i \\neq n$, its condition is $\\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) = -1$.\nConsider all edges $(u,v)$ in the tree except for those incident to vertex $n$. We can assign weights $w(u,v)$ to these edges arbitrarily. There are $n-1 - \\deg(n)$ such edges.\nFor each vertex $i \\neq n$, all edges incident to $i$ except possibly $(i, n)$ are among these edges.\nFor each $i \\neq n$, if $(i,n)$ is an edge, we can determine $w(i,n)$ based on the weights of other edges incident to $i$:\n$w(i,n) = -1 / \\prod_{(i, j) \\in E, j \\neq n} w(i, j)$.\nSince all $w(i,j)$ are $1$ or $-1$, this uniquely determines $w(i,n)$ as $1$ or $-1$.\nThis way, all conditions for $i \\neq n$ are satisfied.\nThe only remaining condition is for vertex $n$: $\\prod_{(n, j) \\in E} w(n, j) = -1$.\nAs shown earlier, if $n$ is even, this condition is automatically satisfied if all other $n-1$ conditions are satisfied.\nSo, for any tree structure $T$, we can choose $n-1 - \\deg(n)$ edge weights arbitrarily. For the remaining $\\deg(n)$ edges incident to $n$, their weights are determined by the conditions for their other endpoints.\nThis means there are $2^{n-1-\\deg(n)}$ ways to assign weights to make a given tree structure good.\nThis is incorrect. The argument for $n$ even shows that if we satisfy $n-1$ equations, the $n$-th is automatically satisfied. We can pick any spanning tree, and for any $n-1$ edges, we can assign weights arbitrarily. Then the weights of the remaining edges are determined. This is also incorrect.\n\nLet's fix a tree structure. We can choose an arbitrary root, say vertex $1$. For any edge $(u, v)$ where $u$ is the parent of $v$, we can assign $w(u, v)$ arbitrarily. Then, for each vertex $v \\neq 1$, $w(v, \\text{parent}(v))$ is determined by the condition at $v$ and the weights of edges $(v, c)$ where $c$ is a child of $v$.\nA simpler way: Fix one edge, say $(1,2)$, and assign its weight arbitrarily. For any other $n-2$ edges, assign their weights arbitrarily. The weights of the remaining edge(s) are then determined by the vertex conditions.\nThere are $n-1$ edges. If we choose weights for $n-1$ edges arbitrarily, then the conditions for vertices $1, \\dots, n-1$ might not be satisfied.\n\nLet's use the property that for any vertex $i$, $\\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) = -1$.\nLet $x_e$ be the weight of edge $e$.\nFor each vertex $i$, we have $\\prod_{e \\text{ incident to } i} x_e = -1$.\nThis is a system of $n$ equations in $n-1$ variables over $\\{-1, 1\\}$.\nAs shown, if $n$ is even, the system is consistent, and one equation is redundant.\nWe can choose $n-1$ variables arbitrarily, and the last one is determined.\nFor example, pick a spanning tree. For any $n-1$ edges, we can assign weights arbitrarily. Then the last condition for vertex $n$ will be satisfied automatically.\nThis means there are $2^{n-1}$ ways to assign weights to a given tree structure such that all vertex conditions are met. Wait, this is not true.\nLet's fix an edge $(u,v)$. We can assign $w(u,v)$ to be $1$ or $-1$.\nFor all other $n-2$ edges, their weights can be chosen arbitrarily.\nThen, for each vertex $i \\neq u, v$, its condition $\\prod_{(i,j)\\in E} w(i,j) = -1$ determines $w(i,p)$ if $p$ is its parent (assuming $u$ is root).\nLet's consider an arbitrary spanning tree. Pick an arbitrary root, say vertex $1$.\nFor any edge $(u, v)$ where $v$ is a child of $u$, we can assign $w(u, v)$ arbitrarily to be $1$ or $-1$.\nThen for each vertex $v \\neq 1$, the condition $\\prod_{(v, j) \\in E} w(v, j) = -1$ determines $w(v, \\text{parent}(v))$.\nThis means that if we choose weights for the $n-1$ edges arbitrarily, we will have $n$ conditions. $n-1$ conditions are independent, and one is dependent. So for a given tree structure, there are $2^{n-1-1} = 2^{n-2}$ ways to assign weights to make it good (if $n$ is even).\nThis is the correct number of ways for a given tree structure.\n\nThe sum we want to compute is $S = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1, n)$.\n$d_T(1, n) = \\sum_{(u, v) \\in P_{1,n}} w(u, v)$, where $P_{1,n}$ is the unique path between $1$ and $n$.\nBy linearity of expectation (summation):\n$S = \\sum_{\\text{tree structures } T_0} \\sum_{\\text{weight assignments } W \\text{ for } T_0 \\text{ that are good}} \\sum_{(u, v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} w(u, v)$.\n$S = \\sum_{\\text{tree structures } T_0} \\sum_{(u, v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} \\sum_{\\text{weight assignments } W \\text{ for } T_0 \\text{ that are good}} w(u, v)$.\n\nLet $N_0$ be the number of tree structures on $n$ labeled vertices, which is $n^{n-2}$ by Cayley's formula.\nFor a fixed tree structure $T_0$ and a fixed edge $(u, v)$ in $T_0$, what is the sum of $w(u, v)$ over all good weight assignments for $T_0$?\nLet $N_{good}(T_0) = 2^{n-2}$ be the number of good weight assignments for $T_0$.\nConsider an edge $e=(u,v)$.\nThere are $2^{n-2}$ good weight assignments.\nPick one edge $e=(u,v)$. We can partition the $2^{n-2}$ assignments into two sets: those where $w(e)=1$ and those where $w(e)=-1$.\nSuppose we fix $w(e)=1$. We have $n-2$ other equations to satisfy.\nSuppose we fix $w(e)=-1$. We have $n-2$ other equations to satisfy.\nThe problem is symmetric. For any edge $e$, there are $2^{n-3}$ good assignments where $w(e)=1$ and $2^{n-3}$ good assignments where $w(e)=-1$.\nThis is because we can pick $n-2$ independent edge weights. If $e$ is one of them, we can fix $w(e)$ and then pick $n-3$ more. If $e$ is the dependent edge, its weight is determined by the choice of $n-2$ independent edges.\nIf $n$ is even, for any edge $e$, the number of good weight assignments where $w(e)=1$ is equal to the number of good weight assignments where $w(e)=-1$. Both are $2^{n-3}$.\nProof: Fix $w(e)=1$. We still have $n-2$ conditions to satisfy. One of them is redundant. So there are $2^{n-2-1}=2^{n-3}$ ways. Same for $w(e)=-1$.\nThus, for any edge $(u, v)$ in any tree structure $T_0$, the sum of its weights over all good assignments is $2^{n-3} \\cdot 1 + 2^{n-3} \\cdot (-1) = 0$.\n\nSo, $S = \\sum_{\\text{tree structures } T_0} \\sum_{(u, v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} 0 = 0$.\n\nThis result seems too simple for a competitive programming problem, especially with large $N$. Let me double check.\nThe example cases:\n$n=1$: Output 0. My logic: $n$ is odd, so 0. Correct.\n$n=2$: Output 998244352 (-1 mod $998244353$). My logic: $n$ is even. Sum is 0. This is incorrect.\n\nWhat went wrong?\nThe assumption that for any edge $e$, the number of good assignments where $w(e)=1$ is equal to the number of good assignments where $w(e)=-1$.\nThis is true if $n \\ge 3$.\nIf $n=2$, there is only one edge $(1,2)$.\nThe conditions are $w(1,2)=-1$ for vertex 1, and $w(1,2)=-1$ for vertex 2.\nThis uniquely determines $w(1,2)=-1$.\nSo there is only $1$ good tree. Its $d(1,2) = w(1,2) = -1$.\nThe sum is $-1$.\nIn this case, $2^{n-2} = 2^{2-2} = 2^0 = 1$ good assignment.\nThe number of good assignments where $w(1,2)=1$ is $0$.\nThe number of good assignments where $w(1,2)=-1$ is $1$.\nSo the sum $w(1,2)$ is not $0$. It is $0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nMy proof for equal counts relies on $n-3 \\ge 0$.\nIf $n=2$, then $n-3 = -1$. The argument breaks down.\nThe number of independent choices is $n-2$. For $n=2$, this is $0$. There are no independent choices. The weight of the single edge $(1,2)$ is fully determined.\n\nSo, for $n=2$, the answer is $-1 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nFor $n > 2$ and $n$ is even, the sum is $0$.\nFor $n$ is odd, the sum is $0$.\n\nCombining these:\nIf $n=1$, output $0$.\nIf $n=2$, output $998244352$.\nIf $n > 2$ and $n$ is odd, output $0$.\nIf $n > 2$ and $n$ is even, output $0$.\n\nThis means the answer is $0$ for all $n \\neq 2$. For $n=2$, it's $-1$.\n\nLet's check the examples with this conclusion:\nInput: `2` -> Output: `998244352`. Correct.\nInput: `1` -> Output: `0`. Correct.\nInput: `4` -> Output: `998244343`. My logic says `0`. This is incorrect.\nExample output for $n=4$ is $-10 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nMy fundamental assumption that $d(1,n)$ is a sum of edge weights, and each edge's contribution sums to 0, must be wrong for $n=4$.\nThe statement \"for any edge $e$, the number of good weight assignments where $w(e)=1$ is equal to the number of good weight assignments where $w(e)=-1$\" is correct for $n \\ge 3$.\nThis means $\\sum_{W \\text{ good for } T_0} w(u,v) = 0$ for any edge $(u,v)$ in $T_0$, provided $n \\ge 3$.\n\nIf this is true, then $S = \\sum_{T_0} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} 0 = 0$ for $n \\ge 3$.\nSo why is the example $n=4$ not $0$?\nThe problem asks for $d(1,n)$, which is the sum of weights on the path from $1$ to $n$.\n$d(1,n) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w(u,v)$.\nThe sum of $d(1,n)$ over all good trees is $\\sum_{T_0} \\sum_{W \\text{ good for } T_0} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} w(u,v)$.\n$ = \\sum_{T_0} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} \\left( \\sum_{W \\text{ good for } T_0} w(u,v) \\right)$.\nIf $n \\ge 3$, then $\\sum_{W \\text{ good for } T_0} w(u,v) = 0$ for any edge $(u,v)$.\nSo this sum is $\\sum_{T_0} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} 0 = 0$.\n\nThis means my logic is still flawed for $n=4$.\nLet's re-evaluate the number of good assignments for a fixed tree structure $T_0$.\nLet $x_e$ be the weight of edge $e$.\nFor each vertex $i$, we have $\\prod_{e \\text{ incident to } i} x_e = -1$.\nThis is a system of $n$ equations. Since $n$ is even, one equation is redundant. We can drop the equation for vertex $n$.\nWe have $n-1$ equations for $n-1$ variables (edge weights).\nThis is a system of linear equations over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (by taking $\\log_2$ and mapping $1 \\to 0, -1 \\to 1$).\n$A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $A$ is an $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ matrix.\nThe matrix $A$ is the incidence matrix of the tree $T_0$ with row $n$ removed.\nThis matrix is invertible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. (The determinant is $1 \\pmod 2$).\nSo there is a unique solution for $x_e$ for any given $T_0$.\nThis means there is exactly $1$ way to assign weights to make a given tree good, if $n$ is even.\nLet's re-check the number of independent choices.\nThe system is $\\prod_{(i,j)\\in E} w(i,j) = -1$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$.\nLet $y_{ij} = (w(i,j)+1)/2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$. $w(i,j) = (-1)^{y_{ij}}$.\nThe equations become $\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ for each $i$.\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ in $n-1$ variables $y_{ij}$.\nThe sum of all $n$ equations is $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{(i,j)\\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThe left side is $2 \\sum_{(i,j)\\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe right side is $n \\pmod 2$.\nSo we must have $0 \\equiv n \\pmod 2$. This implies $n$ must be even.\nIf $n$ is even, $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, so the system is consistent.\nSince the sum of equations is $0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, one equation is redundant. For example, the equation for vertex $n$ is redundant.\nWe have $n-1$ equations for vertices $1, \\dots, n-1$.\nThese $n-1$ equations involve $n-1$ variables (the edge weights).\nThe matrix of this system is the incidence matrix of $T_0$ with row $n$ removed.\nThis matrix is known to be invertible for a tree (any submatrix of the incidence matrix of a tree corresponding to $n-1$ vertices and $n-1$ edges is invertible).\nSo, for a given tree structure $T_0$ (with $n$ even), there is exactly one unique assignment of weights $w(u,v)$ that makes it good.\nThis means $N_{good}(T_0) = 1$.\n\nIf this is true, then the sum is:\n$S = \\sum_{\\text{tree structures } T_0} d_{T_0}(1,n)$.\nHere $d_{T_0}(1,n)$ is uniquely determined by $T_0$.\nLet $w_{T_0}(u,v)$ be the unique weight for edge $(u,v)$ in tree $T_0$.\n$S = \\sum_{\\text{tree structures } T_0} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} w_{T_0}(u,v)$.\nThis matches the $n=2$ example: 1 tree, $w(1,2)=-1$, sum is $-1$.\nThis matches the $n=4$ example too! The example states \"16 distinct good trees\". This implies $N_{good}(T_0)=1$ for each of the $16$ tree structures. (Number of trees on 4 vertices is $4^{4-2}=16$).\nSo the sum is over all $n^{n-2}$ tree structures.\n\nNow the problem is to compute $S = \\sum_{T_0} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} w_{T_0}(u,v)$.\n$S = \\sum_{(u,v)} \\sum_{T_0 \\text{ s.t. }(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T_0)} w_{T_0}(u,v)$.\nThis doesn't seem to simplify easily.\nLet's use the matrix tree theorem approach.\nA common technique for sum over paths is to use specific properties of $w_{T_0}(u,v)$.\nFor a tree $T_0$, $w_{T_0}(u,v)$ is the unique weight.\nLet $y_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be such that $w(i,j) = (-1)^{y_{ij}}$.\nThe system of equations is $\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ for each $i$.\nLet $P_{1,n}$ be the path from $1$ to $n$.\n$d(1,n) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} w(u,v) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} (-1)^{y_{uv}}$.\n\nLet's consider the structure of $y_{uv}$.\nPick an arbitrary vertex $r$. For any vertex $i$, define $s_i = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w(i,j)$. We require $s_i = -1$ for all $i$.\nLet $w(u,v) = \\sigma_u \\sigma_v$ for some vertex labels $\\sigma_i \\in \\{1, -1\\}$.\nThen $\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w(i,j) = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\sigma_i^{\\deg(i)} \\prod_{j \\sim i, j \\neq i} \\sigma_j$.\nThis is not right. $\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\sigma_i^{\\deg(i)} \\prod_{j \\sim i} \\sigma_j$.\nThis product is over edges $(i,j)$ incident to $i$.\nSo $\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w(i,j) = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} (\\sigma_i \\sigma_j) = \\sigma_i^{\\deg(i)} \\cdot \\prod_{j \\text{ s.t. }(i,j) \\in E} \\sigma_j$. This is not $\\sigma_i^{\\deg(i)} \\cdot \\prod_{j \\sim i, j \\neq i} \\sigma_j$.\nIt should be $\\sigma_i^{\\deg(i)} \\cdot \\prod_{j \\text{ s.t. }(i,j) \\in E} \\sigma_j$.\nThis is just $\\sigma_i^{\\deg(i)} \\cdot (\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} \\sigma_j)$.\nLet's try a different approach.\nLet $c_i \\in \\{1,-1\\}$ be a value associated with each vertex $i$.\nDefine $w(u,v) = c_u c_v$.\nThen $\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w(i,j) = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} c_i c_j = c_i^{\\deg(i)} \\prod_{j \\sim i} c_j$.\nThis is not what I want.\n\nConsider a fixed tree $T$. For each vertex $i$, we want $\\prod_{(i, j) \\in E} w(i, j) = -1$.\nLet $w(u,v) = -1$ for edges on path $P_{1,n}$, and $w(u,v)=1$ for edges not on path $P_{1,n}$.\nThis is just one specific assignment.\n\nLet $S_i = \\prod_{j \\sim i} w(i,j)$. We require $S_i = -1$.\nLet $w(u,v) = x_u x_v$ where $x_i \\in \\{1,-1\\}$.\nThen $S_i = \\prod_{j \\sim i} x_i x_j = x_i^{\\deg(i)} \\prod_{j \\sim i} x_j$.\nIf $\\deg(i)$ is even, $S_i = \\prod_{j \\sim i} x_j$. We need $\\prod_{j \\sim i} x_j = -1$.\nIf $\\deg(i)$ is odd, $S_i = x_i \\prod_{j \\sim i} x_j$. We need $x_i \\prod_{j \\sim i} x_j = -1$.\nThis is not simplifying the problem.\n\nLet's use the result from a known problem: The number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices where vertex $i$ has degree $d_i$ is $\\frac{(n-2)!}{(d_1-1)!\\dots(d_n-1)!}$.\nThe sum of $d(1,n)$ over all trees is $n^{n-3} \\cdot \\binom{n}{2}$ for $n \\ge 2$. (This is for $d(u,v)$ where edges have weight 1).\nThe sum of $d(1,n)$ for $n=4$ in the example is $-10$.\nThe problem is asking for the sum of $d(1,n)$ for good trees.\nThe number of good trees is $n^{n-2}$ if $n$ is even, and $0$ if $n$ is odd.\nThis is because for each of the $n^{n-2}$ tree structures, there is exactly one way to assign weights to make it good (when $n$ is even).\n\nLet $w_{uv}$ be the unique weight for edge $(u,v)$ in a tree $T$.\nWe need to calculate $\\sum_{T} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_{uv}$.\nThis sum can be rewritten as $\\sum_{u \\neq v} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. }(u,v) \\in T} \\mathbb{I}((u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T)) \\cdot w_{uv}$.\nThe indicator $\\mathbb{I}((u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T))$ means $(u,v)$ is on the path between $1$ and $n$.\nAn edge $(u,v)$ is on the path between $1$ and $n$ if and only if removing $(u,v)$ separates $1$ and $n$ into different components.\nSpecifically, one component contains $1$ and $u$ (or $v$), and the other contains $n$ and $v$ (or $u$).\nLet $T_{uv}$ be the set of trees containing edge $(u,v)$.\nFor a fixed edge $(u,v)$, how many trees contain it? $2 \\cdot n^{n-3}$. (This is wrong, it's $n^{n-3}$ for a specific edge).\nThe number of trees containing a specific edge $(u,v)$ is $n^{n-2} \\cdot \\frac{n-1}{\\binom{n}{2}} = n^{n-2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{n}$. No.\nThe number of trees on $n$ vertices containing a specific edge $(u,v)$ is $n^{n-3}$. This is because we can contract $(u,v)$ to a single vertex, forming a tree on $n-1$ vertices, and then expand it back. $ (n-1)^{ (n-1)-2 } = (n-1)^{n-3} $. No, this is for spanning trees on $n$ vertices that contain a specific edge $(u,v)$. It's $n^{n-3}$.\nNumber of trees containing edge $(u,v)$ is $n^{n-3}$. (This is correct)\n\nLet's fix an edge $(u,v)$. We need to sum $w_{uv}$ for all trees $T$ where $(u,v)$ is on the path $P_{1,n}(T)$.\nThe value $w_{uv}$ is uniquely determined by $T$.\nLet $y_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ such that $w_{ij} = (-1)^{y_{ij}}$.\nThe system is $\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ for each $i$.\nThis is $A \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{1}$, where $A$ is the incidence matrix of the tree.\nThe solution is $\\mathbf{y} = A^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$.\nThe inverse of the incidence matrix of a tree is not trivial.\n\nLet's try a different approach. What is $y_{uv}$ for an edge $(u,v)$?\nLet's root the tree at an arbitrary vertex, say $1$.\nFor any vertex $i$, let $d(i)$ be its degree.\nFor any vertex $i \\neq 1$, let $p_i$ be its parent.\nThe conditions are:\n$w(i, p_i) \\prod_{c \\text{ child of } i} w(i, c) = -1$ for $i=2, \\ldots, n$.\n$w(1, p_1) \\prod_{c \\text{ child of } 1} w(1, c) = -1$ for $i=1$. (No parent for root 1).\n$\\prod_{c \\text{ child of } 1} w(1, c) = -1$.\n\nLet $w(u,v) = (-1)^{y_{uv}}$.\nThe conditions are $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in E} y_{uv} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ for each vertex $u$.\nLet $T$ be a tree. $y_{uv}$ is the unique solution to this system.\nLet $P_{1,n}$ be the path from $1$ to $n$.\nWe want $\\sum_T \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} (-1)^{y_{uv}}$.\n\nConsider the path $P_{1,n}$. Let it be $1=v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k=n$.\nThe edges on this path are $(v_0, v_1), (v_1, v_2), \\dots, (v_{k-1}, v_k)$.\nLet $P_{1,n}$ be denoted by $e_1, \\dots, e_k$.\n$d(1,n) = \\sum_{j=1}^k w(e_j)$.\nLet's try to calculate $w(u,v)$ for a specific edge $(u,v)$.\nConsider the tree $T$ and the edge $(u,v)$. If we remove $(u,v)$, the tree splits into two components, $T_u$ containing $u$ and $T_v$ containing $v$.\nLet $S_u = \\prod_{i \\in V(T_u)} \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E(T)} w(i,j)$.\n$S_u = \\prod_{i \\in V(T_u)} (-1) = (-1)^{|V(T_u)|}$.\nThe product $S_u$ can also be expressed as $\\prod_{e \\in E(T_u)} w(e)^2 \\cdot \\prod_{j \\sim u, j \\in V(T_v)} w(u,j)$.\nSo $S_u = \\prod_{j \\sim u, j \\in V(T_v)} w(u,j)$.\nSince $(u,v)$ is the only edge connecting $T_u$ and $T_v$, this means $S_u = w(u,v)$.\nThus $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|V(T_u)|}$.\nSimilarly $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|V(T_v)|}$.\nSince $|V(T_u)| + |V(T_v)| = n$, and $n$ is even, we have $|V(T_u)| \\equiv |V(T_v)| \\pmod 2$.\nSo $w(u,v) = (-1)^{\\text{size of component containing } u \\text{ when } (u,v) \\text{ is removed}}$.\n\nThis is a very powerful result!\nFor any edge $(u,v)$ in any tree $T$, its unique good weight $w(u,v)$ is $(-1)^{|C_u|}$ where $C_u$ is the component containing $u$ when $(u,v)$ is removed.\nSo $d(1,n) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} (-1)^{|C_u(u,v)|}$.\nThe sum we need is $\\sum_{T} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T)} (-1)^{|C_u(u,v)|}$.\nLet $k=|C_u(u,v)|$. This is the size of the component containing $u$ when $(u,v)$ is removed.\nFor an edge $(u,v)$ to be on the path $P_{1,n}(T)$, removing $(u,v)$ must separate $1$ and $n$.\nThis means $1$ is in $C_u$ and $n$ is in $C_v$ (or vice versa).\nThe size of $C_u$ (or $C_v$) can be any value from $1$ to $n-1$.\nLet $k$ be the size of the component containing $1$ when $(u,v)$ is removed.\nThen $u$ is in this component, and $v$ is in the other.\nSo $w(u,v) = (-1)^k$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{T} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T)} (-1)^{|C_1(u,v)|}$, where $C_1(u,v)$ is the component containing $1$ after removing $(u,v)$.\n\nLet's fix an edge $(u,v)$.\nNumber of trees where $(u,v)$ splits $1$ and $n$:\nLet's fix $u$ and $v$. The number of trees where $1$ is in $C_u$ and $n$ is in $C_v$ and $|C_u|=k$.\nThis means $1 \\in C_u$, $n \\in C_v$.\nThe number of such trees is $k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\cdot k(n-k)$. (This is for trees where $u$ and $v$ are fixed endpoints, and $k$ vertices are on one side, $n-k$ on the other).\nThis is for $1 \\in C_u, n \\in C_v$.\nThe number of ways to choose $k-1$ other vertices for $C_u$ (besides $1,u$) from $n-2$ vertices is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$.\nThe number of trees on $k$ vertices (containing $1, u$) is $k^{k-2}$.\nThe number of trees on $n-k$ vertices (containing $n, v$) is $(n-k)^{n-k-2}$.\nWe need to connect $u$ and $v$ with an edge.\nThe number of trees where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and $n$ is in the other component:\nThis is $k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1}$. (This is from a standard result, number of trees where removing edge $(u,v)$ splits into components of size $k$ and $n-k$).\nThe sum over all trees of $w(u,v)$ for specific $u,v$ if $(u,v)$ is on path $P_{1,n}$:\nSum over $k$ from $1$ to $n-1$.\nFor a fixed $k$, there are $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$ ways to choose the $k-1$ vertices to be in the component of $1$ (excluding $1$ itself).\nFor each such choice of $k$ vertices, say $S_k$, the number of trees $T$ where $V(C_1(u,v)) = S_k$ and $V(C_n(u,v)) = V \\setminus S_k$ and $(u,v)$ is the edge connecting them is $k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is a standard result from counting trees: number of trees on $n$ vertices where $u$ and $v$ are in different components of size $k$ and $n-k$ is $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThe term $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1}$ is the number of ways to connect two rooted trees with an edge.\nThe number of trees where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ (containing $u$) and $n$ is in the other component (containing $v$) is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nFor each such tree, the edge $(u,v)$ has weight $(-1)^k$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$.\n\nThis sum is for a specific edge $(u,v)$ on the path $P_{1,n}$.\nThis is the sum of $w(u,v)$ over all trees where $(u,v)$ is on $P_{1,n}$.\nIs this sum dependent on $u,v$? No, it's about the sizes of components.\nThe total sum is $\\sum_{u \\neq v} \\sum_{T \\text{ s.t. }(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T)} w_{uv}$.\nThe problem asked for $d(1,n)$. So we need to sum for all edges on the path $P_{1,n}$.\nThe value $w_{uv}$ for an edge $(u,v)$ on $P_{1,n}$ is $(-1)^k$ where $k$ is the size of the component containing $1$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$. This is for a specific edge $(u,v)$ on the path from $1$ to $n$.\nBut the path $P_{1,n}$ has $d(1,n)$ edges.\nConsider the $n^{n-2}$ trees. For each tree $T$, we calculate $d_T(1,n)$.\n$d_T(1,n) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}(T)} (-1)^{|C_1(u,v)|}$.\nLet's fix $k$. How many times does an edge $(u,v)$ with $|C_1(u,v)|=k$ appear in $P_{1,n}(T)$?\nThis is the number of trees where edge $(u,v)$ is on the path $P_{1,n}$ and $1$ is in the component of size $k$.\nThis is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is exactly the expression for the total sum. This is a known identity related to Abel's identity.\nThis identity is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = (n-1) n^{n-3}$. This is the sum of lengths of paths for all trees.\nWait, the formula $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$ is the total sum of lengths of paths $P_{1,n}$ over all trees.\nThis is the sum of $d(1,n)$ if all weights were $1$.\nThe formula for $d(1,n)$ is $\\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1,n}} (-1)^{|C_1(u,v)|}$.\nLet's analyze $n=4$.\n$k$ can be $1, 2, 3$.\n$k=1$: $(-1)^1 \\binom{4-2}{1-1} 1^{1-1} (4-1)^{4-1-1} = -1 \\binom{2}{0} 1^0 3^2 = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 = -9$.\n$k=2$: $(-1)^2 \\binom{4-2}{2-1} 2^{2-1} (4-2)^{4-2-1} = 1 \\binom{2}{1} 2^1 2^1 = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\n$k=3$: $(-1)^3 \\binom{4-2}{3-1} 3^{3-1} (4-3)^{4-3-1} = -1 \\binom{2}{2} 3^2 1^0 = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 = -9$.\nTotal sum for $n=4$: $-9 + 8 - 9 = -10$.\nThis matches the example output! So the formula is correct.\n\nThe sum is $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nWe need to compute this modulo $998244353$.\nThis requires modular inverse for combinations and powers.\n$n$ is up to $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$ can be large.\n$\\binom{n-2}{k-1} = \\frac{(n-2)!}{(k-1)! (n-1-k)!}$.\n$S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\frac{(n-2)!}{(k-1)! (n-1-k)!} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is a standard sum related to generalized binomial coefficients and trees.\nThe sum is $-(n-1) (-1)^{n-1} n^{n-3}$. This is for $n \\ge 2$.\nLet's check this formula.\nFor $n=2$: $-(2-1)(-1)^{2-1} 2^{2-3} = -1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 2^{-1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{-1}$.\nModulo $998244353$, $2^{-1} = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\nSo for $n=2$, the formula gives $499122177$. But the answer is $-1$.\nThe formula $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_u|}$ is valid for $n \\ge 2$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$ is valid for $n \\ge 2$.\nFor $n=2$:\n$k$ can only be $1$.\n$(-1)^1 \\binom{2-2}{1-1} 1^{1-1} (2-1)^{2-1-1} = -1 \\binom{0}{0} 1^0 1^0 = -1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = -1$.\nThis matches the example output for $n=2$.\n\nFor $n=4$:\n$-(4-1)(-1)^{4-1} 4^{4-3} = -3 \\cdot (-1)^3 \\cdot 4^1 = -3 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 4 = 12$.\nThis is not $-10$. So the formula $-(n-1) (-1)^{n-1} n^{n-3}$ is NOT correct for this sum.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis sum needs to be computed directly.\n\n$MOD = 998244353$.\nWe need factorials and inverse factorials for combinations.\n$k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$ can be computed using modular exponentiation.\nThe sum has $O(N)$ terms. Each term takes $O(\\log N)$ for power and $O(1)$ for combinations (with precomputed factorials).\nTotal time complexity $O(N \\log N)$ or $O(N)$ if powers are handled carefully.\n$k^{k-1}$ can be computed as $k \\cdot k^{k-2}$.\n$(n-k)^{n-k-1}$ can be computed as $(n-k) \\cdot (n-k)^{n-k-2}$.\nWe need to precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to $N$.\nMax $N = 5 \\cdot 10^5$. $O(N)$ precomputation. $O(N)$ for the sum. Total $O(N)$.\n\nSpecial cases:\nIf $n$ is odd, the answer is $0$.\nIf $n=1$, it's odd, so $0$.\nIf $n=2$, it's even, sum is $-1$.\nIf $n=4$, it's even, sum is $-10$.\nIf $n$ is even and $n \\ge 2$, compute the sum.\n\nFinal check of $w(u,v) = (-1)^{|C_u|}$.\nLet $y_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be such that $w(i,j) = (-1)^{y_{ij}}$.\nThe conditions are $\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ for each $i$.\nLet $S_u$ be the component containing $u$ when $(u,v)$ is removed.\nLet $S_v$ be the component containing $v$ when $(u,v)$ is removed.\nSum the equations for all $i \\in S_u$:\n$\\sum_{i \\in S_u} \\sum_{(i,j)\\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv \\sum_{i \\in S_u} 1 \\pmod 2$.\nLHS: Each edge $(i,j)$ with $i,j \\in S_u$ appears twice in the sum. So its $y_{ij}$ term is $2y_{ij} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe only edge whose $y_{ij}$ term appears once is $y_{uv}$ (from vertex $u$).\nSo LHS is $y_{uv} \\pmod 2$.\nRHS is $|S_u| \\pmod 2$.\nTherefore $y_{uv} \\equiv |S_u| \\pmod 2$.\nThis means $w(u,v) = (-1)^{y_{uv}} = (-1)^{|S_u|}$.\nThis derivation is correct and works for any $n \\ge 2$.\n\nSo the final algorithm is:\n1. Read $N$.\n2. If $N$ is odd, print $0$.\n3. If $N$ is even:\n   a. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo $998244353$ up to $N-2$.\n   b. Initialize `total_sum = 0`.\n   c.
