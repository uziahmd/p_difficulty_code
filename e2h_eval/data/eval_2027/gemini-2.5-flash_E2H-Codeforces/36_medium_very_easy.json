The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent).

    "thought": "**Probability of Tower Configurations: A Detailed Analysis**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this competitive programming challenge. I'm tasked with calculating the probability of a valid tower configuration, given a set of towns and some constraints on signal power. The key is to understand these constraints and how they affect the valid tower placements and signal ranges.\n\nFirst, I need to represent the problem. There are `n+2` towns, and towers can be built in towns `1` through `n`. Each tower has a certain signal power, `p`.  A town `c` receives a signal from a tower at town `i` if `|c - i| < p`. This leads me to focus on the 'coverage' each tower provides.\n\nThe crucial constraints are:  Towns `0` and `n+1` *cannot* receive any signal, and all towns `1` through `n` must receive signals from *exactly one* tower.  The first constraint tells me that the power of a tower at town `i` must be less than or equal to `i` and `n+1 - i`.  This limits the potential signal power for each tower, and I know it's always true that `1 <= p <= min(i, n+1-i)`.\n\nThe second constraint is where the real logic comes in. It implies that I need to partition the towns `1` to `n` into segments, where each segment is covered by a single tower. These segments can't overlap, and the union of all the segments must equal `[1, n]`. If a town `k` is covered by a tower `i` with power `p`, then `i - p < k < i + p`.  And I can't have a single town covered by two towers at once.\n\nThinking this way, I can define the coverage by intervals, let's say `[L_i, R_i]` for each tower at town `i`. These intervals must be disjoint, and cover `[1, n]`. The tower at location `i` with power `p` then means that `L_i = i - p + 1` and `R_i = i + p - 1`. And also that the interval midpoints have to be town locations for the towers built, to have these intervals valid. The midpoints are at integer locations. So, it means that the endpoints of these segments, that are the tower midpoints have the same parity.\n\nThe set of towns where towers are built is `S`. I need to figure out how many possible sets `S` satisfy the conditions.  It quickly becomes apparent that a tower at town `i` with power `p` covers `2p - 1` towns.  This means the sum of the number of towns covered by all towers, must equal `n`.  My thought is to determine valid partitions with towers, it then corresponds to a valid `S` and all valid `S` are those partitions. So, I will create a dynamic programming solution to calculate the number of valid `S` sets.\n\nI can set up a DP approach: `dp[k]` will represent the number of ways to partition the range `[1, k]` such that all conditions are met. I start with a base case `dp[0] = 1` for an empty range.  For `dp[k]`, I consider the last segment.  This last segment will be of the form `[L, k]`.  If `L` and `k` have the same parity, I can add a tower at the midpoint `(L + k) / 2`.  If `L` and `k` have different parities, it can't be part of the solution and hence the last segment cannot be that. I update this by making the segments `[L, R]` alternate in parity in their endpoint, so one odd and one even, to meet the definition of the tower partitions. So I have `dp[k] = sum(dp[L-1])` for all valid `L`. So, for all possible valid positions, if they were the start of a segment, add that, to add up total possibilities.\n\nTracing a few examples, the values quickly become Fibonacci-like. It suggests that there could be a relation to Fibonacci numbers, or that `dp[k]` is the Fibonacci number `F_{k+1}` for `k >= 0`. So by keeping track of the parity of the segments, I build the correct solution. Since the output is huge, I have to compute results modulo `998244353`. This process yields the correct number of valid tower configurations, which I can use to compute the final probability, and return the answer as described.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the probability that, for a given configuration of radio towers, we can set their signal powers to satisfy certain conditions. There are `n+2` towns from `0` to `n+1`. Towers are built in towns `1, \\dots, n` with probability `1/2` independently.\n\nThe conditions for setting signal powers are:\n1. Towns `0` and `n+1` don't get any signal.\n2. Towns `1, \\dots, n` get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions.\nA tower at town `i` with signal power `p` reaches towns `c` such that `|c - i| < p`. This means `i - p < c < i + p`, or `c \\in [i-p+1, i+p-1]`.\n\nConstraint 1:\n- Town `0` doesn't get signal: For any tower at `i` with power `p`, `|0 - i| < p` must be false. Since `i \\ge 1`, `i < p` must be false. Thus, `p \\le i`.\n- Town `n+1` doesn't get signal: For any tower at `i` with power `p`, `|n+1 - i| < p` must be false. Since `i \\le n`, `n+1 - i < p` must be false. Thus, `p \\le n+1 - i`.\nCombining these, for any tower at `i` with power `p_i`, we must choose `p_i` such that `1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)`. This ensures that the coverage interval `[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]` is entirely contained within `[1, n]`.\n\nConstraint 2: Towns `1, \\dots, n` get signal from exactly one tower each.\nThis implies that if `S` is the set of towns with towers, and we choose powers `p_i` for each `i \\in S`, then the coverage intervals `[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]` for `i \\in S` must form a partition of the interval `[1, n]`. That is, they must be disjoint and their union must be exactly `[1, n]`.\n\nLet `[L, R]` be an interval covered by a single tower at town `i` with power `p`.\nThen `L = i-p+1` and `R = i+p-1`.\nFrom these equations, we can derive `R-L+1 = (i+p-1) - (i-p+1) + 1 = 2p-1`. So, `p = (R-L+2)/2`.\nAlso, `L+R = (i-p+1) + (i+p-1) = 2i`. So, `i = (L+R)/2`.\nFor `i` to be an integer, `L+R` must be even. This means `L` and `R` must have the same parity.\nThe conditions `1 \\le p \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)` are automatically satisfied if `1 \\le L \\le R \\le n`.\n\nSo, a set of towers `S` allows a valid power assignment if and only if:\n1. We can partition the interval `[1, n]` into segments `[L_j, R_j]` for `j=1, \\dots, m`.\n2. For each segment `[L_j, R_j]`, `L_j` and `R_j` must have the same parity.\n3. The set of tower locations `S` must be exactly `\\{(L_j+R_j)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, m\\}`.\n\nSince `L_1=1` (odd), the first segment `[L_1, R_1]` must have `R_1` odd.\nThe next segment starts at `L_2 = R_1+1`, which must be even. So `R_2` must be even.\nThis pattern continues: segments must alternate between `[odd, odd]` and `[even, even]` endpoints.\nFor example, `[odd, odd], [even, even], [odd, odd], \\dots`.\nThe last segment `[L_m, R_m]` must end at `R_m=n`.\nIf `n` is odd, `R_m` is odd, so `L_m` must be odd. This is consistent with the alternating pattern.\nIf `n` is even, `R_m` is even, so `L_m` must be even. This is also consistent.\n\nThe problem reduces to counting the number of ways to partition `[1, n]` into such segments. Each such partition uniquely determines the set `S` of tower locations. If `S` is this unique set, then this configuration of towers is valid. The probability for any specific configuration of `|S|` towers is `(1/2)^{|S|} (1/2)^{n-|S|} = (1/2)^n`. Thus, the total probability is `(Number of valid partitions) \\times (1/2)^n`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways to partition `[1, k]` satisfying the conditions.\nBase case: `dp[0] = 1` (representing an empty prefix, or an empty partition).\n\nFor `dp[k]`, consider the last segment `[L, k]`.\n`L` and `k` must have the same parity.\nThe previous part of the partition must cover `[1, L-1]`, which has `dp[L-1]` ways.\nSo, `dp[k] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\text{ and } k \\text{ same parity}}^{k} dp[L-1]`.\n\nLet's compute the first few `dp` values:\n- `dp[0] = 1`\n- `dp[1]` (k=1, odd): `L` must be odd. Only `L=1`.\n  `dp[1] = dp[1-1] = dp[0] = 1`.\n- `dp[2]` (k=2, even): `L` must be even. Only `L=2`.\n  `dp[2] = dp[2-1] = dp[1] = 1`.\n- `dp[3]` (k=3, odd): `L` must be odd. `L=1, 3`.\n  `dp[3] = dp[1-1] + dp[3-1] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n- `dp[4]` (k=4, even): `L` must be even. `L=2, 4`.\n  `dp[4] = dp[2-1] + dp[4-1] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n- `dp[5]` (k=5, odd): `L` must be odd. `L=1, 3, 5`.\n  `dp[5] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5`.\n\nThe sequence of `dp` values is `1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...`. This is the Fibonacci sequence `F_{k+1}` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots`.\nSo, `dp[k] = F_{k+1}`.\n\nWe can prove this by induction:\nBase cases: `dp[0]=F_1=1`, `dp[1]=F_2=1`.\nAssume `dp[i] = F_{i+1}` for all `i < k`.\n- If `k` is odd: `dp[k] = dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[k-1]`.\n  Using the hypothesis: `dp[k] = F_1 + F_3 + \\dots + F_k`.\n  A known Fibonacci identity states `\\sum_{j=1 \\text{ to } m, j \\text{ odd}} F_j = F_{m+1}`.\n  So, `dp[k] = F_{k+1}`.\n- If `k` is even: `dp[k] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[k-1]`.\n  Using the hypothesis: `dp[k] = F_2 + F_4 + \\dots + F_k`.\n  Another known Fibonacci identity states `\\sum_{j=1 \\text{ to } m, j \\text{ even}} F_j = F_{m+1} - 1`.\n  So, `dp[k] = F_{k+1} - 1`.\nThis contradicts `dp[k] = F_{k+1}` for even `k`.\n\nLet's re-examine the recurrence more directly.\n`dp[k]`\nIf `k` is odd: `dp[k] = dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[k-1]`.\n`dp[k-2]` (for `k-2` odd): `dp[k-2] = dp[0] + dp[2] + \\dots + dp[k-3]`.\nSo, `dp[k] = dp[k-2] + dp[k-1]` (for odd `k \\ge 3`).\n\nIf `k` is even: `dp[k] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[k-1]`.\n`dp[k-2]` (for `k-2` even): `dp[k-2] = dp[1] + dp[3] + \\dots + dp[k-3]`.\nSo, `dp[k] = dp[k-2] + dp[k-1]` (for even `k \\ge 2`).\n\nThis means `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k \\ge 2`.\nCombined with `dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1`, this is exactly the Fibonacci sequence shifted.\n`F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots`\n`dp[0]=1 = F_1`\n`dp[1]=1 = F_2`\n`dp[2]=dp[1]+dp[0] = 1+1=2 = F_3`\n`dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[1] = 2+1=3 = F_4`\n`dp[4]=dp[3]+dp[2] = 3+2=5 = F_5`\n`dp[k] = F_{k+1}` for `k \\ge 0`.\n\nThe number of valid partitions is `dp[n] = F_{n+1}`.\nThe total probability is `F_{n+1} \\times (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}`.\n\nWe need to calculate `F_{n+1}` modulo `998244353` and `(1/2)^n` modulo `998244353`.\n`998244353` is a prime number.\n`2^n` can be computed using modular exponentiation.\n`(1/2)^n` is `(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}`. This can be computed as `pow(2, n * (MOD - 2), MOD)` using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Define `MOD = 998244353`.\n2. Compute `F_{n+1}`. Since `n` can be up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`, we can compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively in `O(n)` time.\n   `fib = [0]*(n+2)`\n   `fib[0] = 0`\n   `fib[1] = 1`\n   `for i from 2 to n+1: fib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % MOD`\n   The result is `fib[n+1]`.\n3.

Partition `[1,1], [2,2]`. Midpoints `1,2`.\n   `p_1=1` (covers 1), `p_2=1` (covers 2).\n   Towns `0,3` not covered. Towns `1,2` covered by exactly one.

Parities differ. Not allowed.\nSo, for `n=2`, there is only 1 valid partition.\n`dp[2]` should be `1`.\nMy `dp` sequence: `dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=2`.\nThis means my `dp[2]` is wrong.\n`dp[0]=1`\n`dp[1]=1` (last segment `[1,1]`, previous `dp[0]`)\n`dp[2]=1` (last segment `[2,2]`, previous `dp[1]`)\n`dp[3]=dp[0]+dp[2]=1+1=2` (last segments `[1,3]` or `[3,3]`, previous `dp[0]` or `dp[2]`)\n`dp[4]=dp[1]+dp[3]=1+2=3` (last segments `[2,4]` or `[4,4]`, previous `dp[1]` or `dp[3]`)\n\nThe sequence `1,1,1,2,3,5,...` is `F_{k+1}` starting `F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5`.\nSo `dp[k] = F_{k+1}`.\n`dp[0] = F_1 = 1`.\n`dp[1] = F_2 = 1`.\n`dp[2] = F_3 = 2`.
