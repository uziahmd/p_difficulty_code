    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the smallest ternary string after applying allowed swaps. The core idea here is to minimize the string lexicographically.  This means getting the '0's as far left as possible, followed by the '1's, and finally the '2's.\n\nThe allowed swaps are the key.  '0' and '1' can swap freely with each other, and the same goes for '1' and '2'.  However, and this is critical, '0' and '2' *cannot* swap directly.  They are essentially locked in their relative order.\n\nSo, let me think this through.  Since '0' and '1' can trade places at will, and so can '1' and '2', the positions of the '0's and the '2's relative to each other are key. If there's a '0' before a '2' in the original string, that relative order will *always* be preserved because those digits cannot jump over each other.  If a '2' is before a '0', that's also fixed.\n\nTherefore, the main strategy has to be to rearrange the '1's around this immutable \"0...2\" or \"2...0\" block. I need to figure out where to place the '1's strategically to achieve the smallest possible string, while respecting the pre-set order of the '0's and '2's.\n\nI believe I can build this into an algorithm where I can separate the string into segments and focus on rearranging the '1's within those segments. It's almost a puzzle of grouping the allowable moves strategically. I'll need to figure out the most efficient way to achieve this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string by performing a specific set of swaps:\n1. Adjacent '0' and '1' can swap ('01' <-> '10').\n2. Adjacent '1' and '2' can swap ('12' <-> '21').\nCrucially, adjacent '0' and '2' *cannot* swap.\n\nLet's analyze the implications of these rules:\n*   **'0' and '1'**: Since they can swap, a '0' can move past any '1' and vice-versa. This means '0's and '1's can be freely reordered among themselves.\n*   **'1' and '2'**: Similarly, '1's and '2's can be freely reordered among themselves.\n*   **'0' and '2'**: This is the key restriction. A '0' cannot move past a '2', and a '2' cannot move past a '0'. This implies that the *relative order* of '0's and '2's in the string is invariant. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it will always appear before that '2' in any reachable string. The same applies if a '2' appears before a '0'.\n\nConsider the characters '0' and '2' as \"fixed points\" that cannot pass each other. The '1's, however, are very mobile. A '1' can move past any '0' (by '01' <-> '10' swap) and any '2' (by '12' <-> '21' swap). This means a '1' can effectively move to any position in the string, as long as it doesn't try to cross a '0' and '2' that are \"stuck\" in relative order.\n\nMore precisely, all '1's can be grouped together and moved to any block of positions that doesn't require them to cross a '0' and a '2' that are in a fixed relative order. However, since '0's and '1's can swap, and '1's and '2's can swap, a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or any '2'. This means '1's can move past *all* '0's and *all* '2's.\n\nTherefore, the '1's can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's. To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nSince '0's cannot pass '2's, the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved. The '1's can be moved anywhere. To make the string lexicographically smallest:\n1.  All '0's should come first.\n2.  Then all '1's.\n3.  Then all '2's.\n\nHowever, this ideal order is constrained by the '0'-'2' restriction.\nThe solution strategy is:\n1.  Collect all '0's from the input string. These will form the prefix of our result.\n2.  Collect all '2's from the input string. These will form the suffix of our result.\n3.  All '1's can be moved past all '0's and all '2's. To make the string lexicographically smallest, these '1's should be placed *after* all '0's and *before* all '2's. But wait, this is not quite right.\n    Consider the example \"100210\":\n    '0's: two '0's\n    '1's: two '1's\n    '2's: one '2'\n    The relative order of '0's and '2's in \"100210\" is: '0' at index 1, '0' at index 2, '2' at index 3, '0' at index 5. So, '0' -> '0' -> '2' -> '0'. This relative order must be preserved.\n    The resulting string should be \"001120\". Here, the '1's are placed *after* the initial '0's and *before* the '2'. And the final '0' from the original string is placed after the '2'.\n\nThis means the '1's can be moved to *any* position without affecting the relative order of '0's and '2's.\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we should:\n1.  Place all '0's that appear *before* the first '2' in the original string at the beginning.\n2.  Then, place all '1's.\n3.  Then, place the first '2' encountered in the original string, followed by any subsequent '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\n\nLet's refine this:\nThe '1's are completely independent of the '0's and '2's. They can be moved to any position. To make the string lexicographically smallest, all '1's should be moved to the earliest possible position where they don't block any '0's from moving left.\nSince '0's can move past '1's, all '0's can move to the left of all '1's.\nSince '1's can move past '2's, all '1's can move to the left of all '2's.\nThe only restriction is '0's cannot move past '2's.\n\nThis implies that any '0' that appears before *any* '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning. Any '2' that appears after *any* '0' in the original string will appear after that '0'.\nThe '1's can be moved *between* the '0's and '2's.\nSpecifically, all '0's that are not preceded by a '2' can be moved to the beginning.\nAll '1's can be moved to form a block.\nAll '2's that are not followed by a '0' can be moved to the end.\n\nThe most straightforward interpretation of \"1's can move past everything\" is that they can be extracted from the string and re-inserted anywhere.\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1.  Count all '1's in the input string. Let this be `count_ones`.\n2.  Construct a new string by iterating through the input string `s`.\n    *   If `s[i]` is '0', append '0' to the result.\n    *   If `s[i]` is '2', append '2' to the result.\n    *   If `s[i]` is '1', ignore it for now (it's counted).\n3.  Now we have a string composed only of '0's and '2's, preserving their original relative order. To minimize lexicographically, we want to insert the block of `count_ones` '1's at the earliest possible position.\n    The earliest position where '1's can be inserted without hindering '0's from moving left is *after* all '0's that are not blocked by a '2'.\n    This means we should find the first occurrence of '2' in the string (if any). All '0's before this '2' can be placed before the '1's. All '2's (and any '0's after them) will be placed after the '1's.\n    So, the '1's should be inserted right before the first '2' encountered in the string (if a '2' exists). If no '2' exists, the '1's should be appended to the end of the '0's.\n\nLet's try this logic:\n1.  Extract all '1's. Count them (`count_ones`).\n2.  Form a temporary string `temp_s` by removing all '1's from the original string `s`. This `temp_s` will only contain '0's and '2's, preserving their relative order.\n3.  Find the index of the first '2' in `temp_s`. Let this be `first_two_idx`.\n    *   If `first_two_idx` is found (i.e., `temp_s` contains '2's):\n        The result string will be `temp_s[0:first_two_idx]` + (`'1'` repeated `count_ones` times) + `temp_s[first_two_idx:]`.\n    *   If `first_two_idx` is not found (i.e., `temp_s` contains only '0's):\n        The result string will be `temp_s` + (`'1'` repeated `count_ones` times).\n\nThis strategy ensures:\n*   All '0's that appear before any '2' in the original string are placed at the very beginning of the result, which is optimal for lexicographical order.\n*   All '1's are grouped together. By placing them *before* the first '2', we ensure they are as far left as possible without violating the '0'-'2' constraint (since '0's can still move past them).\n*   The '0's and '2's maintain their relative order, which is the only invariant property besides the counts of each character.\n\nExample 1: `s = \"100210\"`\n1.  `count_ones = 2`\n2.  `temp_s = \"0020\"` (remove '1's)\n3.  `first_two_idx = 2` (index of '2' in \"0020\")\n4.  Result: `temp_s[0:2]` + `'1'*2` + `temp_s[2:]`\n    `\"00\"` + `\"11\"` + `\"20\"` = `\"001120\"` (Matches example output)\n\nExample 2: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1.  `count_ones = 4`\n2.  `temp_s = \"2222\"` (remove '1's)\n3.  `first_two_idx = 0` (index of '2' in \"2222\")\n4.  Result: `temp_s[0:0]` + `'1'*4` + `temp_s[0:]`\n    `\"\"` + `\"1111\"` + `\"2222\"` = `\"11112222\"` (Matches example output)\n\nExample 3: `s = \"20\"`\n1.  `count_ones = 0`\n2.  `temp_s = \"20\"`\n3.  `first_two_idx = 0`\n4.  Result: `temp_s[0:0]` + `'1'*0` + `temp_s[0:]`\n    `\"\"` + `\"\"` + `\"20\"` = `\"20\"` (Matches example output)\n\nThis logic seems sound and covers all cases.\n\nImplementation details:\n*   Iterate through the string once to count '1's and build `temp_s`.\n*   Find the index of '2' in `temp_s`. Python's `str.find()` method is suitable.\n*   Concatenate the parts.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    temp_s_parts = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the string to count '1's and build temp_s (string of '0's and '2's)\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            temp_s_parts.append(char_s)\n    \n    temp_s = \"\".join(temp_s_parts)\n\n    # Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # '1's should be inserted before the first '2' to be lexicographically minimal.\n    # If no '2' exists, '1's are appended at the end.\n    \n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(temp_s)):\n        if temp_s[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n            \n    result_parts = []\n    if first_two_idx != -1:\n        # Insert '1's before the first '2'\n        result_parts.append(temp_s[0:first_two_idx])\n        result_parts.append('1' * count_ones)\n        result_parts.append(temp_s[first_two_idx:])\n    else:\n        # No '2's in temp_s, so append '1's at the end\n        result_parts.append(temp_s)\n        result_parts.append('1' * count_ones)\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_parts) + \"\\n\")\n\n# The problem statement implies multiple test cases in the example,\n# but competitive programming problems usually specify if there are multiple test cases\n# by giving a 'T' value.
