    "thought": "**Solving the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Array Stabilization problem. The goal is to write a Python script that takes an array of integers and figures out the minimum instability we can achieve by removing exactly one element. The instability is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the remaining array. Seems straightforward enough.\n\nFirst, I need to really understand the problem. I'm given an array 'a' of 'n' integers, and the instability is `max(a) - min(a)`. I have to remove one element, and the script needs to output the smallest possible instability of the remaining array. The constraints are `2 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^5`, so I need to keep efficiency in mind.\n\nI've looked at the examples. The first one clearly demonstrates how removing different elements yields different instabilities, and the goal is to find the minimum. In the second example, I can see that the instability can even be zero. It’s making me think about edge cases.\n\nNow, the key observation: to minimize `max(array) - min(array)`, I want to bring down the maximum and push up the minimum of the remaining array. That’s where the idea to sort the array comes in. If I sort 'a', it becomes `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`. Then `min_orig = a_1` and `max_orig = a_n`.\n\nThis means I only have to consider removing the smallest or the largest element to minimize the instability of the remaining `n-1` elements. Let’s break down the potential scenarios. If I remove the original minimum (`a_1`), the new minimum will be `a_2` and the maximum will stay as `a_n`. This results in the instability of `a_n - a_2`.\n\nNow, if I remove the original maximum element (`a_n`), the new maximum would be `a_(n-1)`, and the minimum would still be `a_1`. That leads to instability of `a_(n-1) - a_1`. All I need to do is calculate these two instabilities (when removing the smallest, and removing the largest), and the smaller of the two is the answer! I am seeing the solution clearly. I just need to translate this into Python code.\n",
