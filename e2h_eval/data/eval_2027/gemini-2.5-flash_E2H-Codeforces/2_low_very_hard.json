Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing and Implementing the \"X\" Shape Checker**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: I need to write a Python script to determine if an `n x n` grid of characters forms a specific \"X\" shape. The rules are pretty straightforward, but I need to make sure I get them right. I'm going to start by breaking down the core requirements:\n\nFirst, **diagonals** – all the characters on *both* main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right, and top-right to bottom-left) have to be identical. Second, **non-diagonals** – every character that *isn't* on either diagonal has to also be the same.  Finally, and this is crucial, the character used on the diagonals must be different from the character used everywhere else, the **difference** is key.\n\nThe input is `n`, which represents the grid's dimensions, it's an odd number from 3 to 299. It must be odd.\n\nI'm thinking I'll represent the grid as a list of lists (or a list of strings would also work) called `grid`. Now for the actual algorithm:\n\n1.  **Get `n` from the user**.\n2.  **Read the grid**.\n3.  **Identify diagonal character**:  I'll grab the top-left element, `grid[0][0]`, as the `diag_char`.  I can use this cell for the checking process. I'll need to then iterate through all the cells on both diagonals. This means, checking where `row == col` or `row + col == n - 1`. If any character on either diagonal is *not* equal to `diag_char`, then it's not an \"X\", and I can stop and print \"NO\".\n4.  **Identify non-diagonal character**: Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, I know there are going to be non-diagonal characters. I can use the position `grid[0][1]` to select the `nondiag_char`. Then, I need to check if `nondiag_char` is the same as `diag_char`; if so, it's immediately not an \"X\". The key to this shape is the *difference* in the letters used. If they are different, I can iterate over all non-diagonal cells (`row != col` and `row + col != n - 1`) and make sure they all match `nondiag_char`. If a mismatch pops up, it's \"NO\".\n5.  **If all checks pass**: Then it's an \"X\", so I'll print \"YES\".\n\nNow, I think I can refine this for clarity and efficiency. Let's make it cleaner and easier to read:\n\n1.  **Read `n`**.\n2.  **Read the grid**: `grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]` sounds like a clean way to handle this.\n3.  **Initialize**: I'll set `diag_char = grid[0][0]`.  I'll also have a `nondiag_char` variable, but I'll initialize it to `None` for now. I'll also add a `found_nondiag_char = False` flag to make sure I don't use it before it's been correctly selected.\n4.  **Iterate through the entire grid**: I'll go through every cell `(r, c)` from `0` to `n-1` for both `r` and `c`.  Inside the loop, I'll calculate `is_diagonal = (r == c) or (r + c == n - 1)`. If I'm on a diagonal, I'll make sure the character matches `diag_char`. If I am *not* on a diagonal, and `found_nondiag_char` is still False, I'll select that character as `nondiag_char` and set the flag to True. Then, I need to verify, that `nondiag_char` is *not* equal to `diag_char`. I'll do this immediately as the first conditional check. After I've set `nondiag_char` and confirmed the diagonal letters do not match the non-diagonal letters, I'll also verify all subsequent non-diagonal cells match this character. If at any point I find a mismatch, I'll print \"NO\" and be done.\n5. **If all checks pass**: If I make it through the entire grid without finding a violation of the rules, I can confidently print \"YES\". I think this revised approach is more structured and easier to debug, so this is how I'll",
