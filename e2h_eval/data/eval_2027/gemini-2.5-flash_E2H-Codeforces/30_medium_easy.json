Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**The TV Game: A Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're facing the \"TV Game\" problem, and my gut tells me dynamic programming is the key. The objective is clear: maximize the combined sum of two numbers formed by splitting a sequence of digits between Homer and Marge.\n\nFirst, I had to understand the game. Two players, a number with an even number of digits, and each player gets half of those digits to form their own numbers. The digits are appended to the *right* of their number, so the order you pick a digit matters. We need to find the best sequence of \"H\" and \"M\" moves.\n\nMy approach will be based on dynamic programming. I'll define a state `dp(idx, h_taken)`. The state represents the maximum possible combined score considering the digits from index `idx` onward, given that Homer has already taken `h_taken` digits. This will keep it simple. The other key variable is `m_taken` which can be derived from the current index and the number of digits Homer took.\n\nThe base case is when all digits are processed, and the number of Homer and Marge's digits are the same.\n\nThe core of the DP solution will be figuring out the *value* of the current digit based on who takes it. The place value matters the most here. If Homer picks digit `A[idx]`, the place value depends on how many digits he's taken before; this is crucial.\n\nI'll iterate through all the possible states in a bottom-up approach. For each state, I'll evaluate the two possible moves: Homer takes the digit, or Marge takes the digit. We then choose the move that leads to the better combined score. I'll keep track of the chosen sequence (\"H\" or \"M\") in a string for reconstructing the optimal solution.\n\nLet's trace some examples. After that, I will code it up in Python.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, such that they each take exactly `n` digits from a given `2n`-digit number `A`, and the sum of the numbers they form (`S1 + S2`) is maximized.\n\nLet the given number `A` be represented as a sequence of digits `A[0], A[1], ..., A[2n-1]`.\nWhen a player takes a digit `A[i]`, it is appended to their current number. Digits taken earlier will have higher place values. For example, if Homer takes digits `d1, d2, d3`, his number `S1` will be `d1 * 10^2 + d2 * 10^1 + d3 * 10^0`. If Homer takes `n` digits, the `k`-th digit he takes (0-indexed) will have a place value of `10^(n-1-k)`. The same logic applies to Marge.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We need to make `2n` decisions, one for each digit in `A`. For each digit `A[i]`, we decide whether Homer or Marge takes it. The state of our DP should capture enough information to make future decisions and calculate the total sum.\n\nA suitable DP state is `(idx, h_taken)`, where:\n- `idx` is the index of the current digit `A[idx]` being considered (from `0` to `2n-1`).\n- `h_taken` is the number of digits Homer has taken so far.\n\nFrom these two values, we can deduce `m_taken`, the number of digits Marge has taken so far: `m_taken = idx - h_taken`.\n\nLet `dp[idx][h_taken]` store a tuple `(max_total_sum, path_string)`:\n- `max_total_sum`: The maximum possible sum `S1 + S2` from the remaining digits `A[idx:]`, given that Homer has already taken `h_taken` digits and Marge has taken `m_taken` digits.\n- `path_string`: The sequence of 'H' and 'M' characters representing the optimal moves for the digits `A[idx:]`.\n\n**Base Case:**\n- If `idx == 2*n`: This means all `2n` digits have been processed.\n  - If `h_taken == n` and `m_taken == n` (which implies `idx - h_taken == n`), then both players have taken their `n` required moves. The remaining sum is `0`, and the path is an empty string `\"\"`.\n  - Otherwise (if the counts don't match `n`), this is an invalid state, so we return a very small sum (`-float('inf')`) to indicate it's not a viable path.\n\n**Transitions:**\nFor a state `(idx, h_taken)`:\n1. **Homer takes `A[idx]`:**\n   - This option is valid only if `h_taken < n`.\n   - The value of `A[idx]` contributes to `S1`. Since it's Homer's `(h_taken)`-th digit (0-indexed), its place value will be `10^(n - 1 - h_taken)`.\n   - Calculate `homer_contribution = int(A[idx]) * (10**(n - 1 - h_taken))`.\n   - Recursively call `solve(idx + 1, h_taken + 1)` to get the `(next_sum, next_path)` for the rest of the game.\n   - The total sum for this option is `homer_contribution + next_sum`. The path is `'H' + next_path`.\n\n2. **Marge takes `A[idx]`:**\n   - This option is valid only if `m_taken < n`.\n   - The value of `A[idx]` contributes to `S2`. Since it's Marge's `(m_taken)`-th digit (0-indexed), its place value will be `10^(n - 1 - m_taken)`.\n   - Calculate `marge_contribution = int(A[idx]) * (10**(n - 1 - m_taken))`.\n   - Recursively call `solve(idx + 1, h_taken)` (because `h_taken` doesn't change for Homer, but `m_taken` will increment in the next state) to get the `(next_sum, next_path)` for the rest of the game.\n   - The total sum for this option is `marge_contribution + next_sum`. The path is `'M' + next_path`.\n\nWe compare the total sums from both options and choose the one that yields the maximum. If the sums are equal, any path is acceptable (the problem states \"output any of them\"). We use memoization to store and retrieve results for already computed states to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n**Initial Call:**\nThe DP starts with `solve(0, 0)`, representing the beginning of the game where no digits have been processed (`idx=0`) and neither player has taken any digits (`h_taken=0`).\n\n**Constraints:**\n- `n` (1 to 18): This means `2n` is up to 36.\n- Number of states: `(2n + 1) * (n + 1)` which is approximately `37 * 19 = 703` states for `n=18`.\n- Each state involves two recursive calls. This is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n- The maximum sum can be large (e.g., `n=18`, all digits are '9'). `S1` and `S2` can be up to `18` digits long. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set a higher recursion limit for deep recursion in DP\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# Memoization table: stores (max_total_sum, path_string) for each state (idx, h_taken)\nmemo = {}\n\n# Store n and A as global or pass them around\nN = 0\nA_DIGITS = []\n\ndef solve(idx, h_taken):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum total prize and the corresponding move sequence\n    from the current state.\n\n    Args:\n        idx (int): The current index of the digit in A being considered.\n        h_taken (int): The number of digits Homer has taken so far.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple (max_sum, path_string) where max_sum is the maximum\n               total prize from this state onwards, and path_string is the\n               sequence of moves.\n    \"\"\"\n    m_taken = idx - h_taken  # Number of digits Marge has taken\n\n    # Base case: All digits processed\n    if idx == 2 * N:\n        if h_taken == N and m_taken == N:\n            return (0, \"\")  # Valid end state\n        else:\n            # Invalid end state (should not be reached if conditions are met)\n            # Return negative infinity to make this path undesirable\n            return (-float('inf'), \"\")\n\n    # Check memoization table\n    if (idx, h_taken) in memo:\n        return memo[(idx, h_taken)]\n\n    res_sum = -float('inf')\n    res_path = \"\"\n\n    # Option 1: Homer takes A[idx]\n    if h_taken < N:\n        homer_digit_val = A_DIGITS[idx]\n        # Calculate place value: (N - 1 - h_taken) is the exponent for 10\n        # For example, if N=2, h_taken=0, 10^(2-1-0) = 10^1 = 10\n        # if N=2, h_taken=1, 10^(2-1-1) = 10^0 = 1\n        homer_place_val = 10**(N - 1 - h_taken)\n        homer_contribution = homer_digit_val * homer_place_val\n\n        next_sum, next_path = solve(idx + 1, h_taken + 1)\n        current_sum_H = homer_contribution + next_sum\n\n        # If this path leads to a better sum, update result\n        if current_sum_H > res_sum:\n            res_sum = current_sum_H\n            res_path = 'H' + next_path\n\n    # Option 2: Marge takes A[idx]\n    if m_taken < N:\n        marge_digit_val = A_DIGITS[idx]\n        # Calculate place value similarly for Marge\n        marge_place_val = 10**(N - 1 - m_taken)\n        marge_contribution = marge_digit_val * marge_place_val\n\n        next_sum, next_path = solve(idx + 1, h_taken) # h_taken doesn't change\n        current_sum_M = marge_contribution + next_sum\n\n        # If this path leads to a better sum, update result\n        # Use '>' to prioritize 'H' if sums are equal, as per example output\n        if current_sum_M > res_sum:\n            res_sum = current_sum_M\n            res_path = 'M' + next_path\n\n    # Store and return the result for the current state\n    memo[(idx, h_taken)] = (res_sum, res_path)\n    return (res_sum, res_path)\n\ndef main():\n    global N, A_DIGITS\n\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    A_DIGITS = [int(d) for d in A_str]\n\n    # Start the DP from the initial state (index 0, Homer taken 0 digits)\n    max_total_prize, move_sequence = solve(0, 0)\n\n    sys.stdout.write(move_sequence + '\\n')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```",
