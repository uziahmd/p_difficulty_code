During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the LCM Minimization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the smallest `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. The key, as always, is to break down the LCM and look for patterns.\n\nMy first thought is to represent `a+k` as `x` and `b+k` as `y`. Then, the problem becomes minimizing `lcm(x, y)`.  I know `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`. So, the bigger the `gcd`, the smaller the LCM.\n\nLet's call `gcd(a+k, b+k)` as `g`. Since `g` divides `a+k` and `b+k`, it must divide their difference, which is `b-a`.  This is a significant insight!  `g` has to be a divisor of the absolute difference, `d = |b-a|`.\n\nNow, if `a` and `b` are equal, `d` becomes 0. In this trivial case, I know `k=0` will always give the minimum LCM, which is simply `a`. That's a quick edge case handled.\n\nAssuming `a` and `b` are distinct (so `d > 0`), I can iterate through all the divisors `g` of `d`. The question becomes: for a given `g`, how do I find a `k` that makes `gcd(a+k, b+k) = g`?\n\nSince `g` divides `a+k` and `b+k`, I can see that `a+k` should be a multiple of `g`, so I need `a+k â‰¡ 0 (mod g)`. This also implies that `b+k` is a multiple of `g` too. The smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this modular congruence is `k = g - (a mod g) mod g`. If `a` is already a multiple of `g`, `k` will be 0.\n\nSo, I'll go through each divisor `g` of `d`: calculate the corresponding `k_g`. Calculate the `lcm` for that `k`. Keep track of the minimum `lcm` and the corresponding `k` values.  At the end of the loop, I'll have the correct `k`.\n",
