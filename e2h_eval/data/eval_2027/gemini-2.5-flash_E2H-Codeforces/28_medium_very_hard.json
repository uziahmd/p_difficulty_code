String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Beautiful String\" Problem**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan. We've got this competitive programming problem involving \"beautiful strings\" that need to reduce to a target character `g` through a specific NOR operation. My first instinct is to break down the operation itself and see if there's an underlying structure.\n\nThe NOR operation, which is basically the opposite of OR, feels like a key piece. It's defined as `NOT(c1 OR c2)`. Thinking about the parity (evenness or oddness) of the ones in the string, and how the NOR operation affects that, is a good starting point. But after a bit of exploration with XOR, it seemed like a dead end.\n\nNext, I need to understand how repeatedly applying this NOR operation works. I've written out some small examples, trying to visualize how the string gets shorter with each step. It quickly becomes apparent that the final result depends on the order of operations, and something about the location of '1's in the string.\n\nI realized that the last '1' in the sequence, or the absence of any ones (all zeros), is the determining factor! If you have at least one '1', we can say that all characters after it are irrelevant. That means the result hinges on the position of the last '1' and whether the preceding characters cancel it out. This seems crucial.\n\nNow, let's represent the reduction process with a recursive function. After some experimentation, I've got this: if the first character of the string is 1, the result is 0. If it's a 0, we flip the result from the smaller string. I think this recursive structure will be the key to efficiently solve it.\n\nThe final string can only be 0 or 1. If we have to count all the beautiful strings, and the first character is '1', we can get all the beautiful strings that have '0' result directly without recursion.\n\nWith that recursive formula in mind, I realize it can be optimized with dynamic programming. I'll need to create a DP table to store intermediate results, avoiding redundant calculations. I've designed the states `f[i][j]` as the count of strings with `i` zeros and `j` ones that reduce to 1 and `h[i][j]` as 0. I got the relation between each.\nI'm confident I can now build my code to solve this efficiently. Now, it's just a matter of coding it up and getting the answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that reduce to a target character `g` (either 0 or 1). The reduction operation replaces the two last characters `c_1 c_2` with `NOT (c_1 OR c_2)`. This is the NOR operation. The string is repeatedly modified until its length becomes 1.\n\nLet `R(s)` denote the result of reducing string `s`.\nLet's analyze the NOR operation:\n- `0 NOR 0 = 1`\n- `0 NOR 1 = 0`\n- `1 NOR 0 = 0`\n- `1 NOR 1 = 0`\n\nThe operation is right-associative: `R(s_1 s_2 ... s_k) = s_1 NOR (s_2 NOR (... NOR (s_{k-1} NOR s_k)...))`.\n\nWe can derive a recursive property for `R(s)`:\n1. If the string length `k=1`, `R(s_1) = s_1`.\n2. If `k > 1`:\n   - If the first character `s_1 = 1`, then `R(s_1 ... s_k) = 1 NOR (s_2 NOR (...)) = 0`.\n   - If the first character `s_1 = 0`, then `R(s_1 ... s_k) = 0 NOR (s_2 NOR (...)) = NOT (s_2 NOR (...)) = NOT R(s_2 ... s_k)`.\n\nLet `f(i, j)` be the number of strings with `i` zeros and `j` ones that reduce to `1`.\nLet `h(i, j)` be the number of strings with `i` zeros and `j` ones that reduce to `0`.\nOur goal is to find `f(n, m)` if `g=1`, or `h(n, m)` if `g=0`.\nAll calculations should be modulo 1000000007.\n\n**Base Cases (strings of length 1):**\n- For \"0\" (`n=1, m=0`): `R(\"0\") = 0`. So, `f(1, 0) = 0`, `h(1, 0) = 1`.\n- For \"1\" (`n=0, m=1`): `R(\"1\") = 1`. So, `f(0, 1) = 1`, `h(0, 1) = 0`.\n\n**Recurrence Relations (for `i+j >= 2`):**\n\n**Case 1: `j=0` (string consists only of zeros, e.g., \"00\", \"000\")**\n- `f(i, 0)`:\n  Since `j=0`, the string must start with '0'. So `f(i, 0) = h(i-1, 0)` (from `NOT R(s_2...s_k) = 1`).\n- `h(i, 0)`:\n  Since `j=0`, the string must start with '0'. So `h(i, 0) = f(i-1, 0)` (from `NOT R(s_2...s_k) = 0`).\nApplying these with base cases:\n`f(1,0)=0, h(1,0)=1`\n`f(2,0)=h(1,0)=1, h(2,0)=f(1,0)=0`\n`f(3,0)=h(2,0)=0, h(3,0)=f(2,0)=1`\nPattern: `f(i, 0) = 1` if `i` is even and `i>=2`, `0` otherwise. `h(i, 0) = 1` if `i` is odd, `0` otherwise.\n\n**Case 2: `j>=1` (string contains at least one '1')**\n- `f(i, j)`:\n  Strings starting with '1' reduce to '0', so they don't contribute to `f(i, j)`.\n  Strings starting with '0': We need `NOT R(s_2...s_k) = 1`, meaning `R(s_2...s_k) = 0`. The suffix `s_2...s_k` has `i-1` zeros and `j` ones. This count is `h(i-1, j)`.\n  So, `f(i, j) = h(i-1, j)` (if `i>=1`, else `0`).\n- `h(i, j)`:\n  Strings starting with '1': These all reduce to '0'. There are `C(i+j-1, j-1)` such strings (choose positions for `j-1` ones among `i+j-1` remaining positions). This term is valid only if `j>=1`.\n  Strings starting with '0': We need `NOT R(s_2...s_k) = 0`, meaning `R(s_2...s_k) = 1`. The suffix `s_2...s_k` has `i-1` zeros and `j` ones. This count is `f(i-1, j)`.\n  So, `h(i, j) = (C(i+j-1, j-1) if j>=1 else 0) + (f(i-1, j) if i>=1 else 0)`.\n\n**Special Handling for `i=0, j>=2` (string consists only of ones, e.g., \"11\", \"111\")**\n- `f(0, j)`: Since `i=0`, `i-1` is negative, so `h(i-1, j)` is 0. Thus `f(0, j) = 0`.\n- `h(0, j)`: `C(j-1, j-1) = 1`. Since `i=0`, `f(i-1, j)` is 0. Thus `h(0, j) = 1`.\nThis means for `j>=2`, the string \"1...1\" reduces to 0. This is correct: `R(\"11\") = 1 NOR 1 = 0`, `R(\"111\") = 1 NOR (1 NOR 1) = 1 NOR 0 = 0`.\n\nThe maximum values for `n, m` are `10^5`. We cannot use a 2D DP table.\nNotice that `f(i, j)` and `h(i, j)` only depend on values with `i-1` zeros. This suggests we can iterate `i` from `0` to `n` and only keep track of the previous `i`'s values.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. We need to precompute factorials and inverse factorials for combinations `C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!)`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Initialize `fact` and `inv_fact` arrays up to `N_MAX = n+m` for combinations.\n2. Handle the edge case `n=0, m=0`: Problem statement says `n+m >= 1`, so this case is not possible.\n3. If `m=0`: (string \"0...0\")\n   - If `g=0`: Answer is `1` if `n` is odd, `0` if `n` is even.\n   - If `g=1`: Answer is `1` if `n` is even and `n>=2`, `0` if `n` is odd or `n=0`.\n   This can be simplified: `g=0` -> `h(n,0) = (n%2==1)`. `g=1` -> `f(n,0) = (n%2==0 and n>=2)`.\n   If `n=0, m=0`, it's `0`. But `n+m>=1`. If `n=0` and `m=0` was allowed, `f(0,0)=0, h(0,0)=0`.\n\n4. Initialize `prev_f[j]` and `prev_h[j]` arrays for `i-1` values, and `curr_f[j]` and `curr_h[j]` for current `i` values.\n   For `i=0`:\n     `curr_f[0] = 0`, `curr_h[0] = 0` (for `n=0, m=0` which is not allowed but conceptually useful)\n     `curr_f[1] = 1`, `curr_h[1] = 0` (for `n=0, m=1`, string \"1\")\n     `curr_f[j] = 0`, `curr_h[j] = 1` for `j >= 2` (for `n=0, m=j`, string \"1...1\")\n   Copy `curr_f` to `prev_f`, `curr_h` to `prev_h`.\n\n5. Iterate `i` from `1` to `n`:\n   - `curr_f[0] = prev_h[0]`\n   - `curr_h[0] = prev_f[0]`\n   - For `j` from `1` to `m`:\n     `curr_f[j] = prev_h[j]`\n     `term_C = C(i+j-1, j-1)`\n     `curr_h[j] = (term_C + prev_f[j]) % MOD`\n   - Copy `curr_f` to `prev_f`, `curr_h` to `prev_h`.\n\n6. After the loops, the answer is `prev_f[m]` if `g=1`, or `prev_h[m]` if `g=0`.\n\n**Combinations `C(N, K)`:**\n`C(N, K) = fact[N] * inv_fact[K] * inv_fact[N-K] % MOD`.\n`inv_fact[x]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `fact[x]`.\nWe can compute modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem: `a^(MOD-2) % MOD`.\n\n**Example `n=1, m=1, g=0`:**\n`N_MAX = 2`.\n`fact = [1, 1, 2]`, `inv_fact = [1, 1, 500000004]` (mod 10^9+7)\n`i=0`:\n  `prev_f = [0, 1, 0, ...]`, `prev_h = [0, 0, 1, ...]`. (up to `m=1`, so `prev_f[0]=0, prev_f[1]=1`, `prev_h[0]=0, prev_h[1]=0`)\n\n`i=1`:\n  `curr_f[0] = prev_h[0] = 0`\n  `curr_h[0] = prev_f[0] = 0`\n  `j=1`:\n    `curr_f[1] = prev_h[1] = 0`\n    `term_C = C(1+1-1, 1-1) = C(1,0) = 1`\n    `curr_h[1] = (term_C + prev_f[1]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`\n  `prev_f = [0, 0, ...]`, `prev_h = [0, 2, ...]`.\n\nTarget `g=0`, so `prev_h[1] = 2`. Correct.\n\n**Example `n=2, m=2, g=0`:**\n`N_MAX = 4`.\n`i=0`:\n  `prev_f = [0, 1, 0, 0, ...]`, `prev_h = [0, 0, 1, 1, ...]`. (up to `m=2`)\n\n`i=1`:\n  `curr_f[0] = prev_h[0] = 0`\n  `curr_h[0] = prev_f[0] = 0`\n  `j=1`:\n    `curr_f[1] = prev_h[1] = 0`\n    `term_C = C(1+1-1, 1-1) = C(1,0) = 1`\n    `curr_h[1] = (1 + prev_f[1]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`\n  `j=2`:\n    `curr_f[2] = prev_h[2] = 1`\n    `term_C = C(1+2-1, 2-1) = C(2,1) = 2`\n    `curr_h[2] = (2 + prev_f[2]) % MOD = (2 + 0) % MOD = 2`\n  `prev_f = [0, 0, 1, ...]`, `prev_h = [0, 2, 2, ...]`.\n\n`i=2`:\n  `curr_f[0] = prev_h[0] = 0`\n  `curr_h[0] = prev_f[0] = 0`\n  `j=1`:\n    `curr_f[1] = prev_h[1] = 2`\n    `term_C = C(2+1-1, 1-1) = C(2,0) = 1`\n    `curr_h[1] = (1 + prev_f[1]) % MOD = (1 + 0) % MOD = 1`\n  `j=2`:\n    `curr_f[2] = prev_h[2] = 2`\n    `term_C = C(2+2-1, 2-1) = C(3,1) = 3`\n    `curr_h[2] = (3 + prev_f[2]) % MOD = (3 + 1) % MOD = 4`\n  `prev_f = [0, 2, 2, ...]`, `prev_h = [0, 1, 4, ...]`.\n\nTarget `g=0`, so `prev_h[2] = 4`.
