The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Xenia and Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, I'm thinking about how to approach this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem.  It's a classic, I've seen variations on this type of ring problem before. The goal is to minimize the total time Xenia spends completing tasks on a circular road.\n\nLet's see. We've got `n` houses, numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks. Each task `a_i` requires Xenia to be at a specific house. She can only move clockwise, which is the key here. It takes one unit of time to move to the next house.\n\nXenia starts at house 1 and has to complete the tasks in order. So, I need to figure out the most efficient route for her.\n\nMy initial thought is to keep track of her `current_house` and the `total_time`. For each task, I'll need to calculate the time it takes to move from the `current_house` to the target house `a_i`.\n\nSince the ring is circular, I need to account for wraparound. If the target house is ahead of the current house, it's a simple subtraction. But if the target is behind the current house, she has to go all the way around, which involves wrapping around the circle.  That will be the most important part of this.\n\nI'll calculate the time needed for each task as `(a_i - current_house + n) % n`. This handles both cases.  If `a_i >= current_house`, the modulo doesn't change it. If `a_i < current_house`, then it makes the math more clear.\n\nLet me think. I'll need to initialize `current_house` to 1 and `total_time` to 0. Then, for each task, I calculate the time, add it to `total_time`, and update `current_house`. Then repeat.\n\nI should check my thinking with a quick example. If n=4, m=3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3] and walk through the calculations to make sure I get the expected total time. If my mental math matches what the output would be, then I will be ready to translate this algorithm into code.  Alright, let's write some Python!\n",
