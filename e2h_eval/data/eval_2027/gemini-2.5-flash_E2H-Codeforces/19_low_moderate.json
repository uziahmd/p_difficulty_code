The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition & Strategy Formulation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Number Games\" problem. I understand I have a nation structured as a tree, with districts and fans per district, based on powers of 2.  The goal is to remove a certain number of contestants, `k`, and maximize the total fans of the *remaining* districts, making sure those remaining districts form a single connected component.\n\nMy first thought is, since maximizing the sum of fans for the remaining districts is the same as minimizing the sum of fans for the removed districts (because the total number of fans is fixed), I should focus on minimizing the removed districts' fan count. Since the fan count is `2^i` for each district `i`, the smaller the `i`, the smaller the fan count. This immediately tells me I should prioritize removing districts with the *smallest* indices. This is a key insight.\n\nThe constraints also clarify my path: it's a tree, so the connections between districts are straightforward and I know my bounds for `n` and `k`.\n\nTherefore, I need to come up with a way to find the `n-k` largest-indexed districts that form a connected component *or* find the smallest `k` districts I must remove while maintaining the connected component.\n\nMy strategy needs to consider keeping districts in *decreasing* order of their index.  I'll start with district `n`, then `n-1`, and so on. At each step, I must verify I still have a connected component after adding the current district. If adding a district breaks the connectivity of the remaining components, then I cannot include it. I should continue removing districts in the same order until the set of remaining districts is a valid connected component of size `n-k`.\n\nThis feels like it could be a dynamic programming or greedy problem, possibly with some form of tree traversal or connectivity checking.  Now I have to devise the algorithm in Python.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove `k` contestants (districts) such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and the total number of fans of the remaining contestants is maximized. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`.\n\nTo maximize `sum(2^i)` for the remaining contestants, we should minimize `sum(2^i)` for the removed contestants. Since `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i`, minimizing the sum means we should prioritize removing districts with smaller indices. For example, removing district 1 saves `2^1`, which is much less than removing district `n` (saving `2^n`).\n\nTherefore, our strategy should be: try to keep districts with the largest possible indices. We want to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component and have the largest possible indices. This implies we should try to keep district `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on.\n\nLet's rephrase this: we want to find a connected component of size `n-k` that includes districts with the highest possible indices.\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of their index: `n, n-1, ..., 1`. We want to \"keep\" as many of these high-indexed districts as possible.\n\nWe can use a greedy approach based on this observation:\n1. Initialize a set of `removed` districts as empty.\n2. Initialize a `count_kept` variable to 0.\n3. Iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\n4. For each district `i`:\n   If we can add district `i` to our set of `kept` districts such that the `kept` districts still form a connected component, and `count_kept` does not exceed `n-k`, we should try to keep it.\n\nThis greedy approach can be implemented more efficiently by considering what happens when we *remove* a district. If we remove a district, it splits its neighbors into separate components. We want to remove `k` districts, and these `k` districts should be the ones with the smallest indices, as long as their removal doesn't disconnect the \"core\" component of high-indexed districts.\n\nLet's maintain a set of \"active\" districts that we are currently considering keeping. Initially, all districts are active. We want to remove `k` districts.\nThe districts we want to remove are `1, 2, ..., k_0`, then `k_0+1, ...` etc., always picking the smallest available index.\n\nConsider the districts `n, n-1, ..., 1`. We are trying to form a connected component of size `n-k`.\nThe largest possible index is `n`. We definitely want to keep `n` if possible.\nThen `n-1`. We want to keep `n-1` if it's connected to `n` (or any other kept node) and we still have capacity.\nThis is a \"select `n-k` nodes to keep\" problem.\n\nLet's use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure.\nWe iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nFor each district `i`:\n1. Mark `i` as \"active\" (i.e., not yet removed).\n2. Add `i` to our DSU structure as a new component of size 1.\n3. For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n   If `j` is already active (meaning `j > i` and we processed it, or `j` is one of the nodes we've decided to keep), then unite the components of `i` and `j` in the DSU.\n   After uniting, if the size of the component containing `i` becomes `n-k`, we have found our target connected component. All other `k` districts (those not in this component) must be removed. These will naturally be the districts `1, ..., i-1` plus any `j` that were not connected to `i` (and were smaller than `i`).\n\nThis approach needs to be careful about which nodes are \"active\". A better way to think about it:\nWe iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`. We want to keep `i` if possible.\nWe maintain the current number of nodes we have decided to keep, let's call it `kept_count`.\nWe also maintain the set of nodes we have decided to remove, `removed_nodes`.\nInitially, `kept_count = 0`, `removed_nodes = []`.\nAll nodes are initially considered \"candidates\" for keeping.\n\nWhen we process node `i` (from `n` down to `1`):\nIf `kept_count < n-k`: We want to keep `i` if it helps form a connected component of `n-k` nodes.\nTo do this, we can use a DSU structure.\nInitialize DSU with `n` components, each node `i` in its own component.\nMaintain `is_removed[i]` for each node. Initially all `is_removed` are false.\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  Mark `i` as `is_removed[i] = True`. This means `i` is a candidate for removal.\n  `k_removed_so_far++`.\n  If `k_removed_so_far == k`:\n    We have removed `k` nodes. The remaining `n-k` nodes must form a connected component.\n    To check this, we need to find all nodes that are NOT marked `is_removed`.\n    Pick any such node, say `x`. Perform a BFS/DFS starting from `x`, only traversing to other non-removed nodes. If the count of reachable nodes is `n-k`, then this set is a valid connected component. The nodes marked `is_removed` are our answer.\n    This check needs to be done efficiently.\n\nA more direct approach:\nWe want to find the largest `x` such that the connected component containing `x` (and only `n-k` nodes total) consists of nodes with the largest possible indices.\nThe key insight for this type of problem is often to iterate from the \"best\" candidates (largest index) downwards.\n\n1. **Adjacency List:** Build an adjacency list for the tree.\n2. **`is_removed` array:** Create a boolean array `is_removed` of size `n+1`, initialized to `False`. This tracks which districts are removed.\n3. **`removed_count`:** Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n4. **Iterate from `n` down to `1`:**\n   For each district `curr_node` from `n` down to `1`:\n     If `curr_node` is already part of a component we've committed to keeping (i.e., it's connected to `n`, `n-1`, etc., and we haven't reached `n-k` nodes yet), we don't remove it.\n     Otherwise, if `removed_count < k`:\n       Mark `is_removed[curr_node] = True`.\n       Increment `removed_count`.\n     If `removed_count == k`, we have made our `k` removals. The remaining `n-k` nodes must form a connected component. We need to verify this.\n\nThis logic is tricky because removing a node might disconnect others.\nThe correct greedy strategy is to start with *all* nodes as potential candidates to keep.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. Which `k` nodes are the \"cheapest\" to remove? The ones with the smallest indices.\nSo, we try to remove `1, 2, 3, ...` up to some point.\nThis is a standard problem: find the largest connected component of `n-k` nodes, where the nodes have highest possible indices.\nThis is equivalent to finding the smallest `k` nodes such that their removal leaves a connected component of size `n-k`.\n\nLet's use a DSU, but in reverse.\n1. Initialize a DSU structure where each node `i` is in its own set.\n2. Maintain `component_size[root]` for each set.\n3. `active_nodes_count = 0`.\n4. `removed_nodes_list = []`.\n5. Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n   Mark `i` as `active`. Increment `active_nodes_count`.\n   For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n     If `j` is also `active` (meaning `j > i` or `j` was activated earlier in this process, which is not possible here as we iterate downwards, so `j` must be `> i`):\n       If `find(i) != find(j)`:\n         `active_nodes_count -= component_size[find(i)] + component_size[find(j)] - component_size[union(i, j)]` (This logic is wrong. `active_nodes_count` should just be incremented when a node becomes active.)\n         `union(i, j)`.\n   Now, `i` is \"activated\". The current DSU structure represents connected components among *only* the active nodes.\n   If `active_nodes_count > n-k`:\n     This means we have activated more than `n-k` nodes. We must remove some.\n     The node `i` that was just activated made the count exceed `n-k`.\n     This implies that `i` is the `(n-k+1)`-th node (in decreasing order) that we are trying to keep.\n     We need to remove `active_nodes_count - (n-k)` nodes.\n     Which nodes should we remove? The ones with the smallest indices among the currently active nodes.\n     This means we should remove `i` and some other nodes.\n     This is tricky.\n\nLet's try a simpler approach based on the \"remove smallest indices\" idea.\nWe have `n` nodes. We want to remove `k` of them.\nConsider the nodes from `n` down to `1`. We will try to keep them.\nWe need to find a \"root\" node `R` for our final connected component of `n-k` nodes.\nThe largest possible `R` is `n`.\nIf we pick `R=n`, we can run a BFS/DFS from `n` to find all nodes reachable from `n` without passing through any *removed* nodes.\nBut we don't know which nodes are removed yet.\n\nThis problem is a variation of finding a maximum weight connected subgraph.\nThe weights `2^i` are very distinct. This means we should prioritize larger `i`.\nThe strategy is: keep `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, ..., as long as they are connected to the existing kept set and we haven't exceeded `n-k` nodes.\nThis is exactly what the DSU approach does when iterating downwards:\n\n**Correct DSU approach:**\n1. **Adjacency List:** Store the tree structure.\n2. **DSU Initialization:**\n   * `parent`: array for DSU parent pointers. `parent[i] = i` initially.\n   * `sz`: array for size of component. `sz[i] = 1` initially.\n   * `is_kept`: boolean array, `is_kept[i] = False` initially. This marks if node `i` is part of our final `n-k` connected component.\n   * `kept_count = 0`.\n   * `removed_nodes = []`.\n3. **Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:**\n   * Mark `is_kept[i] = True`. This means `i` is a candidate for the final component.\n   * `kept_count += 1`.\n   * For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n     * If `is_kept[j]` is `True` (meaning `j` is a node with index > `i` that we are also keeping):\n       * If `find(i) != find(j)`:\n         * `kept_count -= sz[find(i)] + sz[find(j)]` (before union)\n         * `union(i, j)`\n         * `kept_count += sz[find(i)]` (after union, `find(i)` is the new root)\n         * The `kept_count` logic is tricky here. The DSU `sz` array already tracks the size of the component. We just need to make sure the total count of `is_kept` nodes that are in the *same* component is `kept_count`.\n         * A simpler way: `kept_count` is just the number of nodes `i` where `is_kept[i]` is true.\n         * The DSU `sz` array should track the size of the component *among only the `is_kept` nodes*.\n         * Let `root_of_i = find(i)`, `root_of_j = find(j)`. If `root_of_i != root_of_j`, then `union(i, j)`. The `kept_count` doesn't change from union, it only changes when a new node `i` is marked `is_kept`.\n   * After processing `i` and its neighbors:\n     * If `kept_count > n-k`:\n       * This means we have selected `n-k+1` (or more) nodes. Node `i` is the one that caused us to exceed `n-k`.\n       * We must remove `i`.\n       * Mark `is_kept[i] = False`.\n       * `kept_count -= 1`.\n       * Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n       * If `removed_nodes` count reaches `k`, we are done. Break the loop.\n\nThis DSU logic for `kept_count` also seems problematic. The `kept_count` should simply be the number of nodes `p` such that `is_kept[p]` is `True`. The DSU `sz` array should reflect the size of the component *among the `is_kept` nodes*.\n\nLet's refine the DSU approach:\n1. **Adjacency List:** Build `adj`.\n2. **DSU Structure:**\n   * `parent`: `list(range(n + 1))`\n   * `sz`: `[1] * (n + 1)` (size of component, including only currently active nodes)\n   * `max_sz`: `0` (maximum size of any component of active nodes)\n   * `max_sz_root`: `-1` (root of the component with `max_sz`)\n3. **`is_active` array:** `[False] * (n + 1)`\n4. **`removed_list`:** `[]`\n5. **Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:**\n   * Mark `is_active[i] = True`.\n   * Reset `parent[i] = i`, `sz[i] = 1`.\n   * If `sz[i]` (which is 1) is greater than `max_sz`, update `max_sz = 1`, `max_sz_root = i`.\n   * For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n     * If `is_active[j]` is `True`:\n       * If `find(i) != find(j)`:\n         * `root_i = find(i)`\n         * `root_j = find(j)`\n         * `current_max_sz = max_sz`\n         * `union(i, j)` (assume `union` updates `sz` of new root)\n         * `new_root = find(i)`\n         * If `sz[new_root] > current_max_sz`:\n           `max_sz = sz[new_root]`\n           `max_sz_root = new_root`\n   * **Crucial Check:** After processing `i` and its neighbors, if `max_sz > n - k`:\n     * This means the component rooted at `max_sz_root` now has more than `n-k` nodes.\n     * The node `i` we just activated must be \"removed\" to reduce the size of the largest component.\n     * We need to find `i` in the `max_sz_root` component. We must remove it.\n     * Set `is_active[i] = False`.\n     * Add `i` to `removed_list`.\n     * If `len(removed_list) == k`, we are done.\n     * **Problem:** Removing `i` from the DSU is hard. DSU doesn't support efficient deletion.\n\nThis approach is flawed because removing `i` from `is_active` and its component is not straightforward with DSU.\n\n**The actual standard solution for this problem type:**\nIt's about finding the \"core\" component. The `n-k` nodes we keep will form a connected component. This component must have a \"root\" or a \"highest index\" node.\nLet's call the `n-k` nodes we keep `S_kept`. We want `sum_{i in S_kept} 2^i` to be maximized.\nThis means `S_kept` should contain `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, ... as much as possible.\n\nConsider the nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nWe will iterate from `n` down to `1`.\nWe maintain `active_nodes_count`, the number of nodes we have decided to keep.\nWe also maintain a DSU structure for the nodes we are keeping.\nWhen we process node `i`:\n1. If `active_nodes_count < n-k`:\n   We tentatively keep `i`. Add `i` to our DSU. `active_nodes_count++`.\n   For each neighbor `j` of `i`: if `j` is already kept (i.e., `j > i`), union `i` and `j` in DSU.\n   After this, `i` is part of some component.\n   If `sz[find(i)] > n-k`: This means by adding `i`, one component became too large. This means we have to remove `i`.\n   So, we rollback: `active_nodes_count--`, `i` is removed. Add `i` to `removed_list`.\n   If `len(removed_list) == k`, we are done.\n2. If `active_nodes_count == n-k`:\n   We cannot keep any more nodes. So `i` must be removed.\n   Add `i` to `removed_list`.\n   If `len(removed_list) == k`, we are done.\n\nThis is the correct logic:\n1. **Adjacency List:** `adj`\n2. **DSU:** `parent`, `sz` (size of component in DSU)\n3. **`is_kept` array:** `[False] * (n + 1)`\n4. **`kept_count`:** `0` (total nodes marked `is_kept`)\n5. **`removed_list`:** `[]`\n6. **Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:**\n   * If `kept_count == n-k`:\n     * We have already selected `n-k` nodes. Any further node `i` must be removed.\n     * Add `i` to `removed_list`.\n     * If `len(removed_list) == k`, break.\n     * Continue to next `i`.\n   * **Tentatively keep `i`:**\n     * `is_kept[i] = True`\n     * `kept_count += 1`\n     * Initialize DSU for `i`: `parent[i] = i`, `sz[i] = 1`.\n     * For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n       * If `is_kept[j]` is `True`:\n         * `union(i, j)` (union by size/rank)\n     * **Check connectivity constraint:**\n       * If `sz[find(i)] > n-k`:\n         * This means the component containing `i` (and potentially other `is_kept` nodes) has grown larger than the allowed `n-k` nodes.\n         * This implies that `i` must be removed.\n         * **Rollback `i`:**\n           * `is_kept[i] = False`\n           * `kept_count -= 1`\n           * Add `i` to `removed_list`.\n           * If `len(removed_list) == k`, break.\n           * **Crucial:** We need to \"un-union\" `i` from its neighbors in the DSU. This is not directly supported by DSU.\n           * Instead, the DSU `sz` array should only count nodes that are `is_kept` and are part of the current component.\n\nThis problem is a classic application of a DSU where we process nodes in a specific order (decreasing index) and make greedy decisions. The `sz` in DSU must represent the size of the connected component *among the `is_kept` nodes*.\n\nLet's refine DSU for this specific problem:\n1. `parent`: `list(range(n + 1))`\n2. `component_size`: `[0] * (n + 1)` (This will store the count of `is_kept` nodes in the component)\n3. `is_removed`: `[False] * (n + 1)`\n4. `removed_count = 0`\n5. `kept_nodes_in_largest_component = 0` (This is the key variable)\n\nDSU `find` function:\n```python\ndef find(i):\n    if parent[i] == i:\n        return i\n    parent[i] = find(parent[i])\n    return parent[i]\n```\n\nDSU `union` function:\n```python\ndef union(i, j):\n    root_i = find(i)\n    root_j = find(j)\n    if root_i != root_j:\n        # Union by size\n        if component_size[root_i] < component_size[root_j]:\n            root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i # Ensure root_i is larger or equal\n        parent[root_j] = root_i\n        component_size[root_i] += component_size[root_j]\n        # We need to update kept_nodes_in_largest_component if this union creates a new largest component\n        # This is handled in the main loop\n        return True\n    return False\n```\n\nMain loop:\n```python\n# Read n, k, build adj\n# Initialize DSU: parent, component_size (all 0), is_removed (all False)\n# Initialize removed_list = []\n# Initialize kept_nodes_in_largest_component = 0\n\nfor i in range(n, 0, -1): # Iterate from n down to 1\n    # When node i is considered, it's initially NOT removed.\n    # It starts its own component of size 1 (if it's not removed)\n    parent[i] = i\n    component_size[i] = 1 # Node i itself counts as 1 kept node\n\n    # Try to connect i with its already 'kept' neighbors\n    for j in adj[i]:\n        if not is_removed[j]: # If neighbor j is not removed (meaning it's 'kept')\n            if union(i, j): # If union happened, component_size for root_i is updated\n                # Update kept_nodes_in_largest_component\n                # The root of the new merged component is find(i)\n                kept_nodes_in_largest_component = max(kept_nodes_in_largest_component, component_size[find(i)])\n    \n    # After trying to connect i, check if the largest component is too big\n    if kept_nodes_in_largest_component > n - k:\n        # If adding i (and its connections) made the largest component too big,\n        # then i must be removed.\n        is_removed[i] = True\n        removed_list.append(i)\n        \n        # Now, i is removed. Its contribution to component_size needs to be undone.\n        # This is the tricky part.

Its `component_size[i]` is 1.\n2. We connect `i` to its neighbors `j` that are also not removed.\n3. After `i` is processed, we have a set of nodes `n, n-1, ..., i` that are potentially not removed, plus any `j < i` that were initially marked as not removed.\n4. If the largest component among *all currently not removed nodes* exceeds `n-k` in size, then `i` must be one of the `k` nodes to be removed.\n   This is because `i` is the smallest index node we just considered, and its inclusion caused the violation. If we remove `i`, the largest component size might drop.\n\nThis suggests that `component_size[root]` should always reflect the count of `NOT_REMOVED` nodes in that component.\nWhen `i` is processed:\n  `parent[i] = i`\n  `component_size[i] = 1` (initially, assuming `i` is kept)\n  `kept_nodes_in_largest_component = max(kept_nodes_in_largest_component, 1)`\n  For `j` in `adj[i]`:\n    If `j` is not `is_removed[j]`: (This means `j` is a node `> i` that we've decided to keep)\n      `union(i, j)`\n      `kept_nodes_in_largest_component = max(kept_nodes_in_largest_component, component_size[find(i)])`\n\n  If `kept_nodes_in_largest_component > n - k`:\n    `is_removed[i] = True`\n    `removed_list.append(i)`\n    If `len(removed_list) == k`: break\n    \n    # This is the critical part: When `i` is removed, it affects component_size.\n    # We must decrement `component_size[find(i)]` by 1.\n    # And potentially re-evaluate `kept_nodes_in_largest_component`.\n    # This is not easily done with DSU.\n\nThe correct way to handle this is to use a DSU that allows \"deactivation\" or to process the nodes in reverse.\nWhat if we process nodes from `1` to `n`?\nIf we add nodes `1, 2, ..., n` one by one, we can maintain connected components.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. To minimize `sum(2^i)` of removed nodes, we remove `1, 2, ..., k_0`, then `k_0+1, ...` etc.\nThis means we try to keep nodes `n, n-1, ...`.\n\nLet's use a DSU with `n` elements. `parent[i]` and `size[i]` are standard.\nWe also need `is_active[i]` to indicate if node `i` is part of the current graph.\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n1. Set `is_active[i] = True`. This means `i` is now part of the graph.\n2. Initialize `parent[i] = i`, `size[i] = 1`.\n3. For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n   If `is_active[j]` is `True`:\n     `union(i, j)`\n4. After processing `i` and its neighbors, check the size of the component containing `i`. Let `root_i = find(i)`.\n   If `size[root_i] > n - k`:\n     This means the component containing `i` (and other nodes `> i` that are active) has become too large.\n     Node `i` is the \"culprit\" because it's the smallest index node that caused this.\n     So, `i` *must* be one of the `k` removed nodes.\n     Set `is_active[i] = False`.\n     Add `i` to `removed_list`.\n     If `len(removed_list) == k`, we are done. Break.\n     **Problem:** If `is_active[i]` is set to `False`, the DSU structure is now incorrect. `size[root_i]` still counts `i`.\n     This requires a DSU that can handle deletions, or a \"rollback DSU\".\n\nA \"rollback DSU\" approach for this specific problem:\n1. Initialize DSU for all `n` nodes. `parent[i]=i`, `sz[i]=1`.\n2. `is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`\n3. `removed_list = []`\n4. `current_kept_nodes = 0` (Total number of nodes not in `removed_list`)\n5. `max_component_size = 0` (Size of the largest component among `current_kept_nodes`)\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n  `current_kept_nodes += 1`\n  `parent[i] = i`\n  `sz[i] = 1`\n  `current_max_component_size_after_i_added = 1` # If `i` is its own component\n  \n  # Connect `i` to its neighbors that are not removed\n  for `j` in `adj[i]`:\n    if not `is_removed[j]`:\n      # If `j` is not removed, it means `j` is either `>i` and we decided to keep it,\n      # or `j < i` but was already decided to be kept (which is not possible here).\n      # So `j` must be `>i`.\n      `root_i = find(i)`\n      `root_j = find(j)`\n      if `root_i != root_j`:\n        `union(i, j)` # This updates parent and sz\n        `current_max_component_size_after_i_added = max(current_max_component_size_after_i_added, sz[find(i)])`\n      else:\n        `current_max_component_size_after_i_added = max(current_max_component_size_after_i_added, sz[root_i])`\n\n  `max_component_size = max(max_component_size, current_max_component_size_after_i_added)`\n\n  If `max_component_size > n - k`:\n    `is_removed[i] = True`\n    `removed_list.append(i)`\n    `current_kept_nodes -= 1`\n    \n    # We need to re-calculate `max_component_size` for the remaining `current_kept_nodes`.\n    # This is the part that makes it difficult.\n    # The `max_component_size` is based on the DSU state, which is now incorrect because `i` is removed.\n    # A full re-calculation would involve iterating through all `n` nodes, finding their roots,\n    # and summing `sz` for components, which is O(N) at each step, leading to O(N^2). Too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation is that we are trying to remove `k` nodes. The total number of nodes to keep is `n-k`.\nIf we iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`, and decide to keep `i`, we add it to a DSU.\nWe also maintain `active_count`, the number of nodes we have decided to keep.\nIf `active_count` exceeds `n-k`, we must remove the \"cheapest\" node that caused this excess. The cheapest node is `i`.\nSo, if `active_count` becomes `n-k+1` (after adding `i`), we remove `i`.\nBut this doesn't guarantee connectivity. The `n-k` nodes must form a *single* connected component.\n\nThe problem states \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\". This means they form a single connected component.\n\nThis is a very common problem structure. The solution involves finding the \"root\" of the desired component.\nThe \"root\" is the highest-indexed node that is part of the final `n-k` connected component.\nLet this root be `R`. Then all other `n-k-1` nodes in the component must be reachable from `R` using only other nodes in the component.\nWe try `R=n`, then `R=n-1`, etc.\nFor a given `R`:\n1. Mark `R` as `kept`.\n2. Perform a BFS/DFS starting from `R`, adding neighbors to a queue/stack only if they are *not* already marked as `removed`.\n3. The goal is to find `n-k` such nodes.\n4. If we find `n-k` nodes, we have a candidate set. The remaining `k` nodes are removed.\n5. We want to find the `R` that minimizes the sum of `2^i` for removed nodes. This means `R` should be as large as possible.\n\nThis implies we should try `R=n`.\nIf we try to build the component rooted at `n`:\n  Start BFS from `n`.\n  `q = deque([n])`\n  `visited = {n}`\n  `kept_nodes = [n]`\n  While `q` is not empty and `len(kept_nodes) < n-k`:\n    `curr = q.popleft()`\n    For `neighbor` in `adj[curr]`:\n      If `neighbor` not in `visited`:\n        `visited.add(neighbor)`\n        `q.append(neighbor)`\n        `kept_nodes.append(neighbor)`\n        If `len(kept_nodes) == n-k`: break\n  \n  If `len(kept_nodes) == n-k`:\n    We have found a valid component. The nodes to remove are `all_nodes - set(kept_nodes)`.\n    This set of removed nodes will be `n - k` nodes.\n    This is the *best* possible set of `n-k` nodes because it prioritizes `n`, then `n-1`, etc.\n    This greedy strategy works because `2^i` grows so fast. We want to keep the highest `i`s.\n    By performing a BFS/DFS starting from `n` and greedily adding neighbors (which effectively means adding smaller `i`s if `n` has neighbors with smaller `i`), we are implicitly trying to keep `n`, then the largest available neighbors, etc.\n\nLet's test this greedy BFS strategy:\n1. Build adjacency list `adj`.\n2. Initialize `q = deque()` for BFS.\n3. Initialize `is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n4. Initialize `kept_count = 0`.\n5. Initialize `removed_candidates = []`.\n\nThe problem is that the \"root\" of the component is not necessarily `n`. It could be `n-1` if `n` is removed.\nThe problem is asking us to remove `k` specific nodes.\nThe strategy must be: keep `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, ... up to `n-k_0` such that they form a connected component of size `n-k`.\n\nLet's use the DSU approach, but only consider nodes that are *not* in `removed_list`.\n1. `adj`: Adjacency list.\n2. `parent`: DSU parent array.\n3. `component_size`: DSU component size array.\n4. `is_removed`: `[False] * (n + 1)`.\n5. `removed_list`: `[]`.\n6. `kept_nodes_count = 0`.\n\nDSU functions (`find`, `union`) remain the same. `component_size` should refer to the count of nodes *in the original graph* within the component.\n\n```python\n# Initialize DSU: parent, component_size (all 1 initially)\n# is_removed (all False)\n# removed_list = []\n# current_kept_nodes_count = n # All nodes are initially kept\n# max_component_size_among_kept = n # Initially, all nodes form one component\n\n# The iteration should be for deciding which nodes to remove.\n# We want to remove the smallest k indices.\n# So, iterate from 1 to n.\n# Try to remove node `i`.\n# If `i` is removed, check if `n-k` remaining nodes are connected.\n# This check is too slow.\n\n# The solution is a common trick for \"remove k nodes to maximize sum of weights in connected component\".\n# Iterate from `n` down to `1`.\n# For each node `i`, we decide if it is kept or removed.\n# We maintain a DSU of *all* nodes.\n# `is_kept[i]` is a boolean array.\n# `kept_count` is the total number of nodes for which `is_kept[i]` is True.\n# `max_kept_component_size` is the size of the largest connected component consisting only of `is_kept` nodes.\n\n# Adjacency list\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\nfor _ in range(n - 1):\n    u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj[u].append(v)\n    adj[v].append(u)\n\n# DSU initialization\nparent = list(range(n + 1))\nsz = [0] * (n + 1) # Size of component *among kept nodes*\n# The `sz` array needs to be carefully handled.\n# When a node `i` is tentatively kept, `sz[i]` becomes 1.\n# When `union(i, j)` occurs, `sz[root_i]` increases by `sz[root_j]`.\n\ndef find(i):\n    if parent[i] == i:\n        return i\n    parent[i] = find(parent[i])\n    return parent[i]\n\ndef union(i, j):\n    root_i = find(i)\n    root_j = find(j)\n    if root_i != root_j:\n        if sz[root_i] < sz[root_j]: # Union by size\n            root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i\n        parent[root_j] = root_i\n        sz[root_i] += sz[root_j]\n        return True\n    return False\n\nis_kept = [False] * (n + 1)\nremoved_list = []\nkept_count = 0 # Total number of nodes marked as kept\nmax_kept_component_size = 0 # Size of the largest component of kept nodes\n\nfor i in range(n, 0, -1):\n    # Tentatively keep node i\n    is_kept[i] = True\n    kept_count += 1\n    \n    # Initialize DSU for node i\n    parent[i] = i\n    sz[i] = 1 # Node i itself contributes 1 to its component size\n    \n    # Update max_kept_component_size with node i's initial component\n    max_kept_component_size = max(max_kept_component_size, sz[i])\n\n    # Try to connect i with its already-kept neighbors\n    for j in adj[i]:\n        if is_kept[j]: # If neighbor j is also kept\n            root_i = find(i)\n            root_j = find(j)\n            if root_i != root_j:\n                # Store old sizes before union to potentially update max_kept_component_size\n                old_sz_root_i = sz[root_i]\n                old_sz_root_j = sz[root_j]\n                \n                union(i, j)\n                \n                # After union, one of the old roots is now merged.\n                # The new root (say root_i) has updated sz[root_i].\n                # If either of the merged components was the previous max_kept_component_size,\n                # we need to re-evaluate it.\n                # A simpler way is to just update max_kept_component_size with the new size.\n                max_kept_component_size = max(max_kept_component_size, sz[find(i)])\n            else: # i and j are already in the same component\n                max_kept_component_size = max(max_kept_component_size, sz[root_i])\n\n\n    # After processing node i and its neighbors, check if the largest component of kept nodes\n    # exceeds the allowed size (n-k).\n    if max_kept_component_size > n - k:\n        # If it does, node i must be removed. It's the \"cheapest\" node (smallest index)\n        # that caused the component to exceed the limit.\n        is_kept[i] = False\n        kept_count -= 1\n        removed_list.append(i)\n        \n        # When i is removed, it's no longer part of any component.\n        # Its contribution to `sz` for its component needs to be undone.\n        # This is the tricky part. We cannot simply decrement `sz[find(i)]`\n        # because `find(i)` might have been merged with other components.\n        # The DSU does not support deletion.\n\nThis problem is very similar to \"Maximum Spanning Tree\" with connectivity constraints.\nThe constraint \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\" means that the `n-k` kept nodes must form a single connected component.\n\nThe greedy approach is to pick the `n-k` nodes with largest indices that form a connected component.\nThis means we pick `n`. Then we pick `n-1` if it's connected to `n`. Then `n-2` if it's connected to `n` or `n-1`.\nThis is a BFS/DFS starting from `n`, but it's limited to `n-k` nodes.\n\nLet's try the BFS approach from a \"highest possible root\":\n1. Build adjacency list `adj`.\n2. `kept_nodes = set()`\n3. `q = deque()`\n4. `num_to_keep = n - k`\n\n5. Initialize `removed_nodes = []`\n6. `is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`\n\n7. To find the `n-k` nodes to keep:\n   We want the ones with largest indices.\n   We iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`.\n   If `i` is not already marked `is_removed` and `kept_nodes_count < num_to_keep`:\n     We try to add `i` and its connected components.\n     This is essentially what the DSU approach tries to do.\n\nFinal attempt at the DSU logic. The `sz` array in DSU should represent the size of the component for the *active* nodes.\nWhen `i` is processed from `n` down to `1`:\n1. `is_active[i] = True`. This means `i` is now considered part of the graph.\n2. `parent[i] = i`, `sz[i] = 1`. (Initialize `i` as a new component of size 1).\n3. For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n   If `is_active[j]` is `True`:\n     `union(i, j)`.\n4. Now, the DSU reflects the components among all `is_active` nodes.\n5. We need to find the largest component `max_comp_size` among `is_active` nodes.\n   This can be done by iterating `p` from `1` to `n`. If `is_active[p]` and `parent[p] == p`, then `sz[p]` is a component size.\n   This `max_comp_size` check itself is `O(N)`. Too slow inside the loop.\n\nThe solution needs to be `O(N log N)` or `O(N alpha(N))`.\nThe `max_comp_size` needs to be updated efficiently. When a `union` occurs, `max_comp_size` could increase.\nWhen `i` is marked `is_active`, `max_comp_size` could increase if `i` forms a new component of size 1, or joins an existing one.\n\nLet `max_comp_size_val` be the largest component size currently.\n`max_comp_size_root` be its root.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    parent = list(range(n + 1))\n    component_size = [0] * (n + 1) # Stores size of component for 'active' nodes\n    \n    # DSU functions\n    def find(i):\n        if parent[i] == i:\n            return i\n        parent[i] = find(parent[i])\n        return parent[i]\n\n    def union(i, j):\n        root_i = find(i)\n        root_j = find(j)\n        if root_i != root_j:\n            # Union by size\n            if component_size[root_i] < component_size[root_j]:\n                root_i, root_j = root_j, root_i\n            parent[root_j] = root_i\n            component_size[root_i] += component_size[root_j]\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    is_active = [False] * (n + 1) # True if node is currently considered 'kept'\n    removed_list = []\n    \n    # This variable tracks the size of the largest connected component among 'active' nodes.\n    # It must be updated carefully.\n    max_active_component_size = 0 \n\n    # Iterate from n down to 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        # Tentatively add node i to the set of 'active' nodes\n        is_active[i] = True\n        parent[i] = i\n        component_size[i] = 1 # Node i starts its own component of size 1\n        \n        # Update max_active_component_size with the new component of size 1\n        max_active_component_size = max(max_active_component_size, 1)\n\n        # Connect node i to its active neighbors\n        for j in adj[i]:\n            if is_active[j]:\n                # Before union, get the current sizes of components involving i and j\n                root_i_old = find(i)\n                root_j_old = find(j)\n                \n                if union(i, j): # If a merge happens\n                    new_root = find(i) # The new root after union\n                    # The new component size is component_size[new_root]\n                    # Update max_active_component_size if this new component is larger\n                    max_active_component_size = max(max_active_component_size, component_size[new_root])\n                    \n                    # If either of the merged components (root_i_old or root_j_old)\n                    # was previously the largest, we need to re-evaluate max_active_component_size.\n                    # A simple max update is not enough because the old largest might have been one of the merged ones.\n                    # We need to ensure max_active_component_size always reflects the true maximum.\n                    # This check is the problematic part.\n                    # The `max_active_component_size` should be the maximum of `component_size[root]` for all `root`\n                    # where `is_active[root]` and `parent[root] == root`.\n                    # This implies iterating through roots, which is O(N).\n                    # This is why standard DSU doesn't work for deletion or dynamic max component size.\n\n        # After processing i and its neighbors:\n        # If the largest component of active nodes exceeds n-k, then node i must be removed.\n        # This is because i is the smallest-indexed node whose inclusion caused the excess.\n        if max_active_component_size > n - k:\n            is_active[i] = False\n            removed_list.append(i)\n            \n            # When i is removed, its contribution to component_size must be undone.\n            # This is the core difficulty.

When a union occurs, remove old sizes, add new size. When a node is removed, decrement its component size, if it becomes 0, remove it.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's simplify the problem: we want to find `n-k` nodes.\nThe final set of `n-k` nodes will be `S`.\n`S` must be connected.\nThe sum `sum(2^i for i in S)` must be maximized.\nThis is equivalent to minimizing `sum(2^i for i not in S)`.\nSo, we want to remove the `k` smallest indices possible, while keeping `n-k` nodes connected.\n\nThis means we should try to remove `1, 2, ..., k_0` for some `k_0`.\nThe remaining nodes `k_0+1, ..., n` must form a connected component of size `n-k`.\nThis requires `k_0 = k`.\nSo, we remove `1, 2, ..., k`. Check if `k+1, ..., n` are connected. If yes, this is the answer.\nIf no, we must keep some `j <= k`. Which `j`? The one with largest index.\nSo, we remove `1, ..., j-1, j+1, ..., k, k+1, ...`\nThis is equivalent to finding the largest `i` such that if we remove all nodes `j < i` and `j > i` that are not connected to `i` (and are not `n-k` nodes), then the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component.\n\nThe problem is essentially asking for the largest set of `n-k` nodes that form a connected component and include node `n`. If node `n` cannot be part of such a component (e.g., if it's isolated and `n-k > 1`), then we try `n-1`, etc.\n\nThe example: `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `6-3=3` nodes.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`.\nGraph:\n1 -- 2 -- 3\n     | \\\n     4  6 -- 5\n\nTry to keep node 6.\nBFS from 6 for 3 nodes:\nQueue: [6]\nVisited: {6}\nKept: {6} (size 1)\n\nPop 6. Neighbors: 2, 5.\nAdd 5. Queue: [2, 5]. Visited: {6, 5}. Kept: {6, 5} (size 2)\nAdd 2. Queue: [5, 2]. Visited: {6, 5, 2}. Kept: {6, 5, 2} (size 3).\nKept count is 3. We are done.\nThe kept nodes are {2, 5, 6}.\nRemoved nodes are {1, 3, 4}.\nThis matches the example output: `1 3 4`.\n\nThis BFS strategy works!\nWhy does it work? Because `2^i` is so dominant.\nIf we need to keep `N-K` nodes, we should always try to keep the node with the largest index, say `X`.\nThen, we perform a BFS/DFS starting from `X` to find `N-K-1` more nodes.\nWhich neighbors should we prioritize? The ones with larger indices. But the problem structure is a tree, so any path is unique. BFS naturally explores neighbors without bias to index.\nHowever, BFS guarantees that we find the *closest* `N-K` nodes to `X`. Since all nodes have positive fan values, any `N-K` connected component is better than none. And since `2^i` is so dominant, prioritizing `X` (the largest index) is always the best choice. If `X` can be part of an `N-K` component, that component will always have a higher fan sum than any component not containing `X`.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n1. Build adjacency list.\n2. `num_to_keep = n - k`.\n3. `kept_nodes = set()`\n4. `q = deque()`\n5. `is_visited = [False] * (n + 1)`\n\n6. Start BFS from node `n`.\n   `q.append(n)`\n   `is_visited[n] = True`\n   `kept_nodes.add(n)`\n\n   While `q` is not empty and `len(kept_nodes) < num_to_keep`:\n     `curr = q.popleft()`\n     For `neighbor` in `adj[curr]`:\n       If `not is_visited[neighbor]`:\n         `is_visited[neighbor] = True`\n         `q.append(neighbor)`\n         `kept_nodes.add(neighbor)`\n         If `len(kept_nodes) == num_to_keep`:\n           break # Found enough nodes\n\n7. After BFS, `kept_nodes` contains the `n-k` districts that maximize fan count.\n8. The `removed_districts` are all districts `1..n` that are not in `kept_nodes`.\n   Create a list of all districts `[1..n]`. Iterate through it. If district `d` is not in `kept_nodes`, add it to `removed_districts`.\n9. Print `removed_districts` in increasing order.\n\nThis is much simpler and seems correct due to the property of `2^i`.\nComplexity:\n* Building adjacency list: `O(N)`\n* BFS: `O(N)` (visits each node and edge at most once)\n* Constructing `removed_districts`: `O(N)`\n* Sorting `removed_districts`: `O(K log K)` where `K <= N`.\nTotal complexity: `O(N)`. This fits `N=10^6`.\n\nLet's double-check the logic. What if the `N-K` component cannot include node `N`?\nExample: `N=3, K=1`. Keep 2 nodes.\nEdges: `(1,2), (2,3)`.\nGraph: `1 -- 2 -- 3`.\nBFS from 3:\nQueue: [3]\nVisited: {3}\nKept: {3} (size 1)\nPop 3. Neighbors: 2.\nAdd 2. Queue: [2]. Visited: {3, 2}. Kept: {3, 2} (size 2).\nKept count is 2. Done.\nRemoved: {1}. Output: 1. Max fans: `2^2 + 2^3 = 12`.\nThis is correct.\n\nWhat if node `N` is removed?\nExample: `N=4, K=2`. Keep 2 nodes.\nEdges: `(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)`.\nGraph: `1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4`.\nBFS from 4 for 2 nodes:\nQueue: [4]\nVisited: {4}\nKept: {4} (size 1)\nPop 4. Neighbors: 3.\nAdd 3. Queue: [3]. Visited: {4, 3}. Kept: {4, 3} (size 2).\nKept count is 2. Done.\nRemoved: {1, 2}. Output: `1 2`. Max fans: `2^3 + 2^4 = 8 + 16 = 24`.\nThis is correct.\n\nThe greedy strategy works because the `2^i` values are so spread out. Any component that includes `n` will always have a higher fan sum than any component that doesn't, assuming the component size is `n-k`. If there are multiple components of size `n-k` that include `n`, the one found by BFS (which explores \"closest\" nodes first) will include `n` and its \"closest\" `n-k-1` neighbors. This set of nodes is guaranteed to have the highest possible sum of `2^i` because it includes `n` and then prioritizes other high-indexed nodes that are \"close\" to `n`.\n\nThe solution for the first example:\n`N=6, K=3`. Keep `6-3=3` nodes.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`.\nGraph:\n1 -- 2 -- 3\n     | \\\n     4  6 -- 5\n\nBFS from 6:\n`q = deque([6])`\n`is_visited = [F,F,F,F,F,F,T]` (index 6 is True)\n`kept_nodes = {6}`\n\n1. `curr = 6`. Neighbors: 2, 5.\n   `neighbor = 2`. `is_visited[2]` is F. Set `is_visited[2]=T`. `q.append(2)`. `kept_nodes.add(2)`. `kept_nodes = {6,2}`. `len(kept_nodes)` is 2.\n   `neighbor = 5`. `is_visited[5]` is F. Set `is_visited[5]=T`. `q.append(5)`. `kept_nodes.add(5)`. `kept_nodes = {6,2,5}`. `len(kept_nodes)` is 3.\n   `len(kept_nodes) == num_to_keep` (3 == 3). Break.\n\n`kept_nodes = {2, 5, 6}`.\nRemoved nodes: `[1,2,3,4,5,6] - {2,5,6} = {1,3,4}`.\nOutput: `1 3 4`. This matches the example.\n\nThis simple BFS strategy is correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    num_to_keep = n - k\n\n    # If we need to keep all nodes (k=0), this logic is slightly different\n    # but problem states 1 <= k < n.
