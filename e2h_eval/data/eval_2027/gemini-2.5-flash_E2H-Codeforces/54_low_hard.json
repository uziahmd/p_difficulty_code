Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Finding the Optimal Angle in a Regular N-gon**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to locate three unique vertices on a regular convex n-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a target angle 'a'.  My initial thought is to represent the vertices as $V_0, V_1, ... V_{n-1}$.  I can fix one vertex, let's say $V_k$, as the vertex of the angle I'm evaluating.\n\nThe core idea is to leverage the geometry of a regular n-gon and its circumcircle.  Since all vertices lie on a circumcircle, the inscribed angle theorem applies.  The key is realizing that the inscribed angle formed by vertices $V_i$, $V_k$, and $V_j$ (where $V_k$ is the vertex of the angle) is directly related to the central angle subtended by the arc formed by $V_i$ and $V_j$ (excluding the arc containing $V_k$).  Specifically, the inscribed angle is half of the central angle.\n\nNow, I know that the central angle subtended by a single side (i.e., between two adjacent vertices) is $360/n$ degrees.  Therefore, the central angle subtended by an arc connecting $V_i$ and $V_j$ is simply the number of \"unit\" arcs, say 'm', between them (not including those that include $V_k$) multiplied by $360/n$.  So, the inscribed angle, my angle of interest, is $m \\times (360/n) / 2$, which simplifies to $m \\times (180/n)$.\n\nEssentially, I need to find the value of 'm' (the number of \"unit\" arcs between $V_i$ and $V_j$ not including $V_k$) that yields an angle closest to my target 'a'.  The constraints are important. The vertices need to be distinct, so 'm' can range from 1 to n-2. That's the core of the problem. It's an optimization over 'm'.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3$ of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle $\\angle v_1 v_2 v_3$ is as close as possible to a given angle $a$. We need to output the vertex indices (1-based).\n\nAll vertices of a regular polygon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices of the polygon, say $\\angle v_1 v_2 v_3$, is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\nLet the vertices of the n-gon be $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_n$ in clockwise order.\nThe central angle subtended by an arc connecting adjacent vertices (one side of the polygon) is $360/n$ degrees.\nIf an arc spans $k$ sides of the polygon, the central angle it subtends is $k \\times (360/n)$ degrees.\nThe inscribed angle subtending this arc will be half of this central angle: $k \\times (360/n) / 2 = k \\times (180/n)$ degrees.\n\nFor an angle $\\angle v_1 v_2 v_3$, the vertex is $v_2$. The angle subtends the arc between $v_1$ and $v_3$ that does not contain $v_2$.\nLet's fix $v_2$ to be $V_1$.\nThen $v_1$ and $v_3$ must be other distinct vertices.\nLet $v_1 = V_i$ and $v_3 = V_j$.\nThe number of sides $k$ on the arc between $V_i$ and $V_j$ (not containing $V_1$) can range from $1$ to $n-2$.\nFor example, if $v_1 = V_2$ and $v_3 = V_3$, then $k=1$. The angle is $\\angle V_2 V_1 V_3 = 1 \\times (180/n)$.\nIf $v_1 = V_2$ and $v_3 = V_4$, then $k=2$. The angle is $\\angle V_2 V_1 V_4 = 2 \\times (180/n)$.\nIn general, if $v_2 = V_x$, $v_1 = V_y$, $v_3 = V_z$, the number of sides $k$ on the arc $V_y V_z$ (not containing $V_x$) is the difference in indices modulo $n$, adjusted to be between $1$ and $n-2$.\nSpecifically, if we fix $v_2 = V_1$, then $v_1$ and $v_3$ are $V_{1+k_1}$ and $V_{1+k_2}$ (indices modulo $n$, mapping $0$ to $n$). The angle will be $(k_2 - k_1) \\times (180/n)$ if $k_1 < k_2$.\nThe crucial observation is that all possible angles are of the form $k \\times (180/n)$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-2\\}$.\n\nSo, we need to find an integer $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-2\\}$ such that $|k \\times (180/n) - a|$ is minimized.\n\nLet $angle\\_unit = 180/n$.\nThe possible angles are $1 \\times angle\\_unit, 2 \\times angle\\_unit, \\ldots, (n-2) \\times angle\\_unit$.\nWe are looking for $k$ such that $|k \\times angle\\_unit - a|$ is minimized.\nThis is equivalent to finding $k$ such that $k \\times angle\\_unit$ is closest to $a$.\nLet $k_{target} = a / angle\\_unit = a / (180/n) = (a \\times n) / 180$.\nSince $k$ must be an integer, we should check the integers closest to $k_{target}$. These are $\\lfloor k_{target} \\rfloor$ and $\\lceil k_{target} \\rceil$.\nLet $k_1 = \\lfloor k_{target} \\rfloor$ and $k_2 = \\lceil k_{target} \\rceil$.\n\nWe need to consider $k$ values in the range $[1, n-2]$.\nSo, the candidate $k$ values are:\n1. $k_{cand1} = \\max(1, \\min(n-2, k_1))$\n2. $k_{cand2} = \\max(1, \\min(n-2, k_2))$\n\nIt's possible that $k_1 = k_2$ (if $k_{target}$ is an integer). In this case, we only have one candidate $k$.\nOtherwise, we compare $|k_{cand1} \\times angle\\_unit - a|$ and $|k_{cand2} \\times angle\\_unit - a|$.\nThe $k$ that gives the minimum absolute difference is our optimal $k$.\n\nOnce we find the optimal $k$, we need to output three vertices.\nWe can always choose $v_2 = V_1$.\nThen $v_1$ and $v_3$ must be such that the arc between them (not containing $V_1$) spans $k$ sides.\nA simple choice is $v_1 = V_2$ and $v_3 = V_{k+2}$.\nThese vertices are $V_1$, $V_2$, $V_{k+2}$.\nThey are distinct because $k \\ge 1$. $V_2 \\ne V_1$. $V_{k+2} \\ne V_1$ (since $k+2 \\ge 3$). $V_{k+2} \\ne V_2$ (since $k \\ge 1 \\implies k+2 \\ge 3$).\nAlso, $k+2 \\le (n-2)+2 = n$. So $V_{k+2}$ is a valid vertex index.\nThus, the vertices $1, 2, k+2$ will form the desired angle.\n\nLet's walk through an example: $n=4, a=67$.\n$angle\\_unit = 180/4 = 45$.\nPossible angles are $1 \\times 45 = 45$ and $2 \\times 45 = 90$ (since $k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$).\n$k_{target} = (67 \\times 4) / 180 = 268 / 180 \\approx 1.488$.\n$k_1 = \\lfloor 1.488 \\rfloor = 1$.\n$k_2 = \\lceil 1.488 \\rceil = 2$.\nBoth $k_1=1$ and $k_2=2$ are within the range $[1, n-2] = [1, 2]$.\nDifference for $k=1$: $|1 \\times 45 - 67| = |45 - 67| = |-22| = 22$.\nDifference for $k=2$: $|2 \\times 45 - 67| = |90 - 67| = |23| = 23$.\nThe minimum difference is 22, achieved with $k=1$.\nOptimal $k=1$.\nOutput vertices: $1, 2, 1+2 = 3$. So, $1 \\ 2 \\ 3$. This matches example output $2 \\ 1 \\ 3$ (which is equivalent).\n\nExample: $n=4, a=68$.\n$angle\\_unit = 45$.\nPossible angles: $45, 90$.\n$k_{target} = (68 \\times 4) / 180 = 272 / 180 \\approx 1.511$.\n$k_1 = \\lfloor 1.511 \\rfloor = 1$.\n$k_2 = \\lceil 1.511 \\rceil = 2$.\nBoth $k_1=1$ and $k_2=2$ are within range $[1, 2]$.\nDifference for $k=1$: $|1 \\times 45 - 68| = |45 - 68| = |-23| = 23$.\nDifference for $k=2$: $|2 \\times 45 - 68| = |90 - 68| = |22| = 22$.\nThe minimum difference is 22, achieved with $k=2$.\nOptimal $k=2$.\nOutput vertices: $1, 2, 2+2 = 4$. So, $1 \\ 2 \\ 4$. This matches example output $4 \\ 1 \\ 2$ (which is equivalent).\n\nEdge cases:\n$n=3, a=15$.\n$angle\\_unit = 180/3 = 60$.\nPossible angles: $1 \\times 60 = 60$ (since $k \\in \\{1\\}$).\n$k_{target} = (15 \\times 3) / 180 = 45 / 180 = 0.25$.\n$k_1 = \\lfloor 0.25 \\rfloor = 0$.\n$k_2 = \\lceil 0.25 \\rceil = 1$.\nRange for $k$ is $[1, 3-2] = [1, 1]$.\n$k_{cand1} = \\max(1, \\min(1, 0)) = 1$.\n$k_{cand2} = \\max(1, \\min(1, 1)) = 1$.\nBoth candidates point to $k=1$.\nDifference for $k=1$: $|1 \\times 60 - 15| = |60 - 15| = 45$.\nOptimal $k=1$.\nOutput vertices: $1, 2, 1+2 = 3$. So, $1 \\ 2 \\ 3$.
