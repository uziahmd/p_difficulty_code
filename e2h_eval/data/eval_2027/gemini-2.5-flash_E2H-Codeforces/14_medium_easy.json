He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find all positive integers 'n' for which 'n!' ends with exactly 'm' zeroes, where 'm' is given.  \n\nFirst, I need to understand how to count the trailing zeroes in a factorial. The number of zeroes is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor, which is limited by the number of factors of 5 (since there are always more factors of 2). I can use Legendre's formula, which is `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`. This formula calculates the number of factors of 5 in 'n!'.\n\nI've observed that `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. It increases only when 'n' is a multiple of 5. For example, Z(5) jumps from 0 to 1, Z(10) jumps from 1 to 2, and so on. Also note that Z(25) jumps from 4 to 6 because 25 has two factors of 5.\n\nThe problem asks for 'n' such that `Z(n) = m`. This suggests I can use binary search because of the non-decreasing nature of Z(n). I need to find the smallest 'n' where `Z(n)` is *at least* 'm'.\n\nLet's estimate the search space for 'n'. Since `Z(n)` is approximately `n/4`, I can approximate `n` as `4m`. So, if `m` is 100,000, `n` will be around 400,000. For safety, I'll set the upper bound of the search space at 5 * m + 10. The lower bound is clearly 1.\n\nI'll write a function `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` to calculate the number of trailing zeros efficiently using a loop based on the Legendre formula.\n\nNext, I'll perform a binary search. I'll search for the smallest 'n_min' such that `count_trailing_zeroes(n_min)` is greater than or equal to 'm'.\n\nAfter the binary search, I have 'ans_n_min'. If `Z(ans_n_min)` equals 'm', I have a solution. But I need to identify all possible solutions. Because `Z(n)` remains constant across values when there aren't multiples of 5, the solutions will be a contiguous block, typically of size 5:  `ans_n_min`, `ans_n_min + 1`, `ans_n_min + 2`, `ans_n_min + 3`, and `ans_n_min + 4`. I can prove that `ans_n_min` is a multiple of 5. If it's not, I can contradict its minimality.  Also, if  `ans_n_min` is the smallest value where `Z(n) = m`, it must be a multiple of 5.  This means I'll have exactly 5 solutions.  If `Z(ans_n_min)` doesn't equal 'm', there are no solutions.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Binary search to find the smallest 'n_min' such that `Z(n_min) >= m`.\n2. Check if `Z(n_min) == m`.\n3. If yes, the answer is `5` and print `n_min, n_min+1, n_min+2, n_min+3, n_min+4`.\n4. If no, print `0`.\n\nI need to make sure I handle the input/output according to the problem format. It requires printing the number of solutions followed by the solutions themselves, space-separated, on the next line.  I'll use `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` for input and output, as is typical in competitive programming.\n\nI'll test my code with various edge cases like `m = 1`, and `m = some value that is not reachable`, like `m=5`, to verify the logic.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that the algorithm's time complexity is efficient. The binary search and `count_trailing_zeroes` function are both logarithmic, making the entire solution efficient enough to pass the time constraints of the contest. I'll then submit the code.\n",
