Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Crafting the X-Shaped Grid Checker**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: I need to write a Python script to determine if an `n x n` grid of characters forms a specific \"X\" shape. The rules are pretty straightforward, but I need to make sure I get them right. I'm going to structure my thought process here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines an \"X\". It's all about diagonals and non-diagonals. The diagonals, both main and anti-diagonal, must all have the same character. The rest of the grid – the non-diagonal elements – must also share a character, but this character *must be different* from the one on the diagonals.  And, oh yeah, `n` is always odd, between 3 and 300.\n\nI'll represent this grid as `paper[row][col]`, so, like, `paper[0][0]` is the top-left corner.  To figure out the diagonals, I need a quick way to identify diagonal elements.  If `row == col`, I'm on the main diagonal. If `row + col == n - 1`, I'm on the anti-diagonal.  So, if `row == col` OR `row + col == n - 1`, then I'm diagonal.\n\nAlright, algorithm time. I can break this down into steps:\n\n1.  Read `n` (the grid size).\n2.  Read the grid input – `n` lines of characters – and store it in a 2D structure, maybe a list of lists or a list of strings, calling it `grid`.\n3.  I need two variables: `diag_char` and `other_char`. I'll initialize `diag_char` with the character at `grid[0][0]` (guaranteed to be on the main diagonal). `other_char` I'll start as `None` since I haven't seen any non-diagonal characters yet.\n4.  Then, I'll iterate through every cell in the `grid`, from `(0, 0)` up to `(n-1, n-1)`.\n5.  For each cell `(r, c)`:\n    *   I'll check if it's on a diagonal. If `r == c` OR `r + c == n - 1`, I'm diagonal. If the character in `grid[r][c]` *doesn't* match `diag_char`, it's not an X, so I print \"NO\" and quit.\n    *   If the cell is *not* on a diagonal (`else`), I check if I've seen a non-diagonal character before. If `other_char` is still `None`, then I set `other_char` to the current character in `grid[r][c]`.  Otherwise, I compare `grid[r][c]` with `other_char`. If they *don't* match, it's a \"NO\" scenario again.\n6.  Once I've been through the whole grid, I need one last check. I've confirmed the characters on the diagonals and off-diagonals are all consistent, now I need to make sure the two sets of characters are different. If `diag_char == other_char`, then it's not an \"X\", so \"NO\". If all conditions are met, then it's an \"X\". I print \"YES\".\n\nLet me do a quick walkthrough to make sure I'm following this. Let's say `n = 3` and the grid is 'wsw', 'sws', 'wsw'.\n\nInitially, `diag_char` is 'w' and `other_char` is `None`.  I start checking cells. The first cell `(0, 0)` is 'w', which matches `diag_char`.  The next cell, `(0, 1)`, is 's'. Since it's not a diagonal element, I make `other_char` equal 's'. Continuing down the rest of the elements, I'll see that every diagonal element is 'w' and every non-diagonal element is 's'. Finally, I make sure the characters are different. Since 'w' != 's', that's a \"YES\", it's an X!\n\nI think that's the logic I need. Now I can translate this into Python code.\n",
