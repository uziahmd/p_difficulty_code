Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the TV Game Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"TV Game\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it.  Let me break down what I'm dealing with.  Two players, Homer and Marge, are splitting a 2n-digit number, `A`. Each gets `n` digits.  The goal is to maximize the *sum* of their individual numbers, S1 and S2. `n` can be up to 18, so we're talking a maximum of 36 digits in total.\n\nInitially, I was worried about the numbers overflowing integer limits since each player could have up to 18-digit numbers.  But the wording says they *get* a dollar amount, not that we *calculate* a very large number, so standard ints should be fine.  \n\nThe `n <= 18` constraint really catches my eye. It suggests a solution that's potentially exponential in `n` could be acceptable, but certainly not in `2n`.  `2^36` is way too large.  I'm thinking dynamic programming or maybe a greedy approach might be in order here.\n\nMy initial thought is to define a state like `(k, h_moves, m_moves)`.  `k` is the index of the digit we're currently considering, `h_moves` is how many moves Homer's made so far, and `m_moves` is Marge's count.  `h_moves + m_moves` will always equal `k`.\n\nNow, the trick is that the *position* of a digit matters.  When a digit is taken, it gets multiplied by a power of 10 that depends on how many other digits were already taken by that player. So, the direct sum of digits doesn't work.  It's the specific sequence that matters.\n\nTake an example, `A = 1234` and `n = 2`.  If Homer takes 1 then 3, and Marge takes 2 then 4. This is a different sum than if Homer takes 1 then 2. So, just selecting any combination isn't the solution.  This complicates things.  I need to consider the building up of these numbers digit by digit with a bit more care, trying different combinations to get the maximal total.  I think my DP state should reflect these decisions.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of `2n` moves (Homer 'H' or Marge 'M') such that each player makes exactly `n` moves, and the sum of the numbers `S1` (formed by Homer's digits) and `S2` (formed by Marge's digits) is maximized. The input number `A` has `2n` digits.\n\nLet's denote the digits of `A` as `A[0], A[1], ..., A[2n-1]`.\nWhen a player takes a digit, it's appended to their number. The first digit taken by a player becomes the most significant digit of their number, the second becomes the next most significant, and so on. Since each player takes `n` digits, `S1` and `S2` will both be `n`-digit numbers.\n\nThe value of `S1` can be expressed as:\n`S1 = d_H_0 * 10^(n-1) + d_H_1 * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_H_(n-1) * 10^0`\nwhere `d_H_i` is the `(i+1)`-th digit taken by Homer.\nSimilarly for `S2`.\n\nWe want to maximize `S1 + S2`.\nConsider the `k`-th digit `A[k]` (0-indexed) from the original number `A`.\nIf Homer takes `A[k]`, and it's his `h`-th move (0-indexed, so `h` ranges from `0` to `n-1`), then `A[k]` contributes `A[k] * 10^(n-1-h)` to `S1`.\nIf Marge takes `A[k]`, and it's her `m`-th move (0-indexed, so `m` ranges from `0` to `n-1`), then `A[k]` contributes `A[k] * 10^(n-1-m)` to `S2`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.\nLet `dp[k][h_moves][m_moves]` be the maximum possible sum of contributions from digits `A[k]` through `A[2n-1]`, given that `h_moves` digits have already been assigned to Homer and `m_moves` digits have already been assigned to Marge. The total number of digits processed so far is `k`.\nThe base case is when `k == 2n`. At this point, all digits have been assigned, so the remaining contribution is `0`.\n\nThe state transitions are:\nFrom `dp[k][h_moves][m_moves]`:\n1.  **Homer takes `A[k]`**: This is possible if `h_moves < n`.\n    The contribution of `A[k]` to `S1` is `int(A[k]) * (10**(n - 1 - h_moves))`.\n    The next state is `dp[k+1][h_moves+1][m_moves]`.\n    The value for this choice would be `int(A[k]) * (10**(n - 1 - h_moves)) + dp[k+1][h_moves+1][m_moves]`.\n2.  **Marge takes `A[k]`**: This is possible if `m_moves < n`.\n    The contribution of `A[k]` to `S2` is `int(A[k]) * (10**(n - 1 - m_moves))`.\n    The next state is `dp[k+1][h_moves][m_moves+1]`.\n    The value for this choice would be `int(A[k]) * (10**(n - 1 - m_moves)) + dp[k+1][h_moves][m_moves+1]`.\n\n`dp[k][h_moves][m_moves]` will be the maximum of these two choices (if both are valid). If only one is valid, it's that choice. If neither is valid (which shouldn't happen until `k=2n` if `h_moves=n` and `m_moves=n`), it implies an invalid state.\n\nThe dimensions of the DP table are `2n * (n+1) * (n+1)`.\nSince `n <= 18`, `2n <= 36`.\nThe number of states is roughly `36 * 19 * 19 = 12996`.\nEach state calculation involves two recursive calls. This is efficient enough.\n\nTo reconstruct the path (sequence of moves), we can store not only the maximum value but also the choice that led to it (H or M). Let `choice[k][h_moves][m_moves]` store 'H' or 'M'.\n\n**Pre-computation:**\nIt's helpful to pre-calculate `10^p` values to avoid repeated calculations.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Use a dictionary or `functools.lru_cache` for memoization in Python. `lru_cache` is convenient for recursive DP.\n*   The `A` string contains digits, convert them to integers using `int(A[k])`.\n*   The powers of 10 can be large, but Python handles large integers automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Pre-calculate powers of 10 for efficiency\n    powers_of_10 = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        powers_of_10[i] = powers_of_10[i-1] * 10\n    \n    # powers_of_10[j] gives 10^j.\n    # For a digit taken as the x-th digit (0-indexed), its power is 10^(n-1-x).\n    # So we need to access powers_of_10[n - 1 - h_moves] or powers_of_10[n - 1 - m_moves].\n\n    @lru_cache(None)\n    def dp(k, h_moves, m_moves):\n        # Base case: all 2n digits have been processed\n        if k == 2 * n:\n            return 0, \"\" # Return max_sum and the corresponding move sequence\n\n        max_sum = -1\n        best_path = \"\"\n\n        # Option 1: Homer takes A[k]\n        if h_moves < n:\n            current_digit_val = int(A_str[k])\n            # The power for Homer's (h_moves)-th digit (0-indexed) is 10^(n - 1 - h_moves)\n            homer_contribution = current_digit_val * powers_of_10[n - 1 - h_moves]\n            \n            # Recursively find the max sum for the rest of the digits\n            rest_sum, rest_path = dp(k + 1, h_moves + 1, m_moves)\n            \n            total_sum_homer = homer_contribution + rest_sum\n            \n            if total_sum_homer > max_sum:\n                max_sum = total_sum_homer\n                best_path = \"H\" + rest_path\n\n        # Option 2: Marge takes A[k]\n        if m_moves < n:\n            current_digit_val = int(A_str[k])\n            # The power for Marge's (m_moves)-th digit (0-indexed) is 10^(n - 1 - m_moves)\n            marge_contribution = current_digit_val * powers_of_10[n - 1 - m_moves]\n            \n            # Recursively find the max sum for the rest of the digits\n            rest_sum, rest_path = dp(k + 1, h_moves, m_moves + 1)\n            \n            total_sum_marge = marge_contribution + rest_sum\n            \n            # If Homer's option was not taken or Marge's option gives a better sum\n            if total_sum_marge > max_sum:\n                max_sum = total_sum_marge\n                best_path = \"M\" + rest_path\n            # If sums are equal, we can take either.
