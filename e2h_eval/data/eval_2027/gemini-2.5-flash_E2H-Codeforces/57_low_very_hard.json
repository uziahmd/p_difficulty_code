His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Delving into the Olympiad Ranking Problem**\n\nOkay, I'm facing a fascinating combinatorial problem here. I'm given the total number of participants (`n`), a minimum score (`x`) Vasya achieved, and two lists of scores: `a` for the first tour and `b` for the second. The challenge is to figure out Vasya's best and worst possible ranks. It's not a straightforward sort; there's a jury tiebreaker involved.\n\nThe scoring system is clear: total points (a + b) determine rank, with ties broken by the jury. This means if Vasya has a score `S`, and others also have `S`, his rank could be anywhere within that tie.\n\nMy thinking is, I need to manipulate Vasya's assumed score and that of others. I know Vasya's total is at least `x`. My goal is to determine the highest and lowest ranks, the extremes. The tricky part is that I don't know the exact pairings between the scores in `a` and `b`. The scores are interchangeable, and other participants will also get scores made up of some a_i + b_j.\n\nTo get the *best* rank, I need to maximize Vasya's total score (within the `x` constraint) and minimize the scores of others relative to his. I need to strategically pair the scores in `a` and `b`. However, this is more nuanced than that. If I try to give Vasya a really high score, I'm likely to inflate the scores of some others as well. To get the best place, I need to find the largest sum that Vasya can get, and arrange other scores in the most convenient way to reduce possible ties with higher-scoring participants.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best (lowest rank) and worst (highest rank) possible places Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad, given `n` participants, a minimum total score `x` for Vasya, and two lists of `n` scores each for the first and second tours. The crucial information is that we don't know which participant got which score, only that `a_1, ..., a_n` are the scores for tour 1 and `b_1, ..., b_n` are the scores for tour 2, and each `a_i` must be paired with some `b_j` to form a participant's total score. Vasya is one of these participants.\n\n**Understanding the Ranking Rules:**\n1. Participants are sorted by the sum of points (tour 1 + tour 2) in decreasing order.\n2. If two or more participants have the same total points, the jury assigns places.\n   - For the **best place** scenario, if Vasya has score `S` and `P` people have strictly more than `S` points, and `K` people (including Vasya) have exactly `S` points, Vasya's best rank among these `K` people is `P + 1`.\n   - For the **worst place** scenario, if Vasya has score `S` and `P` people have strictly more than `S` points, and `K` people (including Vasya) have exactly `S` points, Vasya's worst rank among these `K` people is `P + K`.\n\n**Strategy for Best Place:**\nTo achieve the best possible rank (closest to 1st), Vasya wants to maximize his own score, and minimize the scores of other participants who might beat him.\n1. **Vasya's Score:** To maximize his score, Vasya should take the highest possible `a_i` and the highest possible `b_j` from the available scores, such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Let's say Vasya gets `a_max` and `b_max`, with `a_max + b_max >= x`. This is the highest possible score any participant could get. If this sum is `S_V`, then Vasya could potentially be 1st.\n2. **Other Participants' Scores:** After Vasya takes `a_max` and `b_max`, the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` must be paired among the other `n-1` participants. To minimize the number of participants who can beat Vasya, we want to pair the remaining scores such that as few participants as possible exceed `S_V`. Since `S_V` is already the maximum possible sum, no one can strictly exceed it.\n3. **Conclusion for Best Place:** If Vasya takes the highest `a_i` and highest `b_j` (say `a_k` and `b_l`), his score `S_V = a_k + b_l` will be the maximum possible score any participant can achieve. As long as `S_V >= x`, Vasya can achieve this score. No other participant can have a score strictly greater than `S_V`. So, Vasya's best rank is always 1st, provided there exists at least one pair `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. The problem guarantees this condition.\n\n**Strategy for Worst Place:**\nTo achieve the worst possible rank (closest to `n`th), Vasya wants to minimize his own score (while still meeting `S_V >= x`) and maximize the scores of other participants who might beat him or tie with him.\n1. **Vasya's Score:** To make his rank worse, Vasya should aim for the smallest possible total score `S_V` such that `S_V >= x`.\n2. **Other Participants' Scores:** We need to pair the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` among the other `n-1` participants such that as many as possible get scores greater than or equal to Vasya's `S_V`.\n3. **The Pairing Problem:** This is a maximum matching problem. We want to find a pairing `(a_i, b_j)` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. For this `a_i` and `b_j`, we then form `n-1` pairs from the remaining scores. To maximize the number of people who score more than or equal to Vasya, we should try to make the other `n-1` participants' scores as high as possible.\n   This can be achieved by sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order. If we pair `a_i` with `b_j`, then `a_i` and `b_j` are used. To maximize the number of participants who score `S_O >= S_V`, we should try to pair the largest `a` values with the largest `b` values for the other participants.\n\nLet's fix Vasya's score `S_V`. We want to count how many participants can achieve `S_O >= S_V`.\nConsider sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.\nIf we pair `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}`, this strategy attempts to create sums that are somewhat \"balanced\" or, if `a` is small, `b` is large.\nHowever, for the worst case, we want to count how many participants can achieve a score `S_k >= S_V`. This implies we want to find a pairing of `a` and `b` that maximizes this count.\n\nThis is a classic \"counting pairs that satisfy a condition\" problem.\nLet `a` be sorted in ascending order and `b` be sorted in descending order.\nWe iterate through each `a_i`. For a given `a_i`, we want to find a `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To maximize the number of such pairs, we should use the smallest `b_j` that satisfies the condition for `a_i`.\nThis suggests a two-pointer approach or binary search.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\nWe are looking for pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nFor a fixed `a_i`, we need `b_j >= x - a_i`.\nSince `b` is sorted, we can use a pointer `ptr_b` to find the smallest `b_j` that satisfies this condition.\nInitialize `ptr_b = n - 1`.\nIterate `i` from `0` to `n-1` (for `a_i`):\n  While `ptr_b >= 0` and `a_i + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n    `ptr_b -= 1`\n  The number of `b_j` values such that `b_j >= x - a_i` is `n - 1 - ptr_b`.\n  These are the `b` values that can form a sum `>= x` with `a_i`.\n  \nThis is the standard approach to count pairs `(a_i, b_j)` with `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nLet `a` be sorted ascending.\nLet `b` be sorted ascending.\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x` and all `i` and `j` are distinct.\nThis is a greedy approach.\nSort `a` in ascending order.\nSort `b` in descending order.\nNow, we try to form as many pairs as possible where `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nLet's use two pointers: `ptr_a` for array `a` (starting at 0) and `ptr_b` for array `b` (starting at 0).\nWhile `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b < n`:\n  If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n    This `a[ptr_a]` can be paired with `b[ptr_b]` to form a sum `>= x`. We count this as one such participant.\n    Increment `ptr_a` and `ptr_b`.\n  Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`):\n    The current `a[ptr_a]` is too small to form a sum `>= x` with `b[ptr_b]` (which is the largest remaining `b` value).\n    So, `a[ptr_a]` cannot form a sum `>= x` with any of the remaining `b` values.\n    We must discard `a[ptr_a]` from consideration for forming a sum `>= x`.\n    Increment `ptr_a`.\n\nThe number of pairs found this way `count` represents the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) who *could* achieve a score of at least `x`.\nThis is because by sorting `a` ascending and `b` descending, we are greedily trying to match the smallest available `a` with the largest available `b`. If even this pair doesn't meet `x`, then that `a` cannot meet `x` with any other `b`. If it does meet `x`, we use it and move on to the next smallest `a` and next largest `b`. This maximizes the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.\n\nSo, the worst place Vasya could get is `n - count + 1`.\nWhy `n - count + 1`?\n`count` is the maximum number of participants who can score at least `x`.\nIf Vasya is one of these `count` participants, and the jury decides to give him the worst possible rank among them, he would be ranked after all `count - 1` other participants who scored `>= x`.\nThe remaining `n - count` participants scored less than `x`.\nSo, Vasya's rank would be `(n - count)` (people who scored < x, who are ranked after him) + `(count - 1)` (people who scored >= x, who are ranked before him) + 1 (Vasya himself).\nNo, this is not right.\nIf `count` participants (including Vasya) score `>= x`, and `n - count` participants score `< x`.\nVasya is one of the `count` participants.\nIn the worst case, all `count - 1` other participants who scored `>= x` are ranked *before* Vasya.\nAll `n - count` participants who scored `< x` are ranked *after* Vasya.\nSo, Vasya's rank would be `(count - 1)` (people better than or equal to him who are ranked before him) + `1` (Vasya himself) = `count`.\nThis is the standard interpretation for \"worst rank among ties\". If `k` people tie for a certain position, the worst rank is `P + k` where `P` people scored strictly more. Here, `P=0` since we only care about people scoring `>=x`. So, Vasya's worst rank among the `count` people is `count`.\n\nLet's re-verify the example:\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\nSorted `a`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\nSorted `b` (desc): `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`ptr_a = 0, ptr_b = 0, count = 0`\n1. `a[0]+b[0] = 1+1 = 2 >= x`. `count = 1`. `ptr_a = 1, ptr_b = 1`.\n2. `a[1]+b[1] = 1+1 = 2 >= x`. `count = 2`. `ptr_a = 2, ptr_b = 2`.\n3. `a[2]+b[2] = 1+1 = 2 >= x`. `count = 3`. `ptr_a = 3, ptr_b = 3`.\n4. `a[3]+b[3] = 1+1 = 2 >= x`. `count = 4`. `ptr_a = 4, ptr_b = 4`.\n5. `a[4]+b[4] = 1+1 = 2 >= x`. `count = 5`. `ptr_a = 5, ptr_b = 5`.\nLoop ends. `count = 5`.\nWorst place = `count = 5`.\nOutput: `1 5`. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\nSorted `a`: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSorted `b` (desc): `[8, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0]`\n`ptr_a = 0, ptr_b = 0, count = 0`\n1. `a[0]=3, b[0]=8`. `3+8 = 11 >= 7`. `count = 1`. `ptr_a = 1, ptr_b = 1`.\n2. `a[1]=4, b[1]=6`. `4+6 = 10 >= 7`. `count = 2`. `ptr_a = 2, ptr_b = 2`.\n3. `a[2]=4, b[2]=4`. `4+4 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 3`. `ptr_a = 3, ptr_b = 3`.\n4. `a[3]=4, b[3]=4`. `4+4 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 4`. `ptr_a = 4, ptr_b = 4`.\n5. `a[4]=5, b[4]=3`. `5+3 = 8 >= 7`. `count = 5`. `ptr_a = 5, ptr_b = 5`.\n6. `a[5]=6, b[5]=0`. `6+0 = 6 < 7`. `a[5]` cannot form `>= x` with `b[5]`. Increment `ptr_a`. `ptr_a = 6`.\nLoop ends. `count = 5`.\nWorst place = `count = 5`.\nOutput: `1 5`. Correct.\n\nThe logic seems sound.\nBest place is always 1.\nWorst place is `count`, where `count` is the maximum number of participants who can achieve a total score of at least `x`, found by pairing sorted `a` (ascending) with sorted `b` (descending) greedily.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Read `n, x`.\n- Read `a` and `b` lists.\n- Sort `a` in ascending order.\n- Sort `b` in descending order.\n- Initialize `count = 0`, `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n- Loop while `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b < n`:\n    - If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n        `count += 1`\n        `ptr_a += 1`\n        `ptr_b += 1`\n    - Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`):\n        `ptr_a += 1`\n- Print `1` and `count`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of `O(N log N)` due to sorting, and `O(N)` for the two-pointer scan. Given `N <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best place:\n    # Vasya can always achieve the highest possible score by taking the maximum a_i and maximum b_j.\n    # Since the problem guarantees that there exist i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x,\n    # Vasya can achieve a score S_V >= x.\n    # By taking the highest possible a_i and b_j, Vasya ensures his score is maximum.\n    # No other participant can achieve a strictly higher score.\n    # Thus, Vasya can always be ranked 1st (if tied with others, jury can assign him 1st).\n    best_place = 1\n\n    # Worst place:\n    # To find the worst place, we want to maximize the number of participants\n    # who score at least x.
