Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve this \"New Year Candles\" problem. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nIt seems like a simulation is the way to go. We're given an initial number of candles, `a`, and a conversion factor, `b`, for turning burned-out candles into new ones. The goal is to maximize the total light hours.\n\nI need to track a few key variables: the total hours of light, `total_hours`, the current number of new candles, `current_new_candles`, and the number of burned-out candles, `burned_out_candles`.\n\nThe core of the simulation will be an iterative process. In each step, I'll:\n\n1.  Light all the current new candles. This increases `total_hours` by `current_new_candles`.\n2.  All the lit candles become burned-out, so I add the number of lit candles to `burned_out_candles`.\n3.  I reset `current_new_candles` to zero.\n4.  Then, I check if I can make new candles from the accumulated burned-out ones. The number of new candles I can make is the integer division of `burned_out_candles` by `b`.\n5.  I add these new candles to `current_new_candles`.\n6.  The burned-out candles used to make the new ones are \"consumed,\" so I update `burned_out_candles` to the remainder of the division.\n7.  The loop continues as long as I have any new candles.\n\nTo clarify this in my mind, let me walk through the example `a = 4, b = 2`.\n\nInitially, `total_hours` is 0, `current_new_candles` is 4, and `burned_out_candles` is 0.\n\n*   **Iteration 1:** I light all 4 candles, so `total_hours` becomes 4.  Those 4 become burned out, `burned_out_candles` becomes 4.  I can make 2 new candles from the 4 burned-out ones, so `current_new_candles` becomes 2, and `burned_out_candles` is 0.\n*   **Iteration 2:** I light the 2 candles, adding 2 more hours to the total, bringing it to 6. They become burned-out (now 2 of them), so `burned_out_candles` is 2. I get 1 new candle (`2 // 2 = 1`), so `current_new_candles` is 1, and `burned_out_candles` goes back to 0.\n*   **Iteration 3:**  I light the 1 remaining candle, increasing `total_hours` to 7.  The one candle then goes out.\n\nThe loop will stop when I reach a point where I cannot make any more new candles.  I think I've got a solid plan now.\n",
