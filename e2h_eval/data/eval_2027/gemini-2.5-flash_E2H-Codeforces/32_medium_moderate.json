    "thought": "**My primary focus here is to efficiently minimize the instability of an array, and the core of this challenge lies in realizing that only removing the smallest or largest element yields the optimal result.** Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding:** We're given an array, and \"instability\" is defined as the range (max - min). Our task is to eliminate precisely one number and then compute the smallest possible instability of the remaining subarray.\n\n2.  **Constraints:** The array's size is relatively small, so a solution with at most O(n log n) complexity is perfectly acceptable.\n\n3.  **Key Insight:** Sorting is the key to minimizing instability. After sorting the array, removing any internal element (one that is *not* the minimum or maximum of the initial array) will never reduce the range as compared to removing the minimum or maximum element. That's because if you remove an element that is *not* the smallest or largest, you're *still* left with the original extreme values in the sorted array, making the initial range unchanged. Only by removing the actual minimum or maximum value can the range be reduced.\n\n4.  **Algorithm Design:** Given this, the solution is straightforward.\n    *   Sort the array.\n    *   Calculate the instability for two scenarios: removing the smallest (which will result in range `max - second smallest`) or removing the largest (resulting in range `second largest - smallest`).\n    *   Return the smallest of those two values.\n\n5.  **Complexity Analysis:** Sorting dominates the running time, giving us an overall time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n) or O(1), depending if the sort can be performed in-place (which may be important in an environment with memory limits).\n\n6.  **Implementation Details:** The code implementation will be simple. We read the input array, sort it, and perform the calculations. No special data structures are needed. It can be done in Python.\n\nThis robust and straightforward approach ensures that, for this problem, the optimal solution is generated every single time.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\nLet the given array be `a` of `n` integers.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nTo minimize the difference `max(array) - min(array)`, we want to either:\n1. Make the maximum value as small as possible.\n2. Make the minimum value as large as possible.\n\nConsider the array `a` sorted in non-decreasing order: `a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}`.\nHere, `a_0` is the smallest element and `a_{n-1}` is the largest element.\n\nWhen we remove an element, there are three main scenarios:\n\n1.  **Remove the smallest element (`a_0`):**\n    The remaining array is `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n    The new minimum element is `a_1`.\n    The new maximum element is `a_{n-1}`.\n    The instability would be `a_{n-1} - a_1`.\n\n2.  **Remove the largest element (`a_{n-1}`):**\n    The remaining array is `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-2}`.\n    The new minimum element is `a_0`.\n    The new maximum element is `a_{n-2}`.\n    The instability would be `a_{n-2} - a_0`.\n\n3.  **Remove any element `a_k` where `0 < k < n-1` (an element from the middle):**\n    The remaining array would still have `a_0` as its minimum and `a_{n-1}` as its maximum.\n    The instability would be `a_{n-1} - a_0`.\n    This value `a_{n-1} - a_0` is always greater than or equal to `a_{n-1} - a_1` (since `a_0 <= a_1`) and `a_{n-2} - a_0` (since `a_{n-2} <= a_{n-1}`). Therefore, removing an element from the middle will never yield a smaller instability than removing either the smallest or largest element.\n\nBased on this, we only need to consider the first two scenarios. The minimum possible instability will be the minimum of the instabilities calculated in these two cases.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read the integer `n`.\n2. Read the `n` integer elements into an array `a`.\n3. Sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order. This allows us to easily access the smallest, second smallest, largest, and second largest elements.\n4. Calculate the instability if the smallest element (`a[0]`) is removed: `a[n-1] - a[1]`.\n5. Calculate the instability if the largest element (`a[n-1]`) is removed: `a[n-2] - a[0]`.\n6. The minimum possible instability is the smaller of these two values.\n7. Print the result.\n\n**Example 1: `a = [1, 3, 3, 7]`**\n1. Sorted `a`: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`\n2. `n = 4`.\n3. Remove `a[0]` (which is `1`): Remaining `[3, 3, 7]`. Instability `7 - 3 = 4`. (Using formula: `a[3] - a[1] = 7 - 3 = 4`)\n4. Remove `a[3]` (which is `7`): Remaining `[1, 3, 3]`. Instability `3 - 1 = 2`. (Using formula: `a[2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`)\n5. Minimum instability: `min(4, 2) = 2`.\n\n**Example 2: `a = [1, 100000]`**\n1. Sorted `a`: `[1, 100000]`\n2. `n = 2`.\n3. Remove `a[0]` (which is `1`): Remaining `[100000]`. Instability `100000 - 100000 = 0`. (Using formula: `a[1] - a[1] = 0`)\n4. Remove `a[1]` (which is `100000`): Remaining `[1]`. Instability `1 - 1 = 0`. (Using formula: `a[0] - a[0] = 0`)\n5.
