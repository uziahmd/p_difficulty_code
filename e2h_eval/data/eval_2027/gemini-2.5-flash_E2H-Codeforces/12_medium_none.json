The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving Xenia and Ringroad: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem.  The core of this is figuring out the minimum time for Xenia to complete a series of tasks on a circular road.  I'm starting with a breakdown:\n\n*   **Circular Road:** Houses 1 to *n*, traffic goes clockwise.\n*   **Tasks:** *m* tasks, each at house *a<sub>i</sub>*, completed in order.\n*   **Starting Point:** Xenia begins at house 1.\n*   **Time:** Moving one house takes one unit of time.\n\nMy first thought is, this seems like a straightforward simulation problem.  I need to trace Xenia's movements and calculate the total time.\n\n**Initial State:** I'll keep track of `current_house = 1` and `total_time = 0`.\n\n**Task Processing:**  For each task *i* (from 1 to *m*), I need to calculate the time to move from `current_house` to *a<sub>i</sub>*.\n\n**The Key Logic:**\n*   **Case 1:  *a<sub>i</sub>* >= `current_house`:**  Xenia moves directly clockwise. The time is simply `a<sub>i</sub> - current_house`.\n*   **Case 2:  *a<sub>i</sub>* < `current_house`:**  Xenia has to go all the way around the ring. This is the tricky part.  She moves from `current_house` to *n*, then from *n* to 1, then from 1 to *a<sub>i</sub>*. That's `n - current_house + 1 + a<sub>i</sub> -1`. Which simplifies nicely to `n - current_house + a<sub>i</sub>`.\nI need to be very careful with this.\n\n**Verification and Testing:** I'll run through the example cases given in the problem description to make sure I'm right.  The example `n = 4, m = 3, a = [3, 2, 3]` should give a result of 6. Let me work this out step by step. I will trace Xenia's movements on the circle.\n\nTask 1 (3): move from house 1 to 3: takes 2 time. `current_house = 3`\nTask 2 (2): move from house 3 to 2: from 3->4->1->2 taking 3 time,  `current_house = 2`\nTask 3 (3): move from house 2 to 3: takes 1 time. `current_house = 3`\nSo the total time is 2+3+1 = 6. Yep, this matches the example. Let's trace the other example.\n\nAlso, I'm testing the second example, `n = 4, m = 3, a = [2, 3, 3]`. With this example, the result should be 2. Let me trace Xenia's movement in this case as well.\n\nTask 1 (2): move from house 1 to 2: takes 1 time. `current_house = 2`\nTask 2 (3): move from house 2 to 3: takes 1 time. `current_house = 3`\nTask 3 (3): move from house 3 to 3: takes 0 time. `current_house = 3`\nSo, the total time is 1+1+0 = 2. This is also correct.\n\nThe logic appears correct. The key to the solution is to implement the wrap-around case correctly.\n\n**Constraints:** I need to keep in mind the constraints: *n* and *m* are up to 10<sup>5</sup>, and the *a<sub>i</sub>* values are between 1 and *n*.  The total time could get pretty large, up to *m*( *n* - 1). With *m* and *n* both 10<sup>5</sup>, so approximately 10^10, Python's automatic integer size is perfect here. For C++, the problem description has mentioned the use of 64-bit integers.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n1.  Read *n*, *m*, and the array *a* from the input.\n2.  Initialize `current_house` to 1 and `total_time` to 0.\n3.  Iterate through the array *a*.\n4.  Inside the loop, apply the time calculation logic: if *a<sub>i</sub>* >= `current_house`, add `a<sub>i</sub> - current_house` to `",
