You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Finding Odd Cycles with Minimal Edge Additions**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of edges, `t`, to add to a graph to create an odd-length cycle, and also the number of ways, `w`, I can do this. The problem is asking for the *minimum* `t`, so I should start by checking if `t=0` works, then `t=1`, and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the conditions for an odd-length cycle. It has to be a cycle (duh!), be odd in length, be simple (no repeated vertices), and have more than one vertex.\n\n**Case 0: No Edge Additions (t = 0)**\n\nCan I find an odd cycle *already* in the graph? I know a graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it's not bipartite. So, I need to check each connected component in the graph for bipartiteness using BFS or DFS. I'll color the vertices during traversal. If I find an edge connecting two vertices of the same color, I have an odd cycle. If even one connected component isn't bipartite, then `t=0` and there's exactly one way to do it (`w=1`), since the graph already satisfies the condition without any edge additions, as shown by the given example.\n\nI need to iterate through the connected components, try to 2-color each one, and if I find any that's not bipartite, I know `t=0`, `w=1`, and I can stop.\n\n**Case 1: Adding One Edge (t = 1)**\n\nIf the graph *is* bipartite (meaning no odd cycles exist currently), adding a single edge might create an odd cycle. To do that, I'd have to add an edge connecting two vertices within the *same* connected component that have the *same* color in the 2-coloring. If I connect differently colored nodes within the same component, I'll only produce even-length cycles. If I add an edge between different components, it gets tricky, and seems not the best choice.\n\nAdding an edge `(u,v)` where `color[u] == color[v]` and `u` and `v` are in the same component will create a cycle, and since there's a path between `u` and `v` of even length, the newly added edge creates an odd cycle.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given graph to form an odd-length simple cycle, and `w`, the number of ways to do so.\n\nWe can analyze the possible values of `t` in increasing order:\n\n**1. t = 0 (No edges added)**\nAn odd-length cycle already exists in the graph if and only if the graph is not bipartite. We can check for bipartiteness using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) based 2-coloring algorithm.\nFor each connected component:\n- Start a traversal (BFS/DFS) from an unvisited vertex, assigning it color 0.\n- All its neighbors get color 1.\n- All neighbors of color 1 vertices get color 0, and so on.\n- If we ever encounter an edge connecting two vertices of the same color, we've found an odd-length cycle.\nIf any connected component is found to be non-bipartite, then `t=0` and `w=1` (there's at least one odd cycle, and we don't add any edges, so one way). We can stop and print `0 1`.\n\n**2. t = 1 (One edge added)**\nIf `t=0` is not possible, it means the entire graph is bipartite. All connected components can be 2-colored.\nTo form an odd-length cycle by adding one edge `(u, v)`, `u` and `v` must be in the same connected component and have the same color.\nLet's say we have colored a component with colors 0 and 1. If we add an edge between two vertices `u` and `v` both colored 0 (or both colored 1), then `u` and `v` are connected by a path of even length in the original graph (since they have the same color in a bipartite graph). Adding the edge `(u, v)` creates a cycle of `(even length path) + 1` (the new edge), which is an odd-length cycle.\nThe number of ways `w` to add one edge is the count of pairs `(u, v)` such that `u` and `v` are in the same component, `u` and `v` have the same color, and `(u, v)` is not an existing edge.\nFor each connected component:\n- Perform a 2-coloring. Count the number of vertices colored 0 (`count0`) and the number of vertices colored 1 (`count1`).\n- The number of potential new edges between same-colored vertices is `count0 * (count0 - 1) / 2` (pairs of color 0) + `count1 * (count1 - 1) / 2` (pairs of color 1).\n- From this, we must subtract the existing edges that connect same-colored vertices. However, since the graph is bipartite, there are no such existing edges. All existing edges connect vertices of different colors.\nSo, the total number of ways `w` is the sum of `count0 * (count0 - 1) / 2 + count1 * (count1 - 1) / 2` for all connected components.\nIf `w > 0`, then `t=1`. Print `1 w`.\n\n**3. t = 2 (Two edges added)**\nIf `t=0` and `t=1` are not possible, it means:\n- The graph is bipartite.\n- All connected components are \"trivial\" in the sense that they don't allow forming an odd cycle with 1 edge. This implies each component has at most 2 vertices, or if it has more, all vertices of one color are isolated or connected only to other components (which is not possible for a connected component). More precisely, it means `count0 * (count0 - 1) / 2 + count1 * (count1 - 1) / 2 = 0` for all components. This can only happen if `count0 <= 1` AND `count1 <= 1` for all components. This means all components are single vertices or single edges.\nSo, if `t=1` is not possible, all connected components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\nTo form an odd-length cycle with two added edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`:\nWe need to connect three vertices `u, v, x` such that `u` and `x` are already connected by a path of even length.\nA simpler approach: we need to connect two distinct connected components.\nLet's say we have `k` connected components. If we add an edge `(u, v)` where `u` is in component `C_i` and `v` is in component `C_j` (`i != j`), these two components merge. The resulting merged component is still bipartite (since both `C_i` and `C_j` were bipartite).\nTo form an odd cycle with 2 edges, we must pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x`.\nSuppose we add edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`. If `u` and `x` are already connected by an edge `(u, x)`, we form a triangle (odd cycle of length 3). This requires `u, v, x` to be distinct and `(u, x)` to be an existing edge. This is not possible if `t=1` was not possible because it implies `u` and `x` are in different components or `u` and `x` are in the same component and have different colors (if they had same color, `t=1` would be possible). If `u` and `x` are in the same component and have different colors, adding `(u,v)` and `(v,x)` makes a path `u-v-x`. If `(u,x)` exists, then `u-v-x-u` is a triangle. The length of this cycle is 3.\nThe most general way to get an odd cycle of length 3 with two added edges is to pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x` such that no two are connected in the original graph. Then add edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`. This forms a path `u-v-x`. Now, if we want to make an odd cycle of length 3, we need an edge `(u, x)`. But `t=2` means we add exactly two edges. So we add `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`. If `(u, x)` is not an existing edge, this is not an odd cycle. If `(u, x)` is an existing edge, this would mean `u` and `x` are already connected. But since `t=1` was not possible, all components were single vertices or single edges. So, no such `u, x` could exist where `u, x` are in the same component and have different colors. This implies `u, x` must be in different components.\nConsider picking three *distinct* vertices `u, v, x`. If we add edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`, we have a path `u-v-x`. To make this an odd cycle, we need to add `(x, u)` as well, which would be `t=3`.\nThe only way to get an odd cycle of length 3 with two added edges is if we select three vertices `u, v, x` such that `u` and `x` are already connected by an edge. Let this edge be `(u, x)`. Then we add edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`. This forms a triangle `u-v-x-u`. Since `(u, x)` is an existing edge, `u` and `x` must be in the same component and have different colors. This is possible.\nThe number of ways `w` for `t=2` would be the count of triples `(u, v, x)` where `u, v, x` are distinct, `(u, x)` is an existing edge, and `(u, v)` and `(v, x)` are not existing edges.\nFor each existing edge `(u, x)`, we can pick any other vertex `v` (not `u` or `x`) and add edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)`.\nThe number of ways to pick `v` is `n - 2`.\nThe number of existing edges is `m`.\nSo, `w = m * (n - 2)`.\nIf `m > 0` and `n > 2`, then `t=2`. Print `2 w`.\n\n**4. t = 3 (Three edges added)**\nIf `t=0, 1, 2` are not possible, it means:\n- The graph is bipartite.\n- All components are single vertices or single edges.\n- `m * (n - 2) = 0`. This means either `m = 0` (no edges) or `n = 2`.\nIf `n=2`, the graph has 2 vertices.\n  - If `m=0`: vertices 1 and 2. Add `(1,1)` (not allowed), `(2,2)` (not allowed). To make an odd cycle, we need length 3. This means 3 vertices. So if `n=2`, `t=3` is impossible.\n  - If `m=1`: edge `(1,2)`. `t=0` (no odd cycle), `t=1` (no same-color pairs), `t=2` (no third vertex `v`). So `t=3` is impossible.\nThus, if `n=2`, an odd cycle cannot be formed. The problem statement guarantees \"consisting of more than one vertex\", but minimum odd cycle length is 3. So `n` must be at least 3.\nIf `n >= 3` and `m=0` (no edges at all):\nWe need to add three edges to form a triangle. Pick any three distinct vertices `u, v, x`. Add edges `(u, v)`, `(v, x)`, `(x, u)`. This forms an odd cycle of length 3.\nThe number of ways `w` is the number of ways to choose 3 vertices from `n`, which is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\nThis is the only remaining case. So `t=3`. Print `3 w`.\n\n**Summary of logic:**\n\n1. **Check for `t=0`:**\n   - Initialize `visited` array and `color` array for 2-coloring.\n   - For each vertex `i` from 1 to `n`:\n     - If `i` is not visited:\n       - Start a BFS/DFS from `i`.\n       - If an odd cycle is detected in this component (edge connects same-colored vertices):\n         - Print `0 1` and exit.\n2. **Check for `t=1`:**\n   - If no odd cycle was found (graph is bipartite):\n     - Initialize `ways_t1 = 0`.\n     - For each connected component found during 2-coloring:\n       - Get `count0` (vertices with color 0) and `count1` (vertices with color 1).\n       - `ways_t1 += count0 * (count0 - 1) // 2`\n       - `ways_t1 += count1 * (count1 - 1) // 2`\n     - If `ways_t1 > 0`:\n       - Print `1 ways_t1` and exit.\n3. **Check for `t=2`:**\n   - If `t=0` and `t=1` failed:\n     - `ways_t2 = m * (n - 2)`\n     - If `ways_t2 > 0`:\n       - Print `2 ways_t2` and exit.\n4. **Check for `t=3`:**\n   - If `t=0, 1, 2` failed:\n     - This implies `m=0` (no edges) and `n >= 3`.\n     - `ways_t3 = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`\n     - Print `3 ways_t3` and exit.\n\n**Edge cases/Constraints:**\n- `n` vertices, `m` edges. `1 <= n <= 100000`, `0 <= m <= 200000`.\n- Graph without parallel edges and loops.\n- `n < 3` means an odd cycle of length 3 is impossible.\n  - If `n=1` or `n=2`:\n    - `t=0`: No odd cycle possible.\n    - `t=1`: No `count0 * (count0-1)/2` or `count1 * (count1-1)/2` if `count0 <= 1` and `count1 <= 1`.\n    - `t=2`: `m * (n-2)` will be 0 if `n=2`.\n    - `t=3`: `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6` will be 0 if `n=1` or `n=2`.\n    - So for `n < 3`, `t=3` and `w=0` (which is not a valid output, problem implies `w > 0` for the found `t`). This means the problem implicitly assumes `n >= 3` for forming an odd cycle. If `n < 3`, no odd cycle can be formed. However, `n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6` is 0 for `n=1,2`. So the `t=3` case will correctly output `3 0` for `n<3`. The example `3 0` output `3 1` confirms `n=3, m=0` is `3 1`. If `n=2, m=0`, output would be `3 0`.\n\nLet's refine the `n < 3` case:\nIf `n=1`: `t=3`, `w=0`.\nIf `n=2`:\n  - `m=0`: `t=3`, `w=0`.\n  - `m=1` (edge 1-2): Graph is bipartite. `count0=1, count1=1`. `ways_t1=0`. `ways_t2 = 1 * (2-2) = 0`. `t=3`, `w=0`.\nSo for `n<3`, the answer is always `3 0`. The general formula handles this.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    edges = [] # Store edges to check for duplicates when adding t=1 edges\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        edges.append(tuple(sorted((u, v)))) # Store sorted tuple for easy lookup\n\n    # Convert edges list to a set for O(1) average time lookup\n    edge_set = set(edges)\n\n    # --- Case 0: t = 0 (Odd cycle already exists) ---\n    # Check for bipartiteness using BFS\n    color = [-1] * (n + 1) # -1: unvisited, 0: color 0, 1: color 1\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    has_odd_cycle_t0 = False\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = [(i, 0)] # (vertex, assigned_color)\n            visited[i] = True\n            color[i] = 0\n            head = 0\n            \n            while head < len(q):\n                u, c = q[head]\n                head += 1\n\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        color[v] = 1 - c\n                        q.append((v, 1 - c))\n                    elif color[v] == c:\n                        # Found an edge connecting two vertices of the same color\n                        # This means an odd cycle exists\n                        has_odd_cycle_t0 = True\n                        break\n                if has_odd_cycle_t0:\n                    break\n        if has_odd_cycle_t0:\n            break\n\n    if has_odd_cycle_t0:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    # --- Case 1: t = 1 (Add one edge to form an odd cycle) ---\n    # If the graph is bipartite, an odd cycle can be formed by adding an edge (u, v)\n    # where u and v are in the same connected component and have the same color.\n    \n    ways_t1 = 0\n    # Re-run BFS to get component-wise counts and ensure all nodes are processed\n    # (previous BFS might have stopped early if odd cycle was found)\n    \n    # Reset visited for new BFS pass\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1) \n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            # This is a new connected component\n            q = [(i, 0)] # (vertex, assigned_color)\n            visited[i] = True\n            color[i] = 0 # Ensure color is set for new component\n            \n            component_nodes = []\n            component_nodes_q = [(i, 0)]\n            head = 0\n            \n            while head < len(component_nodes_q):\n                u, c = component_nodes_q[head]\n                head += 1\n                component_nodes.append(u)\n\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        color[v] = 1 - c\n                        component_nodes_q.append((v, 1 - c))\n            \n            # Count nodes of each color in this component\n            count0 = 0\n            count1 = 0\n            for node in component_nodes:\n                if color[node] == 0:\n                    count0 += 1\n                else:\n                    count1 += 1\n            \n            # Number of pairs of same-colored vertices in this component\n            # Each such pair (u, v) can form an odd cycle by adding edge (u, v)\n            # if (u, v) is not an existing edge.\n            # Since the graph is bipartite, no existing edge connects same-colored vertices.\n            ways_t1 += count0 * (count0 - 1) // 2\n            ways_t1 += count1 * (count1 - 1) // 2\n            \n    if ways_t1 > 0:\n        print(f\"1 {ways_t1}\")\n        return\n\n    # --- Case 2: t = 2 (Add two edges to form an odd cycle) ---\n    # If t=0 and t=1 are not possible, it means:\n    # 1.
