Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solution Process: From Problem to Python**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and it's essentially a graph traversal disguised as a geometric problem. My initial thought is to analyze how the lines (roads) divide the plane into regions (blocks). The key insight is that moving between blocks means crossing a road, and the minimum steps are equivalent to crossing the fewest roads.\n\nI'm thinking, for each road, `ax + by + c = 0`, it splits the plane into two half-planes. If home and the university are on opposite sides of this line, we *must* cross that road. The sign of `ax + by + c` will tell me which side a point is on. If the product of the value for home and university is negative, that means they're on opposite sides, and we need a step.\n\nI need to quickly create an efficient algorithm. I'll read the input and initialize a `crossings` counter to zero. Then, I'll iterate through each road, calculate the value `ax + by + c` for home and university, and if the product is negative, I'll increment `crossings`. This directly corresponds to the minimum number of road crossings.\n\nI have already done some quick examples in my head. No matter how the lines intersect, it is sufficient to count each crossing to find the optimal path.  The time complexity is O(n), which is perfect for n up to 300.  The integer size won't cause any overflow, since the input space is small.\n\nI'll write this in Python, since it's quick and easy. I'll take advantage of Python's handling of integers that are too large, so I don't have to worry about the specific values from multiplying coordinates.  I can quickly write a function that takes the input and does the calculation.\n\nAfter a quick double-check, it seems the code is complete.\n",
