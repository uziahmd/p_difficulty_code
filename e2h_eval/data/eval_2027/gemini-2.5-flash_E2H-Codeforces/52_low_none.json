Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**New Year Candle Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and it's pretty straightforward. It's a simulation problem, plain and simple. We're given an initial number of candles, `a`, and a conversion factor, `b`.  I need to maximize the total burning time by strategically recycling burnt-out candles into new ones.  The core idea is to always burn *any* available new candle immediately.  That's key to maximizing those hours.\n\nMy approach will be to track three key variables: `total_hours`, `new_candles`, and `burnt_out_candles`.  `total_hours` will be the answer. Initially, it's zero. `new_candles` starts at `a`, the initial number of new candles. `burnt_out_candles` is initialized to zero, of course.\n\nThe core of the solution will be a loop.  Inside the loop, I'll do two main things. First, I burn *all* the new candles, increasing `total_hours` by that amount and adding those candles to the `burnt_out_candles` count. Then, I check how many new candles I can make with the burnt-out ones.  This is simply integer division - `burnt_out_candles // b`.  The remainder from that division, `burnt_out_candles % b`, will be what's left over.  I then update the `new_candles` count to reflect the new ones and adjust the `burnt_out_candles` count.\n\nThe loop continues as long as I have *any* new candles.  Once I can't make anymore new candles, I stop. That's it, that's the process.  The simulation is complete. I'm pretty confident this simple method is optimal for this type of problem.\n",
