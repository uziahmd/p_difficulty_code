Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Selling Souvenirs Knapsack Conundrum**\n\nI'm staring down a variation of the knapsack problem, where the core challenge lies in maximizing the cost of souvenirs I can sell, given a weight constraint. The twist? The weights of the souvenirs are limited to 1, 2, or 3. This seemingly simple constraint is the key to unlocking an efficient solution. My initial instinct is to go for the classic dynamic programming approach (O(N*M)), but with N up to 100,000 and M up to 300,000, that would be a computational sinkhole.\n\nMy immediate thought is to sort each group of souvenirs based on their weights (w1, w2, w3) in descending order of cost. This gives me a natural order to pick items within each weight category. Prefix sums seem like a good idea to quickly calculate the cost of taking a specific number of items from each category. But how to do the actual dynamic programming? A naive implementation with O(N*M)  is too slow. I realize I need to exploit the fact that the weights are so small.\n\nThe small weights indicate that I need to iterate over *combinations* of souvenirs of weights 1, 2, and 3. I quickly consider fixing the number of each weight. But, with weights so small, the number of each weight can become quite large. Even if I fix one of the k-values, iterating over the other two leads to the dreaded O(M^2) time complexity, which is still too slow.\n\nThen, I try to come up with another dynamic programming approach. I try to solve for subproblems like maximizing the cost given a specific total weight. I could make a dp-table for this. But, again, my complexity remains too high. I realized I keep coming back to the O(M^2) bottleneck.\n\nI then keep reconsidering how to use prefix sums effectively.  Maybe I can combine the items in the same group? No, I realized that doesn't simplify the problem. After a long period of back-and-forth, I am stumped. How can I possibly solve this within the time limit? Is there a subtle trick that I am missing? The small weights are clearly the key...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs to maximize total cost, given a total weight capacity `m`. Each souvenir `i` has a weight `wi` and a cost `ci`. The key constraints are `n` (number of souvenirs) up to `100000`, `m` (capacity) up to `300000`, and `wi` can only be `1`, `2`, or `3`.\n\nThis is a 0/1 knapsack problem. A standard `O(n*m)` dynamic programming approach would be too slow given `n=10^5` and `m=3*10^5`. The small range of weights (`1, 2, 3`) is the crucial hint.\n\n**1. Group and Sort Souvenirs:**\nFirst, we separate the souvenirs by their weights. To maximize cost, for each weight category, we should always pick the most expensive items first. So, we sort the costs for each weight type in descending order.\nLet `w1_costs`, `w2_costs`, `w3_costs` be lists of costs for souvenirs with weights 1, 2, and 3, respectively, sorted in descending order.\n\n**2. Precompute Prefix Sums:**\nTo quickly get the sum of the `k` most expensive items of a certain weight, we compute prefix sums for each sorted cost list.\n`ps1[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive weight-1 items.\n`ps2[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive weight-2 items.\n`ps3[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive weight-3 items.\n(Remember to handle `k` exceeding the list length by taking `min(k, len(list))`.)\n\n**3. Dynamic Programming with Limited Weights:**\nLet `k1, k2, k3` be the number of items chosen from `w1_costs`, `w2_costs`, `w3_costs` respectively.\nWe want to maximize `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2] + ps3[k3]` subject to `k1*1 + k2*2 + k3*3 <= m`.\n\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 we can take is `m/3`. This is `300000/3 = 100000`.\nWe can iterate over all possible values of `k3`.\nFor each `k3` from `0` to `min(len(w3_costs), m/3)`:\n  a. Calculate `current_cost_w3 = ps3[k3]`.\n  b. Calculate `remaining_capacity = m - k3 * 3`.\n  c. Now, we need to choose `k1` and `k2` such that `k1*1 + k2*2 <= remaining_capacity` and `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2]` is maximized.\n\nThis subproblem (maximizing `ps1[k1] + ps2[k2]` for a given capacity `C = remaining_capacity`) is the core of the solution. Let `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` store this maximum.\n\n**4. Efficiently Computing `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` for all `C`:**\nThe naive way to compute `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` for all `C` up to `m` is `O(m^2)`, which is too slow.\nWe need a faster way to compute `max_cost_w1_w2[C] = max_{0 <= k2 <= C/2} (ps1[min(len(w1_costs), C - 2*k2)] + ps2[k2])`.\n\nNotice that `ps1[x]` and `ps2[x]` are sums of non-negative values, so they are non-decreasing. Also, since we sort costs in descending order, the marginal gain from taking an additional item decreases (or stays the same). This means `ps1[x]` and `ps2[x]` are concave functions. The sum of a concave function and another concave function (after a linear transformation `C - 2*k2`) is generally not easy to optimize directly.\n\nA common technique for knapsack problems with small weights and large `m` is to use a standard DP for a limited range of one weight, and then optimize the rest.\nLet `dp[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp[w] = ps1[min(len(w1_costs), w)]` for all `w` from `0` to `m`. This accounts for taking only weight-1 items.\nNow, we consider adding items of weight 2.\nFor each `k2` from `1` to `min(len(w2_costs), m/2)`:\n  Let `cost_of_k2_w2_items = ps2[k2]`.\n  For `w` from `2*k2` to `m`:\n    `remaining_w = w - 2*k2`.\n    `cost_of_w1_items = ps1[min(len(w1_costs), remaining_w)]`.\n    `dp[w] = max(dp[w], cost_of_k2_w2_items + cost_of_w1_items)`.\nThis loop structure is `O(m * len(w2_costs))` which can still be `O(m^2)`.\n\n**The Optimized Approach for `max_cost_w1_w2[C]`:**\nThe function `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` can be computed in `O(M)` time.\nLet `f(C)` be `max_cost_w1_w2[C]`.\n`f(C)` is the maximum of `ps1[C - 2*k2] + ps2[k2]` over `k2`.\nThis is a standard \"convex hull trick\" or \"sliding window maximum\" type of optimization if the function `ps1` was linear.\nHowever, since `ps1[x]` is also a prefix sum, we can use a deque (double-ended queue) to find the maximum efficiently.\n\nLet `dp[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp[w] = ps1[min(len(w1_costs), w)]` for all `w` from `0` to `m`.\nThis part takes `O(M)`.\nNow, we need to incorporate weight 2 items.\nThe value `ps1[C - 2*k2]` is `ps1[C]` if `k2=0`.\n`ps1[C - 2*k2] + ps2[k2]` is what we want to maximize.\nThe `ps1` array effectively represents the costs of items of weight 1.\nThe `dp` array will store `max_cost_w1_w2[C]`.\n\nLet's rethink `max_cost_w1_w2[C]`:\n`max_cost_w1_w2[C]` is the maximum value of `ps1[k_1] + ps2[k_2]` such that `k_1 + 2*k_2 = C`.\nThis can be computed by a single pass using a DP state.\nLet `dp_w1_w2[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp_w1_w2[0] = 0`.\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `dp_w1_w2[w] = dp_w1_w2[w-1] + w1_costs[k_1]` (if `k_1` is available)\n  `dp_w1_w2[w] = max(dp_w1_w2[w], dp_w1_w2[w-2] + w2_costs[k_2])` (if `k_2` is available)\nThis is the standard 0/1 knapsack DP, but for multiple items of the same type, we need to be careful.\n\nThe correct way to compute `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` in `O(M)`:\nInitialize `dp_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`.\n`ptr1 = 0` (index for `w1_costs`)\n`ptr2 = 0` (index for `w2_costs`)\n`current_cost = 0`\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `option1_cost = -1` (take a weight 1 item)\n  If `ptr1 < len(w1_costs)`:\n    `option1_cost = dp_w1_w2[w-1] + w1_costs[ptr1]`\n  \n  `option2_cost = -1` (take a weight 2 item)\n  If `w >= 2` and `ptr2 < len(w2_costs)`:\n    `option2_cost = dp_w1_w2[w-2] + w2_costs[ptr2]`\n\n  If `option1_cost == -1` and `option2_cost == -1`:\n    `dp_w1_w2[w] = dp_w1_w2[w-1]` (if `w-1` is valid) or `0`\n  Else if `option1_cost >= option2_cost`:\n    `dp_w1_w2[w] = option1_cost`\n    `ptr1 += 1`\n  Else:\n    `dp_w1_w2[w] = option2_cost`\n    `ptr2 += 1`\nThis is incorrect. This greedily picks items, but the optimal choice at `w` depends on the optimal choices at `w-1` and `w-2` that might have used different sets of items.\n\nThe correct `O(M)` approach for `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` is:\n`dp_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n    `dp_w1_w2[w] = ps1[min(len(w1_costs), w)]`\nThis initializes `dp_w1_w2` with the best cost using only weight-1 items.\nNow, we iterate through the weight-2 items. For each `k2` from `1` to `min(len(w2_costs), m/2)`:\n    `cost_k2 = ps2[k2]`\n    For `w` from `2*k2` to `m`:\n        `remaining_w = w - 2*k2`\n        `dp_w1_w2[w] = max(dp_w1_w2[w], cost_k2 + ps1[min(len(w1_costs), remaining_w)])`\nThis is still `O(M * M/2)`.\n\nLet's use the definition: `dp_w1_w2[w] = max_{k2} (ps1[min(len(w1_costs), w - 2*k2)] + ps2[k2])`.\nWe can compute this in `O(M)` time by observing the structure.\n`dp_w1_w2[w]` is the maximum cost for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp_w1_w2[w] = max(dp_w1_w2[w-1] + w1_costs[idx_w1], dp_w1_w2[w-2] + w2_costs[idx_w2])`\nThis is not quite right because `idx_w1` and `idx_w2` depend on how many items were chosen *before*.\nThis is the standard knapsack DP.\n`dp_w1_w2[w]` for `w` from `0` to `m`.\nInitialize `dp_w1_w2[0] = 0`, others to `-inf`.\nFor each `cost` in `w1_costs`:\n  For `w` from `m` down to `1`:\n    `dp_w1_w2[w] = max(dp_w1_w2[w], dp_w1_w2[w-1] + cost)`\nThis is `O(len(w1_costs) * M)`. Too slow.\n\nThe correct `O(M)` computation for `dp_w1_w2[w]` for all `w` up to `M` is as follows:\n`dp_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`max_val_w1 = 0`\n`idx_w1 = 0`\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n    `if idx_w1 < len(w1_costs):`\n        `max_val_w1 += w1_costs[idx_w1]`\n        `idx_w1 += 1`\n    `dp_w1_w2[w] = max_val_w1` (This is only using weight 1 items)\n\nNow, incorporate weight 2 items.\n`current_cost_w2 = 0`\n`idx_w2 = 0`\nFor `k2` from `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`:\n    `if k2 > 0: current_cost_w2 += w2_costs[k2-1]`\n    `remaining_w_for_w1 = m - 2*k2`\n    `cost_from_w1 = ps1[min(len(w1_costs), remaining_w_for_w1)]`\n    `dp_w1_w2[m - 2*k2] = max(dp_w1_w2[m - 2*k2], current_cost_w2 + cost_from_w1)`\nThis is what we need to calculate `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` for all `C`.\nThis is still `O(M) * O(M)` if we iterate through all `C` for each `k2`.\n\nThe `O(M)` DP to compute `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` for all `C` for items of weight 1 and 2:\n`dp = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`ptr1 = 0`\n`current_cost_w1 = 0`\n`for w in range(1, m + 1):`\n    `if ptr1 < len(w1_costs):`\n        `current_cost_w1 += w1_costs[ptr1]`\n        `ptr1 += 1`\n    `dp[w] = current_cost_w1`\nThis initializes `dp` with the best cost using only weight 1 items.\n\nNow, we improve `dp` by considering weight 2 items. This is where the `O(M)` optimization comes in.\nWe need to find `max_{k2} (ps1[w - 2*k2] + ps2[k2])`.\nThis can be rewritten as `max_{k2} ( (ps1[w - 2*k2] - ps1[w]) + ps2[k2] + ps1[w] )`.\nThe `ps1[w]` term is constant for a given `w`.\nWe need to maximize `ps1[w - 2*k2] + ps2[k2]`.\nThis is a standard form for a sliding window maximum problem if `ps1[x]` was just `x`.\nBut `ps1` is a prefix sum.\n\nLet's consider a simpler approach.\n`dp_w1_w2[w]` = maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n    `dp_w1_w2[w] = ps1[min(len(w1_costs), w)]`\nThis is `O(M)`.\n\nNow, iterate for each item of weight 2.\nFor `k2` from `1` to `min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`:\n    `val_w2 = w2_costs[k2-1]`\n    For `w` from `m` down to `2*k2`:\n        `dp_w1_w2[w] = max(dp_w1_w2[w], dp_w1_w2[w-2] + val_w2)`\nThis is still `O(M * N2)`.\n\nThe crucial insight is that for a fixed `k3`, we have `remaining_capacity = m - 3*k3`.\nWe need to find `max_cost_w1_w2[remaining_capacity]`.\nIf `m` is large, we can't iterate `k2` for each `k3`.\n\nThe actual solution for this type of problem (small weights, large N, M) is often to use the fact that the total number of items of weight 2 and 3 that can be taken is limited by `M/2` and `M/3` respectively.\nLet's consider the number of items of weight 2 (`k2`) and weight 3 (`k3`) that are taken.\nThe maximum values for `k2` is `M/2` and `k3` is `M/3`.\nIf we iterate `k2` from `0` to `M/2` and `k3` from `0` to `M/3`, this is `O(M^2)`.\n\nThe solution must be `O(M)` or `O(N log N)` or `O(M log M)`.\nThe `O(M)` part comes from the `max_cost_w1_w2` function.\nIt's `max_cost_w1_w2[C] = max_{0 <= k_2 <= C/2} (ps1[min(len(w1_costs), C - 2*k_2)] + ps2[k_2])`.\nThis can be computed in `O(M)` time using a sliding window maximum (deque) approach.\nSpecifically, for `dp_w1_w2[w]`, we want to maximize `ps1[w - 2*k_2] + ps2[k_2]`.\nLet `j = k_2`. We are maximizing `ps1[w - 2j] + ps2[j]`.\nFor a fixed `w`, as `j` increases, `w - 2j` decreases.\nThe `ps1` part depends on `w - 2j`, and `ps2` part depends on `j`.\nThis is a standard technique.\nLet `f(j) = ps2[j]` and `g(x) = ps1[x]`. We want to maximize `g(w - 2j) + f(j)`.\nIf `g` and `f` are concave, we can use a convex hull trick.\nIf `g` is arbitrary and `f` is concave, we can use a deque.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the maximum cost for weight `i` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + w1_costs[ptr1], dp[i-2] + w2_costs[ptr2])`\nThis is not correct for 0/1 knapsack where items are distinct (even if weights are same).\nThe correct DP for items with value `v` and weight `w` is:\n`dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-w] + v)`\nIf we have multiple items of the same weight, we iterate through them.\n`for item in w1_costs: for j from M down to 1: dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-1] + item)`\n`for item in w2_costs: for j from M down to 2: dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-2] + item)`\nThis is `O(N1*M + N2*M)`. Still too slow.\n\nThe correct way to compute `max_cost_w1_w2[C]` in `O(M)`:\n`dp_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n`best_w1_cost = 0`\n`ptr_w1 = 0`\n`for w in range(m + 1):`\n    `# Option 1: Only use weight 1 items`\n    `if ptr_w1 < len(w1_costs):`\n        `best_w1_cost += w1_costs[ptr_w1]`\n        `ptr_w1 += 1`\n    `dp_w1_w2[w] = best_w1_cost`\n\n    `# Option 2: Combine with weight 2 items`\n    `# For each possible k2, we want to find max(ps1[w - 2*k2] + ps2[k2])`\n    `# This is exactly what the overall loop does.`\n    `# This part needs to be optimized for O(M) overall.`\n    `# The optimization is to use a deque to find the max of ps1[w - 2*k2] + ps2[k2]`\n    `# for each w.`\n    `# Consider dp_w1_w2[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= w/2} (ps1[min(len(w1_costs), w - 2*k2)] + ps2[k2])`\n    `# This is computed by iterating w, and for each w, iterating k2. This is O(M^2).`\n\nThe `O(M)` optimization for `dp_w1_w2`:\nInitialize `dp_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`.\n`dp_w1_w2[w] = ps1[min(len(w1_costs), w)]` for `w` from `0` to `m`.\nThis is the base case: using only weight 1 items. `O(M)`\nNow, we need to consider adding weight 2 items.\nFor `k2` from `1` to `min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`:\n    `current_w2_cost = ps2[k2]`\n    For `w` from `2*k2` to `m`:\n        `dp_w1_w2[w] = max(dp_w1_w2[w], current_w2_cost + ps1[min(len(w1_costs), w - 2*k2)])`\nThis is still `O(M * M/2)`.\n\nThe only way this becomes `O(M)` is if `len(w2_costs)` is small, which is not guaranteed.\nThe trick is that the number of distinct weight values is small.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of items of weight 2 that can be used.
