String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**A Deep Dive into Vasily's Beautiful Strings**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Vasily the Bear\" problem, and my first instinct is to find a Python solution. The core of it boils down to manipulating strings of zeros and ones, where the operation replaces the last two characters with a new one based on these rules: `00` becomes `1`, and anything else becomes `0`. The goal is to figure out how many strings of length *n* zeros and *m* ones will eventually end up as a single character, *g*, after applying this reduction process.\n\nThis looks like a reduction process similar to how we evaluate expressions or condense segment trees, working from the right side of the string. So the last character is determined by these reduction steps. I've got this reduction operation defined as `op(a, b)`. It's pretty straightforward: if it's `00`, the result is `1`, otherwise, the result is `0`.\n\nThe key here is that any time there's a '1' in the last two characters being operated on, the result is automatically zero. The only way to get a '1' is to have a `00`. I went through a bunch of examples to try to understand what's happening. The reduction process is right-associative.\n\nSo, I'm thinking, let's look at how the number of ones affects the final result. If we get a '1' somewhere, it causes a cascading zero effect down the road. If the string contains a '1', the final value is likely to be zero.\n\nLet's say `g=1`.  For this to happen, the last operation has to be `op(0,0)`. I worked my way back from this to the beginning of the string to figure out what strings would work. To end up with a '1', the last characters must be `00`.\nNow, if there is one or more 1's, the result will always be 0. So to obtain g = 1, it must be the case that all bits are 0. So it is g = 1 if n is even, it is g = 0 otherwise.\n\nIt feels like if there's *any* '1' involved, you're usually going to end up with a zero result. And now I need to figure out how to count the strings that make it. My intuition is that this means we have a specific rule or formula.\n\nIf *m* (number of ones) is zero, the result is 1 if *n* (number of zeros) is even, and 0 if *n* is odd.\nIf *m* is greater than zero and *k_0* is the index of the first `1`, then if *g = 1* then *k_0* must be even.\n\nThis feels like it's getting closer. And I'm pretty sure I have the basic idea now of how to check for these beautiful strings.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings containing exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, such that after a series of modifications, the final single character is `g`. The modification operation is: replace the two last characters by one other character. This character is `1` if it replaces two `0`s, otherwise it is `0`. This operation is equivalent to evaluating a right-associative expression: `s_1 op (s_2 op (... op (s_{N-1} op s_N)...))`, where `N = n + m` is the total length of the string.\n\nLet's define the operation `op(a, b)`:\n`op(0, 0) = 1`\n`op(0, 1) = 0`\n`op(1, 0) = 0`\n`op(1, 1) = 0`\n\nNotice that `op(a, b)` is `1` if and only if `a=0` and `b=0`. In all other cases, it's `0`.\nThis implies `op(1, X) = 0` for any `X` (0 or 1), and `op(X, 1) = 0` for any `X`.\nAlso, `op(0, X) = 1 - X`.\n\nLet `R(s_i ... s_k)` denote the result of reducing the substring `s_i ... s_k`.\nThe recursive definition is:\n`R(s_k) = s_k` (base case for a single character)\n`R(s_i ... s_k) = op(s_i, R(s_{i+1} ... s_k))` (for `k > i`)\n\nWe want to find the number of strings `s_1 ... s_N` such that `R(s_1 ... s_N) = g`.\n\nLet's analyze the result `R(s_1 ... s_N)`:\n1.  **If `s_1 = 1`**:\n    `R(s_1 ... s_N) = op(1, R(s_2 ... s_N)) = 0`.\n    So, if the string starts with `1`, the final result is always `0`.\n2.  **If `s_1 = 0`**:\n    `R(s_1 ... s_N) = op(0, R(s_2 ... s_N)) = 1 - R(s_2 ... s_N)`.\n    In this case, the result is `1` if `R(s_2 ... s_N)` is `0`, and `0` if `R(s_2 ... s_N)` is `1`.\n\nThis means the value of `R(s_1 ... s_N)` depends on `s_1` and `R(s_2 ... s_N)`.\nLet `g_final` be the desired final character.\nIf `s_1 = 1`: `g_final` must be `0`.\nIf `s_1 = 0`: `g_final` must be `1 - R(s_2 ... s_N)`.\n\nLet `N_0 = n` be the count of zeros and `N_1 = m` be the count of ones.\n\n**Case 1: `m = 0` (all zeros string)**\nThe string is `00...0` (`n` zeros).\n`R(\"0\") = 0`\n`R(\"00\") = op(0, R(\"0\")) = op(0, 0) = 1`\n`R(\"000\") = op(0, R(\"00\")) = op(0, 1) = 0`\n`R(\"0000\") = op(0, R(\"000\")) = op(0, 0) = 1`\nThe result `R(\"0...0\")` is `0` if `n` is odd, and `1` if `n` is even.\n\nSo, if `m = 0`:\n*   If `n` is odd: `R(\"0...0\") = 0`. If `g = 0`, count = 1. If `g = 1`, count = 0.\n*   If `n` is even: `R(\"0...0\") = 1`. If `g = 1`, count = 1. If `g = 0`, count = 0.\n(Note: `n+m >= 1` means `n >= 1` when `m=0`).\n\n**Case 2: `m > 0` (at least one '1' in the string)**\n\nConsider the string `s_1 s_2 ... s_N`.\nIf `s_1 = 1`: The result is `0`. This string contributes to the count for `g=0`.\n    Number of such strings: `n` zeros, `m-1` ones for the remaining `N-1` positions. This is `C(N-1, n)`.\nIf `s_1 = 0`: The result is `1 - R(s_2 ... s_N)`. This string contributes to the count for `g=0` if `R(s_2 ... s_N) = 1`, and for `g=1` if `R(s_2 ... s_N) = 0`.\n    Number of such strings: `n-1` zeros, `m` ones for the remaining `N-1` positions. This is `C(N-1, n-1)`.\n\nLet `count(n_zeros, n_ones, target_g)` be the number of strings with `n_zeros` zeros and `n_ones` ones that reduce to `target_g`.\nWe are looking for `count(n, m, g)`.\n\nBase cases:\n*   `count(0, 0, 0)` is 0 (string length must be at least 1).\n*   `count(0, 0, 1)` is 0.\n*   `count(n_zeros, 0, 0)`: 1 if `n_zeros` is odd, 0 otherwise.\n*   `count(n_zeros, 0, 1)`: 1 if `n_zeros` is even, 0 otherwise.\n*   `count(0, n_ones, 0)`: 1 if `n_ones > 0`. (String starts with 1, so result is 0).\n*   `count(0, n_ones, 1)`: 0 if `n_ones > 0`. (String starts with 1, so result is 0).\n\nRecursive relation for `n_ones > 0` and `n_zeros > 0`:\n`count(n_zeros, n_ones, g) =`\n  `count for strings starting with '1'` + `count for strings starting with '0'`\n`count(n_zeros, n_ones, g) =`\n  (if `g=0`, `count(n_zeros, n_ones-1, 0)` for the rest of the string) +\n  (if `n_zeros>0`, `count(n_zeros-1, n_ones, 1-g)` for the rest of the string)\n\nThis is a dynamic programming approach, but `n` and `m` can be up to `10^5`, so `O(N*M)` is too slow.\nThe `count(n_zeros, n_ones, target_g)` is actually just combinations `C(total_len-1, n_zeros_in_rest)`.\n\nLet `ans(n, m, g)` be the total count.\nIf `m > 0`:\n`ans(n, m, g) = C(n+m-1, n)` if `g = 0` (strings starting with `1`)\n               `+ C(n+m-1, n-1)` if `g = 1` (strings starting with `0` and `R(s_2...s_N)=0`)\n               `+ C(n+m-1, n-1)` if `g = 0` (strings starting with `0` and `R(s_2...s_N)=1`)\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's use the definition of `R(s)` directly.\n`R(s_1 ... s_N) = g`.\n\nIf `m = 0`:\n    If `n` is odd: `g` must be `0`. Count is `1` if `g=0`, `0` if `g=1`.\n    If `n` is even: `g` must be `1`. Count is `1` if `g=1`, `0` if `g=0`.\n\nIf `m > 0`:\nLet `f(n_0, n_1)` be the final character when reducing a string with `n_0` zeros and `n_1` ones.\nThis `f(n_0, n_1)` is not fixed; it depends on the arrangement.\nWe need to count strings.\n\nLet `N = n+m`.\nConsider the result `R(s_1 ... s_N)`.\nIf `s_1 = 1`, then `R(s_1 ... s_N) = 0`.\nIf `s_1 = 0`, then `R(s_1 ... s_N) = 1 - R(s_2 ... s_N)`.\n\n**Target `g = 0`:**\nStrings that reduce to `0` are:\n1.  Strings starting with `1`. There are `C(N-1, n)` such strings (one `1` is fixed at `s_1`, `n` zeros and `m-1` ones for the remaining `N-1` positions).\n2.  Strings starting with `0` AND `R(s_2 ... s_N) = 1`.\n    For these strings, `s_1 = 0`. The remaining string `s_2 ... s_N` has `n-1` zeros and `m` ones.\n    We need `R(s_2 ... s_N)` to be `1`.\n    Let `N' = N-1`. The subproblem is `ans(n-1, m, 1)`.\n\n**Target `g = 1`:**\nStrings that reduce to `1` are:\n1.  Strings starting with `1`: None (they always reduce to `0`).\n2.  Strings starting with `0` AND `R(s_2 ... s_N) = 0`.\n    For these strings, `s_1 = 0`. The remaining string `s_2 ... s_N` has `n-1` zeros and `m` ones.\n    We need `R(s_2 ... s_N)` to be `0`.\n    The subproblem is `ans(n-1, m, 0)`.\n\nThis looks like a recursive definition.\n`ans(n, m, g)`:\nIf `m = 0`:\n    Return `1` if (`n` is odd and `g=0`) or (`n` is even and `g=1`). Else `0`.\nIf `n = 0`: (and `m > 0` because `m=0` is handled above)\n    String starts with `1`. Result is `0`.\n    Return `1` if `g=0`, `0` if `g=1`. (Only one such string: `11...1`).\nIf `m > 0` and `n > 0`:\n    `total_count = 0`\n    If `g = 0`:\n        `total_count += C(n+m-1, n)` (for strings starting with `1`)\n        `total_count += ans(n-1, m, 1)` (for strings starting with `0` and `R(s_2...s_N)=1`)\n    If `g = 1`:\n        `total_count += ans(n-1, m, 0)` (for strings starting with `0` and `R(s_2...s_N)=0`)\n    Return `total_count % MOD`.\n\nThis is a DP problem. We need to compute `ans(n, m, g)`.\nThe state depends on `n` and `m`. `m` is constant. `n` decreases.\n`ans(n, m, g)` depends on `ans(n-1, m, 1-g)`.\nLet `dp[i][0]` be `ans(i, m, 0)` and `dp[i][1]` be `ans(i, m, 1)`.\n`dp[i][0] = C(i+m-1, i) + dp[i-1][1]`\n`dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0]`\nBase case for `i=0`:\n`dp[0][0] = 1` (since `m > 0`, string is `1...1`, result is `0`)\n`dp[0][1] = 0`\n\nLet's compute for `i` from `1` to `n`.\n`dp[0][0] = 1`\n`dp[0][1] = 0`\n\nFor `i = 1 ... n`:\n`dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0]`\n`dp[i][0] = (C(i+m-1, i) + dp[i-1][1]) % MOD`\n\nThe final answer is `dp[n][g]`.\n\nWe need a combinations function `C(N, K) % MOD`.\n`C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!)`.\nMax `N` is `n+m-1 = 2*10^5 - 1`. Precompute factorials and inverse factorials.\n\nLet's re-check the base cases for `m > 0`:\nIf `n=0`: The string is `11...1` (`m` ones).\n`R(\"1\") = 1`\n`R(\"11\") = op(1, R(\"1\")) = op(1, 1) = 0`\n`R(\"111\") = op(1, R(\"11\")) = op(1, 0) = 0`\nIt seems if there is at least one `1`, and `s_1 = 1`, the result is `0`.\n`R(1...1)` for `m` ones:\n`R(s_N) = 1`\n`R(s_{N-1} s_N) = op(1, 1) = 0`\n`R(s_{N-2} s_{N-1} s_N) = op(1, 0) = 0`\nSo `R(1...1)` is `0` if `m >= 2`.\nIf `m=1`, `R(\"1\") = 1`.\nSo the base case `dp[0][0]=1, dp[0][1]=0` is correct for `m >= 2`.\nIf `m=1`, `n=0`: string is \"1\". Result is 1.\nSo `dp[0][0]=0, dp[0][1]=1` for `m=1`.\n\nLet's refine the base cases for `dp[0][...]`:\nIf `m = 1`:\n    `dp[0][0] = 0` (string \"1\", result is 1)\n    `dp[0][1] = 1`\nIf `m >= 2`:\n    `dp[0][0] = 1` (string \"1...1\", result is 0)\n    `dp[0][1] = 0`\n\nThis logic holds for `n > 0` and `m > 0`.\n\nLet's summarize the overall plan:\n1.  Read `n, m, g`.\n2.  Define `MOD = 1000000007`.\n3.  Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo `MOD` up to `n+m`.\n4.  Define `C(N, K)` function using precomputed values.\n5.  **Handle `m = 0` edge case**:\n    If `n` is odd: if `g=0`, print `1`. Else print `0`.\n    If `n` is even: if `g=1`, print `1`. Else print `0`.\n6.  **Handle `m > 0` case**:\n    Initialize `dp[0]` (current `n` value) based on `m`:\n    If `m == 1`: `dp_0 = 0`, `dp_1 = 1`\n    If `m >= 2`: `dp_0 = 1`, `dp_1 = 0`\n    (Here `dp_0` means `ans(current_n, m, 0)`, `dp_1` means `ans(current_n, m, 1)`)\n\n    Loop `i` from `1` to `n` (representing `n_zeros`):\n        `prev_dp_0 = dp_0`\n        `prev_dp_1 = dp_1`\n        `dp_1 = prev_dp_0`\n        `dp_0 = (C(i+m-1, i) + prev_dp_1) % MOD`\n\n    Finally, print `dp_0` if `g=0`, else print `dp_1`.\n\nLet's test with examples:\n`n=1, m=1, g=0`\n`m > 0`. `m=1`.\nBase case for `i=0`: `dp_0 = 0`, `dp_1 = 1`.\nLoop `i=1` (up to `n=1`):\n    `prev_dp_0 = 0`, `prev_dp_1 = 1`.\n    `dp_1 = prev_dp_0 = 0`.\n    `dp_0 = (C(1+1-1, 1) + prev_dp_1) % MOD`\n         `= (C(1, 1) + 1) % MOD`\n         `= (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\nFinal `dp_0 = 2`, `dp_1 = 0`.\nWe need `g=0`, so print `dp_0 = 2`.
