    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Frog Jumping\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script for this \"Frog Jumping\" problem. The core of it is figuring out which integers the frog can actually reach, given its jumping rules and the constraints.\n\nHere's how I'm breaking it down: the frog can move a distance of `a` or `-b` from any point `k`, as long as it stays within the range `[0, x]`. My ultimate goal is to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from 0 to `m`, where `f(x)` represents the number of distinct integers reachable from 0 and within the interval `[0, x]`.\n\nSo, the frog can jump to `k+a` or `k-b`. These jumps have boundaries (`k+a <= x` and `k-b >= 0`). This naturally lends itself to graph theory, where nodes are integers and edges represent valid jumps. The question then becomes one of reachability.  I'm looking for the number of nodes reachable from `0`.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that any reachable point will be some combination of `a` and `b`. More precisely, it can be written as `c_1 * a - c_2 * b` for non-negative integers `c_1` and `c_2`. Now, the crucial part: not only must the final point be reachable, but every intermediate point in the jump sequence must also be within the range `[0, x]`. That complicates things.\n\nA key insight: all reachable points must be multiples of the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` (let's call it `g`). This simplifies the problem somewhat, because it means my search space is reduced. It also suggests that I can simplify the problem by dividing everything by `g`. If `a' = a/g` and `b' = b/g`, then `gcd(a', b') = 1`.  So, without loss of generality, I can focus on the simplified problem, where I assume `gcd(a, b) = 1`. It also means if all points `k*g` are considered, they can not all be reached.\n\nWith `gcd(a, b) = 1`, all integers are eventually reachable if there were no bounds. We can express any integer as a linear combination of `a` and `b` (Bezout's identity). But remember the constraint: all steps within the jump sequence must also be in `[0, x]`. The Frobenius coin problem provides an upper limit, but I need a more efficient algorithm here. I need to take into account that jumping to, say, `k*a` might be okay, but getting there and staying within the boundaries is the key.\n\nSince the constraint is about staying within the interval `[0, x]` at *every* step, I'm thinking of a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph. The nodes are 0 to x, and valid edges exist based on the jumps. This seems straightforward, but I need to be careful with computational complexity because x can be really large (up to 10^9).\n\nI'm starting to think a mathematical approach might be necessary.  Since all reachable points are multiples of the GCD `g`, and if I divide everything by the GCD, the interval `[0, x]` is essentially going to be `[0, floor(x/g)]`. Let `f'(x/g)` be the number of points in the simplified interval. I need to multiply it by the GCD, and then that becomes my `f(x)`. No that is wrong. I'm overthinking it. Instead, since they have to be multiples of `g`, that simply means that `f(x)` only includes the multiples of `g` that are reachable. Then I'm essentially running `f'(x/g)`. Then it just simplifies to that I must consider points `0, g, 2g, 3g, ...`.\n\nWith `gcd(a, b) = 1`, and the constraints, I can reach a conclusion that if `k` is reachable, then `k+a` is reachable (provided within constraints), and so on. This really sounds like reachability on a finite graph. It makes me think about Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths.\n\nI could define `dist[i]` to be the minimum number of \"+a\" jumps to reach `i` mod `a`. Then the states are `0, g, 2g, ..., a-g` and `0 <= i <= x`. I'm starting to see how Dijkstra could be used.  The \"cost\" of the jump is",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m+1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0`, never jumping outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b` from its current position.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any position reachable by the frog must be a multiple of `g`.\nWe can simplify the problem by dividing `a`, `b`, and `x` by `g`. Let `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`. Then `gcd(a', b') = 1`. If `f'(X)` is the number of reachable points in `[0, X]` using jumps `+a'` and `-b'`, then `f(x) = f'(floor(x/g))`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)` can be rewritten. If `m_prime = floor(m/g)`, then `f(i)` will be `f'(k)` for `i` in `[k*g, (k+1)*g - 1]`.\nSpecifically, `f(i) = f'(floor(i/g))`.\nLet `S = sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{m} f'(floor(i/g))`.\nThis sum can be grouped by `floor(i/g)`:\n`S = sum_{k=0}^{m_prime-1} (g * f'(k)) + (m - m_prime*g + 1) * f'(m_prime)`.\nThis transformation allows us to work with `gcd(a, b) = 1` and then apply the result. Let's assume `gcd(a, b) = 1` for now, and handle the general case later.\n\n**1. Finding Reachable Points (`gcd(a, b) = 1`)**\nThe problem constraints (never jump outside `[0, x]`) mean that if we are at `k`, we can jump to `k+a` only if `k+a <= x`, and to `k-b` only if `k-b >= 0`. This is a graph reachability problem on nodes `0, 1, ..., x`.\nSince `x` can be very large (`10^9`), we cannot simulate this directly for each `x`.\nHowever, notice that all reachable points `y` must satisfy `y = k \\cdot a - l \\cdot b` for some non-negative integers `k, l`.\nSince `gcd(a, b) = 1`, by Bezout's identity, any integer `y` can be expressed as `k \\cdot a - l \\cdot b` for some integers `k, l`.\nWe are interested in the smallest non-negative value `v` that is reachable from `0` and has a specific remainder `r` when divided by `a`. Let `dist[r]` be this minimum value `v`.\nWe can compute `dist[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]` using Dijkstra's algorithm.\nThe states in Dijkstra are `0, 1, ..., a-1` (remainders modulo `a`).\n`dist[r]` stores the minimum non-negative integer `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` (with all intermediate steps non-negative).\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[r] = infinity` for `r \\in [1, a-1]`.\nUse a min-priority queue `pq` storing `(value, remainder)`. Push `(0, 0)` to `pq`.\n\nWhen extracting `(val, rem)` from `pq`:\n1.  **Jump `+a`**: `next_val = val + a`. `next_rem = rem` (since `a \\equiv 0 \\pmod a`).\n    If `next_val < dist[next_rem]`: update `dist[next_rem] = next_val` and push `(next_val, next_rem)` to `pq`.\n2.  **Jump `-b`**: `next_val = val - b`.\n    If `next_val >= 0`: `next_rem = (rem - b % a + a) % a`.\n    If `next_val < dist[next_rem]`: update `dist[next_rem] = next_val` and push `(next_val, next_rem)` to `pq`.\n\nThe maximum value `dist[r]` can take is roughly `a \\cdot b`. Since `a, b \\le 10^5`, this can be `10^{10}`. The number of states is `a`. Dijkstra's complexity is `O(a \\log(\\text{max_dist_val}))` or `O(a \\log a)` with a good priority queue. With `a=10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n**2. Calculating `f(x)` using `dist` array**\nAfter computing `dist[r]` for all `r \\in [0, a-1]`:\nFor a given `x`, a point `y` is reachable in `[0, x]` if `y \\le x`, `y \\ge 0`, `y \\equiv r \\pmod a` for some `r`, and `y` can be written as `dist[r] + k \\cdot a` for some non-negative integer `k`.\nSo, for each `r \\in [0, a-1]`:\nIf `dist[r]` is `infinity`, no point with remainder `r` is reachable.\nOtherwise, the reachable points with remainder `r` are `dist[r], dist[r]+a, dist[r]+2a, ...`.\nWe count how many of these are less than or equal to `x`.\nThis count is `floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1`, provided `x >= dist[r]`. If `x < dist[r]`, the count is `0`.\nSo, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} (\\text{max}(0, \\text{floor}((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1))`\n\n**3. Calculating `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`**\nWe need to compute `S = sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{m} sum_{r=0}^{a-1} (\\text{max}(0, \\text{floor}((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1))`.\nWe can swap the summations:\n`S = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} sum_{i=0}^{m} (\\text{max}(0, \\text{floor}((i - dist[r]) / a) + 1))`.\nFor each `r`, let `D_r = dist[r]`. We need to compute `sum_{i=D_r}^{m} (\\text{floor}((i - D_r) / a) + 1)`.\nLet `j = i - D_r`. The sum becomes `sum_{j=0}^{m-D_r} (\\text{floor}(j / a) + 1)`.\nLet `N = m - D_r`. We need to compute `S_N = sum_{j=0}^{N} (\\text{floor}(j / a) + 1)`.\nThe terms `floor(j/a) + 1` form a sequence:\n`1` for `j = 0, ..., a-1` (`a` terms)\n`2` for `j = a, ..., 2a-1` (`a` terms)\n...\n`Q+1` for `j = Q \\cdot a, ..., N`, where `Q = floor(N/a)`.\nThe sum `S_N` can be calculated as:\n`S_N = a \\cdot (1 + 2 + ... + Q) + (N - Q \\cdot a + 1) \\cdot (Q + 1)`\n`S_N = a \\cdot Q \\cdot (Q+1) / 2 + (N - Q \\cdot a + 1) \\cdot (Q + 1)`.\nThis formula is valid for `N >= 0`. If `N < 0`, `S_N = 0`.\nThe total sum `S` is the sum of `S_N` for each `r`. This takes `O(a)` time after Dijkstra.\n\n**4. Handling `gcd(a, b) != 1`**\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`.\nThe Dijkstra algorithm for `dist[r]` needs `a` states. All `dist[r]` values will be multiples of `g`.\nThe `dist[r]` values are `min_val` such that `min_val \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\nHowever, `r` itself must be a multiple of `g`. If `r` is not a multiple of `g`, then `dist[r]` should remain `infinity`.\nThe Dijkstra should be initialized such that `dist[r] = infinity` if `r % g != 0`. `dist[0] = 0` (since `0 % g == 0`).\nThe `+a` and `-b` operations preserve the property of being a multiple of `g`.\nSo, the `dist[r]` values computed by Dijkstra will naturally be multiples of `g` and `0` for `r` not a multiple of `g`.\nThe formula for `S_N` remains the same. The `dist[r]` values are now the minimum reachable non-negative value `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` AND `v \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `m=7, a=5, b=3`**\n`g = gcd(5, 3) = 1`.\nDijkstra for `a=5`: `dist = [inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]`.\n`dist[0] = 0`. `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\n\n1.  Pop `(0, 0)`. `val=0, rem=0`.\n    `+a`: `next_val = 5, next_rem = 0`. `5 < dist[0]` (which is `0`) is false.\n    `-b`: `next_val = -3`. Invalid.\n    \n    *Correction*: When `val=0, rem=0`, we consider jumps from `val`.\n    `val + a = 0+5 = 5`. `rem = 0`. `dist[0]` is `0`. `5` is not less than `0`.\n    `val - b = 0-3 = -3`. Invalid.\n    The issue is that `dist[0]` should be `0`, but we can also reach `5` from `0`.\n    This implies that `dist[r]` should be the minimum value `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable.\n    The Dijkstra should update `dist[rem]` only if `val` is smaller than the current `dist[rem]`.\n    \n    Let's re-run Dijkstra:\n    `dist = [inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n    `dist[0] = 0`. `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\n    \n    1.

Invalid.\n       \n       *Wait, this is wrong. The `+a` jump is not just from `rem`, but from `val`.

This matches example.\n       \n       My `dist[r]` logic is for minimum value `v` such that `v \\pmod a = r` and `v \\ge 0`.\n       The issue is that `dist[r] + k*a` are not necessarily reachable for ALL `k >= 0`.\n       For example, `dist[0]=0`. `0+5=5` is reachable. `0+10=10` is NOT reachable if `x=7`.\n       The `f(x)` formula `floor((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1` assumes *all* `dist[r]+k*a` are reachable as long as they are non-negative.\n       This is true if there is no upper bound `x`.\n       But here, the upper bound `x` is strict for *all intermediate jumps*.\n       \n       This means the `dist[r]` values must be computed differently.\n       `dist[r]` should be the minimum *positive* value `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` by *only* making `+a` jumps.\n       No, that's not it.\n       \n       The problem states: \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\n       This means the set of reachable points for `x` is `S_x = {p \\in [0, x] | p \\text{ is reachable from } 0 \\text{ in } G_x}`.\n       \n       The `dist[r]` array should represent the minimum value `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` by a path where all intermediate points are `\\ge 0`.\n       This is the standard shortest path problem on a graph where nodes are `0, ..., a-1` and edges are `(u, (u+a)%a)` with weight `a` and `(u, (u-b)%a)` with weight `b`.\n       The `dist[r]` array from the Dijkstra is correct for this interpretation.\n       \n       The problem is how `f(x)` is calculated.\n       A point `y` is reachable in `[0, x]` if and only if `y \\le x` AND `y \\ge dist[y \\pmod a]`.\n       This is still the same logic.\n       The example `f(7)=8` and my calculation of `f(7)=4` means my `f(x)` calculation is wrong.\n       \n       The `dist[r]` values are correct.\n       `dist = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]` for `a=5, b=3`.\n       \n       `f(x)` is the number of points `y` in `[0, x]` such that `y` is reachable.\n       A point `y` is reachable from `0` in the graph `G_x` if `y` is in `[0, x]` and `y` can be reached by a sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps *where all intermediate points are also in `[0, x]`*.\n       \n       The Dijkstra computed `dist[r]` assuming `x = infinity`.\n       The problem implies that `f(x)` is the size of the connected component containing `0` in graph `G_x`.\n       This means `f(x)` cannot be computed using precomputed `dist[r]` values in this simple way.\n       \n       The range of `a` and `b` is `10^5`. `min(a, b)` can be `1`.\n       If `a=1`, then `dist[0]=0`. All points `0, 1, ..., x` are reachable. `f(x) = x+1`.\n       `sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2`.\n       Example 2: `m=10^9, a=1, b=2019`. `g=1`. `dist[0]=0`.\n       `f(x) = x+1`. `sum = (10^9+1)(10^9+2)/2`. This matches.\n       \n       If `b=1`, then `dist[r]` is the minimum non-negative value `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a`.\n       `dist[0]=0`. `dist[1]=a-1`. `dist[2]=a-2`. ... `dist[a-1]=1`.\n       This is because we can always reach `r` from `0` by `0 \\to a \\to 2a \\to ... \\to k*a` and then `k*a \\to k*a-1 \\to ... \\to r` by `b=1` jumps.\n       `dist[r] = (a-r) % a`. (No, `dist[r]` is `r` if `r` is small, or `r+a` if `r` is larger, etc.)\n       Actually `dist[r]` is `r` for `r \\in [0, a-1]`.\n       \n       No, `dist[r]` is the minimum non-negative value `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` by non-negative jumps.\n       For `b=1`, we can reach any `r` by `0 \\to k*a \\to k*a - l*1`.\n       `dist[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]` is `r`. (e.g. `0 \\to a \\to a-1 \\to a-2 \\to ... \\to r`).\n       So `dist = [0, 1, 2, ..., a-1]`.\n       In this case, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{a-1} (\\text{max}(0, \\text{floor}((x-r)/a)+1))`.\n       This is `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} (floor((x-r)/a)+1)` if `x >= a-1`.\n       This sum is `sum_{k=0}^x (floor(k/a)+1) - sum_{k=0}^{x-(a-1)} (floor(k/a)+1)`\n       No, this sum is `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} (floor((x-r)/a)+1)`.\n       `x-r` takes values `x, x-1, ..., x-(a-1)`.\n       `floor((x-r)/a)` takes values `floor(x/a), floor((x-1)/a), ..., floor((x-a+1)/a)`.\n       This is `a` terms.\n       The values `floor(N/a)` for `N=x, x-1, ..., x-a+1` will be `floor(x/a)` (say `Q`) for `x-r >= Q*a`, and `Q-1` for `x-r < Q*a`.\n       Specifically, `x = Q*a + R` where `0 <= R < a`.\n       `floor(x/a) = Q`.\n       `floor((x-1)/a) = Q` if `R > 0`, `Q-1` if `R=0`.\n       `floor((x-R)/a) = Q`.\n       `floor((x-R-1)/a) = Q-1`.\n       So, there are `R+1` terms of `Q`, and `a-(R+1)` terms of `Q-1`.\n       The sum is `(R+1)*(Q+1) + (a-R-1)*Q`.\n       `f(x) = (R+1)*(Q+1) + (a-R-1)*Q`.\n       This is `f(x) = Q*a + R + 1 = x+1`.\n       So for `b=1`, `f(x)=x+1`.\n       This is also consistent with the example `a=1, b=2019`. `f(x)=x+1`.\n       \n       The `dist[r]` calculation is correct for `gcd(a,b)=1` and `b=1` or `a=1`.\n       The issue is that for `a=5, b=3`, `f(7)` is not `4` but `8`.\n       The reachable points are `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`. All points in `[0, 7]` are reachable.\n       This is the core of the problem. When `gcd(a,b)=1`, then any integer `k` can be represented as `c_1 a - c_2 b`.\n       The `dist[r]` values give the minimum non-negative such `k`.\n       The statement \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\" means that for a path `p_0, p_1, ..., p_k`, all `p_i \\in [0, x]`.\n       \n       If `dist[r]` is the minimum non-negative value `v` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` with all intermediate steps non-negative.\n       Then, any `v'` that is `v + k \\cdot a` for `k \\ge 0` is also reachable with all intermediate steps `\\ge 0`.\n       However, if `v+a > x`, then `v+a` is not reachable.\n       \n       This means that for `x` large enough, `f(x)` will be `x+1`.\n       What is \"large enough\"?\n       This is related to the Frobenius number. If `gcd(a,b)=1`, then all integers greater than `a*b - a - b` can be expressed as `c_1 a + c_2 b`.\n       Here, we have `c_1 a - c_2 b`.\n       The `dist[r]` values are the \"smallest\" representations.\n       The largest `dist[r]` value is `max_dist`.\n       If `x >= max_dist`, then any value `y` in `[max_dist, x]` can be reached? Not quite.\n       \n       Let `max_dist = max(dist[r])`.\n       For any `x >= max_dist`, `f(x)` becomes `x+1`.\n       No, this is not true. `f(x)` is the number of reachable points in `[0, x]`.\n       \n       The problem implies that once we reach a point `p`, we can use it to make further jumps.\n       The set of reachable points for a given `x` is the connected component containing `0` in the graph `G_x`.\n       \n       The maximum value of `dist[r]` is `a*b - a - b` in the case of `+a, +b`.\n       For `+a, -b` it's different.\n       `max(dist)` is `max_dist`.\n       For `a=5, b=3`, `max_dist = dist[3] = 12`.\n       If `x >= max_dist`, then `f(x)` is the number of integers in `[0, x]` that are multiples of `g`.\n       Since `g=1`, `f(x) = x+1` for `x >= max_dist`.\n       \n       Let's check `f(x)` for `x` values from `0` to `m`.\n       `f(x)` is constant for `x < min(a,b)`. `f(x)=1` for `x < min(a,b)`.\n       `f(0)=1`.\n       `f(1)=1`.\n       `f(2)=1`.\n       `f(3)=1`.\n       `f(4)=1`.\n       `f(5)=3` (0, 5, 2).\n       `f(6)=3` (0, 5, 2). `6` is not reachable.\n       `f(7)=8` (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n       \n       My `f(x)` calculation is `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} (\\text{max}(0, \\text{floor}((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1))`.\n       This is `f(x)` for `x` large enough (i.e., `x` is large enough that all `dist[r]+k*a` are reachable as long as they are `\\le x`).\n       This is precisely the point of `max_dist`.\n       If `x >= max_dist`, then for any `y \\in [0, x]` that is a multiple of `g`, `y` is reachable.\n       This means `f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1` for `x >= max_dist`.\n       \n       What is `max_dist`? It's `max(dist[r])`.\n       For `a=5, b=3`, `dist = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`. `max_dist = 12`.\n       So for `x >= 12`, `f(x) = x+1`.\n       \n       Let's recompute `f(x)` for `x < max_dist` using BFS.\n       `f(0)=1`.\n       `f(1)=1`.\n       `f(2)=1`.\n       `f(3)=1`.\n       `f(4)=1`.\n       `f(5)=3` (0, 2, 5).\n       `f(6)=3` (0, 2, 5).\n       `f(7)=8` (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n       \n       The example values `f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8` are correct.\n       My `dist` array is: `[0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`.\n       The `dist[r]` values are the minimum `v \\ge 0` such that `v \\equiv r \\pmod a` and `v` is reachable from `0` (without upper bound).\n       \n       The critical observation is that if `x` is large enough, all values `y \\in [0, x]` that are multiples of `g` become reachable.\n       This threshold is `max_val = max(dist[r])`.\n       For `x >= max_val`, `f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1`.\n       For `x < max_val`, `f(x)` must be computed by BFS up to `x`.\n       \n       We can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `min(m, max_val + a)` using BFS.\n       `max_val` can be `a*b`, which is `10^{10}`. This is too large.\n       The maximum value for `dist[r]` is actually `a+b-g` for `gcd(a,b)=g`.\n       No, for `+a, -b`, the maximum value `dist[r]` can be `a*b/g - a - b + g`.\n       For `a=5, b=3, g=1`, `max_dist = 12`.\n       The maximum value of `a` or `b` is `10^5`. So `max_dist` can be `10^5 * 10^5 / 1 - 10^5 - 10^5 + 1 \\approx 10^{10}`.\n       \n       This means `max_dist` is too large to iterate up to.\n       The number of distinct values `dist[r]` can be at most `a`.\n       The sum is `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\n       The `f(x)` function will be computed for `x` up to `min(m, max_dist)`.\n       \n       What is `max_dist`?\n       It's `max_{r \\in [0, a-1]} dist[r]`.\n       The maximum value of `dist[r]` is bounded by `a * b / g`.\n       The maximum for `a,b <= 10^5` is `10^{10}`.\n       \n       The solution must combine the `dist` array with a BFS for small `x`.\n       Let `L = min(m, max_dist + a)`.\n       We can run BFS for `i` from `0` to `L`.\n       `current_f = 0`. `reachable = set()`. `q = deque()`.\n       `ans = 0`.\n       For `i` from `0` to `L`:\n         If `i` is reachable from `0` in `G_i`, add it to `reachable`.\n         This is too slow.\n         \n       Let `reachable_vals = set()`\n       `q = deque([0])`\n       `reachable_vals.add(0)`\n       `ans = 0`\n       `last_f_val = 0`\n       \n       For `x` from `0` to `m`:\n         If `x` becomes reachable:\n           `q.append(x)`\n           `reachable_vals.add(x)`\n         \n         while `q`:\n           `curr = q.popleft()`\n           `next_plus_a = curr + a`\n           If `next_plus_a <= x` and `next_plus_a` not in `reachable_vals`:\n             `reachable_vals.add(next_plus_a)`\n             `q.append(next_plus_a)`\n           `next_minus_b = curr - b`\n           If `next_minus_b >= 0` and `next_minus_b` not in `reachable_vals`:\n             `reachable_vals.add(next_minus_b)`\n             `q.append(next_minus_b)`\n         \n         `f_x = len(reachable_vals)`\n         `ans += f_x`\n       This would be `O(m*a)` or `O(m*log(m))` if `m` is small.\n       \n       The critical value `max_dist` is actually `max(dist[r])`.\n       For `a=5, b=3`, `max_dist = 12`.\n       The sum is `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\n       We can calculate `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `max_dist` using BFS.\n       `max_dist` is at most `a * b / g`.\n       If `a=10^5, b=10^5, g=1`, `max_dist` is `10^{10}`. This is still too large.\n       \n       The maximum value of `dist[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]` is related to `a` and `b`.\n       It's not `a*b/g`. It's actually bounded by `a + b`.\n       The maximum value `dist[r]` can take is `a+b-g` if `g=1`.\n       For `a=5, b=3`, `g=1`. `a+b-g = 5+3-1 = 7`.\n       My `dist` array `[0, 9, 3, 12, 6]` has `max_dist = 12`. This contradicts `a+b-g`.\n       \n       The max value that can be reached in `a` steps is `a*b`.\n       The max value of `dist[r]` is `max(dist[r])`.\n       The values `dist[r]` are the minimum non-negative numbers `v` such that `v \\pmod a = r` and `v` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps (all intermediate steps `\\ge 0`).\n       This Dijkstra works correctly and `max(dist[r])` is indeed `12` for `a=5, b=3`.\n       \n       Let `limit = min(m, max_dist + a)`.\n       We can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `limit` using a BFS.\n       The number of states in BFS is `limit`. `limit` can be `10^5 + 10^5 = 2*10^5`.\n       This is `O(limit)` for BFS.\n       \n       Algorithm:\n       1. Calculate `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n       2. Compute `dist[r]` for `r \\in [0, a-1]` using Dijkstra.\n          Initialize `dist[r] = infinity` for `r \\in [0, a-1]`.\n          `dist[0] = 0`. `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\n          When popping `(val, rem)`:\n            If `val > dist[rem]`, continue.\n            `new_val = val + a`. `new_rem = rem`.\n            If `new_val < dist[new_rem]`: `dist[new_rem] = new_val`, push `(new_val, new_rem)`.\n            `new_val = val - b`.\n            If `new_val >= 0`: `new_rem = (rem - b % a + a) % a`.\n            If `new_val < dist[new_rem]`: `dist[new_rem] = new_val`, push `(new_val, new_rem)`.\n       3.

The points are `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.\n       \n       The discrepancy means that for `x < max_dist`, the `f(x)` cannot be calculated using `dist[r]` values alone.\n       The actual definition of `f(x)` is the number of reachable points in `[0, x]` by *any path* where all intermediate points are in `[0, x]`.\n       This is precisely what the BFS does.\n       \n       The `max_dist` is the point where the `dist[r]` values become \"stable\" and \"all points are reachable\".\n       This means `f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1` for `x >= max_dist`.\n       \n       The critical value `max_dist` for `a,b <= 10^5` is `max(dist[r])`.\n       The maximum value of `dist[r]` is `a*(b/g - 1)` (if `a <= b`).\n       If `a=10^5, b=10^5-1, g=1`. `max_dist = 10^5 * (10^5-1-1) = 10^5 * (10^5-2) approx 10^{10}`.\n       This means `max_dist` can indeed be very large.\n       \n       The problem is \"very easy\". This implies there's a simpler approach.\n       \n       What if `a` is very small?

This is correct.\n       \n       What if `a` is large? E.g., `a=10^5, b=1`. `g=1`.\n       `dist = [0, 1, ..., a-1]`. `max_dist = a-1`.\n       `threshold = min(m, a-1+a) = min(m, 2a-1)`.\n       If `m < 2a-1`, then BFS up to `m`.\n       If `m >= 2a-1`, BFS up to `2a-1`. Then use formula for `i > 2a-1`.\n       This is `O(a)`.\n       \n       The maximum value of `a` is `10^5`.\n       The maximum value of `max_dist` is the problem.\n       \n       If `a` is small, `max_dist` can be large.\n       If `a` is large, `max_dist` can be small.\n       \n       Let's re-evaluate the actual maximum value of `dist[r]`.\n       The values `dist[r]` are of the form `k*a - l*b`.\n       The largest `dist[r]` can be `a * (b/g - 1)` if `a < b`.\n       The largest `dist[r]` can be `b * (a/g - 1)` if `b < a`.\n       So `max_dist` is `min(a,b) * (max(a,b)/g - 1)`.\n       For `a=5, b=3, g=1`. `min(5,3)*(max(5,3)/1 - 1) = 3*(5-1) = 12`. This matches.\n       \n       So `max_dist` can be `10^5 * (10^5/1 - 1) approx 10^{10}`.\n       This implies that `threshold` can be `10^{10}`.\n       The BFS for `f(x)` values up to `threshold` is too slow.\n       \n       This means the `f(x)` for `x < max_dist` must also be derived from `dist[r]` values.\n       My `f(x)` formula `sum_{r=0}^{a-1} (\\text{max}(0, \\text{floor}((x - dist[r]) / a) + 1))` is what is needed.\n       The example `f(7)=8` must be `4` by this formula.\n       \n       The problem statement: \"The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from `0`.\"\n       This is the standard definition of reachability.\n       \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\n       This is a constraint on the *path*.\n       \n       The `dist[r]` values are computed for paths that only use `\\ge 0` numbers.\n       If we use `a=5, b=3`, `dist = [0, 9, 3, 12, 6]`.\n       Points reachable in `[0, 7]` are `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.\n       `dist[1]=9`. `1` is reachable in `[0,7]`. Path: `0 \\to 5 \\to 2 \\to 7 \\to 4 \\to 1`. All intermediate points `\\le 7`. This is valid.\n       My formula `floor((x-dist[r])/a)+1` means `dist[r]` is the smallest reachable point, and then all `dist[r]+k*a` are also reachable.\n       But `1` is reachable, `dist[1]=9`. My formula says `floor((7-9)/5)+1 = 0`.\n       The formula is wrong.\n       \n       The `dist[r]` values are minimums, but they don't imply that `dist[r]+a` is reachable under `x` constraint.\n       \n       The only way this problem is easy is if `f(x)` is always `floor(x/g)+1`.\n       This is true if `max_dist` is small.\n       \n       The sum `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`.\n       If `a=10^5, b=10^5-1, m=10^9`. `g=1`. `max_dist` is `10^{10}`.\n       Then `f(i)` is likely not `i+1` for many `i`.\n       \n       The problem is the definition of `f(x)`. It's the size of the connected component.\n       This is a standard BFS up to `min(m, a+b)` or `min(m, 2*max(a,b))`.\n       The maximum for `a,b` is `10^5`. So `2*10^5`.\n       This means `f(x)` can be computed for `x` up to `2*10^5`.\n       \n       Let `L = 2*max(a,b)`.\n       We can compute `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `min(m, L)` using BFS.\n       `visited = {0}`, `q = deque([0])`.\n       `f_arr = [0] * (min(m, L) + 1)`.\n       `current_f_val = 1`.\n       `total_ans = 0`.\n       `bfs_reachable_q = deque([0])`.\n       \n       For `x` from `0` to `min(m, L)`:\n         `new_nodes_for_q = []`\n         While `bfs_reachable_q`:\n           `curr = bfs_reachable_q.popleft()`\n           `next_plus_a = curr + a`\n           If `next_plus_a <= x` and `next_plus_a not in visited`:\n             `visited.add(next_plus_a)`\n             `new_nodes_for_q.append(next_plus_a)`\n             `current_f_val += 1`\n           `next_minus_b = curr - b`\n           If `next_minus_b >= 0` and `next_minus_b not in visited`:\n             `visited.add(next_minus_b)`\n             `new_nodes_for_q.append(next_minus_b)`\n             `current_f_val += 1`\n         `bfs_reachable_q.extend(new_nodes_for_q)`\n         `f_arr[x] = current_f_val`\n         `total_ans += current_f_val`\n         \n       After this loop, `f(x)` for `x > L` is `floor(x/g)+1`.\n       The sum for `x > min(m, L)` is `sum_{i=min(m, L)+1}^{m} (floor(i/g)+1)`.\n       This sum is computed using the `S(N)` formula.\n       \n       The bound `L = 2*max(a,b)` is a common bound for reachability problems like this.\n       If `x > a+b`, then all points `k*g` for `k \\le x/g` are reachable.\n       So `f(x) = floor(x/g)+1` for `x >= a+b`.\n       `L = a+b`.\n       \n       For `a=5, b=3`. `L = 5+3 = 8`.\n       We compute `f(0)` to `f(8)`.\n       `f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8`.\n       `f(8)`: `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`. `f(8)=9`.\n       Sum for `m=7`: `1+1+1+1+1+3+3+8 = 19`.
