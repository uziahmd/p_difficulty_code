In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Tokitsukaze and Mahjong: My Python Script**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is this Mahjong game. Tokitsukaze has three tiles, and she needs to figure out the fewest extra tiles to draw to get a \"mentsu\" (either a triplet of the same tile, a \"koutsu\", or a sequence of three sequential tiles of the same suit, a \"shuntsu\"). It's all about finding the most efficient way to achieve at least one of these winning combinations.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Let's structure this!\" I'll represent the tiles as tuples (number, suit) for clarity. We have cases to consider: zero extra draws (the starting three tiles already make a mentsu), one extra draw, and two extra draws. I'll test these scenarios in order, returning the smallest number that works.\n\nFirstly, if no draws are needed, it means we can form either a koutsu or a shuntsu with the existing three tiles. Koutsu is easy; are all the tiles identical? Shuntsu is slightly more complex, requiring all tiles to share the same suit and the numbers to be sequential. I'll check these conditions first, if either is true, we have the answer.\n\nSecondly, if one draw is needed, it means we have to find any \"new tile\" that, combined with the original three, creates a mentsu. With the 3 initial tiles, and a new one, we have to see if any three of the four, makes a set. This means checking combinations, and for a draw of one tile, we need a \"new tile\".\n\nThe core is iterating through the possibilities. To determine if a set of three tiles forms a mentsu, I'll need a helper function to analyze the combination of any three cards. Koutsu is straightforward: three identical cards. Shuntsu is slightly more complex, requiring same suit and sequential numbers.\n\nIf, after the one-draw check, no solution is found, I'm going to assume we need two draws. The logic behind it, since the problem allows any tiles to be drawn, two draws *should* always work. It is always possible to select two tiles such that a koutsu of these tiles, with a third draw, or one of the existing initial three, is made. So, I will assume a default of needing two draws.\n\nI'll build the code as follows:\n\n1.  Read input tiles, parse them into (number, suit).\n2.  Check for 0 draws: Is the initial three tiles already a mentsu?\n3.  Check for 1 draw. Try to find a tile that, with two existing tiles, makes a mentsu.\n4.  If not, assume 2 draws and return 2.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand, and the number of each type of tile she can draw is infinite.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of draws (0, 1, or 2).\n\nFirst, let's represent the tiles in a structured way. Each tile can be represented as a tuple `(number, suit)`, where `number` is an integer from 1 to 9 and `suit` is a character 'm', 'p', or 's'.\n\nLet the initial three tiles be `t1, t2, t3`.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nShe needs 0 draws if the initial three tiles `t1, t2, t3` already form a mentsu.\n*   **Koutsu Check**: Are all three tiles identical? `t1 == t2` and `t2 == t3`.\n*   **Shuntsu Check**: Are all three tiles of the same suit AND their numbers are sequential?\n    1.  Check if `t1.suit == t2.suit` and `t2.suit == t3.suit`.\n    2.  If suits are the same, get their numbers `n1, n2, n3`. Sort them: `min_n, mid_n, max_n`.\n    3.  Check if `min_n + 1 == mid_n` and `mid_n + 1 == max_n`.\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, we check if 1 draw is sufficient. This means drawing one tile `t_new` such that the hand `t1, t2, t3, t_new` contains a mentsu. A mentsu uses 3 tiles. So, we need to check if any three tiles from `t1, t2, t3, t_new` can form a mentsu. This implies `t_new` must complete a mentsu with two of the existing tiles, or with one of the existing tiles and another copy of itself (which is not possible since we draw only one `t_new`).\n\nMore specifically, with one draw, we can form a mentsu if:\n*   **Koutsu possibility**: Two of the initial tiles are identical. For example, if `t1 == t2`, we can draw another `t1` (or `t2`) to form `[t1, t1, t1]`.\n    *   To check this, count the frequency of each unique tile among `t1, t2, t3`. If any tile appears 2 or more times, we can draw one more of that tile to form a koutsu.\n*   **Shuntsu possibility**: Two of the initial tiles are of the same suit and can form a shuntsu with one additional tile.\n    *   Consider all pairs of tiles from `t1, t2, t3` (e.g., `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`).\n    *   For any pair `(tx, ty)`:\n        1.  If `tx.suit == ty.suit`:\n            *   Let their numbers be `nx` and `ny`. Sort them: `n_min, n_max`.\n            *   If `n_max - n_min == 1` (e.g., 2m, 3m): We need `(n_min - 1, suit)` (if `n_min > 1`) or `(n_max + 1, suit)` (if `n_max < 9`). Since at least one of these is always a valid tile (e.g., for 1m, 2m, we can draw 3m; for 8m, 9m, we can draw 7m), drawing one such tile completes a shuntsu.\n            *   If `n_max - n_min == 2` (e.g., 2m, 4m): We need `(n_min + 1, suit)`. This tile is always valid (e.g., 2m, 4m -> 3m). Drawing this tile completes a shuntsu.\n\nIf any of these conditions (koutsu or shuntsu with 1 draw) are met, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then the answer must be 2.\nThis is because we can always form a mentsu by drawing two tiles. For example, we can draw `1m` and `2m`. Our hand becomes `t1, t2, t3, 1m, 2m`. This hand contains the pair `1m, 2m`. If we were allowed a third draw, we could draw `3m` to complete `1m, 2m, 3m`.\nHowever, the problem says \"minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw\". If the answer is 2, it means after drawing two tiles, she wins.\nWe can always draw two tiles that complete a mentsu with one of the existing tiles, or form a mentsu among themselves.\nFor example, if we have `t1, t2, t3`:\n1.  We can draw `X` and `X` (e.g., `1m` and `1m`). The hand becomes `t1, t2, t3, X, X`. If any of `t1, t2, t3` is `X`, we have a koutsu `X, X, X`.\n2.  If none of `t1, t2, t3` is `X`, we have `t1, t2, t3, X, X`. We can't form a mentsu with just these 5 tiles. This means the argument for 2 draws being sufficient for any case must be stronger.\n\nA simpler argument for 2 draws being sufficient:\nWe can always choose to draw two tiles `X` and `Y` such that they, along with one of the initial tiles `t_i`, form a mentsu.\nFor example, if we have `t1 = (N, S)`, we can draw `(N, S)` and `(N, S)`. Our hand is `t1, t2, t3, (N, S), (N, S)`. Now we have three identical tiles `(N, S), (N, S), (N, S)`, forming a koutsu. This requires drawing 2 tiles.\nSince we can always choose to complete a koutsu with one of the tiles we already possess (by drawing two more copies of that tile), 2 draws are always sufficient if 0 or 1 draw isn't.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n1.  Parse the three input strings into `(number, suit)` tuples.\n2.  Sort the initial tiles to simplify checks for shuntsu (numbers must be sequential). Sorting should be done primarily by suit, then by number within the same suit. This helps group similar tiles.\n    For example, `(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')` can be sorted to `(9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p')`.\n3.  Apply the checks for 0 draws.\n4.  Apply the checks for 1 draw.\n5.  If neither 0 nor 1 draw suffices, print 2.\n\n**Example walkthrough for `3p 9m 2p`:**\nTiles: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`\n\n**0 Draws?**\n*   Koutsu: No, tiles are `(3, 'p')`, `(9, 'm')`, `(2, 'p')`. Not all identical.\n*   Shuntsu:\n    *   Suits: Not all 'p'. So no shuntsu.\nAnswer is not 0.\n\n**1 Draw?**\n*   **Koutsu possibility**:\n    *   Counts: `(3, 'p'): 1`, `(9, 'm'): 1`, `(2, 'p'): 1`. No tile appears 2 or more times. So, no koutsu with 1 draw.\n*   **Shuntsu possibility**:\n    *   Pairs:\n        *   `(3, 'p')` and `(9, 'm')`: Different suits. Skip.\n        *   `(3, 'p')` and `(2, 'p')`: Same suit 'p'. Numbers are 2, 3. `abs(3-2) == 1`.\n            *   Need `(2-1, 'p') = (1, 'p')` (valid, 1p exists) OR `(3+1, 'p') = (4, 'p')` (valid, 4p exists).\n            *   Since a valid tile exists (`1p` or `4p`), we can draw one tile to complete a shuntsu.\n            *   Return 1.\n\nThe output for `3p 9m 2p` is `1`, which matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_raw = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for t_str in tiles_raw:\n        tiles.append((int(t_str[0]), t_str[1]))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for easier shuntsu checking.\n    # Primary sort by suit, secondary by number.\n    # This groups tiles of the same suit together.\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # A mentsu can be a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence).\n    \n    # Check for Koutsu (3 identical tiles)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for Shuntsu (3 sequential tiles of the same suit)\n    # Tiles are already sorted by suit then number.\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]: # All same suit\n        nums = [tiles[0][0], tiles[1][0], tiles[2][0]]\n        # Check if numbers are sequential\n        if nums[0] + 1 == nums[1] and nums[1] + 1 == nums[2]:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # We need to form a mentsu with one extra tile.\n    # This means either:\n    # 1.
