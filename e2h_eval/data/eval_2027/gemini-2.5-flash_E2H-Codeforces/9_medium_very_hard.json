Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market.

    "thought": "**Knapsack with a Twist: Small Weights, Big Costs**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which boils down to a variation of the classic knapsack. We've got `n` souvenirs, each with a weight and a cost, and a maximum weight capacity `m`. The goal is to maximize the total cost of the chosen souvenirs without exceeding `m`. It's a constrained 0/1 knapsack, with the crucial detail that each item's weight is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nImmediately, my mind goes to the usual dynamic programming solution, `O(n*m)`, but with `n` and `m` being so large (100000 and 300000, respectively), that's a non-starter - way too slow!  The weight constraint `wi <= 3` is the key.  I can group the souvenirs by their weights: `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, and `costs_w3`.  To maximize the total cost, within each weight category, I should always pick the most expensive items first.  I'm thinking sorted lists and prefix sums here.\n\nLet's call the number of items with weight 1 `N1`, weight 2 `N2`, and weight 3 `N3`.  Then let `C1_i`, `C2_i`, and `C3_i` be the costs of the i-th most expensive item in each category.  I'll define prefix sums `P1[k]`, `P2[k]`, and `P3[k]` for each weight. Now, the problem becomes finding the optimal quantities `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` of each weight to maximize the total cost given the weight constraint: `1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m`.\n\nMy first instinct is to try a brute force approach by iterating all possible values for `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, and computing the max value. That would be O(m^3), again too slow. So, I must try something different. I could iterate over a range of `k3` from `0` to `min(N3, m/3)`, and optimize the sub-problem inside.\n\nThe subproblem is now this: with the given remaining capacity and fixed item counts for the weight 3 items, how to maximize `P1[k1] + P2[k2]` given `k1 + 2*k2 <= M`, and the bounds on k1 and k2.\nThis subproblem is a 2-variable knapsack, but here lies the crux of the optimization. Can I iterate through k2 to solve?\n\nThe problem now turns into maximizing `P1[k1] + P2[k2]`.  If I fix `k2` and derive `k1` from the capacity constraint, I get a linear relation to maximize two prefix sums. This sounds like an optimization problem, but it seems there's no simple closed form to calculate this maximum value.\n\nThis part is now the bottleneck, as I have an O(m^2) complexity with just a simple brute force, but is there a cleverer way? I have to exploit the \"weights are small\". So it's related to the classic dynamic programming technique for the small weight Knapsack problem.  I can set up DP to calculate the max cost for a particular weight given available items. `dp[w]` = maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nThen, I iterate k2 to update the `dp[w]` as such. However, computing all dp values for `w` from 0 to m makes this complexity also O(m^2).\n\nI have to reduce the complexity somewhere, the \"small weights\" condition must be useful.\n\nLet's carefully analyze the expression I want to maximize: `P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, M - 2*k2)]`. Prefix sums of sorted values means that P1 and P2 are concave. So `P2[k2]` is a concave function, while `P1[min(N1, M - 2*k2)]` is also concave as long as we fix N1 and change k2. This means their sum isn't necessarily something special that can be optimized efficiently.\n\nIf I fix an item type, does that give an advantage? No obvious patterns emerge.\n\nGiven that I'm iterating `k3` and then k2, I am solving this in O(m^2) time, where m is the capacity. So that's too slow. Perhaps I could precompute some",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs to maximize total cost, subject to a total weight constraint `m`. We are given `n` souvenirs, each with weight `wi` and cost `ci`. The crucial constraint is that `wi` can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThis is a variation of the 0/1 knapsack problem. A standard `O(n*m)` DP approach would be too slow given `n=10^5` and `m=3*10^5`. However, the small range of weights (`wi <= 3`) allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nFirst, we separate the souvenirs by their weights and sort them by cost in descending order. This is because to maximize total cost, we should always pick the most expensive items first for any given weight category.\nLet `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, `costs_w3` be lists of costs for souvenirs with weights 1, 2, and 3 respectively, sorted in descending order.\nWe can then precompute prefix sums for these sorted costs:\n`P1[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive souvenirs of weight 1.\n`P2[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive souvenirs of weight 2.\n`P3[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive souvenirs of weight 3.\nThese prefix sum arrays will have lengths `N1+1`, `N2+1`, `N3+1` respectively, where `N1, N2, N3` are the counts of items for each weight.\n\nLet `k1, k2, k3` be the number of items chosen with weights 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We want to maximize `P1[k1] + P2[k2] + P3[k3]` subject to `1*k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m`.\n\nA common approach for knapsack with small item weights is to iterate over one or two item types and use dynamic programming for the remaining types.\nLet's iterate over `k3`, the number of items of weight 3.\n`k3` can range from `0` to `min(N3, m/3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n1. The cost from weight 3 items is `P3[k3]`.\n2. The weight used is `3 * k3`.\n3. The remaining capacity is `m' = m - 3 * k3`.\n4. We now need to maximize `P1[k1] + P2[k2]` subject to `k1 + 2*k2 <= m'`, `0 <= k1 <= N1`, `0 <= k2 <= N2`.\n\nThe subproblem (maximizing `P1[k1] + P2[k2]` for a given `m'`) needs to be solved efficiently for all possible `m'` values. Let `dp[w]` be the maximum cost for exactly weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(N2, w/2)} (P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)])`.\nA naive computation of `dp[w]` for all `w` from `0` to `m` would take `O(m^2)`, which is too slow.\n\nWe can optimize the computation of `dp[w]` using a sliding window maximum (deque) approach.\nLet `j = w - 2*k2`. Then `k2 = (w-j)/2`.\nWe need to maximize `P2[(w-j)/2] + P1[min(N1, j)]` over `j` such that `j` has the same parity as `w`, `0 <= j <= w`, and `0 <= (w-j)/2 <= N2`.\nThe `dp[w]` can be split into `dp_even[w]` (for even `w`) and `dp_odd[w]` (for odd `w`).\nFor `dp_even[w]`, we consider `j` values with the same parity as `w` (even `j`).\nFor `dp_odd[w]`, we consider `j` values with the same parity as `w` (odd `j`).\n\nLet's compute `dp_even[w]` for even `w`:\n`dp_even[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(N2, w/2)} (P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)])`.\nLet `idx_j = w - 2*k2`. Then `k2 = (w - idx_j) / 2`.\n`dp_even[w] = max_{idx_j \\text{ even, } 0 <= idx_j <= w, (w-idx_j)/2 <= N2} (P2[(w-idx_j)/2] + P1[min(N1, idx_j)])`.\nThis can be rewritten as `dp_even[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(N2, w/2)} (P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)])`.\nFor fixed `w`, we are looking for `max(P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)])`.\n\nLet `f(k2, w) = P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)]`.\nThe values `P1[k]` and `P2[k]` are concave (prefix sums of non-increasing values).\n`P1[min(N1, x)]` is also concave.\nThe function `P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)]` is a concave function of `w - 2*k2`, composed with a decreasing linear function of `k2`. This makes it a convex function of `k2`.\nWe are maximizing `P2[k2]` (concave) + `P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)]` (convex). The sum of a concave and a convex function is not necessarily unimodal.\n\nHowever, we can compute `dp[w]` for all `w` in `O(M)` time.\n`dp[w]` is the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp[w] = max(dp[w-1] + C1[k1_used+1], dp[w-2] + C2[k2_used+1])` is not directly applicable because `k1_used` and `k2_used` are not part of the `dp` state.\nThe correct way to compute `dp[w]` is to iterate `w` from `1` to `m`.\n`dp[w]` represents the maximum cost for *at most* weight `w`.\n`dp[w] = dp[w-1]` (optionally don't take any more items).\nThen, consider adding a weight 1 item: `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-1] + cost_w1_item)`.\nConsider adding a weight 2 item: `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-2] + cost_w2_item)`.\nThis is still not correct because `cost_w1_item` depends on how many weight 1 items we've already taken.\n\nThe problem can be solved by iterating over `k1` (number of items of weight 1) and `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\nFor each pair `(k1, k2)`:\n  1. Calculate current weight `W = k1 + 2*k2`.\n  2. Calculate current cost `C = P1[k1] + P2[k2]`.\n  3. If `W > m`, skip.\n  4. The remaining capacity is `m_rem = m - W`.\n  5. The maximum number of weight 3 items we can take is `k3_max = min(N3, m_rem // 3)`.\n  6. The total cost for this `(k1, k2)` pair is `C + P3[k3_max]`.\n  7. Update the overall maximum cost.\n\nThe range of `k1` is `[0, min(N1, m)]`.\nThe range of `k2` is `[0, min(N2, m/2)]`.\nIterating over all `(k1, k2)` pairs would be `O(m * m/2) = O(m^2)`, which is `(3*10^5)^2 = 9*10^{10}` operations, still too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation for `w_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}` is that we can iterate over the number of items of weight 1 and 2, but only for a limited number of items, and then use a DP for the rest.\nAlternatively, we can iterate over `k1` from `0` to `min(N1, M)` and `k2` from `0` to `min(N2, M/2)`.\nThis is still `O(M^2)`.\n\nLet's re-examine the `dp[w]` calculation for items of weight 1 and 2:\n`dp[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(N2, w/2)} (P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)])`.\nThis is `max_{k2} (A[k2] + B[w - 2k2])` where `A[k2] = P2[k2]` and `B[x] = P1[min(N1, x)]`.\nThis can be computed in `O(M)` using a specific optimization.\nFor a fixed `k2`, we need to compute `P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)]`.\nLet `w = 2k_2 + k_1`.\nWe can compute `dp[w]` for all `w` from `0` to `m` in `O(m)` time.\nThe key is to observe that `P1[min(N1, x)]` is `P1[x]` for `x <= N1` and `P1[N1]` for `x > N1`.\nLet `f_12[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`f_12[w]` can be computed by iterating `k1` from `0` to `min(N1, w)`.\nFor each `k1`, we use `k1` weight and `P1[k1]` cost. Remaining weight `w - k1`.\nWe can take `k2 = min(N2, (w - k1)//2)` items of weight 2.\nSo, `f_12[w] = max_{0 <= k1 <= min(N1, w)} (P1[k1] + P2[min(N2, (w - k1)//2)])`.\nThis is still `O(M^2)`.\n\nA more efficient way to compute `f_12[w]` (or any such `f_xy[w]`) is required.\nLet's consider the number of items of weight 1, `k1`.\nThe number of items of weight 2, `k2`.\nThe number of items of weight 3, `k3`.\nThe total number of items `K = k1 + k2 + k3`.\nThe maximum possible `K` is `m` (if all items are weight 1).\nThe minimum possible `K` is `m/3` (if all items are weight 3).\nThe sum `k1 + 2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m`.\n\nLet's fix the number of items of weight 1, `k1`.\nThen `k1` ranges from `0` to `min(N1, m)`.\nFor each `k1`, we have `P1[k1]` cost and `k1` weight used.\nRemaining capacity `m' = m - k1`.\nWe need to solve for `max(P2[k2] + P3[k3])` subject to `2*k2 + 3*k3 <= m'`.\nThis is the same subproblem, but with weights 2 and 3. Let `f_23[w]` be the max cost for weight `w` using items of weight 2 and 3.\n`f_23[w] = max_{0 <= k3 <= min(N3, w/3)} (P3[k3] + P2[min(N2, (w - 3*k3)//2)])`.\nIf we can compute `f_23[w]` for all `w` in `O(M)` time, then the overall solution would be `O(M)`.\n\nHow to compute `f_23[w]` for all `w` in `O(M)`?\n`f_23[w] = max_{k3} (P3[k3] + P2[min(N2, (w - 3*k3)//2)])`.\nLet `j = (w - 3*k3)//2`. This means `w - 3*k3` must be even.\nSo `w` and `3*k3` must have the same parity. This implies `w` and `k3` must have the same parity.\nWe can compute `f_23_even[w]` for even `w` and `f_23_odd[w]` for odd `w` separately.\nFor `f_23_even[w]`, we consider `k3` to be even.\nFor `f_23_odd[w]`, we consider `k3` to be odd.\n\nConsider `f_23_even[w]` for even `w`. We iterate `k3` which is even.\n`f_23_even[w] = max_{k3 \\text{ even, } 0 <= k3 <= min(N3, w/3)} (P3[k3] + P2[min(N2, (w - 3*k3)//2)])`.\nLet `k3 = 2k_3'`. Then `w - 3*(2k_3') = w - 6k_3'`.\n`f_23_even[w] = max_{0 <= k_3' <= min(N3//2, w/6)} (P3[2k_3'] + P2[min(N2, (w - 6k_3')//2)])`.\nLet `j = (w - 6k_3')//2`. Then `k_3' = (w - 2j)//6`.\nThis is a `max(A[k_3'] + B[j])` form.\nThis is a standard \"knapsack with small weights\" problem, which can be solved in `O(M)` using a deque for each remainder class modulo `W_max`.\nHere `W_max = 3`. So we need to compute `dp[w]` for `w \\pmod 1`, `w \\pmod 2`, `w \\pmod 3`.\n\nLet `dp[w]` be the maximum cost for exactly weight `w`.\n`dp[w] = -infinity`\n`dp[0] = 0`\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `dp[w] = dp[w-1]` (if we don't add item of weight 1)\n  `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-2] + C2_next)` (if we add item of weight 2)\n  `dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w-3] + C3_next)` (if we add item of weight 3)\nThis is still not correct because `C_next` depends on how many items we've used.\n\nThe correct `O(M)` approach for `dp[w]` for two item types `(w_A, C_A)` and `(w_B, C_B)` with limited counts `N_A, N_B`:\n`dp[w]` = max cost for weight `w`.\nInitialize `dp` array of size `m+1` to `-infinity`, `dp[0]=0`.\nFor `k_A` from `0` to `N_A`:\n  `current_cost_A = P_A[k_A]`\n  `current_weight_A = k_A * w_A`\n  If `current_weight_A > m`, break.\n  `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight_A`\n  We need to fill `remaining_capacity` with `B` items.\n  The maximum cost for `remaining_capacity` using `B` items is `P_B[min(N_B, remaining_capacity / w_B)]`.\n  `total_cost = current_cost_A + P_B[min(N_B, remaining_capacity / w_B)]`.\n  Update overall max.\nThis is `O(M)` if `w_A` is 1. If `w_A` is 2, it's `O(M/2)`.\nThis is the `O(M)` solution to the subproblem `f_xy[w]`.\n\nSo, the overall strategy:\n1. Parse input, categorize items by weight, sort costs descending.\n2. Compute prefix sums `P1`, `P2`, `P3`.\n3. Initialize `max_total_cost = 0`.\n4. Iterate `k3` from `0` to `min(N3, m/3)`:\n   a. `current_cost_3 = P3[k3]`\n   b. `current_weight_3 = 3 * k3`\n   c. `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight_3`\n   d. If `remaining_capacity < 0`, break (or continue, but `m/3` ensures it's non-negative initially).\n   e. Now, we need to maximize `P1[k1] + P2[k2]` s.t. `k1 + 2*k2 <= remaining_capacity`.\n      This is `f_12[remaining_capacity]`.\n      `f_12[w]` can be computed efficiently.\n      For a given `w` (which is `remaining_capacity`), we iterate `k2` from `0` to `min(N2, w/2)`.\n      `k1_max = min(N1, w - 2*k2)`.\n      `f_12_val = P2[k2] + P1[k1_max]`.\n      We need to find the maximum `f_12_val` over all valid `k2`.\n      This inner loop for `k2` takes `O(w)` time. If we do this for each `k3`, it's `O(M^2)`.\n      To make it `O(M)`: precompute `f_12[w]` for all `w` from `0` to `m`.\n      `f_12[w]` can be computed in `O(M)` time using a sliding window maximum over two arrays.\n      Let `dp_12[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n      `dp_12[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(N2, w/2)} (P2[k2] + P1[min(N1, w - 2*k2)])`.\n      This is `max_{k2} (P2[k2] + P1_capped[w - 2*k2])`.\n      This is a max-plus convolution. It can be computed for all `w` in `O(M)` using a deque.\n      For each `r` in `[0, 1]` (for `w \\pmod 2`):\n        Iterate `w_prime` from `0` to `(m-r)//2`.\n        `w = 2*w_prime + r`.\n        We need to compute `max_{k2} (P2[k2] + P1_capped[w - 2*k2])`.\n        Let `j = w - 2*k2`. Then `k2 = (w-j)/2`.\n        `max_{j \\text{ s.t. } j \\equiv r \\pmod 2} (P2[(w-j)/2] + P1_capped[j])`.\n        This is a sliding window maximum problem for each `r`.\n        For fixed `r`, let `j = 2x+r`. Then `k2 = (w-(2x+r))/2 = (w-r)/2 - x`.\n        We want `max_x (P2[(w-r)/2 - x] + P1_capped[2x+r])`.\n        Let `i = (w-r)/2`. Then `max_x (P2[i-x] + P1_capped[2x+r])`.\n        This is `max_x (A[i-x] + B[x])` which is indeed a sliding window max.\n        The length of the window is `N2`.\n        So, `dp_12` table can be computed in `O(M)` time.\n\n5. After computing `dp_12[w]` for all `w` from `0` to `m`:\n   `max_total_cost = 0`\n   For `k3` from `0` to `min(N3, m/3)`:\n     `current_cost_3 = P3[k3]`\n     `current_weight_3 = 3 * k3`\n     `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight_3`\n     `max_total_cost = max(max_total_cost, current_cost_3 + dp_12[remaining_capacity])`.\n\nTotal time complexity:\n- Sorting costs: `O(N log N)`.\n- Prefix sums: `O(N)`.\n- Computing `dp_12` table: `O(M)`.\n- Outer loop for `k3`: `O(M/3)` iterations.

Compute `dp_12[w]` for `w` from `0` to `M`. `dp_12[w]` is the maximum cost for exactly weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n   This can be done in `O(M)` using two deques (one for `w` even, one for `w` odd).\n   For `r` in `[0, 1]`: (remainder for `w \\pmod 2`)\n     `deque_q = collections.deque()`\n     For `j` from `0` to `min(N2, (M-r)//2)`: (number of weight 2 items)\n       `w = r + 2*j`\n       `val = P2[j] - P1[min(N1, w)]`\n       While `deque_q` and `deque_q[-1][1] <= val`:\n         `deque_q.pop()`\n       `deque_q.append((j, val))`\n       While `deque_q` and `deque_q[0][0] < j - N1`: # This window size is related to N1 items\n         `deque_q.popleft()`\n       `dp_12[w] = P1[min(N1, w)] + deque_q[0][1]`\n   This is the `O(M)` part.\n3.
