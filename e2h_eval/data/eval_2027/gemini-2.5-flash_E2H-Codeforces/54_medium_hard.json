Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Pythonic Pursuit of Optimal Angles in Regular Polygons**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is this: I need a Python script to find the perfect three vertices in a regular n-gon. The goal? To make the angle formed by these vertices as close as possible to a given angle 'a'.  The vertices are neatly numbered 1 to n in a clockwise fashion.\n\nMy mind immediately starts dissecting the geometry of a regular n-gon. I know it's inscribable in a circle, and all the vertices sit snugly on that circle. Each side of the n-gon subtends a central angle of 360/n degrees. So, I need to find three points on the circle, where one is a \"vertex\" of our target angle.\n\nI figured, let's fix one vertex as our starting point, 'v2', and without losing any generality, let's make it vertex number 1.  Then, the remaining two vertices, 'v1' and 'v3', are the ones we need to pinpoint.\n\nThe angle 'v1-v2-v3' is the inscribed angle, remember? And the inscribed angle is always half the measure of the central angle that captures the same arc. The relevant arc is the one between 'v1' and 'v3' *that doesn't* include 'v2'. This is the core insight. The size of this arc, and thus the angle, depends on how many sides (or \"steps\") separate 'v1' and 'v3' in the n-gon.\n\nI initially got a little mixed up by directly calculating the number of steps. But then, it became clear: let's fix v2 as vertex 1.  So, v1 could be vertex `1 + i` and `v3` could be vertex `1 + j` (modulo n) where `i` and `j` are indices. The number of 'steps' is essentially the absolute difference between i and j. No, that is not entirely correct, we have to consider the arc not passing through v2. The relevant thing to determine the angle is the value of `|i-j|`.\n\nThen it clicked. Let's make it simpler, with `v2` as vertex `1`, and then `v1` and `v3` are any other distinct vertices `k` and `m`. These vertices must be different from `v2`. So the angle is defined by the number of steps.  The *not-v2* arc is what matters.\n\nIf `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `j` and `v3` is `k`. The steps from `i` to `j` are `(j-i+n)%n`. This gives me the crucial number of edges between the vertices. The problem is that, it should be the edges along the arc that doesn't contain `v2`.\n\nLet's assume `v2` is vertex 1. I am fixing it for easier calculation. Then, the number of steps from `v2` to `v1` will be `s1`, and from `v2` to `v3` will be `s2`. So `v1` is vertex `1+s1`, and `v3` is vertex `1+s2`. The important thing is that `s1` and `s2` are distinct. They are also numbers in `[1, n-1]`.\nThe central angle of one side of the polygon is `360/n`. The inscribed angle is half of it. The key to the solution is `|s1-s2|`. This means that the size of arc `v1v3` (not containing `v2`) is `|s1-s2|` steps/edges.\nAnd therefore, the inscribed angle is `|s1-s2| * (180/n)`.\n\nTo minimize the error, I need to figure out `k` such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is as small as possible. This has become a straightforward search!  I can cycle through possible `k` values, which range from 1 to n-2. For each `k`, I calculate the resulting angle `k * (180/n)`. I then compare the absolute difference between this angle and the target angle 'a'.  The winning `k` is the one that gives me the smallest difference.\n\nI start with an initial `min_diff` of infinity and an invalid `best_k` of -1. I loop from 1 to `n-2`. I compute the current_angle for the given `k`, then compute the difference, and if this difference is smaller than `min_diff`, I update it and update",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these vertices, numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\n1.  **Inscribed Angles:** A regular n-gon can be inscribed in a circle. Any angle formed by three vertices of the polygon, with the middle vertex on the circle, is an inscribed angle.\n2.  **Central Angle per Edge:** The central angle subtended by each side (edge) of the regular n-gon is `360 / n` degrees.\n3.  **Inscribed Angle Formula:** An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n4.  **Angle `v1-v2-v3`:** Let `v2` be the vertex of the angle. The angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1v3` (the arc that does *not* contain `v2`).\n    The measure of this arc is determined by the number of edges of the polygon between `v1` and `v3` along this arc.\n    If there are `k` edges along the arc `v1v3`, then the central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360 / n)`.\n    Therefore, the inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` is `(1/2) * k * (360 / n) = k * (180 / n)`.\n\n**Possible Values for `k`**\n\n*   `k` represents the number of edges between `v1` and `v3` along the arc not containing `v2`.\n*   Since `v1`, `v2`, `v3` must be distinct vertices, `k` must be at least 1.\n*   The maximum number of edges along an arc that doesn't contain `v2` is `n-2`. For instance, if `v2` is vertex 1, `v1` is vertex 2, and `v3` is vertex `n`, the arc `v1v3` (not containing `v2`) spans `n-2` edges. This forms the internal angle of the polygon.\n*   So, `k` can be any integer from `1` to `n-2`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal Angle**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` such that `|k * (180 / n) - a|` is minimized.\n\nLet `base_angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\nWe are looking for `k` that minimizes `|k * base_angle_unit - a|`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `a`.\n2.  Calculate `base_angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\n3.  Initialize `min_diff` to a very large number (e.g., `float('inf')`) and `best_k` to `-1`.\n4.  Iterate `k` from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive):\n    a.  Calculate `current_angle = k * base_angle_unit`.\n    b.  Calculate `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    c.  If `diff < min_diff`, update `min_diff = diff` and `best_k = k`.\n    (If `diff == min_diff`, we can keep the current `best_k`, as any optimal solution is acceptable).\n5.  After the loop, `best_k` will hold the value that produces an angle closest to `a`.\n\n**Choosing Vertices `v1, v2, v3`**\n\nOnce `best_k` is found, we need to pick three distinct vertices.\nA simple and consistent choice is:\n*   Let `v2` be vertex `1`.\n*   Let `v1` be vertex `2`. This means `v1` is 1 step (edge) away from `v2` in clockwise direction.\n*   Let `v3` be vertex `2 + best_k`. This means `v3` is `1 + best_k` steps away from `v2` in clockwise direction.\n\nLet's verify this choice:\n*   `v2 = 1`.\n*   `v1 = 2`.\n*   `v3 = 2 + best_k`.\n\nThe number of steps from `v2` to `v1` is `s1 = 1`.\nThe number of steps from `v2` to `v3` is `s2 = 1 + best_k`.\nThe difference in steps `|s1 - s2| = |1 - (1 + best_k)| = |-best_k| = best_k`.\nThis matches our formula for the angle `k * (180 / n)`.\n\n**Distinctness and Validity of Vertices:**\n*   `v1=2` is distinct from `v2=1` (since `n >= 3`).\n*   `v3=2+best_k`. Since `best_k >= 1`, `v3 >= 3`. Thus `v3` is distinct from `v1=2` and `v2=1`.\n*   The vertices must be within `[1, n]`. `1` and `2` are valid. For `v3`, `best_k` is at most `n-2`, so `v3 = 2 + best_k <= 2 + (n-2) = n`. Thus, `v3` is also within the valid range `[1, n]`.\n\nFinally, print `v1, v2, v3` in that order. So, `2 1 (2 + best_k)`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=67):**\n1.  `n=4, a=67`.\n2.  `base_angle_unit = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n3.  `min_diff = inf`, `best_k = -1`.\n4.  Loop `k` from `1` to `n-2 = 2`:\n    *   **k = 1:**\n        *   `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n        *   `diff = abs(45.0 - 67) = 22.0`.\n        *   `22.0 < inf`, so `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_k = 1`.\n    *   **k = 2:**\n        *   `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n        *   `diff = abs(90.0 - 67) = 23.0`.\n        *   `23.0` is not less than `22.0`. `min_diff` and `best_k` remain unchanged.\n5.  Loop ends. `best_k = 1`.\n6.  Output: `2 1 (2 + 1)` which is `2 1 3`.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough as `n` up to `10^5` means `10^5` iterations, which is acceptable for competitive programming (typically up to `10^8` operations).
