The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Radio Towers Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Radio Towers\" problem. My understanding is this: we've got a line of $n+2$ towns, numbered 0 to $n+1$. The interesting part is that towns 1 through $n$ can build radio towers, each with a 50% chance. These towers are the key.  Each tower has a signal power, a value from 1 to *n*.\n\nHere's where the constraints kick in. Towns 0 and $n+1$ are off-limits, no signals there.  Each of towns 1 through *n* *must* receive a signal from *exactly one* tower.  The tower at town *i* with power *p* covers the range *i - p + 1* to *i + p - 1*. Or put another way, towns *c* such that *|c - i| < p*.\n\nNow, the core of the problem is figuring out the probability that we *can* successfully assign powers to the towers, given this setup. This means finding powers that obey the constraints.  We're looking for the total probability, modulo 998244353.\n\nThinking about the constraints more deeply:\n\nLet's call the set of towns that *actually* build towers 'S'. For each tower in 'S', we get to choose its power. This means each tower location *i* must have a power *p<sub>i</sub>* within the range [1, *n*].\n\nFor town 0, it *cannot* be covered by any tower. So, if we place a tower at position *i*, it must be that town *i* and its power *p<sub>i</sub>* have the relationship that $i - p_i \\ge 0$, or that $p_i \\le i$.\n\nFor town *n+1*, also must *not* be covered. With the same logic, it must be the case that $n+1 \\ge i + p_i$, therefore, $p_i \\le n + 1 - i$.\n\nThis creates a tight bound on the allowable powers for a tower at location *i*: $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This seems key to simplifying the search. I need to make sure I consider this bound when developing an algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given $n$ potential tower locations ($1, \\dots, n$), where each tower is built with probability $1/2$, we can assign signal powers $p_i \\in [1, n]$ to the built towers such that:\n1.  Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2.  Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For a tower at town $i$ with signal power $p_i$, it covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means towns $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$ are covered.\n\n**Constraint 1 Analysis:**\n*   Town $0$ receives no signal: For any tower $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$, $0$ must not be in $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$. Since $i \\ge 1$ and $p_i \\ge 1$, $i+p_i \\ge 2$, so $0 < i+p_i$. This implies we must have $0 \\le i-p_i$, or $p_i \\le i$.\n*   Town $n+1$ receives no signal: For any tower $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$, $n+1$ must not be in $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$. Since $i \\le n$ and $p_i \\ge 1$, $i-p_i \\le n-1$, so $n+1 > i-p_i$. This implies we must have $n+1 \\ge i+p_i$, or $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n*   Combining these, for any tower $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n    The maximum possible power for a tower at $i$ is $P_i = \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This power covers towns from $i-P_i+1$ to $i+P_i-1$.\n    Notice that $i-P_i+1 \\ge i-i+1 = 1$ and $i+P_i-1 \\le i+(n+1-i)-1 = n$. So, any tower $i$ with power $P_i$ will cover a range of towns entirely within $[1, n]$.\n\n**Constraint 2 Analysis:**\nTowns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one tower. This is the crucial part.\nConsider the towns $1, \\dots, n$. Each must be covered by exactly one tower.\nLet $L_i = i-P_i+1$ and $R_i = i+P_i-1$. This is the maximum range a tower at $i$ can cover while satisfying Constraint 1.\nThe length of this range is $R_i - L_i + 1 = (i+P_i-1) - (i-P_i+1) + 1 = 2P_i-1$.\nIf $i \\le (n+1)/2$, then $P_i = i$, so $L_i = 1$, $R_i = 2i-1$.\nIf $i > (n+1)/2$, then $P_i = n+1-i$, so $L_i = 2i-n$, $R_i = n$.\n\nThis structure implies that for a valid assignment of powers to exist, the set of covered towns must form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis is a known pattern related to \"perfect tilings\" or \"non-overlapping intervals\".\nA configuration of built towers $S$ is valid if and only if:\n1.  For any $i \\in S$, $i \\ne 1$ and $i \\ne n$. (This is not true. $i=1$ or $i=n$ can be valid.)\n2.  If $i \\in S$, then $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$. (This is also not true. For $n=2$, towers at $1,2$ is valid.)\n\nLet's re-examine the example $n=5$. Towers at $2, 4, 5$.\n*   Town $2$: $P_2 = \\min(2, 5+1-2) = \\min(2,4) = 2$. Max range is $(2-2, 2+2) = (0,4)$, covering $1,2,3$.\n*   Town $4$: $P_4 = \\min(4, 5+1-4) = \\min(4,2) = 2$. Max range is $(4-2, 4+2) = (2,6)$, covering $3,4,5$.\n*   Town $5$: $P_5 = \\min(5, 5+1-5) = \\min(5,1) = 1$. Max range is $(5-1, 5+1) = (4,6)$, covering $5$.\n\nExample given: $n=5$, towers in $2,4,5$.\nSet $p_2=2$, $p_4=1$, $p_5=1$.\n*   Tower $2$ with $p_2=2$ covers $1,2,3$.\n*   Tower $4$ with $p_4=1$ covers $4$.\n*   Tower $5$ with $p_5=1$ covers $5$.\nThis covers $1,2,3,4,5$ uniquely. This is a valid configuration.\n\nThe condition for a set of towers $S$ to be valid is that the towns $1, \\dots, n$ can be partitioned into disjoint intervals, where each interval $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ is covered by *exactly one* tower $i \\in S$.\nThis means that if we have towers $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ in $S$, then we can choose powers $p_{i_j}$ such that:\n$(i_1-p_{i_1}, i_1+p_{i_1}) \\cup (i_2-p_{i_2}, i_2+p_{i_2}) \\cup \\dots \\cup (i_k-p_{i_k}, i_k+p_{i_k})$ is a partition of $(0, n+1)$.\nThis implies that $i_1-p_{i_1} = 0$, $i_k+p_{i_k} = n+1$, and for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nAlso, each $p_{i_j}$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n\nLet $x_j = i_j - p_{i_j}$ and $y_j = i_j + p_{i_j}$.\nThe conditions become:\n$x_1=0$, $y_k=n+1$.\n$y_j = x_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nThis means the intervals are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_k, y_k)$, which are $(0, y_1), (y_1, y_2), \\dots, (y_{k-1}, n+1)$.\nFor each tower $i_j$, we have $p_{i_j} = (y_j - x_j)/2$.\nSo $i_j = (x_j+y_j)/2$. This means $x_j$ and $y_j$ must have the same parity.\nAlso, $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ means $y_j - x_j \\ge 2$.\nAnd $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ means $y_j-x_j \\le 2i_j$ and $y_j-x_j \\le 2(n+1-i_j)$.\nThe second condition for $p_{i_j}$ is $y_j-x_j \\le 2(n+1-i_j) \\implies y_j-x_j \\le 2(n+1 - (x_j+y_j)/2) \\implies y_j-x_j \\le 2(n+1) - x_j - y_j \\implies 2y_j \\le 2(n+1) \\implies y_j \\le n+1$. This is already satisfied by $y_k=n+1$ and $y_j < y_{j+1}$.\nThe first condition $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ is $y_j-x_j \\le 2i_j \\implies y_j-x_j \\le x_j+y_j \\implies 0 \\le 2x_j \\implies x_j \\ge 0$. This is satisfied by $x_1=0$ and $x_{j+1}=y_j \\ge y_1 \\ge x_1+2 = 2$.\n\nSo, the conditions simplify to:\n1.  There must exist a sequence of integers $0 = y_0 < y_1 < \\dots < y_k = n+1$ such that $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ have the same parity for all $j=0, \\dots, k-1$. (This implies $y_j$ and $j$ have the same parity).\n2.  For each $j=0, \\dots, k-1$, the town $i_{j+1} = (y_j+y_{j+1})/2$ must have a tower built.\n3.  The power $p_{i_{j+1}} = (y_{j+1}-y_j)/2$ must be at least $1$. This is guaranteed by $y_{j+1} > y_j$.\n\nThe condition that $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ have the same parity means $y_{j+1}-y_j$ must be even.\nThis means $p_{i_{j+1}}$ must be an integer.\nThe sequence $y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_k$ must satisfy $y_0=0, y_k=n+1$, and $y_{j+1}-y_j$ is an even integer $\\ge 2$.\nLet $i_j = (y_{j-1}+y_j)/2$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$. These are the towns where towers must be built.\nThe set of towns $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ must be exactly the set of built towers.\nThis implies that for any $x \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$, no tower is built at $x$.\n\nConsider the sequence $y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_k$.\n$y_0=0$. $y_k=n+1$.\n$y_1$ must be an even integer $\\ge 2$. $i_1 = y_1/2$.\n$y_2$ must be an even integer $\\ge y_1+2$. $i_2 = (y_1+y_2)/2$.\n...\n$y_k=n+1$. So $n+1$ must be an even integer. This means $n$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is even, $n+1$ is odd. Then $y_k$ is odd. But $y_0=0$ is even.\nIf $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ must have the same parity, then $y_j$ and $j$ must have the same parity.\nSo $y_k$ must have the same parity as $k$.\nIf $n$ is even, $n+1$ is odd. So $y_k$ is odd. This means $k$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is odd, $n+1$ is even. So $y_k$ is even. This means $k$ must be even.\n\nThis is a crucial observation: The problem statement says $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ must have same parity, which means $i_j$ must be an integer.\nThe problem is actually about $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ having the same parity, because $i_j = (y_j+y_{j+1})/2$.\nIf $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ have different parities, $(y_j+y_{j+1})/2$ is not an integer. This is impossible.\nSo $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ must always have the same parity.\nThis means $y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_k$ must all have the same parity.\nSince $y_0=0$ (even), all $y_j$ must be even.\nThis means $y_k=n+1$ must be even.\nTherefore, if $n$ is even, $n+1$ is odd, and no such sequence $y_j$ exists.\nIn this case, the probability is $0$.\n\nLet's re-check the $n=2$ example (output $1/4$). $n=2$ is even. This contradicts my logic.\nWhat did I misunderstand?\nThe towns are $0, \\dots, n+1$. A tower at $i$ with power $p$ covers $c$ s.t. $|c-i|<p$.\nThis means $c \\in (i-p, i+p)$.\nThe condition is that $0$ and $n+1$ are not covered.\n$0 \\notin (i-p, i+p) \\implies p \\le i$.\n$n+1 \\notin (i-p, i+p) \\implies p \\le n+1-i$.\nSo $p \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nThe towns $1, \\dots, n$ must be covered exactly once.\nThis means the set of intervals $C_i = (i-p_i, i+p_i)$ for $i \\in S$ must partition $(0, n+1)$.\nLet $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of built towers, with $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\nThen we must have $i_1-p_{i_1} = 0$, $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, and $i_k+p_{i_k} = n+1$.\nLet $x_j = i_j-p_{i_j}$ and $y_j = i_j+p_{i_j}$.\nThen $x_1=0$, $y_j=x_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, and $y_k=n+1$.\nFrom $i_j = (x_j+y_j)/2$ and $p_{i_j} = (y_j-x_j)/2$:\n1. $x_j, y_j$ must have the same parity so $i_j$ is an integer.\n2. $y_j-x_j \\ge 2$ so $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$.\n3. $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n   $p_{i_j} \\le i_j \\implies (y_j-x_j)/2 \\le (x_j+y_j)/2 \\implies y_j-x_j \\le x_j+y_j \\implies 0 \\le 2x_j \\implies x_j \\ge 0$. This is satisfied since $x_1=0$ and $x_{j+1}=y_j \\ge x_j+2$.\n   $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j \\implies (y_j-x_j)/2 \\le n+1-(x_j+y_j)/2 \\implies y_j-x_j \\le 2(n+1)-(x_j+y_j) \\implies 2y_j \\le 2(n+1) \\implies y_j \\le n+1$. This is satisfied since $y_k=n+1$ and $y_j < y_{j+1}$.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n1. $x_1=0$.\n2. $y_k=n+1$.\n3. $y_j=x_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n4. For each $j \\in [1, k]$, $x_j$ and $y_j$ must have the same parity.\n5. For each $j \\in [1, k]$, $y_j-x_j \\ge 2$.\n\nFrom (1), $x_1=0$. From (4), $y_1$ must be even.\nFrom (3), $x_2=y_1$. From (4), $y_2$ must have the same parity as $y_1$, so $y_2$ is even.\nBy induction, all $x_j$ and $y_j$ must be even.\nThis means $y_k=n+1$ must be even.\nSo $n$ must be odd.\n\nMy logic is consistent. For $n=2$ (even), the probability should be $0$.\nHowever, the example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$, which is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThis means my interpretation of \"signal from a tower ... reaches every city $c$ such that $|c-i|<p$\" is wrong.\nWhat if it means $c \\in [i-p+1, i+p-1]$? This is the standard interpretation for integer coordinates.\nThe text says \"every city $c$ such that $|c-i|<p$\". This is an open interval $(i-p, i+p)$.\nThe cities are $0, 1, \\dots, n+1$.\nIf $n=2$, towns $0,1,2,3$. Towers in $1,2$.\nIf $p_1=1$, tower $1$ covers $c$ s.t. $|c-1|<1 \\implies 0<c<2 \\implies c=1$.\nIf $p_2=1$, tower $2$ covers $c$ s.t. $|c-2|<1 \\implies 1<c<3 \\implies c=2$.\nTowers in $1,2$ with $p_1=1, p_2=1$ cover $1,2$ respectively.\nTowns $0,3$ are not covered. This is a valid configuration.\nHere $i_1=1, p_1=1 \\implies x_1=0, y_1=2$.\n$i_2=2, p_2=1 \\implies x_2=1, y_2=3$.\nHere $x_1=0, y_1=2, x_2=1, y_2=3$.\n$y_1=2 \\ne x_2=1$. So this is not a partition of $(0, n+1)$.\nThe problem states \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\".\nThis implies that the *union* of the covered integer points $\\{c \\mid i-p_i < c < i+p_i, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ for $i \\in S$ must be exactly $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and each $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ must be in exactly one such set.\n\nThis means that the *integer intervals* $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$.\nThe conditions become:\n1. $L_i \\ge 1$ and $R_i \\le n$. This means $i-p_i+1 \\ge 1 \\implies p_i \\le i$, and $i+p_i-1 \\le n \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$. So $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This is the same as before.\n2. The union of $[L_i, R_i]$ for $i \\in S$ is $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and these intervals are disjoint.\nThis means we have a sequence of intervals $[L_1, R_1], [L_2, R_2], \\dots, [L_k, R_k]$ where $L_1=1, R_k=n$, and $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nLet the towers be $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\nThen $L_{i_1}=1$, $R_{i_j}+1 = L_{i_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, and $R_{i_k}=n$.\nFor each $i_j \\in S$, we choose $p_{i_j}$ such that $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\nAnd $p_{i_j} = (R_{i_j}-L_{i_j}+1+1)/2 = (R_{i_j}-L_{i_j}+2)/2$.\nAlso $i_j = (L_{i_j}+R_{i_j})/2$.\nThis means $L_{i_j}$ and $R_{i_j}$ must have the same parity.\nLet $B_0 = 0, B_1, \\dots, B_k = n+1$ be the boundary points of the intervals.\nThe intervals are $[B_j+1, B_{j+1}-1]$. No, this is not right.\nThe intervals are $[L_j, R_j]$.\nLet $L_j, R_j$ be the start and end of the $j$-th interval.\n$L_1=1, R_k=n$.\n$R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$.\nThe center of interval $[L_j, R_j]$ is $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThe power is $p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2 + 1/2$. No, $p_j = (R_j-L_j+1+1)/2$ is for $(i-p, i+p)$.\nFor $|c-i|<p \\iff i-p<c<i+p$, the integers covered are $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\nThe length of this interval is $(i+p-1) - (i-p+1) + 1 = 2p-1$.\nSo $R_j-L_j+1 = 2p_j-1$.\nThis means $R_j-L_j+2 = 2p_j$.\nSo $R_j-L_j$ must be an even number.\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nAnd $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. This means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity for $i_j$ to be an integer.\nSo $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\n$L_1=1$ (odd). So $R_1$ must be odd.\n$R_1+1 = L_2$. $L_2$ must be even. So $R_2$ must be even.\n$R_2+1 = L_3$. $L_3$ must be odd. So $R_3$ must be odd.\nIn general, $L_j$ and $R_j$ have parity of $j$.\nSo $R_k=n$ must have the parity of $k$.\nThis implies that $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe set of towns where towers are built is $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\nFor any $x \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$, no tower is built at $x$.\nThis means we are looking for configurations of built towers $S$ such that there exists a sequence $1=L_1 \\le R_1 < L_2 \\le R_2 < \\dots < L_k \\le R_k=n$ satisfying:\n1. $R_j-L_j$ is even (so $L_j, R_j$ have same parity).\n2. $L_j$ and $R_j$ have parity of $j$.\n3. $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n4. For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2 \\in S$.\n5. For any $x \\notin S$, $x$ must not be $i_j$ for any $j$.\n\nFrom (2) and (3):\n$L_1=1$ (odd), $R_1$ (odd).\n$L_2=R_1+1$ (even), $R_2$ (even).\n$L_3=R_2+1$ (odd), $R_3$ (odd).\n$L_j$ has parity of $j$. $R_j$ has parity of $j$.\n$i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. Since $L_j, R_j$ have same parity, $i_j$ is an integer.\nThe condition $p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ is equivalent to $L_j \\ge 1$ and $R_j \\le n$. This is explicitly satisfied.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to counting the number of subsets $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that there exists a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ with $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2 \\in S$ for all $j$, and $x \\notin S$ for all $x \\ne i_j$.\nThis means $S$ must be exactly the set $\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\nThe condition $L_j, R_j$ have parity of $j$ implies $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ is an integer.\nAlso $R_k=n$. So $n$ must have the parity of $k$.\nIf $n$ is even, $k$ must be even. If $n$ is odd, $k$ must be odd.\n\nConsider the sequence of points $0, R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_k=n$.\nLet $x_0=0, x_1=R_1, \\dots, x_k=n$.\nThen $x_j - x_{j-1} = R_j - R_{j-1}$.\n$L_j = R_{j-1}+1$.\n$i_j = (R_{j-1}+1+R_j)/2$.\nThe condition $R_j-L_j$ is even means $R_j - (R_{j-1}+1)$ is even.\nSo $R_j - R_{j-1}$ must be odd.\nThis means $x_j - x_{j-1}$ must be odd for all $j=1, \\dots, k$.\nThis implies $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ must have different parities.\nSince $x_0=0$ (even), $x_1$ must be odd. $x_2$ must be even. $x_3$ must be odd.\nSo $x_j$ must have the parity of $j$.\nThus $x_k=n$ must have the parity of $k$.\nThis means $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity. This is consistent.\n\nSo we are looking for a set of towers $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ such that:\n1. There is a sequence $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n$.\n2. For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, $x_j-x_{j-1}$ is odd.\n3. For each $j=1, \\dots, k$, $i_j = (x_{j-1}+1+x_j)/2$ is in $S$.\n4. For any $y \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$, no tower is built at $y$.\n\nCondition (2) means $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ have different parities. This means $x_j$ has parity of $j$.\nSo $x_0=0$ (even), $x_1$ (odd), $x_2$ (even), $\\dots, x_k=n$ (parity of $k$).\nThis implies $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe towns $i_j = (x_{j-1}+1+x_j)/2$ are the ones that must have towers.\nAll other towns $y \\notin \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ must not have towers.\nThe probability of a specific configuration of towers is $(1/2)^N$, where $N$ is the number of towns where towers are built or not built. Here $N=n$.\nSo we need to count the number of valid sets $S$, and multiply by $(1/2)^n$.\n\nLet $dp[m]$ be the number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, m\\}$ into intervals satisfying the conditions.\n$dp[0] = 1$ (empty partition for empty set).\nTo compute $dp[m]$: The last interval must be $[L_k, R_k]$ where $R_k=m$.\n$L_k = R_{k-1}+1$.\n$R_k-L_k$ must be odd. So $m - (R_{k-1}+1)$ must be odd.\n$m - R_{k-1} - 1$ is odd.\nIf $m$ is odd, $R_{k-1}$ must be odd.\nIf $m$ is even, $R_{k-1}$ must be even.\nSo $R_{k-1}$ must have the same parity as $m$.\nThe tower for this interval is $i_k = (L_k+R_k)/2 = (R_{k-1}+1+m)/2$.\nWe need $i_k$ to be in $S$.\nThe number of ways to choose $S$ is actually $1$. For a given sequence $x_0, \\dots, x_k$, the set $S$ is uniquely determined.\nAnd for a given sequence $x_0, \\dots, x_k$, the choices of powers $p_j$ are uniquely determined.\nSo we are counting the number of sequences $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k=n$ such that $x_j - x_{j-1}$ is odd for all $j=1, \\dots, k$.\nThis also implies $x_j$ and $j$ have the same parity. So $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nLet $F(m)$ be the number of such sequences ending at $m$.\n$F(0)=1$ (empty sequence $x_0=0$).\n$F(m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\text{if } (m-j) \\text{ is odd then } F(j) \\text{ else } 0$.\n$F(m) = F(m-1)$ if $m-(m-1)=1$ (odd)\n$F(m) = F(m-2)$ if $m-(m-2)=2$ (even)\n$F(m) = F(m-3)$ if $m-(m-3)=3$ (odd)\n$F(m) = F(m-5)$ if $m-(m-5)=5$ (odd)\nSo $F(m) = F(m-1) + F(m-3) + F(m-5) + \\dots$.\nLet's list values:\n$F(0)=1$\n$F(1)$: $x_1=1$. $x_1-x_0=1$ (odd). So $F(0)=1$. $F(1)=1$. Sequence: $0,1$. $k=1$. $n=1, k=1$ (same parity).\n$F(2)$: $x_k=2$. $x_k-x_{k-1}$ must be odd.\n    $x_1=2$. $2-0=2$ (even). Not allowed.\n    $x_2=2$. $x_1$ must be odd. $x_1=1$. $x_2-x_1=2-1=1$ (odd). $F(0)=1$. So $F(2)=1$. Sequence: $0,1,2$. $k=2$. $n=2, k=2$ (same parity).\n$F(3)$: $x_k=3$.\n    $x_1=3$. $3-0=3$ (odd). $F(0)=1$.\n    $x_2=3$. $x_1$ must be even. No $x_1 \\le 2$ is even.\n    $x_3=3$. $x_2$ must be odd. $x_2=1$ (not possible, $x_2$ must be even). $x_2=2$ (not possible, $x_2$ must be even).\n    Wait, $x_j$ must have parity of $j$.\n    $x_0=0$ (even).\n    $x_1$ must be odd.\n    $x_2$ must be even.\n    $x_3$ must be odd.\n    $F(m) = \\sum_{j \\text{ s.t. } m-j \\text{ is odd}} F(j)$.\n    $F(0)=1$.\n    $F(1) = F(0) = 1$. (Path $0 \\to 1$. $k=1$. $n=1, k=1$ same parity.)\n    $F(2) = F(1) = 1$. (Path $0 \\to 1 \\to 2$. $k=2$. $n=2, k=2$ same parity.)\n    $F(3) = F(2) + F(0) = 1+1=2$. (Paths $0 \\to 1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ and $0 \\to 3$. $k=3$ for $0 \\to 1 \\to 2 \\to 3$. $k=1$ for $0 \\to 3$.\n        For $n=3$, $k$ must be odd. $k=1$ is valid. $k=3$ is valid.\n        $0 \\to 3$: $i_1 = (0+1+3)/2=2$. Tower at $2$. $p_2=(3-0)/2$ not integer. $p_2=(3-0+1)/2=2$. This is using $|c-i|<p$.\n        This is exactly the $n=3$ example. Tower $2$ with $p_2=2$ covers $1,2,3$. This is one way.\n        $0 \\to 1 \\to 2 \\to 3$: $i_1=(0+1+1)/2=1, i_2=(1+1+2)/2=2, i_3=(2+1+3)/2=3$. Towers at $1,2,3$. $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$. This is another way.\n        So $F(3)=2$ is correct.\n    $F(4) = F(3) + F(1) = 2+1=3$. ($0 \\to 1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4$, $0 \\to 3 \\to 4$, $0 \\to 1 \\to 4$).\n    $F(5) = F(4) + F(2) + F(0) = 3+1+1=5$.\nThis sequence $F(m)$ is Fibonacci numbers: $F(m) = Fib(m+1)$, where $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, \\dots$.\nSo $F(m) = Fib(m+1)$.\n$F(0)=Fib(1)=1$.\n$F(1)=Fib(2)=1$.\n$F(2)=Fib(3)=2$. No, $F(2)=1$.\n$F(m) = F(m-1) + F(m-3) + F(m-5) + \\dots + F(m \\pmod 2)$.\n$F(m) = F(m-1) + F(m-3) + \\dots + F(1)$ if $m$ is even.\n$F(m) = F(m-1) + F(m-3) + \\dots + F(0)$ if $m$ is odd.\nThis is not Fibonacci.\nLet's try recursion $F(m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1, m-j \\text{ odd}} F(j)$.\n$F(m-1) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-2, (m-1)-j \\text{ odd}} F(j)$.\n$(m-1)-j$ odd $\\iff m-j$ even.\nSo $F(m) = F(m-1) + \\sum_{j=0}^{m-3, m-j \\text{ odd}} F(j)$. This is not simplifying.\n\nLet $G(m)$ be the number of sequences $x_0, \\dots, x_k=m$ where $x_j-x_{j-1}$ is odd.\n$G(0)=1$.\n$G(m) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} G(j)$ where $m-j$ is odd.\n$G(m) = G(m-1) + G(m-3) + G(m-5) + \\dots$.\nIf $m$ is odd: $G(m) = G(m-1) + G(m-3) + \\dots + G(0)$.\nIf $m$ is even: $G(m) = G(m-1) + G(m-3) + \\dots + G(1)$.\nConsider $G(m-2) = G(m-3) + G(m-5) + \\dots$.\nIf $m$ is odd: $G(m) = G(m-1) + G(m-2)$.\nIf $m$ is even: $G(m) = G(m-1) + G(m-2)$. (This holds if $G(1)$ is the last term in $G(m-2)$ sum, and $G(0)$ is the last term in $G(m)$ sum, which is correct).\nSo $G(m) = G(m-1) + G(m-2)$ for $m \\ge 2$.\nBase cases:\n$G(0)=1$.\n$G(1)=G(0)=1$.\n$G(2)=G(1)=1$.\n$G(3)=G(2)+G(1)=1+1=2$.\n$G(4)=G(3)+G(2)=2+1=3$.\n$G(5)=G(4)+G(3)=3+2=5$.\nThis is $G(m) = Fib(m+1)$ where $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, \\dots$.\n$G(0)=Fib(1)=1$.\n$G(1)=Fib(2)=1$.\n$G(2)=Fib(3)=2$. This is where it differs. My $G(2)$ is $1$.\nLet's check $G(2)$ again: $G(2) = \\sum_{j=0}^{1} G(j)$ where $2-j$ is odd.\n$j=1: 2-1=1$ (odd). Term is $G(1)=1$.\n$j=0: 2-0=2$ (even). Term is $0$.\nSo $G(2)=G(1)=1$.\nThen $G(3)=G(2)+G(1)=1+1=2$.\n$G(4)=G(3)+G(2)=2+1=3$.\n$G(5)=G(4)+G(3)=3+2=5$.\nThe sequence is $1,1,1,2,3,5,8, \\dots$.\nThis is $Fib(m)$ shifted.\n$G(0)=1$\n$G(1)=1$\n$G(2)=1$\n$G(3)=2$\n$G(4)=3$\n$G(5)=5$\n$G(m) = F_{m-1}$ for $m \\ge 3$, where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\n$G(m) = Fib(m-1)$ for $m \\ge 2$ if $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1$.\n$G(2)=1=Fib(1)$. $G(3)=2=Fib(2)$. $G(4)=3=Fib(3)$. $G(5)=5=Fib(4)$.\nNo, $G(m) = Fib(m)$ for $m \\ge 2$ if $Fib(0)=1, Fib(1)=1$. No.\nStandard Fibonacci is $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nMy sequence $G(m)$ is $1,1,1,2,3,5, \\dots$.\n$G(0)=1$.\n$G(1)=1$.\n$G(2)=1$.\n$G(3)=2$.\n$G(4)=3$.\n$G(5)=5$.\n$G(n)$ is $Fib(n)$ for $n \\ge 3$ where $Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1$.\n$G(n)$ values are $F_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 2$, if $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2 \\dots$.\nLet's use $F_n$ for $F_0=1, F_1=1$.\n$F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, \\dots$.\nThen $G(n) = F_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 1$, and $G(0)=1$.\n$G(1)=F_0=1$.\n$G(2)=F_1=1$.\n$G(3)=F_2=2$.\n$G(4)=F_3=3$.\n$G(n)$ is $F_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 1$ where $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_k=F_{k-1}+F_{k-2}$.\n$F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, F_5=8, \\dots$.\nThe value we need is $G(n)$.\nIf $n=1$, $G(1)=1$.\nIf $n=2$, $G(2)=1$.\nIf $n=3$, $G(3)=2$.\nIf $n=4$, $G(4)=3$.\nIf $n=5$, $G(5)=5$.\nThese match the example outputs:\n$n=1: 1/2^1 = 1/2$.

Tower in town $1$ with prob $1/2$.\nIf tower $1$ is built: $p_1 \\le \\min(1, 1+1-1) = 1$. So $p_1=1$.\nTower $1$ with $p_1=1$ covers $|c-1|<1 \\implies c=1$.\nTowns $0,2$ not covered. Town $1$ covered by exactly one tower.\nThis is a valid configuration. Prob $1/2$.\nSo $G(1)=1$ and the probability is $1/2$.\nThe example output $748683265$ is $1/4$. This is confusing.\nCould it be that $n=1$ is a typo in example output and it should be $1/2$? Or my $G(1)$ is wrong?\n$G(1)=G(0)=1$. This seems correct for $x_0=0, x_1=1$.\nThe $n=1$ case is simple:\n$x_0=0, x_1=1$. $k=1$. $n=1$, $k=1$, same parity.\n$i_1 = (0+1+1)/2 = 1$. Tower must be built at $1$.\nThis is one valid configuration.

So $c+d = 0+1=1$. Correct.\nFor $n=2$, $M^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. So $c+d = 1+0=1$. Correct.\nFor $n=3$, $M^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. So $c+d = 1+1=2$. Correct.\n\nThe modulo is $998244353$.\nWe need to compute $G(n) \\cdot 2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$2^{-n}$ is $pow(2, -n, MOD) = pow(2, MOD-1-n, MOD)$.\n\nFinal values for examples:\n$n=1$: $G(1)=1$.

This matches.\nSo it seems the example output for $n=1$ is actually for $n=2$ or $n=3$.\nThe problem description has a single input line, which means the examples are separate test cases, not one input with multiple lines.\nInput '2' -> Output '748683265'\nInput '3' -> Output '748683265'\nInput '5' -> Output '842268673'\nInput '200000' -> Output '202370013'\n\nSo for $n=2$, output $1/4$. My $G(2)=1$, $1 \\cdot 2^{-2} = 1/4$. Correct.\nFor $n=3$, output $1/4$. My $G(3)=2$, $2 \\cdot 2^{-3} = 1/4$. Correct.\nFor $n=5$, output $5/32$. My $G(5)=5$, $5 \\cdot 2^{-5} = 5/32$. Correct.\n\nSo the $n=1$ output in the problem's example must be a typo, or I'm misreading the example block.\nIt says:\nInput\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\nOutput\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\nThis implies that for input $n=2$, output is $748683265$.\nFor input $n=3$, output is $748683265$.\nFor input $n=5$, output is $842268673$.\nFor input $n=200000$, output is $202370013$.\nMy calculations for $n=2,3,5$ match these. So my logic is very likely correct.\nThe $n=1$ case is not in the example.\n\nLet's implement the matrix exponentiation.\n$MOD = 998244353$.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef mat_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    C[0][0] = (A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]) % MOD\n    C[0][1] = (A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]) % MOD\n    C[1][0] = (A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0]) % MOD\n    C[1][1] = (A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef mat_pow(A, p):\n    res = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] # Identity matrix\n    base = A\n    while p > 0:\n        if p % 2 == 1:\n            res = mat_mult(res, base)\n        base = mat_mult(base, base)\n        p //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0: # Though n >= 1, handle for completeness.
