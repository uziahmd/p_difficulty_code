The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$.

    "thought": "**Solving the Neko Finds Grapes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Neko Finds Grapes\" problem, and here's my thought process.  The goal is to maximize how many chests I can open given some keys, with the condition that a key can only open a chest if their numbers add up to an odd number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We've got `n` chests and `m` keys.  Each key can only open one chest, and each chest can only be opened once. The crucial detail is that `a_i + b_j` must be odd to open a chest with a key.\n\nBreaking down that \"odd sum\" rule is key.  It means we're dealing with either an even chest and an odd key, or an odd chest and an even key. Any other combination results in an even sum, and that won't work.\n\nThis leads to the counting approach. Let's keep track of how many even and odd chests we have, and also how many even and odd keys.  So, I'll have `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd` counters.\n\nNow, forming pairs is the core. An even chest *needs* an odd key, and an odd chest *needs* an even key. I want to pair as many as possible, which means the number of pairings is limited by the smaller of the available chests or keys of the matching parity.\n\nFor the even chest/odd key pairs, I can form `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` pairs.  For the odd chest/even key pairs, I can form `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` pairs.\n\nSince these two types of pairings are independent (they use different types of chests and keys), I just need to add the maximum pairings from each type together to get the total number of chests Neko can open:  `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.  That's my core formula!\n\nI've tested it on an example given and it works, and double-checked the edge cases where all chests or keys may have the same parity. The time complexity is linear, so it's efficient enough to deal with the constraints. I've also double-checked it for Python specific implementation, making sure input and output are correctly handled. It looks like it should work in all cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests and `m` keys. Each chest has a number `a_i` and each key has a number `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that the sum `a_i + b_j` must be odd. This occurs in two specific scenarios regarding the parity of `a_i` and `b_j`:\n1. If `a_i` is even, then `b_j` must be odd for their sum to be odd (Even + Odd = Odd).\n2. If `a_i` is odd, then `b_j` must be even for their sum to be odd (Odd + Even = Odd).\n\nIf `a_i` and `b_j` have the same parity (both even or both odd), their sum `a_i + b_j` will be even, and thus the key cannot open the chest.\n\nThis observation simplifies the problem significantly: we need to match chests of one parity with keys of the opposite parity. These two types of pairings are independent:\n- Even-numbered chests can only be opened by odd-numbered keys.\n- Odd-numbered chests can only be opened by even-numbered keys.\n\nTo maximize the total number of opened chests, we should maximize the number of pairings for each independent type.\n\nLet's count the number of even and odd chests, and even and odd keys:\n- `chests_even`: count of chests with an even number.\n- `chests_odd`: count of chests with an odd number.\n- `keys_even`: count of keys with an even number.\n- `keys_odd`: count of keys with an odd number.\n\nFor the first type of pairing (even chest with odd key):\nThe maximum number of such pairings is limited by the available count of even chests and odd keys. So, we can form `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` pairs.\n\nFor the second type of pairing (odd chest with even key):\nSimilarly, the maximum number of such pairings is limited by the available count of odd chests and even keys. So, we can form `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` pairs.\n\nSince these two types of pairings use distinct sets of chests (even vs. odd) and distinct sets of keys (odd vs. even), they do not conflict with each other. Therefore, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximum pairings from these two types:\n`Total opened chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0` and `chests_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers. For each number, check its parity: if even, increment `chests_even`; otherwise, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Initialize `keys_even = 0` and `keys_odd = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers. For each number, check its parity: if even, increment `keys_even`; otherwise, increment `keys_odd`.\n6. Calculate the result using the formula: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7. Print the result.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n- Reading `n` and `m`: O(1)\n- Counting chest parities: O(N) because we iterate through `n` chest numbers.\n- Counting key parities: O(M) because we iterate through `m` key numbers.\n- Calculating the final result: O(1).\nTotal time complexity: O(N + M), which is efficient enough for `N, M <= 10^5`.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n- O(1) additional space, as we only store counts and do not need to store the actual lists of chest or key numbers.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize counts for chest parities\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    \n    # Read chest numbers and count their parities\n    # Using map(int, ...) directly without creating a list saves memory\n    for x in map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()):\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    # Initialize counts for key parities\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    \n    # Read key numbers and count their parities\n    # Using map(int, ...) directly without creating a list saves memory\n    for x in map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()):\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum number of chests that can be opened\n    # Even chests can only be opened by odd keys\n    # Odd chests can only be opened by even keys\n    total_opened_chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(total_opened_chests)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
