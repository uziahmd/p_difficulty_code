And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey: Calculating Average Sleep Time**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to figure out the average sleep time over a series of \"weeks.\" Each week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and I'm given `n` days of sleep records (a1, a2, ... an). The goal is to find the average sleep time across *all* possible weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of weeks, which is `n - k + 1`.  Then, for each week, I need the sum of sleep times. I'll call this sum `S_i` for the `i`-th week, starting at `a_i` and ending at `a_{i+k-1}`.  So,  `S_i = a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{i+k-1}`.  The average will be the `TotalSum` of all `S_i` values divided by the number of weeks.\n\nA simple approach would be to calculate each week's sum individually, right?  A nested loop to go through all `n - k + 1` weeks and then sum the `k` days within each week.  That gives me O((n - k + 1) * k) time complexity.  However, with `n` and `k` up to 2 * 10^5, this can quickly become O(n^2), which is too slow.\n\nSo, I need to optimize.  Thinking about this, I realize there's overlap between the weeks.  The second week (starting at `a2`) includes all but the first day of the first week.  Aha!  This calls for a sliding window approach.  I can efficiently calculate `S_i` from `S_{i-1}`.  `S_i = S_{i-1} - a_{i-1} + a_{i+k-1}`.  This means calculating each `S_i` takes only constant time once I have the first one!\n\nThis means I calculate the sum of the first week (0 to k-1) which takes O(k). I initialize the `TotalSum` with the first week. Then use a loop with O(n-k) iteration. And I should be able to calculate all `S_i`. Thus, overall time complexity becomes O(k + n - k) which is O(n), and this is efficient enough.\n\nIn terms of the algorithm: I'll initialize `TotalSum` with the sum of the first `k` elements.  Then, in a loop from `1` to `n - k`, I'll update the current week's sum using the sliding window technique.  Finally, I calculate the average by dividing `TotalSum` by the number of weeks, which is `n - k + 1`. I need to ensure the final result is output with the necessary precision. Let's say 10 decimal places to be safe.\n\nI've tested with the provided example. It's working. Edge cases: If `k = 1`, it's just the average of all `n` days, which my logic seems to handle, the loop just adds all the numbers. If `k = n`, there is only one week and it is the same as the total sum. Also handled. No overflow issues, since Python has arbitrary-precision integers, and the division yields a float.\n\nI'm ready to code. And I'll add useful comments, too.\n",
