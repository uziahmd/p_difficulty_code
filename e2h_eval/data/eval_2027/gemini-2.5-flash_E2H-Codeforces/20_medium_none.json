    "thought": "**My Python Script for a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem involves binary strings, prefixes, and constraints on how often a string can appear as a prefix within a multiset. The goal is to find the number of ways to define these prefix constraints such that the maximum size of the multiset is exactly a given value 'f'.\n\nFirst, I recognize this smells like a dynamic programming problem on a tree. Each binary string can be seen as a node in a binary trie, where the empty string is the root, and the leaves are strings of length 'n'. My initial thought was max-flow, but that's too slow. A greedy or DP-based approach seems much more suitable.\n\nThe core idea is to understand how the maximum size of the multiset is determined by the `c_s` values (the allowed counts) for all prefixes. If a prefix 's' has length L < n, any string of length 'n' having 's' as a prefix must also have one of 's0' or 's1' as a prefix, where '0' and '1' are bits. The count of strings with 's' as a prefix is the sum of the counts for 's0' and 's1'. Therefore, I have a recursive relation to define dp[L], which represents maximum possible count of strings with any prefix of length L, considering the `c_s` constraints. Each node 's' of the trie corresponds to an allowed count `c_s`.  For each node 's' I need to determine a maximum value `dp[s]` given the child nodes `dp[s0]` and `dp[s1]` and the constraint `c_s`. `val(s) = min(c_s, val(s0) + val(s1))`.\n\nTo maximize the multiset size, I need to maximize the counts at each level, but within the constraints.  Since the problem's structure is symmetric (strings of the same length behave the same), I can use a 1D DP `dp[L]`, where `dp[L]` represents the maximum prefix count for *any* string of length `L`. This simplifies things significantly.\n\nHowever, I need to count *ways* of choosing `c_s` values such that my max prefix counts (related to dp and related to each node of the tree of length from 1 to n) lead to a final multiset size of 'f'.  This means counting possible combinations of `c_s` values that result in a specific 'f'. `f = val(0) + val(1)`.\n\nSo, it's a dynamic programming problem where each intermediate result (and final result) needs to be tracked modulo 998244353. The key insight is to define `dp[L][val]` as the *number of ways* to choose `c_s'` values for all descendants of a string 's' of length 'L', such that the maximum prefix count rooted at 's' is 'val'.  This will be my primary state.\n\nTo compute `dp[L][x]`, where 'x' is a specific value for prefix length 'L', I need to consider all possible ways to \"split\" this value between the children (`dp[L+1][S_0]` and `dp[L+1][S_1]`), along with the constraint `c_s`. The `P[L+1][S_sum]` is the number of ways to reach value S_sum, by convoluting children. I need to iterate over all possible values of `c_s`, subject to the `c_s = val`. I need to sum over all these options, taking MOD. The recurrence relation is: `dp[L][x] = SuffixSumP[L+1][x] + (k - x) * P[L+1][x]`. Where `SuffixSumP[L+1][x]` is a cumulative sum.\n\nThe convolution operation suggests using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) or FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). The MOD and ROOT hints at NTT, which I'll use. I need to pad the input polynomials to the next power of 2, greater than or equal to `2k+1` to properly work with the NTT/convolution and efficiently perform it within the time limit.\n\nOnce `dp[1]` is calculated, the final result is calculated from dp[1] by convolving it with itself for `f`. And return final result. This whole process needs to be carefully implemented modulo 998244353.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset is exactly `f`. A multiset `M` of binary strings of length `n` is beautiful if for every string `s` (length `1` to `n`), the count of strings in `M` having `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how to calculate the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given all `c_s` values. This can be modeled using a dynamic programming approach on the binary trie formed by strings of length `1` to `n`.\nLet `val(s)` be the maximum number of strings of length `n` that can have `s` as a prefix, subject to the given `c_s` values for `s` and its descendants.\n- If `s` is a string of length `n` (a leaf in the trie), then `val(s) = c_s`.\n- If `s` is a string of length `L < n` (an internal node), its children are `s0` and `s1`. Any string of length `n` having `s` as a prefix must either have `s0` as a prefix or `s1` as a prefix. Thus, `val(s)` is limited by `c_s` and by the sum of `val(s0)` and `val(s1)`. Specifically, `val(s) = min(c_s, val(s0) + val(s1))`.\n\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `val(\"0\") + val(\"1\")`, where `0` and `1` are the two strings of length 1.\n\nThe problem requires us to count ways to choose `c_s` values. Since the structure of the trie is symmetric for all nodes at the same depth, we can use dynamic programming based on the string length `L`.\nLet `dp[L][x]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` values for all binary strings `s'` that are descendants of a *specific* string `s` of length `L` (including `s` itself), such that `val(s) = x`.\nThe maximum possible value for any `c_s` is `k`. Therefore, `val(s)` cannot exceed `k`. So, `x` ranges from `0` to `k`.\n\n**Base Case: `L = n`**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `val(s) = c_s`. To achieve `val(s) = x`, we must choose `c_s = x`. There is only one way to do this for a given `x`.\nSo, `dp[n][x] = 1` for `0 <= x <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step: `L` from `n-1` down to `1`**\nTo compute `dp[L][x]`, we consider a string `s` of length `L`. Its children are `s0` and `s1`, both of length `L+1`.\n`val(s) = min(c_s, val(s0) + val(s1))`.\nWe need to sum up `dp[L+1][val(s0)] * dp[L+1][val(s1)]` for all combinations of `val(s0)` and `val(s1)` that lead to `val(s) = x` for a chosen `c_s`.\n\nLet `P[S_sum]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` values for descendants of `s0` and `s1` such that `val(s0) + val(s1) = S_sum`.\n`P[S_sum] = sum_{x0=0 to k} (dp[L+1][x0] * dp[L+1][S_sum - x0])`.\nThis is a convolution: `P = dp[L+1] * dp[L+1]`. The maximum value for `S_sum` is `2k`.\nWe can compute this convolution using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in `O(k log k)` time.\n\nNow, for a specific `x` (the target `val(s)`), and a chosen `c_s` (from `0` to `k`):\n`val(s) = min(c_s, S_sum) = x`.\nThis can happen in two ways:\n1.  `c_s = x` and `S_sum >= x`:\n    There is `1` way to choose `c_s = x`. The number of ways for `S_sum >= x` is `sum_{S_sum'=x to 2k} P[S_sum']`. Let's call this `SuffixSumP[x]`.\n2.  `c_s > x` and `S_sum = x`:\n    There are `k - x` ways to choose `c_s` (i.e., `x+1, x+2, ..., k`). The number of ways for `S_sum = x` is `P[x]`.\n\nSo, `dp[L][x] = (SuffixSumP[x] + (k - x) * P[x]) % MOD`. (All calculations are modulo `998244353`).\n`SuffixSumP[x]` can be computed efficiently by iterating `x` downwards: `SuffixSumP[x] = (P[x] + SuffixSumP[x+1]) % MOD`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAfter computing `dp[1]`, we need to find the number of ways such that `val(\"0\") + val(\"1\") = f`.\nThis is another convolution: `sum_{x0=0 to k} (dp[1][x0] * dp[1][f - x0])`.\nThis is `(dp[1] * dp[1])[f]`. We can compute this using NTT.\n\n**Overall Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `dp_current = [1] * (k+1)`. (This represents `dp[n]`).\n2.  For `L` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n    a.  Compute `P = multiply(dp_current, dp_current)` using NTT. `P` will have length `2k+1`.\n    b.  Compute `SuffixSumP`. `SuffixSumP[2k] = P[2k]`. For `x_sum` from `2k-1` down to `0`, `SuffixSumP[x_sum] = (P[x_sum] + SuffixSumP[x_sum+1]) % MOD`.\n    c.  Create `dp_next_level = [0] * (k+1)`. For `x` from `0` to `k`:\n        `dp_next_level[x] = (SuffixSumP[x] + (k - x) * P[x]) % MOD`.\n    d.  Update `dp_current = dp_next_level`.\n3.  After the loop, `dp_current` holds `dp[1]`.\n4.  Compute `final_P = multiply(dp_current, dp_current)` using NTT. `final_P` will have length `2k+1`.\n5.  The answer is `final_P[f]`. If `f` is greater than `2k`, the answer is `0`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n-   `n` iterations for the DP.\n-   Each iteration involves one NTT multiplication (`O(k log k)`) and `O(k)` for suffix sums and `dp` calculation.\n-   The final convolution is `O(k log k)`.\n-   Total time complexity: `O(n * k log k)`.\n-   Given `n=15`, `k=2*10^5`, `log k` is about `18`. `15 * 2*10^5 * 18` is approximately `5.4 * 10^7` operations, which is feasible within typical time limits.\n-   Space complexity: `O(k)` for storing DP arrays and temporary NTT arrays.\n\n**NTT Implementation Details:**\n-   `MOD = 998244353` is a prime number suitable for NTT (`998244353 = 119 * 2^23 + 1`).\n-   A primitive root modulo `MOD` is `3`.\n-   The `multiply` function pads polynomials to the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `len_A + len_B - 1`. For `dp` arrays of length `k+1`, this means padding to `N_NTT = 2^M` where `N_NTT >= 2k+1`.\n-   Ensure all intermediate calculations are performed modulo `MOD`, and handle potential negative results of `%` operator by adding `MOD` if needed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 998244353\nROOT = 3  # Primitive root modulo 998244353\n\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        wlen = pow(ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (len_half * 2), MOD)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = pow(wlen, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n        for i in range(0, n, 2 * len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + len_half + j] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + len_half + j] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\n    return a\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Calculate target length for convolution\n    target_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to target_len\n    n_ntt = 1\n    while n_ntt < target_len:\n        n_ntt <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad polynomials with zeros\n    fa = list(a) + [0] * (n_ntt - len_a)\n    fb = list(b) + [0] * (n_ntt - len_b)\n\n    # Perform NTT\n    fa = ntt(fa, False)\n    fb = ntt(fb, False)\n\n    # Pointwise multiplication\n    for i in range(n_ntt):\n        fa[i] = (fa[i] * fb[i]) % MOD\n\n    # Inverse NTT\n    fa = ntt(fa, True)\n\n    # Trim result to target_len\n    return fa[:target_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp_current[x] = number of ways such that max prefix count for a string s of current length is x\n    # Max value for x is k.
