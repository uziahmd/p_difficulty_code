    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, given its width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of gilded rings (`k`).  The core idea is that each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, with a 2-cell gap between consecutive rings.  My strategy is to calculate the number of cells in each ring and sum them up.\n\nFirst, I need to define how to calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring. The problem states that the *i*-th ring has the dimensions `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. I verified this formula, understanding that `4(i-1)` accounts for removing two cells from each side (top, bottom, left, right) for each ring. This means there's a 2-cell gap between rings, which aligns with the problem description.\n\nThe number of cells in the border of a rectangle is `2 * width + 2 * height - 4` which accounts for avoiding double-counting corners. Also, I realized that given the constraint on `k`, the smallest dimension of the innermost ring will always be at least 3, so I don't need to worry about edge cases where the dimensions are smaller than that (where special formulas would be needed).\n\nTo solve this, I will loop from `i = 1` to `k`. In each iteration, I'll calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle for the *i*-th ring, then compute its border cells using the formula above. Finally, I will keep a running sum of the gilded cells. The constraint related to `k` is key.  It guarantees we don't end up with negative or invalid rectangle dimensions. I'll test the logic with some examples to make sure it works. The code will simply read `w`, `h`, and `k` and use the loop to calculate and sum the number of cells in each ring.\n\nThis seems efficient, with a time complexity of O(k), and will only use a few variables.  I'm confident this approach is correct and will handle all valid inputs based on the problem description.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings.\n\nLet's analyze the definition of the `i`-th ring:\n1.  **Dimensions of the `i`-th ring's rectangle:** The problem states that the `i`-th ring consists of all bordering cells on an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.\n    *   For the first ring (`i=1`): The dimensions are `(w - 4(1 - 1)) x (h - 4(1 - 1)) = w x h`. This means the first ring is along the edge of the original plate.\n    *   For the second ring (`i=2`): The dimensions are `(w - 4(2 - 1)) x (h - 4(2 - 1)) = (w - 4) x (h - 4)`. This implies that the second ring's rectangle starts 2 cells in from each side of the first ring's rectangle (since `w` becomes `w-4`, meaning 2 cells are removed from the left and 2 from the right). This matches the description \"the second one — 2 cells away from the edge\". This pattern continues for subsequent rings.\n\n2.  **Number of cells in a single ring:** Each ring is the border of a rectangle. For a rectangle of size `W x H`, the number of cells in its border (with 1 cell width) is `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`. This formula accounts for the four corner cells being counted twice if we simply sum `2W + 2H`.\n\n3.  **Constraint on `k`:** The problem provides a constraint `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This constraint is crucial. Let `min_dim = min(w, h)`.\n    `k <= (min_dim + 1) / 4`\n    `4k <= min_dim + 1`\n    `4k - 4 <= min_dim - 3`\n    `4(k - 1) <= min_dim - 3`\n    Rearranging this, we get `min_dim - 4(k - 1) >= 3`.\n    This means that for the `k`-th (innermost) ring, its defining rectangle will have both dimensions (`w - 4(k - 1)` and `h - 4(k - 1)`) at least 3. Therefore, we never have to worry about degenerate rectangles (e.g., 1xH or 2xH) for which the border formula might need adjustment. The formula `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` is always safe to use.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n2.  Loop `i` from `1` to `k` (inclusive).\n3.  Inside the loop, for each `i`:\n    a.  Calculate the current width `current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n    b.  Calculate the current height `current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n    c.  Calculate the number of cells in this ring: `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n    d.  Add `cells_in_current_ring` to `total_gilded_cells`.\n4.  After the loop finishes, print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (w=7, h=9, k=2):**\n\n*   Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n\n*   **For i = 1 (first ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 7 - 0 = 7`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * (1 - 1) = 9 - 0 = 9`\n    *   `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * 7 + 2 * 9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 0 + 28 = 28`\n\n*   **For i = 2 (second ring):**\n    *   `current_w = 7 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 7 - 4 = 3`\n    *   `current_h = 9 - 4 * (2 - 1) = 9 - 4 = 5`\n    *   `cells_in_current_ring = 2 * 3 + 2 * 5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12`\n    *   `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\n\n*   Loop finishes. Print `40`.\n\nThis approach correctly calculates the total gilded cells as per the problem description and examples. The maximum values for `w, h` are 100 and `k` is at most 25, so the calculation is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read w, h, and k from a single line of input\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    w = int(line[0])\n    h = int(line[1])\n    k = int(line[2])\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each ring from 1 to k\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        # Calculate the effective width and height for the current i-th ring.\n        # According to the problem, the i-th ring is the border of an inner rectangle\n        # of size (w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1)).\n        current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n\n        # The problem constraints (k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1) / 4)) guarantee that\n        # current_w and current_h will always be at least 3.\n        # Thus, we can safely use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle\n        # to find the number of border cells.\n        # Number of border cells = 2 * (width + height) - 4 (to correct for double-counted corners)\n        cells_in_current_ring = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4\n        \n        # Add the cells of the current ring to the total\n        total_gilded_cells += cells_in_current_ring\n    \n    # Print the final total number of gilded cells\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_gilded_cells) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the logic\nsolve()\n\n```",
