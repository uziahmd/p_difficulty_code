The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Maximizing Fan Count in \"The Number Games\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"The Number Games\" problem to solve using Python. The core of it is a tree structure representing districts, with each district having a certain number of fans based on its index. My goal is to figure out how to remove *k* districts in a way that leaves a connected component of *n-k* districts with the maximum possible total fan count.\n\nHere's how my mind's working through it:\n\n*   **Understanding the Problem:** I see that the nation's districts are structured as a tree. Each contestant has fans equal to 2 raised to the power of their district number. The challenge is choosing which *k* districts to axe so what's left is a cohesive group with the highest fan total. The connected part after removal can't be broken apart by the initial edges.\n\n*   **Goal Breakdown:**  The crucial bit is the fan count. Because of how the fan count grows exponentially (2^i), I realize I need to focus on keeping the districts with the largest indices to get the biggest sum. My objective shifts to picking the *n-k* districts with the biggest indices, but there's a catch: they have to be connected!\n\n*   **Initial Strategy:** I initially thought a greedy approach made sense: working backward from district *n* and selecting districts if their addition maintains connectivity. It seemed logical to try and keep the larger districts first.\n\n*   **First Greedy Attempt Flaw:** This quickly felt complicated. While I could easily start with *n*, deciding which other districts to include to keep *n* connected, and, subsequently, other districts, became complex. At one point, to include *i* district, I might have to go back and keep a *j* (where *i*>*j*) district that I want to remove later on. It could force me to keep smaller districts just for connectivity, which wouldn't be optimal.\n\n*   **Corrected Perspective:**  The problem is actually about *removing* districts, not keeping them. This shift is important! Looking at it this way, I'm trying to find an *n-k* size connected graph that maximizes the sum of 2^i. To do that, the connected graph must prioritize the higher-indexed districts, meaning the graph should contain the higher-indexed districts first. This is still a form of a greedy approach, but framed correctly. Now, I need a Python implementation to explore how to do this correctly, ensuring the connectivity constraint is always met.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree, such that the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *not* selected, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly. This means that to maximize the sum, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. For example, `2^10` is much larger than `2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^9`. This implies a greedy strategy: we should try to keep the largest possible district indices.\n\nLet `S` be the set of `n-k` districts we choose to keep. We want to maximize `sum(2^i for i in S)`.\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of their indices: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep as many of the largest-indexed districts as possible, while ensuring the `n-k` selected districts form a connected component.\n\nThis problem can be rephrased: we are looking for a connected component of size `n-k` that includes the largest possible district indices.\nLet's try to build the set of `n-k` kept districts starting from district `n` and going downwards.\n\n1. **Start with district `n`:** It offers the largest fan count `2^n`. We should definitely try to keep it. So, initialize `kept_districts = {n}`.\n2. **Iterate downwards:** From `i = n-1` down to `1`:\n   * If we already have `n-k` districts in `kept_districts`, we are done. The remaining districts (those not in `kept_districts`) are the ones to be removed.\n   * If `i` is not yet in `kept_districts`:\n     * If adding `i` to `kept_districts` would maintain connectivity with the existing `kept_districts` (i.e., `i` is adjacent to at least one district already in `kept_districts`), then we *should* add `i`. This is because `i` has the largest index among the remaining unconsidered districts, and adding it helps us get closer to `n-k` districts while maintaining connectivity.\n     * What if `i` is not adjacent to any district in `kept_districts`? Can we still add `i`? Yes, if there's a path from `i` to some district in `kept_districts` consisting *only* of districts that we *will eventually keep*. This is the tricky part.\n\nThe crucial insight for this type of problem (maximizing sum of values in a connected subgraph) is often a greedy approach combined with a specific way to check connectivity or build the component.\nThe most effective greedy strategy here is to consider districts from `n` down to `1`. We want to include district `i` if possible. \"Possible\" means that `i` is part of a valid component of `n-k` nodes that we are trying to build.\n\nLet's maintain the set of `n-k` districts we want to keep. We start by assuming we keep district `n`. Then we try to keep `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on.\nIf we decide to keep district `i`, it must be connected to the currently formed component. If `i` is not directly adjacent to any node in the current component, but it's \"close\" (i.e., its path to the component only involves nodes with indices greater than `i`), then we should try to keep it.\n\nThis leads to a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) like approach, but prioritizing larger indices.\nStart with district `n` in a priority queue (or just a regular queue, as we process in decreasing order).\nWhen we extract `u` from the queue, we add it to our `kept_districts` set. Then, for each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n1. If `v` has not been visited (i.e., not yet added to `kept_districts` or considered for addition).\n2. If `v` is a \"candidate\" to be kept (i.e., its index is large enough to be considered).\n\nThis is still not quite right. The problem is that we need a specific number of nodes `n-k`.\n\nA more robust greedy approach:\n1. Initialize an empty set `kept_districts`.\n2. Initialize a queue `q` for a BFS-like traversal.\n3. Add district `n` to `kept_districts` and `q`.\n4. While `q` is not empty and `len(kept_districts) < n - k`:\n   a. Dequeue a district `u` from `q`.\n   b. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      i. If `v` is not in `kept_districts` and `v` has not been \"marked for removal\" (meaning we've decided not to keep it yet):\n         * We want to keep `v` if it's one of the largest available districts that can extend the current component.\n         * The crucial idea is that if we have `m` nodes selected so far, and we need `N-K-m` more nodes, we should pick the `N-K-m` largest-indexed nodes among all available neighbors and their unvisited neighbors, as long as they form a connected path to the current component.\n\nThis is exactly what the following algorithm does:\n1. **Represent the tree:** Use an adjacency list `adj`.\n2. **Initialize `kept_districts`:** Add district `n` to `kept_districts`.\n3. **Initialize a queue `q`:** Add district `n` to `q`.\n4. **Initialize `visited` array/set:** Mark `n` as visited.\n5. **Main loop:** While `q` is not empty and `len(kept_districts) < n - k`:\n   a. Dequeue a district `u` from `q`.\n   b. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      i. If `v` has not been visited:\n         * Mark `v` as visited.\n         * If `len(kept_districts) < n - k`:\n           * Add `v` to `kept_districts`.\n           * Enqueue `v` to `q`.\n         * Else (`len(kept_districts) == n - k`):\n           * We have already selected `n-k` nodes. We can't simply add `v`. We need to ensure that the `n-k` nodes we *do* keep are the \"best\" ones. The current `kept_districts` contains `n` and its largest-indexed reachable neighbors. If `v` is smaller than some district currently in `kept_districts` but not part of the `n-k` largest, this approach will naturally replace it.\n\nThis BFS-like approach is slightly off. The standard BFS explores layer by layer. We need to prioritize larger indices across the *entire* unvisited graph.\n\nThe correct greedy strategy involves prioritizing larger indices. We want to find a connected component of size `N-K`.\nLet `current_component` be the set of nodes we decide to keep.\nInitialize `current_component = {N}`.\nInitialize a priority queue `pq` containing neighbors of `N` (with negative index as priority to get max-heap behavior).\nKeep track of `visited` nodes.\n\nCorrected Greedy Algorithm:\n1. **Adjacency List:** Build `adj` for the tree.\n2. **Initialize `removed_districts`:** This will store the `k` districts to be removed.\n3. **Initialize `is_kept` array/set:** A boolean array `is_kept[1...n]` to mark districts that are kept. Initially all `False`.\n4. **Initialize `q` (BFS queue):** A `collections.deque`.\n5. **Start with district `n`:**\n   * Mark `is_kept[n] = True`.\n   * Add `n` to `q`.\n   * `num_kept = 1`.\n6. **BFS-like traversal:**\n   * While `q` is not empty and `num_kept < n - k`:\n     * Dequeue `u` from `q`.\n     * Create a temporary list `candidates` to store unkept neighbors of `u`.\n     * For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n       * If `not is_kept[v]`: Add `v` to `candidates`.\n     * Sort `candidates` in descending order (largest index first).\n     * For each `v` in `candidates` (from largest to smallest):\n       * If `num_kept < n - k`:\n         * Mark `is_kept[v] = True`.\n         * Add `v` to `q`.\n         * `num_kept += 1`.\n       * Else: Break (we have enough nodes, no need to consider smaller ones).\n\n7. **Collect removed districts:** After the loop, iterate from `1` to `n`. If `is_kept[i]` is `False`, add `i` to `removed_districts`.\n8. **Print:** Print `removed_districts` in increasing order.\n\nThis algorithm works because:\n* We start with the largest possible district `n`.\n* At each step, when expanding from an already kept district `u`, we consider its neighbors. We prioritize adding neighbors with larger indices. This ensures that the `n-k` nodes we keep are always the ones with the highest possible indices that can form a connected component starting from `n`.\n* By using a queue, we explore the graph layer by layer, but the sorting of `candidates` ensures that within each \"layer\" of potential new nodes, we pick the largest indices first. This effectively makes it a \"greedy BFS\" where the greedy choice is to pick the largest available index.\n\nLet's trace Example 1: `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `n-k = 3` districts.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\n\nAdjacency List:\n1: [2]\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2, 5]\n\n1. `is_kept = [F,F,F,F,F,F]` (size 7, index 0 unused)\n2. `q = deque()`\n3. `is_kept[6] = True`, `q.append(6)`, `num_kept = 1`. (`kept_districts = {6}`)\n4. `num_kept = 1 < 3`. `q` not empty.\n   a. `u = q.popleft()` (which is 6).\n   b. Neighbors of 6: `[2, 5]`.\n      i. `candidates = []`.\n      ii. `v = 2`: `is_kept[2]` is `False`. Add 2 to `candidates`.\n      iii. `v = 5`: `is_kept[5]` is `False`. Add 5 to `candidates`.\n      iv. `candidates = [2, 5]`. Sort descending: `[5, 2]`.\n      v. For `v = 5`: `num_kept = 1 < 3`.\n         `is_kept[5] = True`. `q.append(5)`. `num_kept = 2`. (`kept_districts = {6, 5}`)\n      vi. For `v = 2`: `num_kept = 2 < 3`.\n         `is_kept[2] = True`. `q.append(2)`. `num_kept = 3`. (`kept_districts = {6, 5, 2}`)\n      vii. `num_kept` is now 3. Break from candidate loop.\n5. Loop condition `num_kept < n - k` (i.e. `3 < 3`) is `False`. Loop terminates.\n\n6. Collect removed districts:\n   `is_kept`: `[F,T,F,F,T,T]` (for indices 1 to 6)\n   - `i=1`: `is_kept[1]` is `False`. Add 1 to `removed_districts`.\n   - `i=2`: `is_kept[2]` is `True`.\n   - `i=3`: `is_kept[3]` is `False`. Add 3 to `removed_districts`.\n   - `i=4`: `is_kept[4]` is `False`. Add 4 to `removed_districts`.\n   - `i=5`: `is_kept[5]` is `True`.\n   - `i=6`: `is_kept[6]` is `True`.\n   `removed_districts = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\n7. Print `1 3 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis greedy strategy correctly identifies the `n-k` districts with the largest indices that form a connected component.\n\n**Complexity:**\n* Building adjacency list: O(N+M) where M is N-1 (edges). So O(N).\n* BFS-like traversal: Each node `u` is enqueued and dequeued at most once. When `u` is dequeued, we iterate its neighbors. For each neighbor `v`, we check `is_kept[v]` (O(1)). The `candidates` list can have degree `deg(u)` elements, sorting it takes `O(deg(u) log deg(u))`.\n* Total time for BFS: Sum of `deg(u) log deg(u)` over all `u`. In the worst case, a star graph, `deg(center) = N-1`, so `O(N log N)`.\n* Collecting removed districts: O(N).\n* Total time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\n* Space complexity: `O(N)` for adjacency list, `is_kept` array, and queue.\n\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is feasible (`10^6 * log(10^6) approx 10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # is_kept[i] will be True if district i is kept, False otherwise\n    is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Queue for BFS-like traversal\n    q = deque()\n    \n    # Number of districts currently kept\n    num_kept = 0\n\n    # Start with the largest district 'n'\n    # If n-k is 0, we keep nothing, but problem says 1 <= k < n, so n-k >= 1\n    if num_kept < n - k:\n        is_kept[n] = True\n        q.append(n)\n        num_kept = 1\n\n    # Perform a modified BFS\n    # We want to keep n-k districts\n    while q and num_kept < n - k:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        \n        # Collect unkept neighbors\n        candidates = []\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if not is_kept[v]:\n                candidates.append(v)\n        \n        # Sort candidates in descending order to prioritize larger indices\n        candidates.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        for v in candidates:\n            if num_kept < n - k:\n                is_kept[v] = True\n                q.append(v)\n                num_kept += 1\n            else:\n                # We have already selected n-k districts\n                # No need to consider smaller candidates from this point\n                break\n    \n    # Collect the districts to be removed\n    removed_districts = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not is_kept[i]:\n            removed_districts.append(i)\n            # Optimization: if we already found k districts, we can stop\n            if len(removed_districts) == k:\n                break\n    \n    # Output the removed districts in increasing order\n    # (they are already collected in increasing order of district number)\n    print(*(removed_districts))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
