Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Python Solution for Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my hands, and I think I've got a solid plan for a Python solution. The core of the problem is about finding two non-intersecting vouchers with a specific duration sum, all while minimizing the total cost. I've broken it down step by step to optimize my approach.\n\nInitially, I considered a brute-force method, but with the constraints given (up to 200,000 vouchers), it's clearly going to be too slow. That approach would involve checking all possible pairs, which leads to a time complexity of O(N^2), so that is out.\n\nThe breakthrough for me was realizing that I could fix one voucher and efficiently search for a matching one. The non-intersection condition (one voucher finishes before another starts) became the key. Let's fix a voucher 'i', let its duration be d_i. The second voucher should have a duration of x - d_i. The crucial condition is that l_j, the start time of the other voucher, must be greater than r_i, the end time of the first. This is all the problem hinges on.\n\nI began thinking about how I could efficiently search for such a voucher 'j'. I came to the idea of storing all vouchers grouped by their duration. However, the requirement that the second voucher starts after the first means I need to refine that approach. It's not enough to know the duration.\n\nThis led me to the sweep-line approach. The best way forward is to process vouchers by their start days and end days. I decided to maintain a data structure that keeps track of the minimum cost for each duration. Specifically, for any duration `d`, I need to maintain the minimum cost amongst all vouchers whose end day is before my \"current day\" `D`. This will let me do the required lookups, keeping the complexity manageable.\n\nTo make things efficient, I sort all the vouchers by their start and end dates. As I iterate through possible start and end days, I update this data structure. I'll maintain a list `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`. As I process each day, I consider vouchers that begin and end on that day, updating my cost lookup accordingly. The crucial part is to correctly update the lookup so that I can find a corresponding `j` voucher given my `i` voucher and its `duration`.\n\nThe time complexity ends up being linear because, in the worst case, I process each voucher only once, giving me O(N) operations in the worst case. This, coupled with the sweep approach of processing the days, gives me a time complexity of O(N + MAX_DAY), where MAX_DAY is a constant bounded by 200,000.  The space complexity is also linear, due to the voucher lists and the cost-lookup array. I'm pretty confident that the overall time and space requirements are optimal.\n\nI then went through a couple of examples with the idea and then coded it out. The code should now handle edge cases correctly, like non-positive durations, and handle cases where no such pair exists. It should handle the constraint that no voucher matches itself (i!=j) by the very nature of how the durations and the day conditions play out.\n\nFinally, I checked for possible integer overflows. It should be fine as costs are up to 10^9 and we only deal with sums of two costs, which is up to 2*10^9, which is handled correctly with python automatically managing large numbers.\n\nI think the code and my reasoning is complete, and it should run reasonably quickly. It also should handle the test cases properly.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct, non-overlapping vouchers whose total duration is exactly `x` and whose total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\nLet's denote a voucher by `(l, r, cost)`, where `l` is the departure day, `r` is the arrival day, and `cost` is the price. The duration of a voucher is `r - l + 1`. Two vouchers `i` and `j` are non-overlapping if `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i`.\n\nWe can solve this problem efficiently using a sweep-line approach. We iterate through each possible day `current_day` from 1 up to `MAX_DAY` (the maximum possible `r` value, which is `2 * 10^5`). At each `current_day`, we perform two main operations:\n\n1.  **Consider vouchers starting on `current_day`:** For each voucher `k` that starts on `current_day` (`l_k = current_day`), we try to pair it with a previously processed voucher `i`. For this to be a valid pair (`i`, `k`):\n    *   Voucher `i` must have ended *before* `current_day` (i.e., `r_i < current_day`).\n    *   The duration of voucher `i` must be `x - duration_k`.\n    *   We want to find such an `i` with the minimum possible `cost_i`.\n\n    To efficiently find such an `i`, we maintain an array `min_cost_for_duration`. `min_cost_for_duration[d]` stores the minimum cost of any voucher with duration `d` that has already *ended* by `current_day - 1`. When we process vouchers starting on `current_day`, we query `min_cost_for_duration[x - duration_k]`. If a valid `cost_i` is found, we update our overall minimum total cost `min_total_cost` with `cost_i + cost_k`.\n\n2.  **Consider vouchers ending on `current_day`:** For each voucher `k` that ends on `current_day` (`r_k = current_day`), this voucher can now be considered as a potential first voucher (`i`) for future vouchers `j` that start *after* `current_day`. We update `min_cost_for_duration[duration_k]` with `min(min_cost_for_duration[duration_k], cost_k)`. This ensures that `min_cost_for_duration` always holds the minimum cost for vouchers that have completed by the current day.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize `MAX_DAY = 2 * 10^5`.\n2.  Create two lists of lists:\n    *   `vouchers_by_start_day`: `vouchers_by_start_day[l]` will store a list of `(r, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that start on day `l`.\n    *   `vouchers_by_end_day`: `vouchers_by_end_day[r]` will store a list of `(l, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that end on day `r`.\n    Initialize both with empty lists for indices `0` to `MAX_DAY`.\n3.  Read `n` and `x`.\n4.  For each of the `n` vouchers:\n    *   Read `l, r, cost`.\n    *   Calculate `duration = r - l + 1`.\n    *   Append `(r, cost, duration)` to `vouchers_by_start_day[l]`.\n    *   Append `(l, cost, duration)` to `vouchers_by_end_day[r]`.\n5.  Initialize `min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (MAX_DAY + 1)`. This array will store the minimum cost for a voucher of a given duration that has already ended.\n6.  Initialize `min_total_cost = float('inf')`. This will store the overall minimum cost for a valid pair of vouchers.\n7.  Iterate `current_day` from `1` to `MAX_DAY`:\n    *   **Process vouchers starting on `current_day`:** For each `(r_k, cost_k, duration_k)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]`:\n        *   Calculate `required_duration_i = x - duration_k`.\n        *   If `1 <= required_duration_i <= MAX_DAY` (meaning it's a valid positive duration that can exist):\n            *   Let `cost_i = min_cost_for_duration[required_duration_i]`.\n            *   If `cost_i` is not `float('inf')` (meaning a suitable first voucher `i` was found):\n                *   Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_i + cost_k)`.\n    *   **Process vouchers ending on `current_day`:** For each `(l_k, cost_k, duration_k)` in `vouchers_by_end_day[current_day]`:\n        *   Update `min_cost_for_duration[duration_k] = min(min_cost_for_duration[duration_k], cost_k)`.\n8.  After the loop, if `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, print `-1`. Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Populating `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`: O(N) because each voucher is processed once.\n    *   The main loop runs `MAX_DAY` times.\n    *   Inside the loop, each voucher is processed exactly once in `vouchers_by_start_day` (when its `l` matches `current_day`) and exactly once in `vouchers_by_end_day` (when its `r` matches `current_day`).\n    *   Array lookups and updates are O(1).\n    *   Total time complexity: O(N + MAX_DAY). Given N, MAX_DAY <= 2 * 10^5, this is highly efficient.\n\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day` store a total of `2N` tuples.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration` stores `MAX_DAY + 1` elements.\n    *   Total space complexity: O(N + MAX_DAY). This is also well within typical memory limits.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the non-overlapping condition (`r_i < l_j`) because a voucher `i` is only considered as \"ended\" and added to `min_cost_for_duration` when `current_day` reaches `r_i`. It is then paired with vouchers `j` that start on `current_day'` where `current_day' > r_i`. This guarantees `r_i < l_j`. The `i != j` condition is also implicitly satisfied as a voucher cannot end before it starts.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MAX_DAY = 2 * 10**5 \n    \n    # vouchers_by_start_day[l] stores list of (r, cost, duration) for vouchers starting on day l\n    # Max index needed is MAX_DAY, so size MAX_DAY + 1 (for 1-based indexing)\n    vouchers_by_start_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_DAY + 1)]\n    \n    # vouchers_by_end_day[r] stores list of (l, cost, duration) for vouchers ending on day r\n    # Max index needed is MAX_DAY, so size MAX_DAY + 1 (for 1-based indexing)\n    vouchers_by_end_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_DAY + 1)]\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers_by_start_day[l].append((r, cost, duration))\n        vouchers_by_end_day[r].append((l, cost, duration))\n\n    # min_cost_for_duration[d] stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration d\n    # that has ended by the current_day.\n    # Max duration is MAX_DAY (e.g., from day 1 to MAX_DAY), so size MAX_DAY + 1\n    min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (MAX_DAY + 1)\n    \n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # Iterate through each possible day from 1 to MAX_DAY\n    for current_day in range(1, MAX_DAY + 1):\n        # Phase 1: Consider vouchers starting on current_day as the second voucher (j)\n        # We look for a suitable first voucher (i) that ended before current_day.\n        for r_k, cost_k, duration_k in vouchers_by_start_day[current_day]:\n            required_duration_i = x - duration_k\n            \n            # Check if required_duration_i is a valid duration (positive and within bounds)\n            if 1 <= required_duration_i <= MAX_DAY:\n                cost_i = min_cost_for_duration[required_duration_i]\n                if cost_i != float('inf'): # If a suitable voucher 'i' was found\n                    min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_i + cost_k)\n\n        # Phase 2: Consider vouchers ending on current_day as the first voucher (i)\n        # Update min_cost_for_duration for these vouchers.
