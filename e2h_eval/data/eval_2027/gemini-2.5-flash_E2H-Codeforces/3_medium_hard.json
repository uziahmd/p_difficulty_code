Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solving Vanya and Lanterns: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to figure out the smallest radius, `d`, that will light up an entire street given a bunch of lanterns placed along it. Let's break this down. We have a street of length `l` and `n` lanterns at positions `a_i`.  A lantern at `a_i` lights up from `a_i - d` to `a_i + d`. The goal is to determine the minimum `d` such that the whole street from 0 to `l` is covered.\n\nFirst, sort the lantern positions. Sorting is just easier to conceptualize. Now, we need to think about the gaps that need to be filled.  There are three types: the beginning of the street, the end of the street, and the spaces *between* lanterns.\n\nTo light up the beginning of the street (from 0 to the first lantern), `d` needs to be at least the position of the first lantern itself, because `a_0 - d <= 0`, so `d >= a_0`.  For the end of the street, the last lantern has to reach `l`, so `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which means `d >= l - a_{n-1}`.\n\nThe most interesting part is what happens between the lanterns. Consider any two adjacent lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`.  We need to ensure their light coverage overlaps.  This overlap condition is key! If `d` is less than `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`, there is an unlit gap between the lanterns.  To cover this gap, it is required that `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} -d`.  So, `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, meaning `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. We must find the *largest* of all these internal gaps, and divide it by two to get `max_diff / 2`.\n\nNow, we must consider all three requirements. So, the minimum `d` will be the maximum of `a_0`, `l - a_{n-1}`, and half the largest internal difference. That's the solution.\n\nEdge cases are also important. What if there's only one lantern? Or all lanterns are at the same point? Or at 0 and `l`? These were considered and incorporated. In particular, setting `max_diff` is the most important part when there's one lantern to not break the logic. We will initialize it at `0.0`, which resolves the issue with division by two (0 / 2 = 0) to use the maximum requirement from the start and end point.\n\nThe implementation involves reading the input, sorting, calculating these three components, and then returning the maximum. Ensure high precision with `\"{:.10f}\".format(d)` and use floats to ensure accurate calculations during division.\n\nThe complexity will be dominated by sorting (`O(n log n)`) and iterating through the lantern positions `O(n)`. Thus, it is `O(n log n)`. This is suitable, given the constraints where `n <= 1000`. And it looks like the solution is complete.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns, positioned at various points `a_i` along a street of length `l` (from `0` to `l`), can collectively illuminate the entire street. Each lantern at `a_i` illuminates the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo find the minimum `d`, we need to consider all parts of the street that might be difficult to light and determine the `d` required for each. The overall minimum `d` will be the maximum of these individual requirements.\n\nLet's break down the street into critical segments:\n\n1.  **The beginning of the street (point 0):** The first lantern (after sorting the lantern positions) must be able to light point 0. If the first lantern is at `a_0`, it covers `[a_0 - d, a_0 + d]`. To cover point 0, we must have `a_0 - d <= 0`, which implies `d >= a_0`.\n\n2.  **The end of the street (point l):** Similarly, the last lantern must be able to light point `l`. If the last lantern is at `a_{n-1}`, it covers `[a_{n-1} - d, a_{n-1} + d]`. To cover point `l`, we must have `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** For any two adjacent lanterns at `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (after sorting), the segment `(a_i, a_{i+1})` must be fully lit. The lantern at `a_i` lights up to `a_i + d`, and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` lights from `a_{i+1} - d`. For the entire segment between them to be covered, their illuminated ranges must meet or overlap. That is, `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`. This simplifies to `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. We need to find the maximum `d` required for any such internal gap.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`.\n2.  Read the `n` lantern positions `a_i` into a list.\n3.  **Sort** the lantern positions in ascending order. This is crucial for identifying the first, last, and adjacent lanterns correctly.\n4.  Calculate the `d` required for the start of the street: `d_start = a[0]`.\n5.  Calculate the `d` required for the end of the street: `d_end = l - a[n-1]`.\n6.  Initialize `max_d_internal = 0.0`. Iterate through the sorted lantern positions from `i = 0` to `n-2`. For each pair `(a[i], a[i+1])`, calculate the distance `diff = a[i+1] - a[i]`. The `d` required to cover this gap is `diff / 2.0`. Update `max_d_internal` to be the maximum of its current value and `diff / 2.0`.\n7.  The minimum `d` that lights the entire street is the maximum of `d_start`, `d_end`, and `max_d_internal`.\n8.  Print the result formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirements.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Sample):**\n`n = 2, l = 5`\n`a = [2, 5]`\n\n1.  Sorted `a`: `[2, 5]`\n2.  `d_start = a[0] = 2`.\n3.  `d_end = l - a[n-1] = 5 - 5 = 0`.\n4.  Internal gaps:\n    `i = 0`: `a[1] - a[0] = 5 - 2 = 3`. Required `d = 3 / 2.0 = 1.5`.\n    `max_d_internal` becomes `1.5`.\n5.  `result_d = max(d_start, d_end, max_d_internal) = max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0`.\n6.  Output: `2.0000000000`\n\nThis approach correctly handles all cases, including `n=1` (where `max_d_internal` remains `0.0` as the loop doesn't run, and `max(a[0], l-a[0], 0.0)` correctly yields `max(a[0], l-a[0])`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions to easily find the first, last, and adjacent lanterns.\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Calculate the minimum 'd' required for the beginning of the street (point 0).\n    # The first lantern at a[0] must cover point 0.\n    # This means a[0] - d <= 0, so d >= a[0].\n    d_required_for_start = float(a[0])\n\n    # Calculate the minimum 'd' required for the end of the street (point l).\n    # The last lantern at a[n-1] must cover point l.\n    # This means a[n-1] + d >= l, so d >= l - a[n-1].\n    d_required_for_end = float(l - a[n-1])\n\n    # Calculate the maximum 'd' required to cover the gaps between adjacent lanterns.\n    # For any two adjacent lanterns a[i] and a[i+1], the segment between them must be covered.\n    # The 'hardest' point to cover between them is exactly in the middle.\n    # The combined reach (a[i] + d) and (a[i+1] - d) must at least meet.\n    # So, a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d  =>  2d >= a[i+1] - a[i]\n    # => d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n    max_d_required_between_lanterns = 0.0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        diff = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        max_d_required_between_lanterns = max(max_d_required_between_lanterns, float(diff) / 2.0)\n    \n    # The overall minimum 'd' must satisfy all these conditions simultaneously.\n    # Therefore, it is the maximum of the individual 'd' requirements.\n    result_d = max(d_required_for_start, d_required_for_end, max_d_required_between_lanterns)\n\n    # Print the result formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n    print(f\"{result_d:.10f}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
