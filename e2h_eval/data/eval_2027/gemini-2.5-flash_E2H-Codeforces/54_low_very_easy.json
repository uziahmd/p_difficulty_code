Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" problem. The core of it is finding three vertices, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, in a regular `n`-gon such that the angle formed at `v2` is as close as possible to a target angle `a`. The input is `n` (number of sides) and `a` (target angle), and the output needs to be the three vertices `v1, v2, v3`.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the geometry. I know the crucial part is understanding the angles within a regular polygon. Since it's regular, all the vertices lie on a circumcircle. The key property is that the inscribed angle (the angle we're interested in) is half the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\nLet's assume, without loss of generality, that `v2` is always vertex `1`.  Then, I need to figure out how to express the angle formed by `v1`, vertex `1`, and `v3` based on the positions of `v1` and `v3` relative to `v2`.  Let's number the vertices from `1` to `n`.  `v1` will be some `i` and `v3` will be some `j`.\n\nThe angle subtended at the center by one side of the polygon is `360/n`.  The central angle formed by the chord joining `v1` and `v3` is proportional to the number of edges separating them.  So, I need a way to count these edges along the circumference.  Let's consider the arc between `v1` and `v3` that *doesn't* contain vertex `1`. That's where the angle is formed.\n\nIf `i` is less than `j` and we're looking at the vertices numbered 1 to n, the \"distance\" between the two vertices on the circumference seems to be represented by the difference between `j` and `i`.\nI'll need to figure out how to calculate that distance, handling cases where it crosses the \"wrap-around\" point (i.e., when `j` is closer to `1` than `i`). I think working with the arcs and how many \"edges\" are present will be the key.  I have a feeling I'll need to use the modulo operator somewhere to handle the circular nature of the polygon.  My next step will be to formulate an equation for the inscribed angle based on this \"edge count\" and then systematically check all possible combinations of `v1` and `v3` to find the angle closest to `a`.\n",
