The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Gilded Cell Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's see... the plate has a width (`w`) and height (`h`), and there are `k` rings.  Each ring is a border around an inner rectangle, and the rings are nested.  The first ring is along the outer edge. The ith ring's rectangle is progressively smaller by a width of 1 cell all around.\n\nLet's think this through systematically. The dimensions of the inner rectangles change with each ring, `i`. The dimensions of the inner rectangle within the `i`-th ring is `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. This is because the rings consume a 'width' or a border of one all around it.\n\nFor the first ring (`i = 1`), the dimensions are simply `w x h`. The number of gilded cells in this ring would be the perimeter of the rectangle. If the width is `W` and the height is `H` for this inner rectangle, the perimeter (number of gilded cells) is `2W + 2H - 4` - accounting for the overlap at the corners. So, for `i=1`, it's `2w + 2h - 4`.\n\nFor the second ring (`i = 2`), it becomes a `(w - 4) x (h - 4)` rectangle, and the gilded cells will be the border of this rectangle: `2(w - 4) + 2(h - 4) - 4`. I can generalize this to the `i`-th ring. The width of the inner rectangle will be  `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and height `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`. So for any `i`, the gilded cells are calculated as `2 * W_i + 2 * H_i - 4`. I must sum these from i = 1 to k.\n\nNow, I need to keep the constraints in mind. `w` and `h` are between 3 and 100, and `k` depends on the smaller dimension, `min(w, h)`. The formula is `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This limits how many rings are actually possible. The largest `i` is k. I need to make sure the inner rectangles don't collapse to a non-existent rectangle. This `k` constraint will ensure that the dimensions of the inner rectangle `W_k` and `H_k` are still within valid boundaries to have this gilded border. If I don't use this constraint, there will be no rectangle left to be gilded and the calculations won't work.\n\nAlright, I think I have a solid understanding of the problem. I can now write a Python script that takes `w`, `h`, and `k` as inputs and calculates the total number of gilded cells based on the formulas I derived. I will probably use a loop to iterate through the rings and sum up the gilded cells for each ring. The `k` constraint can be used as the stopping condition for the loop. I think I'm ready to code this up!\n",
