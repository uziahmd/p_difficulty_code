            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Tile Mentsu Formation**\n\nI'm tasked with determining the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid \"mentsu\" (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) given her initial three tiles. I've broken down the problem by considering scenarios requiring zero, one, or two draws. The goal is to optimize the solution, aiming for a runtime efficient method. Since the maximum draws possible is 2, and after the first two draws, we are guaranteed to form a koutsu.\n\nFirst, I examine the initial three tiles. If they already constitute a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit), no additional draws are needed.\n\nIf the initial tiles don't form a mentsu, I then consider drawing one tile. Here, the focus is on whether any pair within the three initial tiles can, with one additional tile, complete a mentsu. For a koutsu, I check if any two initial tiles are identical; if so, drawing a third identical tile completes the triplet. For a shuntsu, I verify if two tiles share the same suit and their numbers are close enough (differing by at most 2). This allows for drawing the missing tile(s) to form a sequence.\n\nIf neither the initial configuration nor a single draw yields a mentsu, I conclude that two draws are required. In this scenario, I can always choose two tiles identical to any one of the original tiles to create a koutsu.\nThe approach uses a straightforward check for koutsu and shuntsu. It handles all permutations of the given tiles which is the central part of this puzzle. The implementation is designed to optimize time complexity, focusing on clear logic and straightforward comparisons. It also accounts for all tile combinations, guaranteeing a correct solution.",
