The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Solving the Xenia and Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to tackle the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break this down systematically. I see that we have `n` houses on a ringroad and `m` tasks. Each task `a_i` specifies the house where Xenia needs to go to.  Movement is clockwise only, and we're starting at house 1. The goal is to minimize the total time.\n\nMy initial thought is to keep track of Xenia's current position (`current_house`) and the total time elapsed (`total_time`). We start with `current_house = 1` and `total_time = 0`.\n\nFor each task `a_i`, I'll calculate the time needed to move from `current_house` to `target_house = a_i`. Since we move clockwise, this is straightforward:\n\n*   If the target house is greater than or equal to the current house, the time is simply the difference: `target_house - current_house`.\n*   If the target house is less than the current house, it means we have to go around the ring. The time in this case is `n - current_house + target_house`. I can visualize this as going from the current house to house `n`, then wrapping around to `target_house`.\n\nI'll iterate through the tasks, calculating the time for each move, updating the `total_time`, and setting `current_house` to the target for the next task. I need to be careful with the conditions, and I think a direct formula captures both cases well: if target is greater or equal to current house, take the difference, otherwise apply the wrap around case.\n\nJust to be sure, let's work through an example: `n=4`, `m=3`, `a=[3, 2, 3]`.\n\n*   Initially, `current_house = 1`, `total_time = 0`.\n*   Task 1 (`a_1 = 3`): `time_taken = 3 - 1 = 2`. `total_time = 2`, `current_house = 3`.\n*   Task 2 (`a_2 = 2`): `time_taken = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3`. `total_time = 5`, `current_house = 2`.\n*   Task 3 (`a_3 = 3`): `time_taken = 3 - 2 = 1`. `total_time = 6`, `current_house = 3`.\n\nThis looks correct and gives the expected answer, which adds further confidence in my algorithm. It should be relatively straightforward to translate this into a Python script.\n",
