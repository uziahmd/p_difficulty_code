    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, let's break this \"Gluttony\" problem down. It's asking for a Python script to find a permutation `b` of an input array `a` such that the sums of all non-empty, proper subsets of `a` and `b` are different. The constraint on the input size (`n <= 22`) feels like a hint towards a brute-force or possibly a clever, non-exponential solution. The large integer constraint (`a[i] <= 10^9`) is, I suspect, just to make sure we're not dealing with any integer overflow issues.\n\nThe core condition - `sum(subset_a) != sum(subset_b)` for *all* proper subsets - is where the complexity lies. I'm going to start by understanding the simplest cases, to see if any patterns emerge.\n\n**Initial Exploration with Small Cases**\n\nIf `n=1`, there's no subset to check, making any permutation (which is just the original element itself) valid. The problem statement's `0 < k < n` clause isn't entirely clear here, but I'm assuming that when `n=1` the result is just the original array, in which case there are no subsets.\n\nFor `n=2`, with `a = [a0, a1]`, the proper subsets are just the individual elements. So, `b` must swap the two elements, `b = [a1, a0]`.  Since `a` contains distinct integers, that swap is guaranteed to fulfill the condition. This reversal strategy feels promising.\n\n**Hypothesis and Potential Algorithm**\n\nGiven the n=2 case, my initial thought is that sorting the array `a` and then applying some kind of cyclic shift might work.  Let's say `a` is sorted. Then, the candidate solution would be `b = [a1, a2, ..., an-1, a0]`. This feels like it might be a valid solution, but there is no guarantee, so that would have to be verified. Since `n` is limited, that strategy seems efficient for this task.\n\nI need to confirm if such a cyclic shift always works, or if there will be some corner cases to consider for each of those.  I can think about how the sum of all subsets changes in relation to the indices of `a` and `b`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements of `a` at these indices is different from the sum of elements of `b` at these indices. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]` for `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} (a[i] - b[i]) != 0`.\n\nConsider sorting the input array `a` in ascending order. Let the sorted array be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\nA simple permutation to try is a cyclic shift: `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}`.\nSo, `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\nLet's examine `a[i] - b[i]` for this permutation:\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-2`: `a[i] - b[i] = a[i] - a[i+1]`. Since `a` is sorted, `a[i] < a[i+1]`, so `a[i] - a[i+1]` is a negative integer.\nFor `i = n-1`: `a[n-1] - b[n-1] = a[n-1] - a[0]`. Since `a` is sorted and `n > 1`, `a[n-1] > a[0]`, so `a[n-1] - a[0]` is a positive integer.\n\nLet `d_i = a[i] - b[i]`.\nFor `i = 0, ..., n-2`, `d_i = a[i] - a[i+1] < 0`.\nFor `i = n-1`, `d_{n-1} = a[n-1] - a[0] > 0`.\n\nWe need `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0` for `0 < |S| < n`.\nIf `S` does not contain `n-1`, then all `d_i` for `i` in `S` are negative. The sum of negative numbers is always negative, hence not zero. So the condition holds for any `S` that does not include `n-1`.\n\nNow consider subsets `S` that include `n-1`. Let `S = S' U {n-1}` where `S'` is a subset of `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\nThe sum is `sum_{i in S'} d_i + d_{n-1}`.\n`sum_{i in S'} d_i` is a sum of negative numbers (or 0 if `S'` is empty).\n`d_{n-1} = a[n-1] - a[0]`.\nWe need `sum_{i in S'} (a[i] - a[i+1]) + (a[n-1] - a[0]) != 0`.\n\nThis specific cyclic shift `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}` is indeed a valid construction for `n > 1`.\nThe proof relies on the fact that `a_i - a_{i+1}` are all negative for `i < n-1` and `a_{n-1} - a_0` is positive.\nAny sum `sum_{i \\in S} (a_i - b_i)` would either be:\n1. A sum of only negative terms (if `n-1 \\notin S`). This sum is always negative, thus not zero.\n2. A sum including `a_{n-1} - a_0` and possibly other negative terms `a_i - a_{i+1}`.\n   The sum `sum_{i \\in S} (a_i - b_i)` must be non-zero.\n   For example, let's consider the differences `x_i = a_i - a_{i+1}` for `i=0, \\dots, n-2` and `x_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\n   We need `sum_{i \\in S} x_i \\ne 0`.\n   If `n-1 \\not\\in S`, then all `x_i` are negative for `i \\in S`, so the sum is negative.\n   If `n-1 \\in S`:\n     Let `S' = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`. Then `sum_{i \\in S} x_i = x_{n-1} + sum_{i \\in S'} x_i`.\n     `x_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_0`.\n     `sum_{i \\in S'} x_i = sum_{i \\in S'} (a_i - a_{i+1})`.\n     Since `a_i` are distinct, `a_i - a_{i+1}` are non-zero.\n     The values `a_i - a_{i+1}` are negative integers.\n     The value `a_{n-1} - a_0` is a positive integer.\n     This specific construction is a known solution for this type of problem, where the values `d_i` are `a_i - b_i`.\n\nLet's formalize why `sum_{i \\in S} d_i \\ne 0` for `S` including `n-1`.\n`sum_{i \\in S} d_i = (a_{n-1} - a_0) + sum_{i \\in S'} (a_i - a_{i+1})`.\nAll `a_i` are distinct. Let `a_i` be sorted.\nThe smallest possible positive sum occurs when `S` contains `n-1` and `S'` is empty, giving `a_{n-1} - a_0`. This is positive.\nThe largest possible negative sum occurs when `S` contains `n-1` and `S'` contains all other indices `0, ..., n-2`.\nIn this case, `sum_{i \\in S} d_i = (a_{n-1} - a_0) + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (a_i - a_{i+1})`.\nThis is a telescoping sum: `(a_{n-1} - a_0) + (a_0 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_2) + ... + (a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}) = (a_{n-1} - a_0) + (a_0 - a_{n-1}) = 0`.\nHowever, the problem statement specifies `0 < k < n` where `k = |S|`.\nIf `S` contains all indices `0, ..., n-1`, then `|S|=n`, which is not allowed.\nSo, `S` cannot be `{0, ..., n-1}`. Therefore, `sum_{i \\in S} d_i` will never be exactly 0.\nIf `S` is any proper non-empty subset containing `n-1`, it means `S'` cannot be `{0, ..., n-2}`.\nSo `sum_{i \\in S'} (a_i - a_{i+1})` will be a sum of some but not all of `a_0-a_1, ..., a_{n-2}-a_{n-1}`.\nLet `P = \\{0, \\dots, n-2\\}`. The sum `sum_{i \\in P} (a_i - a_{i+1}) = a_0 - a_{n-1}`.\nThe sum `sum_{i \\in S'} (a_i - a_{i+1})` is a partial sum of these terms.\nSince `a_i` are distinct, `a_i - a_{i+1}` are distinct negative integers.\nThe sum `(a_{n-1} - a_0) + sum_{i \\in S'} (a_i - a_{i+1})` will be non-zero because if it were zero, it would imply `sum_{i \\in S'} (a_i - a_{i+1}) = a_0 - a_{n-1}`. This would mean `S'` must contain all indices `0, ..., n-2`, which implies `S = \\{0, ..., n-1\\}`, contradicting `|S| < n`.\nTherefore, this construction works for all `n > 1`.\n\nFor `n=1`: The condition `0 < k < n` means there are no subsets `S` to check. Any permutation `b` of `a` is valid. Since `b` must be a permutation of `a`, `b` must be `a` itself. So, `a_0` is the answer. The cyclic shift `b_0 = a_{(0+1)%1} = a_0` also works.\n\nSo, the overall strategy is:\n1. Read `n` and `a`.\n2. Store pairs `(value, original_index)` for `a`.\n3. Sort these pairs based on `value`. Let this sorted list be `sorted_a`.\n4. Create `b_indices` by cyclically shifting the original indices from `sorted_a`. Specifically, if `sorted_a[i]` is `(value_i, original_index_i)`, then `b` at position `original_index_i` should be `value_{(i+1)%n}`.\n   Alternatively, let `b_val[i]` be the value at `a_i`'s original position.\n   If `(val_j, orig_idx_j)` is `sorted_a[j]`, then `b_val[orig_idx_j] = sorted_a[(j+1)%n][0]`.\n   Then print `b_val`.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n1. `n = 4`\n2. Pairs: `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n3. Sort by value: `sorted_a = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   Let `s_i` denote `sorted_a[i]`. So `s_0=(1,3), s_1=(10,2), s_2=(100,1), s_3=(1000,0)`.\n4. Construct `b_val`:\n   `b_val` will be an array of size `n`.\n   For `j = 0`: `s_0 = (1, 3)`. `orig_idx = 3`. `b_val[3] = s_{(0+1)%4}[0] = s_1[0] = 10`.\n   For `j = 1`: `s_1 = (10, 2)`. `orig_idx = 2`. `b_val[2] = s_{(1+1)%4}[0] = s_2[0] = 100`.\n   For `j = 2`: `s_2 = (100, 1)`. `orig_idx = 1`. `b_val[1] = s_{(2+1)%4}[0] = s_3[0] = 1000`.\n   For `j = 3`: `s_3 = (1000, 0)`. `orig_idx = 0`. `b_val[0] = s_{(3+1)%4}[0] = s_0[0] = 1`.\n   Resulting `b_val`: `[1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\n   This matches the example output `100 1 1000 10` if we reorder it to `1 1000 100 10`. Wait, the example output is `100 1 1000 10`. This means `b[0]=100, b[1]=1, b[2]=1000, b[3]=10`.\n   Let's check the example's `b` against `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n   `a_0=1000, a_1=100, a_2=10, a_3=1`.\n   `b_0=100, b_1=1, b_2=1000, b_3=10`.\n   The example output corresponds to mapping `a_0 -> a_1`, `a_1 -> a_3`, `a_2 -> a_0`, `a_3 -> a_2`.\n   This is not a simple cyclic shift of the sorted values.\n   The example output `100 1 1000 10` is a permutation of `1000 100 10 1`.\n   \n   My construction gives `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`. Let's check this against `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n   `a_0=1000, a_1=100, a_2=10, a_3=1`.\n   `b_0=1, b_1=1000, b_2=100, b_3=10`.\n   \n   Indices: `0  1  2  3`\n   `a`:     `1000 100 10 1`\n   `b`:     `1  1000 100 10`\n   \n   Differences `d_i = a_i - b_i`:\n   `d_0 = 1000 - 1 = 999`\n   `d_1 = 100 - 1000 = -900`\n   `d_2 = 10 - 100 = -90`\n   `d_3 = 1 - 10 = -9`\n   \n   Let's check sums of `d_i`.\n   `S={0}`: `d_0 = 999 != 0`\n   `S={1}`: `d_1 = -900 != 0`\n   `S={2}`: `d_2 = -90 != 0`\n   `S={3}`: `d_3 = -9 != 0`\n   `S={0,1}`: `d_0+d_1 = 999 - 900 = 99 != 0`\n   `S={0,2}`: `d_0+d_2 = 999 - 90 = 909 != 0`\n   `S={0,3}`: `d_0+d_3 = 999 - 9 = 990 != 0`\n   `S={1,2}`: `d_1+d_2 = -900 - 90 = -990 != 0`\n   `S={1,3}`: `d_1+d_3 = -900 - 9 = -909 != 0`\n   `S={2,3}`: `d_2+d_3 = -90 - 9 = -99 != 0`\n   `S={0,1,2}`: `d_0+d_1+d_2 = 999 - 900 - 90 = 9 != 0`\n   `S={0,1,3}`: `d_0+d_1+d_3 = 999 - 900 - 9 = 90 != 0`\n   `S={0,2,3}`: `d_0+d_2+d_3 = 999 - 90 - 9 = 900 != 0`\n   `S={1,2,3}`: `d_1+d_2+d_3 = -900 - 90 - 9 = -999 != 0`\n   \n   My construction `[1, 1000, 100, 10]` is indeed a valid answer. The problem states \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\" So my simpler cyclic shift strategy should be correct.\n\nFinal Algorithm:\n1. Read `n`.\n2. Read the array `a`.\n3. Create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)` for each element in `a`.\n4. Sort this list of tuples based on `value`.\n5. Initialize an empty array `b` of size `n`.\n6. Iterate `j` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   Let `(value_j, original_index_j)` be the `j`-th tuple in the sorted list.\n   The element `a[original_index_j]` (which is `value_j`) will be replaced by `value_{(j+1)%n}` in `b`.\n   So, `b[original_index_j] = sorted_list[(j+1)%n][0]`.\n7. Print the elements of `b`.\n\nThis construction is guaranteed to work for all `n >= 1`.\nFor `n=1`, `a=[val]`. `sorted_list = [(val, 0)]`.\n`b[0] = sorted_list[(0+1)%1][0] = sorted_list[0][0] = val`. So `b=[val]`. Correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 3: Create a list of tuples (value, original_index)\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 4: Sort this list of tuples based on value\n    # This sorts by the first element of the tuple (the value)\n    indexed_a.sort()\n\n    # Step 5: Initialize an array b of size n\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # Step 6: Construct b using the cyclic shift strategy\n    # If indexed_a[j] is (value_j, original_index_j),\n    # then b at original_index_j gets the value of sorted_a[(j+1)%n][0]\n    for j in range(n):\n        current_val, original_idx = indexed_a[j]\n        next_val_in_sorted_order = indexed_a[(j + 1) % n][0]\n        b[original_idx] = next_val_in_sorted_order\n\n    # Step 7: Print the elements of b\n    print(*(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
