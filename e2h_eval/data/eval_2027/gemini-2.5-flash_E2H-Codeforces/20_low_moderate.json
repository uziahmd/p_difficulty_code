For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and it screams \"dynamic programming\" to me right away. It's asking for a count of possibilities, with constraints, and that classic structure of counting how many ways you can do something. I'm going to start by really digging into the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand these variables: `n`, `k`, and `f`. And the key is choosing values for `c_s` for every binary string, with length from 1 to `n`.  Each `c_s` has to be between 0 and `k`.\n\nThe \"beautiful multiset\" concept is the heart of the problem. It seems like it's a constraint we have to work with. So, a multiset of length *n* strings is beautiful if, for any string `s` (length 1 to `n`), the number of strings in the multiset with `s` as a prefix is less than or equal to the corresponding `c_s`.  And we want the *maximum* size of a beautiful multiset to be *exactly* `f`.\n\nI'm starting to visualize this as a binary tree. Each string is a path from the root.  A string `s` of length `L < n` is an internal node, and its children are `s0` and `s1`. A string of length `n` is a leaf.  The \"prefix\" condition becomes \"in the subtree rooted at `s`\".  This is a really powerful geometric representation.\n\nThe core constraint is that the number of strings in the multiset that have a prefix `s`, which I'm calling `count(s)`, must be less than or equal to `c_s`. Now, if `s` is a leaf, then `count(s)` is simply the number of times that exact string appears.  But for internal nodes, this becomes additive, `count(s) = count(s0) + count(s1)`. This is key.\n\nMy goal is to maximize the multiset size, which I realize is just `count(\"\")` at the root. But it is constrained by these `c_s` values. To get the maximum size, I need to push each `count(s)` as high as it can go, subject to the constraints.  If I can get `count(s) = c_s` as much as possible, that would be ideal. I suspect this will result in a problem about how these constraints interact with each other.  I bet there is some DP structure based around the binary tree I mentioned. Okay, I'm getting a handle on it.  Now, let's start sketching out the DP approach...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s \\in [0, k]$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset is exactly $f$. A multiset is beautiful if for every $s$, the number of strings in the multiset having $s$ as a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\n\nLet $M$ be a multiset of binary strings of length $n$. For any binary string $s$ of length $1 \\le L \\le n$, let $N_s$ be the number of strings in $M$ that have $s$ as a prefix. The condition for $M$ to be beautiful is $N_s \\le c_s$ for all $s$. The size of the multiset $M$ is $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } n} N_s$.\n\nConsider a binary string $s$ of length $L < n$. Any string in $M$ that has $s$ as a prefix must either have $s0$ as a prefix or $s1$ as a prefix. Thus, $N_s = N_{s0} + N_{s1}$.\nThis structure implies that the values $N_s$ must satisfy a set of hierarchical constraints. To maximize the total size of a beautiful multiset, we should maximize $N_s$ for all $s$. The maximum possible value for $N_s$ is $c_s$. So, we want to choose $N_s$ such that $N_s \\le c_s$ and $N_s = N_{s0} + N_{s1}$ (for $L<n$), and $N_s \\ge 0$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is achieved by setting $N_s$ to the maximum possible value given the $c_s$ constraints. This maximum value, let's call it $V_s$, can be found recursively:\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$: $V_s = c_s$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $L < n$: $V_s = \\min(c_s, V_{s0} + V_{s1})$.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $V_\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string (representing the root of the binary tree of all strings). This is because $V_\\epsilon$ represents the total count of strings in the multiset.\n\nNotice that the structure of the binary tree of strings is symmetric. For any length $L$, all strings of length $L$ have the same \"subtree structure\". This means that if we are only concerned with the *maximum possible size* of a beautiful multiset, the specific string $s$ matters less than its length and the $c_s$ values in its subtree.\nLet $DP[L][\\text{val}]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings in the subtree rooted at a string $s$ of length $L$, such that the maximum possible count $V_s$ for that subtree is $\\text{val}$.\nThe strings $s$ are of length $1, \\dots, n$. The root of the entire structure is the empty string $\\epsilon$ (length 0). We are interested in $V_\\epsilon$.\nThe possible values for $c_s$ are $0, \\dots, k$. The maximum possible $V_s$ can be $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\n\nLet $dp[L][v]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ values for all strings in a subtree rooted at a node of depth $L$ (i.e., strings of length $L$ and their suffixes), such that the maximum possible count for this subtree is $v$.\nThe base case is for $L=n$. For a string $s$ of length $n$, $V_s = c_s$. So, to get $V_s = v$, we must choose $c_s = v$. There is only 1 way to do this.\nThus, $dp[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\n\nFor $L < n$:\nTo calculate $dp[L][v]$, we consider a string $s$ of length $L$. We need to choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$ and also choose $c_{s0}$ and $c_{s1}$ (and their subtrees) such that $V_s = v$.\nWe know $V_s = \\min(c_s, V_{s0} + V_{s1})$.\nLet $v_{0}$ be $V_{s0}$ and $v_{1}$ be $V_{s1}$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $V_{s0} = v_0$ is $dp[L+1][v_0]$.\nThe number of ways to achieve $V_{s1} = v_1$ is $dp[L+1][v_1]$.\nSo, for fixed $v_0, v_1$, there are $dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$ ways to choose $c$ values in the subtrees of $s0$ and $s1$.\nThe sum $v_0 + v_1$ can range from $0$ to $2 \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{n-(L+1)} = k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nLet $S_L[x] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=x} dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$. This is a convolution.\n$S_L[x]$ represents the number of ways to choose $c$ values for the subtrees of $s0$ and $s1$ such that $V_{s0} + V_{s1} = x$.\nThe maximum possible value for $V_s$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$. Let $K_L = k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe maximum possible sum $v_0+v_1$ is $K_L$.\nThe values $dp[L+1][v]$ are non-zero for $v \\in [0, K_{L+1}]$.\nSo, $S_L[x]$ is non-zero for $x \\in [0, 2 K_{L+1}] = [0, K_L]$.\n\nNow, for a fixed $x = V_{s0} + V_{s1}$, we need to choose $c_s$.\nIf we choose $c_s \\ge x$, then $V_s = \\min(c_s, x) = x$.\nIf we choose $c_s < x$, then $V_s = \\min(c_s, x) = c_s$.\nWe want $V_s = v$.\n\nCase 1: $v < x$. We must choose $c_s = v$. There is 1 way to choose $c_s$. This applies for $v \\in [0, \\min(k, x-1)]$.\nCase 2: $v = x$. We must choose $c_s \\ge x$. The possible values for $c_s$ are $x, x+1, \\dots, k$. There are $k-x+1$ ways to choose $c_s$. This applies for $x \\in [0, k]$. If $x > k$, there are 0 ways.\n\nSo, $dp[L][v]$ can be written as:\n$dp[L][v] = \\sum_{x=v+1}^{K_L} S_L[x] \\cdot 1 + S_L[v] \\cdot (k-v+1)$\nThis is for $v \\le k$.\nIf $v > k$, then $V_s = v$ is impossible if $c_s=v$ is required.\nHowever, $V_s$ can be up to $K_L$. If $v > k$, then $c_s$ must be $k$.\nIf $V_s=v > k$, then we must have $c_s \\ge v$ for $V_s=v$ to be possible. But $c_s \\le k$. So $V_s$ cannot be greater than $k$ if $V_s=c_s$.\nIf $V_s = v > k$, it must be that $V_s = x = v$, and $c_s \\ge v$. But $c_s \\le k$, so this is only possible if $v \\le k$.\nThus $dp[L][v]$ is non-zero only for $v \\in [0, k]$. Oh, this is incorrect. $V_s$ can be greater than $k$. For example, if $n=1$, $L=0$. $s=\\epsilon$. $V_\\epsilon = \\min(c_\\epsilon, V_0 + V_1)$. $V_0=c_0, V_1=c_1$. $V_\\epsilon = \\min(c_\\epsilon, c_0+c_1)$. Here $c_\\epsilon$ would be $c_s$ for $s$ of length 0, but the problem states $s$ of length 1 to $n$. So $V_\\epsilon = V_0+V_1$.\nThe maximum value of $V_s$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nLet's refine the recurrence:\n$dp[L][v]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_t$ for $t$ in the subtree of $s$ (including $s$ itself if $L \\ge 1$), such that $V_s=v$.\nFor $L=n$: $V_s=c_s$. So $dp[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\nFor $L<n$:\n$dp[L][v] = \\sum_{x=0}^{K_L} S_L[x] \\cdot (\\text{ways to choose } c_s \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, x) = v)$\nThe ways to choose $c_s$ for $\\min(c_s, x) = v$:\n1. If $v < x$: we need $c_s = v$. This is 1 way. Possible if $0 \\le v \\le k$.\n2. If $v = x$: we need $c_s \\ge x$. This is $k-x+1$ ways. Possible if $0 \\le x \\le k$.\n3. If $v > x$: this is impossible. $\\min(c_s, x)$ cannot be greater than $x$.\n\nSo, for $L \\in [1, n-1]$:\n$dp[L][v] = \\sum_{x=v+1}^{K_L} S_L[x] \\cdot [0 \\le v \\le k] + S_L[v] \\cdot [0 \\le v \\le k] \\cdot (k-v+1)$\n$dp[L][v] = [0 \\le v \\le k] \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{x=v+1}^{K_L} S_L[x] + S_L[v] \\cdot (k-v+1) \\right)$\n$dp[L][v] = [0 \\le v \\le k] \\cdot \\left( \\left(\\sum_{x=v}^{K_L} S_L[x]\\right) + S_L[v] \\cdot (k-v) \\right)$\n\nLet $P_L[v] = \\sum_{x=v}^{K_L} S_L[x]$ (suffix sum of $S_L$).\nThen $dp[L][v] = [0 \\le v \\le k] \\cdot (P_L[v] + S_L[v] \\cdot (k-v))$.\nThe maximum value for $v$ is $K_L = k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$. However, $dp[L][v]$ is only non-zero for $v \\in [0, k]$. This is because $V_s$ can be at most $k$ if $s$ is of length $L \\ge 1$. If $V_s > k$, then it must be that $c_s \\ge V_s$ and $V_{s0}+V_{s1} = V_s$. But $c_s \\le k$. So $V_s \\le k$.\nThis observation is crucial. It means $dp[L][v]$ is only non-zero for $v \\in [0, k]$.\nSo, $K_L$ in the sum limits can be replaced by $k$.\n$dp[L][v] = [0 \\le v \\le k] \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{x=v+1}^{k} S_L[x] + S_L[v] \\cdot (k-v+1) \\right)$.\nThe maximum possible value of $V_s$ for $s$ of length $L \\ge 1$ is $k$.\nThe maximum possible value of $V_\\epsilon$ (for the empty string) is $k \\cdot 2^n$.\n\nThe final answer is $dp[0][f]$ where $dp[0][v]$ is the number of ways to choose all $c_s$ such that $V_\\epsilon = v$.\n$V_\\epsilon = V_{0} + V_{1}$. There is no $c_\\epsilon$ constraint.\nSo $dp[0][v] = S_0[v] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=v} dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]$.\nThe maximum value for $v$ for $dp[1][v]$ is $k$. So $v_0, v_1 \\in [0, k]$.\nThus $v$ for $dp[0][v]$ can range from $0$ to $2k$.\nThe final answer is $dp[0][f]$.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize $dp[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\n2. Iterate $L$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n   a. Compute $S_L$ using convolution of $dp[L+1]$ with itself.\n      $S_L[x] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=x} dp[L+1][v_0] \\cdot dp[L+1][v_1]$.\n      Since $dp[L+1][v]$ is non-zero only for $v \\in [0, k]$, $S_L[x]$ is non-zero only for $x \\in [0, 2k]$.\n      This convolution can be done in $O(k^2)$ time.\n   b. Compute $dp[L][v]$ for $v \\in [0, k]$:\n      $P_L[v] = \\sum_{x=v}^{2k} S_L[x]$. Compute suffix sums of $S_L$.\n      $dp[L][v] = (P_L[v] + S_L[v] \\cdot (k-v)) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n      Note that $P_L[v]$ is the sum up to $2k$, not $k$. This is because $S_L[x]$ can be non-zero up to $2k$.\n      The maximum $v$ for $dp[L][v]$ is $k$.\n3. For $L=0$:\n   a. Compute $S_0$ using convolution of $dp[1]$ with itself.\n      $S_0[x] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=x} dp[1][v_0] \\cdot dp[1][v_1]$.\n      Since $dp[1][v]$ is non-zero only for $v \\in [0, k]$, $S_0[x]$ is non-zero only for $x \\in [0, 2k]$.\n   b. The answer is $S_0[f]$.\n\nThe maximum value for $k$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe convolution step takes $O(k^2)$. There are $n$ levels. Total time $O(n k^2)$.\nGiven $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^{10} = 6 \\cdot 10^{11}$, which is too slow.\nWe need to optimize convolution. FFT/NTT can do convolution in $O(k \\log k)$.\nTotal time $O(n k \\log k)$.\n$15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$, which is feasible.\n\nLet's check the constraints on $f$: $1 \\le f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum possible value for $V_\\epsilon$ is $2k$. So $f$ must be $\\le 2k$. If $f > 2k$, the answer is 0.\n\nImplementation details for NTT:\nThe modulus is $998244353$, which is a prime number of the form $c \\cdot 2^p + 1$.\n$998244353 = 119 \\cdot 2^{23} + 1$. This modulus is suitable for NTT.\nWe need to implement NTT for polynomial multiplication.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\nROOT = 3  # Primitive root modulo MOD\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        len_half <<= 1\n        w_len = power(ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (2 * len_half))\n        if invert:\n            w_len = inv(w_len)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, 2 * len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_len) % MOD\n    \n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inv(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\ndef multiply_poly(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n    \n    ntt(a_padded, False)\n    ntt(b_padded, False)\n    \n    c_padded = [(a_padded[i] * b_padded[i]) % MOD for i in range(n)]\n    \n    ntt(c_padded, True)\n    \n    return c_padded[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # dp[L][v]: number of ways to choose c_t for subtree at depth L, having V_s = v\n    # For L=n, V_s = c_s.
