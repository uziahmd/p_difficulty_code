And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Refining the Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to calculate the average sleep time across all possible `k`-day weeks, given `n` days of recorded data and the sleep times for each day.  The problem description is clear, and I've got a good handle on the mechanics.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are centered around the input parameters: `n`, `k`, and the sleep time array `a`.  The constraints on `n` and `k` are important; specifically, they can be as large as `2 * 10^5`. That tells me I need an efficient solution because a naive approach would be too slow.\n\nThe core idea is to iterate through all possible weeks, calculate the sum of sleep times for each week, and then find the average.  I understand that there will be `n - k + 1` weeks. I visualize an outer loop iterating through each possible starting day of a week, and then an inner loop summing the sleep times within that week.\n\nI worked through an example `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]` to make sure that the calculation is correct. Based on this I confirmed that the naive solution would involve `O((n-k+1)*k)` operations.  This is basically `O(n*k)`.  And in the worst case where `k` can be as large as `n/2`, the running time can be `O(n^2)`.  That's a bit too slow given the constraint on n.\n\nThen I realized this is a perfect situation for the sliding window approach or prefix sums. Instead of recalculating the week's sum from scratch each time, I can derive the next week's sum from the previous one. I'll need to define `S_i` as the sum of sleep times for the week starting on day `i`.\n\nThis reduces the complexity drastically. Once I have the sum of the first week, I can obtain the subsequent week sums by simply subtracting the first element and adding the new last element. Specifically, I can calculate `S_i+1` by using `S_i - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]` (using 0-based indexing for `a`).\n\nTherefore, my strategy will be to:\n1.  Calculate the sum of the first week (days 0 to k-1).\n2.  Initialize the total sum of all weeks with this value.\n3.  Iterate, updating the sliding window, and accumulating sums for weeks 2 through n-k+1.\nThis will lead to a very fast `O(n)` solution.\n",
