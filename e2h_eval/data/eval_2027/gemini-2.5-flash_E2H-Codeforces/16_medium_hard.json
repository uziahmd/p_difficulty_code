Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to \"Crazy Town\"**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this \"Crazy Town\" problem.  First, the goal is to get from a home to a university in the fewest steps, where a step is crossing a road.  Since the plane is divided into blocks by these roads, a \"step\" equals crossing a line that separates two blocks.\n\nThe core insight is that I don't need to actually *calculate* the blocks or simulate movement within them.  Instead, I just need to figure out which roads *separate* the home and the university. If a road separates them, I have to cross it.  If they're on the same side of a road, I don't.\n\nA line is defined by the equation `ax + by + c = 0`. I can plug the home coordinates (x1, y1) and the university coordinates (x2, y2) into this equation and get two values.  The sign of `ax + by + c` tells me which \"side\" of the line a point is on (positive, negative, or zero). Zero doesn't matter because the problem states neither the home nor university lie on a road.\n\nSo, for each road, I calculate `a*x1 + b*y1 + c` and `a*x2 + b*y2 + c`. If these two values have *different* signs (one positive, one negative), the line separates the home and the university and I increment my step counter.  If they have the same sign, the road doesn't separate them, and I don't increment the counter.\n\nI can simplify this sign check. Multiplying those values and seeing if the product is negative works, because a negative product means different signs, a positive product means same signs. Since points are guaranteed not to lie on the roads, I don't need to consider the case where the product is zero.\n\nThe overall algorithm is pretty simple: read in the home and university coordinates, then for each road, calculate the above and increment the step counter when the signs are opposite.  The final value of the step counter is the answer.\n\nI'll use Python because it's concise, and its integers have arbitrary precision which handles values comfortably within the limits given. Reading in the input, doing simple arithmetic, and printing the output will be straightforward. I'm not using any complex data structures, so the time complexity will be linear with the number of roads (O(n)), which is efficient enough. I've verified my approach with the examples in the problem description, and the logic seems sound.  I'm ready to code this up!\n",
