Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on the Distinct Sequence Counting Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the number of *distinct* letter sequences you can create by decoding substrings of a binary string `S`.  `S` is built by adding '0's and '1's, and these represent Morse code, which can be lengths of 1 to 4. I know there are 26 possible letters, and I've quickly confirmed the number of valid Morse codes.  It's clear I need a Python solution and the result needs to be modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nMy initial thought is that this screams dynamic programming.  I'm thinking about how the problem evolves as the string `S` grows. I initially considered defining `dp[k]` as the count for the prefix `S[0:k]`. But that doesn't really account for needing to consider *all* substrings, not just prefixes.  I then started thinking about a `count_sequences(substring)` function, which sounds promising, but then I realized I need to avoid double-counting the same sequence across different substrings.\n\nI realize I need to maintain a set of the distinct sequences found so far, maybe called `TotalSet`, but that quickly seems like it's going to become very inefficient in terms of memory as `S` gets long. It's a key observation that the problem is about *distinct* sequences. I also tried a simple example with \"111\" to verify the answer.\n\nI started listing the possible sequences that can be made from a substring, and the combinations grow quickly.  A Trie came to mind. My problem shifted to how to efficiently update the Trie or a similar data structure when a new character is added to `S`, keeping track of the new distinct sequences. I'm imagining a `dp[i]` that's the number of sequences for prefixes, but I'm having trouble handling the distinct sequences constraint.\n\nIt became clear to me that I must be careful about all substrings and can't use prefix alone. Maintaining sets or Tries with distinct nodes for all sequences is not efficient enough.  I was concerned about memory usage and the complexity of these operations. I switched the way I process, by considering all substrings.\n\nNow I'm focusing on \"suffixes\" that end at each index, and I'm updating my DP for these.  The key is to leverage the fact that the maximum code length is 4. This means I can decompose each new sequence's first characters from substrings. I'm currently conceptualizing this using a set or Trie. My code is trying to efficiently construct these distinct sequences.\n\nHowever, each attempt to keep a set of all sequences still seemed too memory-intensive. I was also worried about the inclusion-exclusion principle, which gets complex.\n\nAfter many attempts, a more optimized Trie-based solution seems the most promising because they represent unique states.  I tried creating `dp_nodes[k]` containing the ending nodes in Trie. The code needs to quickly create new nodes in the Trie and efficiently determine new distinct sequences.\n\nThis strategy will need careful implementation to avoid too many iterations.  I suspect I'll need some clever optimizations to handle the substring decoding efficiently, potentially relying on the fact that the code lengths are limited.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by any substring of a growing string `S`. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nThe key constraints and properties are:\n1. Morse codes are strings of '0's and '1's.\n2. Code length is between 1 and 4.\n3. There are 26 valid Morse codes, each mapping to a distinct English letter. Four specific strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") are invalid.\n4. The maximum length of `S` is `m = 3000`.\n\nLet's first define the set of valid Morse codes. We can use a `set` for quick lookup.\n`valid_codes = {\"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\", \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\"}`\n\nThe problem requires counting *distinct* sequences of English letters. Since the actual letters don't matter, only their distinctness, we can map the 26 valid Morse codes to integers 0 through 25. For example, \"0\" maps to 0, \"1\" maps to 1, \"00\" maps to 2, and so on. A sequence of letters can then be represented as a tuple of these integers. To count distinct sequences efficiently, a Trie (prefix tree) data structure is suitable. Each node in the Trie represents a prefix of some sequence. The total count of distinct sequences will be the number of nodes in the Trie (excluding the root).\n\nLet `S` be the current string. When a new character `ch` is appended to `S`, its length becomes `N`. We need to consider all substrings of `S` that end at the newly added character, i.e., `S[j:N]` for `j = 0, ..., N-1`. For each such substring, we find all distinct sequences it can decode into and add them to our global Trie.\n\nLet `trie_root` be the root of our global Trie. `total_distinct_sequences` will store the count of non-root nodes in this Trie.\n\nWe maintain a list `dp[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `N-1`. `dp[i]` will be a set of Trie nodes. Specifically, `dp[i]` stores all Trie nodes that represent the end of a sequence formed by decoding `S[i:N]` (the suffix of `S` starting at index `i` and ending at the current last character).\n\nWhen `ch` is appended to `S` (making `S` length `N`):\n1. Create a new `dp_new` list of size `N`.\n2. For `i` from `0` to `N-1`:\n   `dp_new[i]` will be computed based on `dp[i]` from the previous step (for string `S[0:N-1]`) and the new character `ch`.\n   The sequences formed by `S[i:N]` can be formed by appending a new letter (corresponding to `ch` or a code ending with `ch`) to sequences formed by `S[i:N-1]`, or by decoding `S[k:N]` for `k` close to `N`.\n\nLet's refine the DP state. `dp[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `N-1`) will be the set of Trie nodes representing the ends of sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[i:N-1]` (the suffix of `S` of length `N-i`).\nWhen `S[N-1]` is appended, we update `dp` for all `i`.\nFor each `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[i]` will be a set of Trie nodes reachable by decoding `S[i:N]`.\n  Initially, `dp[i]` is empty.\n  For `len = 1` to `4`:\n    If `i + len > N`: continue (substring `S[i:i+len]` would exceed `S`)\n    `code = S[i:i+len]`\n    If `code` is a valid Morse code:\n      `letter_idx = map_code_to_int(code)`\n      If `i + len == N`: (This code forms the *entire* suffix `S[i:N]`)\n        `current_node = trie_root.get_child(letter_idx)` (create if not exists)\n        If `current_node` is new, `total_distinct_sequences++`.\n        `dp[i].add(current_node)`\n      Else (`i + len < N`): (This code forms the first letter of a sequence)\n        For each `prev_node` in `dp[i+len]`:\n          `current_node = prev_node.get_child(letter_idx)` (create if not exists)\n          If `current_node` is new, `total_distinct_sequences++`.\n          `dp[i].add(current_node)`\n\nThe `dp[i]` states are sets of Trie nodes. The size of these sets can be large.\nA more efficient approach for `dp[i]` is to store a list of Trie nodes for each `i`, and for each node, the *number of ways* to reach it. This is for counting ways, not distinct sequences.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem's exact wording: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". This means we need a global set of all distinct sequences.\n\nA Trie node can be represented by a dictionary `children` and a boolean `is_end_of_sequence`.\n`trie_root = {'children': {}, 'count': 0}`\n`total_distinct_sequences = 0`\n\nWhen a new character `char` is appended to `S` (let `S` be the current string after appending `char`, length `N`):\nWe need to calculate `dp[i]` for `i = 0, ..., N-1`. `dp[i]` will be the set of Trie nodes that are reachable by decoding `S[i:N]` (the suffix ending at `N-1`).\nInitialize `dp = [set() for _ in range(N)]`.\n\nFor `j` from `N-1` down to `0`: (This `j` is the starting index of the substring `S[j:N]`)\n  For `len = 1` to `4`:\n    If `j + len > N`: continue\n    `code = S[j : j + len]`\n    If `code` is in `valid_codes`:\n      `letter_idx = map_code_to_int(code)`\n      If `j + len == N`: (The code `S[j:N]` forms a single-letter sequence)\n        `current_trie_node = trie_root`\n        `if letter_idx not in current_trie_node['children']:`\n          `current_trie_node['children'][letter_idx] = {'children': {}, 'count': 0}`\n          `total_distinct_sequences = (total_distinct_sequences + 1) % MOD`\n        `next_node = current_trie_node['children'][letter_idx]`\n        `dp[j].add(next_node)`\n      Else (`j + len < N`): (The code `S[j:j+len]` forms the first letter of a multi-letter sequence)\n        For `prev_node` in `dp[j + len]`:\n          `current_trie_node = trie_root`\n          `if letter_idx not in current_trie_node['children']:`\n            `current_trie_node['children'][letter_idx] = {'children': {}, 'count': 0}`\n            `total_distinct_sequences = (total_distinct_sequences + 1) % MOD`\n          `first_letter_node = current_trie_node['children'][letter_idx]`\n\n          `trie_node_to_add = first_letter_node`\n          `# This is wrong.
