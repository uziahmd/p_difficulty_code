For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Classifying Musical Triads: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify a set of three notes (a \"triad\") as either \"major,\" \"minor,\" or, if neither, \"strange.\"  My thinking is, let's break this down into manageable steps.  First, the notes themselves. I'm going to represent these notes numerically, because working with integers is just easier in code.  Let's use a mapping: C=0, C#=1, and so on, up to H=11.  A dictionary seems perfect for that.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to calculate the distance, in semitones, between any two notes, remembering that the scale is cyclic.  The formula `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12` will do the trick, ensuring the distance is always positive and respects the cycle.  Seems simple enough.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in recognizing the defining patterns of major and minor triads.  A major triad has a 4-3 semitone interval structure, while a minor triad is 3-4.  Crucially, the notes in the input are *unordered*, so I can't just assume they're in the right sequence.  That means I'll need to consider all possible arrangements.\n\nMy plan is to *sort* the input notes first. That simplifies the permutation issue significantly.  Then, I'll essentially cycle through the notes, taking each one as the potential \"root\" of the triad (X in the definition).  For each root, I'll calculate the intervals to the other two notes and see if it fits the major or minor pattern. If I find a match, great! I can output the correct classification.  If none of the root possibilities fits either pattern, it's \"strange.\"  I'm confident this systematic approach will be efficient and correct.\n",
    "response": "The problem requires classifying a given three-note triad as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" based on specific semitone intervals. The notes are cyclic, and distances are measured upwards.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1.  **Map Notes to Integers:** Assign each of the 12 notes a unique integer from 0 to 11. This allows for easy arithmetic calculation of semitone distances. For example, C=0, C#=1, ..., H=11.\n\n2.  **Calculate Semitone Distance:** Given two notes `n1` and `n2` (as integers), the upward distance from `n1` to `n2` is `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. The modulo 12 handles the cyclic nature of the notes.\n\n3.  **Process Input:**\n    *   Read the three note strings.\n    *   Convert each note string into its integer representation using the mapping.\n\n4.  **Check All Permutations:** A triad is an *unordered set* of notes. This means any of the three given notes could be the \"root\" (X), the \"middle\" (Y), or the \"top\" (Z) of the major/minor interval pattern. To account for this, we need to test all possible orderings of the three notes. There are `3! = 6` permutations for three distinct notes. If notes are not distinct, it's fewer, but checking all 6 permutations is safe and covers all cases.\n\n5.  **Define Major/Minor Conditions:**\n    *   For a sequence of notes (X, Y, Z):\n        *   **Major:** Distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones AND Distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones.\n        *   **Minor:** Distance(X, Y) = 3 semitones AND Distance(Y, Z) = 4 semitones.\n\n6.  **Iterate and Classify:**\n    *   For each of the 6 permutations of the input notes (let them be `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`):\n        *   Calculate `dist_ab = (n_b - n_a + 12) % 12`.\n        *   Calculate `dist_bc = (n_c - n_b + 12) % 12`.\n        *   If `dist_ab == 4` and `dist_bc == 3`, it's a major triad.\n        *   If `dist_ab == 3` and `dist_bc == 4`, it's a minor triad.\n    *   The problem guarantees the answer is unambiguous, so we can return \"major\" or \"minor\" as soon as we find a match.\n    *   If no permutation satisfies either condition, the triad is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach systematically checks all possibilities to correctly identify the triad type.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # 1.
