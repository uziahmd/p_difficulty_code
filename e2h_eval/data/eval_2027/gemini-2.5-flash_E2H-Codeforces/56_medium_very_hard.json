Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for \"Guard Duty (easy)\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need to write a Python script to solve a competitive programming problem where we have Rebel spaceships and bases, and we need to pair them up without any of the connecting lines intersecting. We are given the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), and their coordinates. We have to output \"Yes\" if there is a way to do this and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nThe crucial observation is that both R and B are small (up to 10), which shouts \"brute force!\" to me. This means we can try all possible pairings – all the permutations. First, if R and B aren’t the same, it’s impossible, so we check that first and return \"No\". If they *are* equal (let's call them N), then we have N! possible pairings to check.\n\nThe intersection check is the key: we have to find out if two line segments cross each other. This is a geometric problem. We'll use the cross product to determine the \"orientation\" of three points: are they in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, or are they collinear? We'll define an `orientation` function.\n\nIf two line segments intersect, the endpoints of one segment must be on opposite sides of the line that the other segment lies on. I can use the orientation to determine this.\n\nWith that, here's my plan:\n1.  Read R and B. If R!=B, print \"No\".\n2.  Read in all the coordinates for the spaceships and bases.\n3.  Generate all possible permutations of base-spaceship pairs using `itertools.permutations`.\n4.  For each permutation:\n    *   Form the line segments based on the current spaceship-base pairing.\n    *   Check every pair of these segments for intersection (the `do_intersect` function).\n    *   If any segments intersect, this permutation is invalid. Move to the next permutation.\n    *   If all pairs of segments in this pairing *don’t* intersect, print \"Yes\" and stop.\n5.  If we check all permutations and none work, print \"No\".\n\nThe important thing is the `do_intersect` function. It needs to correctly test for intersecting segments using the orientations of their endpoints. It's the core of the algorithm. We use the cross-product implementation for that.\n\nThe time complexity will be exponential, but the constraints are small enough that it *should* work. Let’s make sure this code is correct and then try it out!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to connect `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, and no two connecting paths (straight line segments) intersect. We are given the coordinates of all spaceships and bases.\n\n**1. Initial Checks and Constraints:**\n*   **Perfect Matching:** For a perfect matching to exist, the number of spaceships (`R`) must be equal to the number of bases (`B`). If `R != B`, it's impossible, and we can immediately output \"No\". Let `N = R = B`.\n*   **Small `N`:** The problem states `1 <= R, B <= 10`. This is a very small constraint, suggesting that a solution with exponential time complexity (e.g., involving permutations) might be acceptable.\n*   **Geometric Guarantees:**\n    *   No two points coincide.\n    *   No three points are on the same line. This is a crucial simplification for the segment intersection check.\n\n**2. Algorithm Outline:**\n\nThe core idea is to try every possible way to assign spaceships to bases and, for each assignment, check if any two connecting paths intersect.\n\n*   **Step 1: Read Input.** Read `R` and `B`. If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit. Otherwise, set `N = R`. Read `N` spaceship coordinates and `N` base coordinates, storing them as `Point` objects (or tuples).\n*   **Step 2: Iterate through Permutations.** We need to find a one-to-one mapping from bases to spaceships. This can be represented as a permutation of spaceship indices. For example, if `bases[i]` is connected to `spaceships[P[i]]`, then `P` is a permutation of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)`. Python's `itertools.permutations` is ideal for generating these.\n*   **Step 3: Form Segments for an Assignment.** For each permutation `P`, create `N` line segments: `(bases[i], spaceships[P[i]])` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n*   **Step 4: Check for Intersections.** For the current set of `N` segments, check every unique pair of segments to see if they intersect. If even one pair intersects, this assignment is invalid, and we move to the next permutation.\n*   **Step 5: Output.** If an assignment is found where no segments intersect, print \"Yes\" and terminate. If all permutations are checked and none are valid, print \"No\".\n\n**3. Segment Intersection Check (Geometric Predicate):**\n\nThe most critical part is determining if two line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect. We'll use the concept of orientation (cross product).\n\n*   **Orientation Function:** A function `orientation(p, q, r)` calculates the orientation of the ordered triplet of points `(p, q, r)`.\n    *   It returns `1` if `(p, q, r)` are in counter-clockwise (CCW) order.\n    *   It returns `-1` if `(p, q, r)` are in clockwise (CW) order.\n    *   It returns `0` if `(p, q, r)` are collinear.\n    The value is computed as `(q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)`. The sign of this value determines the orientation.\n\n*   **`do_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2)` Function:**\n    Let `seg1 = (p1, q1)` and `seg2 = (p2, q2)`.\n    1.  Calculate the four orientations:\n        *   `o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)` (orientation of `p2` with respect to line `p1q1`)\n        *   `o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)` (orientation of `q2` with respect to line `p1q1`)\n        *   `o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)` (orientation of `p1` with respect to line `p2q2`)\n        *   `o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)` (orientation of `q1` with respect to line `p2q2`)\n\n    2.  **Using the \"no three points are on the same line\" guarantee:**\n        This guarantee simplifies the intersection check significantly. It means that `o1, o2, o3, o4` will *never* be `0` because `p1, q1, p2` (and other triplets) are always three distinct points from the input set and thus cannot be collinear.\n        Therefore, two segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` strictly intersect if and only if:\n        *   `p2` and `q2` are on opposite sides of the line `p1q1` (i.e., `o1` and `o2` have different signs, `o1 != o2`).\n        *   `p1` and `q1` are on opposite sides of the line `p2q2` (i.e., `o3` and `o4` have different signs, `o3 != o4`).\n        If both conditions are true, the segments intersect. This also correctly handles cases where segments might share an endpoint (they won't be reported as intersecting, which is usually desired for \"crossing\" intersections).\n\n**4. Complexity:**\n*   Number of permutations: `N!` (for `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`).\n*   For each permutation:\n    *   Form `N` segments.\n    *   Check `N * (N-1) / 2` pairs of segments. For `N=10`, this is `45` pairs.\n    *   Each intersection check involves a few arithmetic operations.\n*   Total operations: Approximately `N! * N^2`. For `N=10`, this is `3,628,800 * 10^2 = 3.6 * 10^8`. While this seems high, the constant factor for arithmetic operations is very small, and Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle coordinate values without overflow. This approach is generally efficient enough for `N=10` in competitive programming.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# A simple class to represent a point in 2D space.\n# Using a class can make the code more readable than raw tuples.\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n# Function to determine the orientation of an ordered triplet of points (p, q, r).\n# This is based on the sign of the 2D cross product of vectors PQ and PR.\n# Returns:\n#   1  if (p, q, r) are in counter-clockwise (CCW) order\n#   -1 if (p, q, r) are in clockwise (CW) order\n#   0  if (p, q, r) are collinear (guaranteed not to happen for distinct input points by problem statement)\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # Calculate the value of (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n    # This is the z-component of the cross product of vectors PQ and PR.\n    val = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - \\\n          (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # Collinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1 # CCW (positive) or CW (negative)\n\n# Function to check if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect.\n# This function specifically handles the case where \"no three points are on the same line\"\n# is guaranteed, which simplifies the intersection logic.\ndef do_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Calculate the four orientations needed for the general case.\n    # Due to the problem guarantee (\"no three points are on the same line\"),\n    # none of these orientations will ever be 0.\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) # Orientation of p2 with respect to segment (p1, q1)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) # Orientation of q2 with respect to segment (p1, q1)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1) # Orientation of p1 with respect to segment (p2, q2)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1) # Orientation of q1 with respect to segment (p2, q2)\n\n    # General case: Segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if and only if\n    # p2 and q2 are on opposite sides of the line p1q1 (o1 != o2), AND\n    # p1 and q1 are on opposite sides of the line p2q2 (o3 != o4).\n    # This correctly identifies strict intersections (where segments cross).\n    # It will return False if segments only touch at an endpoint.\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    return False # No intersection found\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read R and B from the first line of input.\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # If the number of spaceships and bases are not equal, a perfect matching\n    # is impossible.\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    N = R # Use N for the common count of spaceships and bases\n\n    # Read spaceship coordinates.\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        spaceships.append(Point(x, y))\n\n    # Read base coordinates.\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        bases.append(Point(x, y))\n\n    # Iterate through all possible permutations of spaceship indices.\n    # Each permutation `p_indices` represents an assignment:\n    # `bases[i]` is connected to `spaceships[p_indices[i]]`.\n    for p_indices in itertools.permutations(range(N)):\n        current_segments = []\n        # Form the N segments for the current assignment.\n        for i in range(N):\n            current_segments.append((bases[i], spaceships[p_indices[i]]))\n\n        # Check for intersections among the segments formed by this assignment.\n        has_intersection = False\n        # We need to check every unique pair of segments.\n        # Use nested loops to iterate through distinct pairs (i, j) where i < j.\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i + 1, N):\n                seg1_p1, seg1_q1 = current_segments[i]\n                seg2_p2, seg2_q2 = current_segments[j]\n\n                # If any pair of segments intersects, this assignment is invalid.\n                if do_intersect(seg1_p1, seg1_q1, seg2_p2, seg2_q2):\n                    has_intersection = True\n                    break # Break from inner loop as this permutation is invalid\n            if has_intersection:\n                break # Break from outer loop as this permutation is invalid\n\n        # If after checking all pairs, no intersections were found,\n        # then we have a valid assignment.
