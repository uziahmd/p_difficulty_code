Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Efficient Vacation Planning: My Python Implementation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The challenge is to find the cheapest pair of vacation vouchers that don't overlap and have a total duration of *x* days. The brute-force approach (checking all pairs) is a no-go for large input sizes like these, so we need a smarter strategy.\n\nMy initial thought was, \"sort things!\" Sorting by start or end dates seemed promising, but the overlap condition was still tricky to handle efficiently.  I eventually landed on a sweep-line approach combined with pre-calculating the minimum costs for vouchers of different durations. Here's the gist:\n\n1. **Preprocessing:** I create two dictionaries (or lists, for efficiency) to group the vouchers. One's indexed by start day, the other by end day.  This lets me quickly access vouchers that *start* or *end* on a specific day.\n\n2. **The Sweep:**  I \"sweep\" through each day. For each day, I consider:\n   *   **Vouchers ending yesterday:** These vouchers are now candidates to be the \"first half\" of a pair. I calculate their duration and store the minimum cost for that duration, only if it's cheaper than what I already have.\n   *   **Vouchers starting today:** These vouchers are the \"second half\" of a pair. For each of these, I check if there is a complementary voucher (duration *x* minus the current voucher's duration) that ended before today. If so, I calculate the combined cost and keep track of the overall minimum.\n\n3. **Optimization:** Instead of iterating through all possible \"previous\" vouchers, I pre-compute the `min_cost_for_duration` array. This array is the key to efficiency; it stores the *minimum* cost of any voucher that *ended* before a specific day for a given duration.  \n\n4. **Avoiding Overlap:** The sweep line and the `min_cost_for_duration` array work in tandem to guarantee no overlap. By only considering a voucher that *ended* by yesterday as a possible previous half, the non-intersection condition is automatically satisfied. The constraint `ri < lj` is implicitly encoded.\n\nThe time complexity is linear with respect to the number of vouchers and the maximum coordinate value, or `O(N + MAX_COORD)`.  This makes it suitable for inputs of size up to 200,000.  The `min_cost_for_duration` array provides efficient lookup using its indexes, ensuring the overall efficiency.  The space complexity is also linear, but the data structures are designed to be efficiently indexed.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct, non-overlapping vouchers whose total duration is exactly `x` and whose combined cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\nLet's denote a voucher by `(l, r, cost)`, where `l` is the departure day, `r` is the return day, and `cost` is its price. The duration of a voucher is `r - l + 1`.\n\nTwo vouchers `i` and `j` are non-overlapping if `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i`. Without loss of generality, let's assume `r_i < l_j`. This means voucher `i` must end strictly before voucher `j` begins.\n\nWe are looking for a pair of vouchers `(i, j)` such that:\n1. `r_i < l_j` (or `r_j < l_i`, which is symmetric)\n2. `(r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x`\n3. `cost_i + cost_j` is minimized.\n\nA brute-force approach of checking all `N^2` pairs would be too slow given `N` up to `2 * 10^5`. We need a more efficient approach.\n\n**Sweep Line Algorithm**\n\nWe can solve this problem using a sweep line algorithm. We'll iterate through all possible days from `1` to `MAX_COORD` (where `MAX_COORD` is the maximum possible `r_i` or `l_i`, which is `2 * 10^5`).\n\nFor each `day` in our sweep:\n1.  **Consider vouchers that *start* on `day`:** These vouchers can potentially be the *second* voucher (`j`) in a pair `(i, j)` where `r_i < l_j` and `l_j = day`. For such a voucher `(l_j, r_j, cost_j)` (which is `(day, r_j, cost_j)`), we calculate its duration `duration_j = r_j - day + 1`. We then need to find a suitable first voucher `i` with duration `duration_i = x - duration_j` that ended *before* `day` (i.e., `r_i < day`).\n2.  **Consider vouchers that *end* on `day`:** These vouchers can potentially be the *first* voucher (`i`) in a pair `(i, j)` where `r_i = day`. We should record their minimum costs based on their durations so they can be found by future `j` vouchers (those starting on `day + 1` or later).\n\nTo efficiently find the minimum cost for `duration_i`, we'll maintain an array `min_cost_for_duration[d]`. This array will store the minimum cost of any voucher with duration `d` that has already *ended* by the current sweep `day - 1`.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`: The maximum possible day coordinate.\n    *   Create two lists of lists (or dictionaries) to group vouchers:\n        *   `vouchers_by_start_day[l]`: Stores `(r, cost)` for all vouchers starting on day `l`.\n        *   `vouchers_by_end_day[r]`: Stores `(l, cost)` for all vouchers ending on day `r`.\n    *   Populate these lists by reading all `N` input vouchers.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (MAX_COORD + 1)`: An array to store the minimum cost for a voucher of a specific duration that has *already ended*. Initialize all entries to `infinity`.\n    *   `min_total_cost = float('inf')`: This will store the overall minimum combined cost found so far. Initialize to `infinity`.\n\n2.  **Sweep Line:**\n    *   Iterate `day` from `1` to `MAX_COORD`:\n        *   **Step 2a: Process vouchers starting on `day` (potential second voucher `j`)**\n            For each voucher `(r_curr, cost_curr)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[day]`:\n                *   Calculate its duration: `duration_curr = r_curr - day + 1`.\n                *   Calculate the required duration for the first voucher: `needed_duration = x - duration_curr`.\n                *   Check if `needed_duration` is valid: It must be positive (`needed_duration >= 1`) and less than `x` (meaning `duration_curr` is also positive). The condition `1 <= needed_duration < x` covers this.\n                *   If `needed_duration` is valid and `min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration]` is not `infinity` (meaning we've found a suitable preceding voucher):\n                    *   Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_curr + min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration])`.\n\n        *   **Step 2b: Process vouchers ending on `day` (potential first voucher `i`)**\n            For each voucher `(l_prev, cost_prev)` in `vouchers_by_end_day[day]`:\n                *   Calculate its duration: `duration_prev = day - l_prev + 1`.\n                *   Update `min_cost_for_duration[duration_prev] = min(min_cost_for_duration[duration_prev], cost_prev)`. This makes this voucher available for future `j` vouchers starting on `day + 1` or later.\n\n3.  **Result:**\n    *   After the sweep, if `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no valid pair was found. Print `-1`.\n    *   Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Preprocessing (reading input and populating `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`): `O(N)`.\n    *   Sweep Line: The outer loop runs `MAX_COORD` times. Inside the loop, processing vouchers by start day and end day involves iterating through lists. The total number of `(r, cost)` pairs across all `vouchers_by_start_day[day]` lists is `N`. Similarly, the total number of `(l, cost)` pairs across all `vouchers_by_end_day[day]` lists is `N`. Array lookups/updates are `O(1)`.\n    *   Total time complexity: `O(N + MAX_COORD)`. Given `N, MAX_COORD <= 2 * 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   `vouchers_by_start_day` and `vouchers_by_end_day`: `O(N + MAX_COORD)` to store all voucher details grouped by day.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration`: `O(MAX_COORD)` for the array.\n    *   Total space complexity: `O(N + MAX_COORD)`. This is also within typical memory limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # MAX_COORD represents the maximum possible value for li or ri.\n    # Given constraints: 1 <= li <= ri <= 2 * 10^5.\n    MAX_COORD = 2 * 10**5\n\n    # vouchers_by_start_day[l] will store a list of (r, cost) for vouchers starting on day l.\n    vouchers_by_start_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]\n    # vouchers_by_end_day[r] will store a list of (l, cost) for vouchers ending on day r.\n    vouchers_by_end_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        vouchers_by_start_day[l].append((r, cost))\n        vouchers_by_end_day[r].append((l, cost))\n\n    # min_cost_for_duration[d] stores the minimum cost of a voucher\n    # with duration 'd' that has already ended by the current sweep day - 1.\n    # The maximum possible duration for a single voucher is MAX_COORD.\n    min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (MAX_COORD + 1)\n\n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # Sweep through all possible days from 1 to MAX_COORD\n    for day in range(1, MAX_COORD + 1):\n        # Phase 1: Consider vouchers that start on 'day'.\n        # These vouchers could be the *second* part of a pair (prev_voucher, current_voucher).\n        # For a valid pair, prev_voucher must have ended on day-1 or earlier.\n        for r_curr, cost_curr in vouchers_by_start_day[day]:\n            duration_curr = r_curr - day + 1\n            \n            # We need a previous voucher whose duration (needed_duration)\n            # sums up with duration_curr to exactly x.\n            needed_duration = x - duration_curr\n\n            # Both durations must be positive.\n            # duration_curr is always >= 1.\n            # If needed_duration <= 0, then duration_curr >= x, which means\n            # this voucher alone is too long or exactly x, leaving no room for a prev voucher.\n            # So, we need 1 <= needed_duration < x.\n            if 1 <= needed_duration < x:\n                if min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration] != float('inf'):\n                    min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_curr + min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration])\n\n        # Phase 2: Consider vouchers that end on 'day'.\n        # These vouchers are now \"available\" to be the *first* part of a pair\n        # for any future voucher starting on day+1 or later.\n        for l_prev, cost_prev in vouchers_by_end_day[day]:\n            duration_prev = day - l_prev + 1\n            min_cost_for_duration[duration_prev] = min(min_cost_for_duration[duration_prev], cost_prev)\n\n    if min_total_cost == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total_cost)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
