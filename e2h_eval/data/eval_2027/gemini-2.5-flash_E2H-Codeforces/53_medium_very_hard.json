    "thought": "**The Quest for the Longest Repeating Substring**\n\nAlright, so the task at hand is to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice. This string consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length of at most 100. Overlapping occurrences are allowed, which adds a bit of a wrinkle to the problem.\n\nMy initial approach is to iterate through all possible substring lengths. The longest possible length is the string's length minus one (e.g., \"aa\" has a substring \"a\" repeated, with length 1), and the shortest is one. Since we're looking for the *longest* such substring, it makes sense to start from the longest possible length and work our way down.\n\nFor each length, I'll systematically generate all possible substrings of that length. For a string 's' of length 'N', a substring of length 'L' starting at index 'i' is simply 's[i:i+L]'. The starting index 'i' will range from 0 up to 'N-L'.\n\nNow, the crucial part: for each substring I generate, I need to check if it appears at least twice within the original string. A straightforward way to do this is to count the occurrences of the substring. If the count is greater than or equal to 2, I've found a candidate. Since I'm iterating through lengths in descending order, the first such substring I find will be the longest one.\n\nLet's consider an example: s = \"ababa\", N = 5.\n\nIf L = 4, there are two substrings \"abab\" and \"baba\". They both appear only once, so no luck.\nWhen L = 3, \"aba\" is a substring, which appears at the beginning and also starting at index 2 (s[2:5]), so it occurs twice. That's the solution! I'm essentially searching for substrings that occur multiple times, with overlapping allowed. I'm taking the largest.\n\nA key optimization here is to avoid redundant counting of the same substrings. So for a given length L, I will use a set called 'seen_substrings' to store the unique substrings of that length I've already processed.\n\nNow, efficiency is paramount. The outer loop is O(N), and the inner one is also O(N). Each check `s.count()` can be `O(N*L)` if there is an occurrence. A quick check of `s.count()` in Python: its efficiency is not ideal, and can be slow. It checks the entire string from the beginning when it could just start at index `i+1`. We can improve that! Instead of `s.count(sub) >= 2`, let's try a clever use of `s.find(sub, i+1)`. We can use the start of the substring at `s[i:i+L]` as `sub` and use `find` to check if `sub` appears again starting at `i+1`.\n\nLet's refine the algorithm.\n\n1.  Read the input string, and determine its length 'N'.\n2.  Initialize 'max\\_repeated\\_len = 0'.\n3.  Iterate 'L' (substring length) from 'N-1' down to 1.\n    *   Create a set 'seen\\_substrings' to store unique substrings of length 'L'.\n    *   Iterate 'i' (starting index) from '0' to 'N-L'.\n        *   Extract 'sub = s[i:i+L]'.\n        *   If 'sub' is *not* in 'seen\\_substrings':\n            *   Add 'sub' to 'seen\\_substrings'.\n            *   Count occurrences of 'sub' starting from index 'i+1'. So we use `s.find(sub, i+1)`.\n            *   If 's.find(sub, i+1)' finds an instance:\n                *   Return 'L', as this is now the maximum, and we start from longest.\n4.  If the loops complete, return '0', since there is no match.\n\nThis revised approach is a little more efficient, with `s.find()` reducing to one search from the current position. It will still be O(N^2), so the overall solution is O(N^3) or O(N^4) (but hopefully that will pass in Python). I'll need to double-check the logic carefully for edge cases: strings of length 1, strings of length 2, etc. With some refinements like this, I believe it's going to work and I will have my solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Overlapping occurrences are allowed. The input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length is at most 100.\n\nLet the given string be `s` and its length be `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Iterate through possible substring lengths:** We are looking for the *longest* such substring, so it's efficient to check lengths in decreasing order. The maximum possible length for a substring is `n-1` (e.g., in \"aaaa\", \"aaa\" appears twice). The minimum length is 1. So, we iterate `L` from `n-1` down to `1`.\n\n2.  **For each length `L`, iterate through all unique substrings of that length:**\n    *   For a fixed length `L`, a substring can start at any index `i` from `0` to `n-L`.\n    *   To avoid redundant checks, we can use a `set` to store substrings of the current length `L` that we have already processed.\n\n3.  **Check for a second occurrence:**\n    *   For each unique substring `sub = s[i : i + L]`, we need to determine if it appears at least one more time in `s`.\n    *   We can use the `s.find(sub, i + 1)` method. This method searches for `sub` in `s` starting from index `i + 1`.\n    *   If `s.find(sub, i + 1)` returns an index (i.e., not `-1`), it means a second occurrence of `sub` has been found. This second occurrence can start after the first one, allowing for overlapping substrings (e.g., \"zz\" in \"zzz\", where the first \"zz\" starts at 0 and the second at 1).\n\n4.  **Return the length:**\n    *   Since we iterate `L` in decreasing order, the first `L` for which we find a substring that appears at least twice is guaranteed to be the length of the *longest* such substring. We can then print `L` and exit.\n\n5.  **Handle no repeated substrings:** If the loops complete without finding any such substring (meaning no substring of length 1 or greater appears at least twice), we should print `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`s = \"ababa\"`, `n = 5`):**\n\n*   **L = 4:**\n    *   `i = 0`: `sub = \"abab\"`. `s.find(\"abab\", 1)` returns `-1`.\n    *   `i = 1`: `sub = \"baba\"`. `s.find(\"baba\", 2)` returns `-1`.\n    *   No substring of length 4 appears twice.\n*   **L = 3:**\n    *   `i = 0`: `sub = \"aba\"`. `s.find(\"aba\", 1)` returns `2`.\n        *   We found \"aba\" starting at index 0 and again at index 2.\n        *   Since this is the first `L` (iterating downwards) for which we found a repeated substring, `3` is the answer. Print `3` and stop.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outer loop (for `L`):** Runs `O(N)` times (from `N-1` down to `1`).\n*   **Inner loop (for `i`):** Runs `O(N)` times (from `0` to `N-L`).\n*   **Inside the inner loop:**\n    *   Substring extraction `s[i : i + L]`: `O(L)` time.\n    *   Set operations (`sub not in seen_substrings_of_current_length`, `seen_substrings_of_current_length.add(sub)`): Average `O(L)` time due to string hashing and comparison.\n    *   `s.find(sub, i + 1)`: In the worst case, this operation can take `O((N-i-1) * L)` time.\n*   **Total Complexity:** Summing these up, the worst-case time complexity is approximately `O(N * N * (L + (N-i-1) * L))`, which simplifies to `O(N^4)`.\n\nGiven `N <= 100`, `N^4 = (10^2)^4 = 10^8`. While `10^8` operations can be slow for Python, built-in string methods like `find` are implemented in C and are highly optimized, often performing much better than the theoretical worst-case on average. This approach should be efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\nThe problem statement's example input/output format suggests multiple test cases, each on a new line. The solution uses a `while True` loop to read lines from standard input until EOF, processing each string independently.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Function to process a single string and find the length of its longest repeated substring\ndef process_string(s):\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # Iterate substring length from the longest possible down to 1.\n    # The longest possible substring length that can appear twice is n-1.\n    # For example, in \"aaaa\", \"aaa\" (length 3) appears twice.\n    # If n is 1 (e.g., \"a\"), range(0, 0, -1) is empty, so the loop won't run,\n    # and it will correctly print 0 later.\n    for L in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # Use a set to store unique substrings of the current length L that we have already checked.\n        # This prevents redundant 'find' calls for the same substring, improving efficiency.\n        seen_substrings_of_current_length = set()\n\n        # Iterate through all possible starting positions 'i' for a substring of length L.\n        # A substring s[i:i+L] is valid if i+L <= n.\n        # So, 'i' can range from 0 up to n-L.\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            sub = s[i : i + L]\n\n            # If this specific substring 'sub' (of current length L) has not been checked yet:\n            if sub not in seen_substrings_of_current_length:\n                seen_substrings_of_current_length.add(sub)\n\n                # Search for another occurrence of 'sub' in the original string 's'.\n                # We start the search from index 'i + 1' to ensure we find a *different* occurrence.\n                # This correctly handles overlapping occurrences (e.g., \"zz\" in \"zzz\",\n                # where the first \"zz\" starts at index 0 and the second at index 1).\n                if s.find(sub, i + 1) != -1:\n                    # We found a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n                    # Since we are iterating L in decreasing order (from longest to shortest),\n                    # the first L for which we find such a substring is guaranteed to be the longest.\n                    print(L)\n                    return # Exit the function immediately after printing the result for this string.\n\n    # If the loops complete without finding any substring of length 1 or greater\n    # that appears at least twice, it means no such substring exists.\n    # In this case, the problem asks to output 0.\n    print(0)\n\n# Read input line by line from standard input until EOF (End Of File).\n# This handles multiple test cases, each on a new line, as implied by the example output format.\nwhile True:\n    line = sys.stdin.readline()\n    # If readline() returns an empty string, it means EOF has been reached.\n    if not line:\n        break\n    \n    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace (like newline characters) from the input line.\n    s = line.strip()\n    \n    # Process the string and print the result to standard output.\n    process_string(s)\n\n```",
