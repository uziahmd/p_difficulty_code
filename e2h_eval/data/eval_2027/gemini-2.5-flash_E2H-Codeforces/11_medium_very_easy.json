A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The objective is to script a solution for the \"Soft Drinking\" problem, a classic from competitive programming. The core is figuring out how many toasts each friend can make, given limited resources.  I see a bunch of inputs: the number of friends (`n`), drink bottles (`k`), drink volume per bottle (`l`), limes (`c`), lime slices per lime (`d`), salt (`p`), and the per-friend requirements for drink (`nl`) and salt (`np`).\n\nMy first thought is to calculate the total amount of each resource available. Simple multiplication for drink, lime slices, and salt. Then, I need to figure out how many \"single-person\" toasts are possible, considering each resource individually. For drink, I'll divide the total milliliters by the per-toast requirement and use integer division to get whole toasts. Lime slices are similar; divide total slices by slices needed per toast. Salt is the same drill.\n\nNow comes the crucial part. The *limiting* factor will determine how many toasts everyone can have.  So, I need the *minimum* number of single-person toasts possible across all resources. This minimum represents the maximum number of toasts that *any single person* could make.\n\nFinally, since everyone makes the same number of toasts, I divide that minimum by the number of friends (`n`). Integer division is essential because you can't have fractional toasts.\n\nI have tested with the provided examples and the logic holds.  I have also accounted for potential edge cases, like division by zero (which can't happen based on the problem constraints). The Python code is straightforward: read the input, calculate the totals, calculate the individual resource toasts, find the minimum, and divide by the number of friends. I'm using `sys.stdin.readline` for input, which is standard in these environments, and `print` for output. No fancy modules needed, this is all basic arithmetic. I should be able to run this without a hitch.\n",
