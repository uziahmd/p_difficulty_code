Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to write a Python script for the \"Amusing Joke\" problem. The core of this problem is to determine if the characters in a pile of letters exactly match the combined letters of a guest's and host's names. No extra letters or missing letters are allowed.  I've got three input lines to read: guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n\nFirst, I'll combine the guest's and host's names. Then, I need to count the frequency of each character in the combined name and the pile of letters. I could do this with nested loops or a more efficient method.\n\nI considered sorting the combined names and the pile, then comparing them. If they're equal, it means the letters are a perfect match.  This is simple and effective. Let's try to sort the Example 1 from the description. I tried with manual sorting and got the same result: \"YES\". Perfect. However, what if a character from pile is missing from the combined? Let's check with Example 2, by sorting method. Yes, this works. The sorting method correctly tells the pile is missing \"P\" from the combined name, and that there are extra letters in pile from \"L\".\n\nAnother efficient method is using frequency maps (dictionaries) to store character counts. Python's `collections.Counter` would be perfect for this! It'll simplify character count and comparison. Let's walk through Example 1 using this method. Yes, this approach works too and matches the example's result.\n\nBoth sorting and `Counter` methods seem good, and efficient. Because of the problem constraints (line lengths are no more than 100), efficiency isn't a huge concern here. But, since I'm trying to write as \"Pythonic\" code as possible, and I already understand the algorithm and all corner cases in the examples I'll use the `collections.Counter` method.\n\nThe problem states, \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" This significantly simplifies things because I don't need to handle empty strings or non-alphabetic characters.\n\nI'll read input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for faster I/O, which is standard in competitive programming. For the comparison, I'll directly compare two `Counter` objects to check for equality.\n\nLet's do some quick tests to check edge cases like short names, repeated characters, and extra/missing letters. Yes, my choice of approach works in all these cases.  Since all the edge case logic and example cases all work, I am good to write the final script. No need for any more comments in the submission. The `Counter` solution seems robust and clear.\n",
