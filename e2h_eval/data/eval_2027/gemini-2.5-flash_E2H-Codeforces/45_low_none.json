There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Tennis Championship\" problem and my goal is to figure out the maximum number of games the tournament winner can play. It's a knockout format, so the losing player is eliminated after each match. The core rule is that two players can only compete if the difference in their number of *previous* games played is at most one. Both must have won all their prior games. I need to design a Python script to solve this.\n\nFirst, I'm trying to wrap my head around the problem with some examples. For `n=2`, it's simple: one match, and the winner plays one game. `n=3` is a bit more interesting, I can have the winner play two games (e.g. 1 vs 2, then winner vs 3). `n=4` is where I start seeing a pattern.  I realize that the optimal structure is the classic binary tree tournament; in this case, the winner plays `log2(n)` games.  My gut says this pattern will continue but I need to prove that.\n\nI'm thinking about how to *maximize* the winner's games. The winner needs to consistently find opponents who have played a similar number of games.  The key seems to be building that bracket structure where the number of previous games played are as close as possible.\n\nLet's say `f(k)` represents the maximum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games. So, the winner's last opponent must have played `k-1` games, and so on.\n\nI need to model this relationship more formally. I see how each level builds upon the previous one. I'm wondering if a recursive or dynamic programming approach would work best. I need to make sure my Python script can handle any input `n`, and generate the correct maximum game count. I also need to make sure I understand how the difference of 2 between the games played is NOT allowed.\n",
