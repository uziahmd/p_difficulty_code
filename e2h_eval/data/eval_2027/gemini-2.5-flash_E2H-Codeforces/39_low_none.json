Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Road to 1600 Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Road to 1600\" problem, and I need a Python script to generate a board where the rook takes fewer vuns than the queen.  The rules are clear: construct an N x N board with numbers 1 to N^2, and we have these two pieces with distinct movement and teleportation rules. I need to make the rook cheaper than the queen.\n\nFirst, let's break down the movement costs and capabilities of each piece. The rook is pretty simple: it can move horizontally or vertically any distance. The queen, however, can move horizontally, vertically, *and* diagonally. It's obvious that the queen has a bigger reach than the rook.  In each step, they find the minimum unvisited reachable number and go there. If they can't reach any unvisited cell directly, they teleport to the smallest unvisited cell on the board, costing one vun.\n\nFormally, if we have a reachable set for the rook, $S_R(curr)$, that must be a subset of the queen reachable set $S_Q(curr)$. The goal is `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\n\nBecause of this direct-reach comparison, the rook *might* get stuck when the queen isn't; so if we engineer the board right, perhaps the teleport costs will add up more for the queen.  The rook's stuck scenarios are a subset of the queen's.  If the rook *can* move, so can the queen.\n\nI see this problem as a matter of controlling the teleport scenarios.  The queen will always have a better starting position to pick numbers. If there are no immediate moves available, then the teleport cost is added. We need to somehow force the queen to teleport more. I think I need to start to investigate how the numbers are placed in the board and how they get visited in the movement algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an $N \\times N$ board with numbers from $1$ to $N^2$ such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print -1.\n\nLet's analyze the movement rules and vun costs:\n1.  A piece starts at cell 1, which is marked visited.\n2.  In each step, the piece looks for the unvisited cell with the minimum number among all cells reachable in one move. It moves to this cell. No vun is paid.\n3.  If all reachable cells are already visited, but there are still unvisited cells on the board, the piece teleports to the unvisited cell with the minimum number globally. This costs 1 vun.\n4.  If all cells are visited, the process stops.\n\nThe key difference between a rook and a queen is their movement capabilities:\n*   **Rook:** Moves horizontally and vertically.\n*   **Queen:** Moves horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.\n\nThis means that the set of cells reachable by a queen from any given position is always a superset of (or equal to) the set of cells reachable by a rook from that position. Let $S_R$ be the set of unvisited cells reachable by a rook, and $S_Q$ be the set for a queen. We have $S_R \\subseteq S_Q$.\n\nConsider the condition for paying a vun: a piece pays a vun if $S_R$ (for rook) or $S_Q$ (for queen) is empty, but there are still unvisited cells on the board.\n\nSince $S_R \\subseteq S_Q$:\n*   If $S_Q$ is not empty, then the queen will find a cell to move to without paying a vun.\n*   If $S_Q$ is empty, then $S_R$ must also be empty. In this case, both rook and queen would pay a vun (if there are unvisited cells left).\n*   The only scenario where the queen might pay a vun and the rook does not is if $S_R$ is empty but $S_Q$ is not. This is impossible, as $S_R \\subseteq S_Q$.\n*   The only scenario where the rook might pay a vun and the queen does not is if $S_R$ is empty but $S_Q$ is not. This means the rook cannot move to any unvisited cell, but the queen *can*. This is the situation we want to exploit: rook pays a vun, queen does not.\n\nTo make the rook pay a vun while the queen does not, we need to arrange numbers such that:\n1.  The rook is at some cell `(r, c)`.\n2.  All unvisited cells in row `r` and column `c` (excluding `(r, c)`) have numbers greater than the global minimum unvisited cell.\n3.  There is an unvisited cell `(r', c')` that is reachable by the queen (i.e., `r'=r` or `c'=c` or `|r-r'|=|c-c'|`) and has a number smaller than the global minimum unvisited cell. This is not quite right.\n    The rule is: if $S_R$ is empty, rook pays. If $S_Q$ is not empty, queen doesn't pay.\n    So, we need to make all unvisited cells in the current row/column of the rook *already visited*.\n    But there must be an unvisited cell reachable by the queen (diagonally) that has the smallest number among all reachable cells for the queen.\n\nThis problem is tricky because the path depends on the current position and the set of visited cells. A simpler approach might be to design a board where the queen's *additional* moves (diagonals) are frequently useful, allowing it to avoid vuns that the rook cannot.\n\nLet's consider small values of $N$:\n*   **$N=1$**: The board has only cell 1. Both pieces start at 1, all cells are visited. 0 vuns for both. No solution.\n*   **$N=2$**: Board $2 \\times 2$.\n    Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    If we place 1 at (0,0).\n    Rook: From (0,0), can reach (0,1), (1,0).\n    Queen: From (0,0), can reach (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n    The queen always has at least one more option (the diagonal). This makes it harder for the rook to pay a vun while the queen doesn't.\n    Example:\n    1 3\n    4 2\n    Rook: 1 -> 2 (min of 2,3,4) -> 3 (min of 3,4) -> 4. 0 vuns.\n    Queen: 1 -> 2 (min of 2,3,4) -> 3 (min of 3,4) -> 4. 0 vuns.\n    It seems for small $N$, it might be hard to create a difference. The example output for $N=4$ shows a specific pattern.\n\nThe example output for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nThe key insight for constructing such a board is to place small numbers (like 1 to $N^2/2$) and large numbers (like $N^2/2+1$ to $N^2$) in separate \"zones\" or patterns.\nIf we can make the rook move through a sequence of cells, exhausting its row/column options, and then force it to pay a vun to reach a small number in a 'far-away' zone, while the queen can reach that number (or another small number) via a diagonal move, then we achieve the goal.\n\nConsider dividing the $N \\times N$ board into two halves. For $N=4$, $N^2=16$. Numbers $1 \\dots 8$ and $9 \\dots 16$.\nLet's try to put numbers $1, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ into one \"half\" of the board and numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\dots, N^2$ into the other \"half\".\nA simple way to do this is to fill the first $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$ rows with numbers $1, \\dots, N \\times \\lceil N/2 \\rceil$ and the remaining rows with larger numbers. This doesn't seem to work well because the pieces can move across rows/columns.\n\nA more effective strategy is to alternate small and large numbers in a checkerboard-like pattern.\nFor example, fill cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is even with numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ and cells where $i+j$ is odd with numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\ldots, N^2$. Or vice-versa.\nLet's try to put small numbers in cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even, and large numbers in cells where $i+j$ is odd.\nThe number of even-sum cells is $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ and odd-sum cells is $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$.\nLet's fill $1, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ into even-sum cells and $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\dots, N^2$ into odd-sum cells.\n\nExample for $N=4$:\nTotal cells = 16. Small numbers: 1-8. Large numbers: 9-16.\nThere are $N^2/2 = 8$ even-sum cells and $N^2/2 = 8$ odd-sum cells.\nFill cells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ even with $1, \\dots, 8$.\nFill cells $(i,j)$ with $i+j$ odd with $9, \\dots, 16$.\n\nLet's assign numbers by iterating through the grid.\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = N*N`\nCreate a result board.\nIterate `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  If `(r+c)` is even:\n    `board[r][c] = small_num`\n    `small_num += 1`\n  Else (`(r+c)` is odd):\n    `board[r][c] = large_num`\n    `large_num -= 1` (or `large_num += 1` if we use `N*N/2+1` to `N*N`)\n\nLet's use `small_num = 1` to `N*N/2` and `large_num = N*N/2+1` to `N*N`.\n`k = N*N / 2`\n`small_val = 1`\n`large_val = k + 1`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  If `(r+c)` is even:\n    `board[r][c] = small_val`\n    `small_val += 1`\n  Else (`(r+c)` is odd):\n    `board[r][c] = large_val`\n    `large_val += 1`\n\nLet's test this pattern for $N=4$:\n`k = 8`. Small values: 1-8. Large values: 9-16.\n(0,0) even: 1\n(0,1) odd: 9\n(0,2) even: 2\n(0,3) odd: 10\n(1,0) odd: 11\n(1,1) even: 3\n(1,2) odd: 12\n(1,3) even: 4\n(2,0) even: 5\n(2,1) odd: 13\n(2,2) even: 6\n(2,3) odd: 14\n(3,0) odd: 15\n(3,1) even: 7\n(3,2) odd: 16\n(3,3) even: 8\n\nResulting board for $N=4$:\n1  9  2 10\n11 3 12  4\n5 13  6 14\n15  7 16  8\n\nLet's trace the rook and queen on this board.\nStart at 1 (0,0).

Queen pays 0 vuns.\n\nRook 1 vun, Queen 0 vuns. Still the wrong direction.\n\nThe key must be that the rook gets stuck *before* the queen.\nThis implies the rook consumes all its reachable cells (row/column) and then has to teleport. But the queen, from the same spot, can still reach a small number via diagonal.\nThis happens if the current cell $(r,c)$ has its row $r$ and column $c$ full of visited cells or very large unvisited numbers, but there's an unvisited diagonal cell $(r',c')$ with a small number.\n\nLet's try a different pattern.\nDivide the board into two halves. Fill the first $N \\times (N/2)$ cells with numbers $1, \\dots, N \\times (N/2)$ and the remaining cells with larger numbers. This is a very simple pattern.\nFor $N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\n\nRook: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16. 0 vuns.\nQueen: Same path. 0 vuns.\n\nThis problem is about finding a specific configuration that causes a difference.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has a specific arrangement of numbers.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are placed in an alternating fashion.\nLet $K = N^2/2$.\nCells $1, \\dots, K$ are one set. Cells $K+1, \\dots, N^2$ are another set.\nThe example board for $N=4$:\nNumbers $1 \\dots 8$ (small) and $9 \\dots 16$ (large).\nSmall numbers: (0,0)=4, (0,1)=3, (0,2)=6, (1,0)=7, (1,1)=5, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=8, (3,3)=2.\nLarge numbers: (0,3)=12, (1,2)=9, (1,3)=15, (2,0)=14, (2,2)=11, (2,3)=10, (3,0)=13, (3,2)=16.\n\nNotice that numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are roughly in the positions $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is even.\nAnd $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are roughly in positions $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is odd.\nLet's check the example:\n(0,0) sum 0 (even) -> 4 (small)\n(0,1) sum 1 (odd) -> 3 (small)\n(0,2) sum 2 (even) -> 6 (small)\n(0,3) sum 3 (odd) -> 12 (large)\n(1,0) sum 1 (odd) -> 7 (small)\n(1,1) sum 2 (even) -> 5 (small)\n(1,2) sum 3 (odd) -> 9 (large)\n(1,3) sum 4 (even) -> 15 (large)\n(2,0) sum 2 (even) -> 14 (large)\n(2,1) sum 3 (odd) -> 1 (small)\n(2,2) sum 4 (even) -> 11 (large)\n(2,3) sum 5 (odd) -> 10 (large)\n(3,0) sum 3 (odd) -> 13 (large)\n(3,1) sum 4 (even) -> 8 (small)\n(3,2) sum 5 (odd) -> 16 (large)\n(3,3) sum 6 (even) -> 2 (small)\n\nThe example board does not follow a simple checkerboard pattern. It's a mix.\nThis suggests the pattern is more complex or specific to $N=4$.\n\nWhat if $N$ is odd? For example $N=3$. $N^2=9$. $K=4$.\nSmall numbers $1,2,3,4$. Large numbers $5,6,7,8,9$.\nIf $N=1$, output -1.\nIf $N$ is odd ($N \\ge 3$), it seems there might be no solution.\nIf $N$ is even ($N \\ge 2$), there might be a solution. The example is for $N=4$.\n\nConsider the center of the board. For odd $N$, there's a unique center cell. For even $N$, there are four center cells.\nThe example $N=4$ has $1$ at $(2,1)$, which is one of the \"center\" cells for $N=4$.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are scattered. $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are scattered.\n\nLet's try to fill the board with two alternating groups of numbers.\nGroup 1: $1, 2, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nGroup 2: $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nLet's iterate through rows and columns.\nFor $N=4$:\nNumbers $1 \\dots 8$ and $9 \\dots 16$.\nFill the first $N/2$ rows with alternating small/large numbers, and the last $N/2$ rows with alternating large/small numbers.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's simplify the construction.\nWe need the rook to pay vuns and the queen to avoid them. This means the queen must find a diagonal move to a small number when the rook cannot.\nThis means we want small numbers on diagonals relative to some positions.\n\nConsider filling the first half of the cells (by row-major order) with $N^2$ down to $N^2 - N^2/2 + 1$.\nAnd the remaining cells with $1$ up to $N^2/2$.\nThis means the first $N^2/2$ cells get large numbers, and the last $N^2/2$ cells get small numbers.\nFor $N=4$:\n$N^2/2=8$.\nCells $0 \\dots 7$ (row-major) get $16 \\dots 9$.\nCells $8 \\dots 15$ (row-major) get $1 \\dots 8$.\n\nBoard:\n16 15 14 13\n12 11 10  9\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n\nLet's trace this.\nStart at 16 (0,0). Visited: {(0,0)}.\nCurrent position: (0,0).\nThis starts at the largest number, not 1. The rule says start at 1.\nSo this pattern is not good.\n\nThe rule says \"In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number 1.\"\nSo 1 must be placed somewhere.\n\nWhat if $N$ is odd?\nFor $N=1$, the answer is -1.\nFor $N=3$, $N^2=9$.\nIf we put 1 in the center (1,1).\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\nRook: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9. 0 vuns.\nQueen: Same path. 0 vuns.\n\nIf $N$ is odd, the board has an odd number of cells. $N^2$ is odd.\nThe number of even-sum cells and odd-sum cells are $ (N^2+1)/2 $ and $ (N^2-1)/2 $.\nLet's try the checkerboard pattern (even sum cells get small numbers, odd sum cells get large numbers) for $N=3$.\n$K = \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil = 5$.

Large numbers $6 \\dots 9$.\nEven sum cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). 5 cells.\nOdd sum cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). 4 cells.\n\nBoard:\n1 6 2\n7 3 8\n4 9 5\n\nLet's trace for $N=3$:\nStart at 1 (0,0).

Queen pays 0 vuns.\n\nThis checkerboard pattern (small numbers on even sum cells, large numbers on odd sum cells) always results in 0 vuns for both for $N=3$.\nIt seems that for odd $N$, it's impossible.\nThe problem statement says for $N=1$, \"both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.\" This means 0 vuns. So $N=1$ is -1.\n\nWhat if $N$ is odd and $N \\ge 3$?\nIf $N$ is odd, $N^2$ is odd. The number of cells with (row+col) even is $(N^2+1)/2$, and with (row+col) odd is $(N^2-1)/2$.\nLet's call cells with (row+col) even as 'E-cells' and (row+col) odd as 'O-cells'.\nA rook at an E-cell can only move to E-cells (if it moves two steps in one direction) or O-cells (if it moves one step).\nNo, that's not right. A rook at $(r,c)$ can move to $(r, k)$ or $(k, c)$.\nIf $r+c$ is even, then $(r+k)$ can be even or odd, and $(k+c)$ can be even or odd.\nExample: $N=3$. (0,0) is E.\nRook at (0,0). Can move to (0,1) (O), (0,2) (E), (1,0) (O), (2,0) (E).\nSo a rook can always move between E and O cells.\n\nA queen at $(r,c)$ can move to $(r',c')$.\nIf $r+c$ is even:\n    Horizontal/vertical moves: $(r,k)$ or $(k,c)$.\n        If $k$ has same parity as $c$, then $r+k$ is even.\n        If $k$ has different parity from $c$, then $r+k$ is odd.\n    Diagonal moves: $(r \\pm d, c \\pm d)$ or $(r \\pm d, c \\mp d)$.\n        $(r+d) + (c+d) = (r+c) + 2d$, which has same parity as $r+c$. (E-cell)\n        $(r+d) + (c-d) = r+c$, which has same parity as $r+c$. (E-cell)\nSo a queen at an E-cell can only move to E-cells via diagonal moves.\nA queen at an O-cell can only move to O-cells via diagonal moves.\n\nThis is the key!\nIf we put all \"small\" numbers (e.g., $1, \\dots, N^2/2$) only on E-cells, and all \"large\" numbers ($N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$) only on O-cells.\nAnd assume $N$ is odd. Then there are more E-cells than O-cells.\nE-cells: $(N^2+1)/2$. O-cells: $(N^2-1)/2$.\nSo we put $1, \\dots, (N^2+1)/2$ on E-cells.\nAnd $(N^2+1)/2 + 1, \\dots, N^2$ on O-cells.\n\nLet's retry for $N=3$ with this strategy.\nE-cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2) - 5 cells.

The rook might get stuck.\n\nWhat if we reverse the pattern?\nPut $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ on O-cells, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ on E-cells.\nFor $N=4$:\nO-cells: (0,1),(0,3),(1,0),(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,0),(3,2) - 8 cells.

Queen pays 0 vuns.\n\nRook 4 vuns, Queen 0 vuns. This works! Rook pays strictly less vuns (0 < 4 is false).\nRook pays 4 vuns, Queen pays 0 vuns. This is `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`. We need `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\nSo this pattern also doesn't work.\n\nThe example output for $N=4$ is the only one provided. It's likely that $N$ must be even, and this specific pattern (or similar) is the only type of solution.\n\nLet's re-examine the example output for $N=4$:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nRook path: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14.

(2 vuns total)\n\nThe example output is actually:\n`rook_vuns = 1`\n`queen_vuns = 2`\n`1 < 2` is true. So this is a valid solution.\n\nLet's try to generalize the pattern of the example board.\nThe cells are filled with numbers based on their position.\nThe small numbers (1 to $N^2/2$) and large numbers ($N^2/2+1$ to $N^2$) are mixed.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are assigned to cells based on a specific pattern.\nAnd $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are assigned to the remaining cells.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\nThe example uses $N=4$.\nThe numbers $1 \\dots 8$ are for the first `count = N*N/2` cells.\nThe numbers $9 \\dots 16$ are for the remaining `count = N*N/2` cells.\n\nConsider filling the first half of the grid (rows $0 \\dots N/2 - 1$) with small numbers and the second half (rows $N/2 \\dots N-1$) with large numbers, but with a twist.\nFor $N=4$:\nRows 0, 1: small numbers (1-8)\nRows 2, 3: large numbers (9-16)\n\nLet's try to put $N^2/2$ small numbers and $N^2/2$ large numbers.\nFill the top-left quadrant and bottom-right quadrant with small numbers, and the other two quadrants with large numbers.\nThis is my \"Set A/Set B\" strategy, which resulted in `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n\nThe example board has small numbers (1-8) scattered.\n1 at (2,1)\n2 at (3,3)\n3 at (0,1)\n4 at (0,0)\n5 at (1,1)\n6 at (0,2)\n7 at (1,0)\n8 at (3,1)\n\nLarge numbers (9-16) are also scattered.\n9 at (1,2)\n10 at (2,3)\n11 at (2,2)\n12 at (0,3)\n13 at (3,0)\n14 at (2,0)\n15 at (1,3)\n16 at (3,2)\n\nLet's try to fill the cells $(r,c)$ such that $r < N/2$ with small numbers and $r \\ge N/2$ with large numbers, but alternate columns.\nFor $N=4$:\nRows 0,1 get small numbers (1-8).\nRows 2,3 get large numbers (9-16).\nThis is not $N^2/2$ vs $N^2/2$. It's $N^2/2$ cells for first half, $N^2/2$ for second half.\n\nLet's try to fill the board in a specific order:\nFill cells $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is even with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nFill cells $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is odd with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern that resulted in `rook_vuns > queen_vuns` or `rook_vuns = queen_vuns`.\n\nThe solution for $N=4$ is likely very specific.\nThe problem setter might have found a pattern for $N=4$ and assumed it generalizes.\nIf $N$ is odd, it seems impossible to have a difference in vuns.\nIf $N$ is odd, the number of E-cells and O-cells are different.\nIf $N$ is even, the number of E-cells and O-cells are equal.\n\nIf $N$ is odd, say $N=3$. $N^2=9$.\nE-cells: 5. O-cells: 4.\nIf we put small numbers (1-5) on E-cells, large numbers (6-9) on O-cells.\nQueen at E-cell can always move to another E-cell via diagonal.\nRook at E-cell can move to O-cells or E-cells.\nIf the rook is at an E-cell and all other E-cells in its row/col are visited, and all O-cells in its row/col are large, it might pay a vun.\nBut the queen, from that E-cell, can always find an unvisited E-cell (small number) via diagonal, unless all E-cells are visited.\nIf all E-cells are visited, then all small numbers are gone. Both would pay a vun for the next smallest number (which is large).\nSo queen won't pay a vun more than rook.\n\nThis suggests that for odd $N$, it's impossible.\nSo the answer for odd $N$ is -1.\n\nWhat about even $N$?\nThe example board for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's try to construct a similar board for general even $N$.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are the \"small\" numbers.\nThe numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are the \"large\" numbers.\n\nLet's fill the board with two alternating groups of numbers.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are placed in cells $(r,c)$ such that $r+c$ is even (E-cells) if $r < N/2$ or $r \\ge N/2$ AND $c \\ge N/2$.\nAnd $(r,c)$ such that $r+c$ is odd (O-cells) if $r < N/2$ AND $c \\ge N/2$ or $r \\ge N/2$ AND $c < N/2$.\nThis is becoming too complex.\n\nLet's use a simpler construction that works for $N=4$.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are filled in the cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is even.\nThe numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are filled in the cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is odd.\nThis is also not $N^2/2$ vs $N^2/2$. This is $N \\cdot (N/2)$ cells vs $N \\cdot (N/2)$ cells. So it works.\nLet's try this for $N=4$.\nRows 0, 2 (even rows) get $1, \\dots, 8$.\nRows 1, 3 (odd rows) get $9, \\dots, 16$.\n\nBoard (row-major fill):\n1  2  3  4\n9 10 11 12\n5  6  7  8\n13 14 15 16\n\nStart at 1 (0,0).\n**Rook:**\nReachable unvisited: (0,1)=2, (0,2)=3, (0,3)=4, (2,0)=5, (2,1)=6, (2,2)=7, (2,3)=8.\nMin is 2 at (0,1).

Still `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n\nIt seems the only solution is for $N$ to be even.\nAnd for even $N$, the pattern must be very specific.\nThe example output is probably the intended solution for $N=4$, and for other even $N$, a similar pattern might work.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has:\n- Numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are scattered.\n- Numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are scattered.\n\nLet's try to replicate the structure of the example.\nThe example board has small numbers (1-8) and large numbers (9-16).\nSmall numbers: (0,0)=4, (0,1)=3, (0,2)=6, (1,0)=7, (1,1)=5, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=8, (3,3)=2.\nLarge numbers: (0,3)=12, (1,2)=9, (1,3)=15, (2,0)=14, (2,2)=11, (2,3)=10, (3,0)=13, (3,2)=16.\n\nNotice that the small numbers are mostly in the top-left $2 \\times 2$ block and bottom-right $2 \\times 2$ block.\n(0,0)=4, (0,1)=3, (1,0)=7, (1,1)=5\n(2,2)=11 (large), (2,3)=10 (large), (3,2)=16 (large), (3,3)=2 (small)\nThis is not clean.\n\nThe problem is probably designed such that only $N$ being even has a solution, and for odd $N$, it's -1.\nFor even $N$, we need to put numbers such that the queen's diagonal moves are sometimes blocked, but the rook's are not, or vice versa.\n\nConsider the cells $(r,c)$ such that $r+c$ is even (E-cells) and $r+c$ is odd (O-cells).\nFor even $N$, there are $N^2/2$ of each.\nLet's try to fill E-cells with small numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nAnd O-cells with large numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis is the pattern that resulted in Queen 0 vuns and Rook 1 vun for $N=4$.\nThis means rook pays MORE vuns.

It's possible that the problem expects this specific board for $N=4$ and a simple generalization for other even $N$.\n\nLet's try to make a pattern that is simple and possibly works for even $N$.\nFill the top-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block and the bottom-right $N/2 \\times N/2$ block with small numbers ($1 \\dots N^2/2$).\nFill the top-right $N/2 \\times N/2$ block and the bottom-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block with large numbers ($N^2/2+1 \\dots N^2$).\nThis is what I called \"Set A/Set B\" strategy.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the Set A/Set B strategy:\nSet A: $(r,c)$ where $r<N/2, c<N/2$ OR $r \\ge N/2, c \\ge N/2$.\nSet B: $(r,c)$ where $r<N/2, c \\ge N/2$ OR $r \\ge N/2, c < N/2$.\nFor $N=4$, each set has 8 cells.\nFill Set A with $1, \\dots, 8$.\nFill Set B with $9, \\dots, 16$.\nBoard:\n1 2  9 10\n3 4 11 12\n13 14 5 6\n15 16 7 8\n\nRook: 1 vun. Queen: 0 vuns. (Tested this earlier). Still `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n\nIt seems the example board is the only known solution for $N=4$.\nThe problem asks for *any* such board.\nIf $N$ is odd, output -1.\nIf $N$ is even, we need a construction.\nThe example board is $N=4$.\nLet's analyze the structure of the example board.\nThe cells $(r,c)$ are filled with numbers.\nNumbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are small. Numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are large.\nThe first $N^2/2$ cells (in row-major order) get large numbers, then the remaining $N^2/2$ cells get small numbers.\nThis is:\nBoard for $N=4$:\n16 15 14 13\n12 11 10  9\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\nThis starts at 16, not 1. So this is not valid.\n\nThe problem states \"some chess figure stands in the cell with the number 1\".\nSo cell 1 is the starting point.\n\nThe only remaining option is that $N$ must be even, and there's a specific pattern.\nWhat if we fill the cells $(r,c)$ with $1, \\dots, N^2$ in a zig-zag pattern?\nOr a spiral?\nThese are general filling patterns.\n\nThe problem essentially asks us to find a placement of numbers such that the queen is forced to pay a vun, but the rook is not.\nThis happens if:\n1.  Rook is at `(r,c)`.\n2.  All unvisited cells in row `r` and column `c` are either visited or have large numbers.\n3.  But there is an unvisited diagonal cell `(r',c')` with a small number.\n4.  The queen moves to `(r',c')` without paying a vun.\n5.  The rook has no unvisited cells in its row/column with small numbers. It pays a vun to teleport to the global minimum unvisited cell (which could be `(r',c')` or another small number).\n\nThis requires the queen's diagonal moves to be critical.\nIf the rook is at $(r,c)$, and all other cells in row $r$ and column $c$ are visited or have large numbers.\nMeanwhile, there is a small number $X$ at $(r',c')$ where $|r-r'|=|c-c'|$, and $X$ is the minimum unvisited number.\nThen the queen would move to $X$ without paying a vun. The rook would pay a vun to teleport to $X$.\n\nLet's try to construct such a scenario.\nPlace 1 at $(0,0)$.\nPlace 2 at $(N-1, N-1)$.\nPlace 3 at $(0, N-1)$.\nPlace 4 at $(N-1, 0)$.\nThis creates a situation where small numbers are far apart.\n\nLet's use the pattern from a known solution for this type of problem:\nFor even $N$, fill the cells $(r,c)$ with $r < N/2$ with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in a specific way.\nAnd $r \\ge N/2$ with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in a specific way.\nThis is similar to my \"even rows get small, odd rows get large\" idea.\n\nThe example output's pattern is:\nThe cells $(r,c)$ such that $(r+c)$ is even are filled with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nThe cells $(r,c)$ such that $(r+c)$ is odd are filled with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern.\nBut the example output for $N=4$ does not strictly follow this.\n(0,0) sum 0 (even) -> 4 (small)\n(0,1) sum 1 (odd) -> 3 (small)\n(0,2) sum 2 (even) -> 6 (small)\n(0,3) sum 3 (odd) -> 12 (large)\nThis is not consistent. (0,1) is odd but has a small number. (0,3) is odd and has a large number.\n\nThe solution must be:\nIf $N$ is odd, print -1.\nIf $N$ is even, construct a board.\nFor even $N$, let's try a simple pattern:\nFill the first $N/2$ rows with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ (row by row).\nFill the remaining $N/2$ rows with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ (row by row).\nFor $N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\n\nRook pays 0 vuns. Queen pays 0 vuns. This doesn't work.\n\nThe example output for $N=4$ is very specific.\nIt implies that for $N$ even, we must use a more complex pattern.\nThe problem statement mentions $N \\le 500$. This implies a general construction, not hardcoding $N=4$.\n\nLet's consider the number of vuns. If the rook pays 0 vuns, and queen pays 1 vun, that's a solution.\nThis requires the queen to get stuck (all reachable cells visited) but the rook not. This is impossible as $S_R \\subseteq S_Q$.\nSo the rook must pay at least 1 vun if the queen pays 1 vun.\nThe only way for `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is if the queen makes a move that makes it pay, but the rook makes a different move that doesn't make it pay, or makes it pay less.\n\nThis can happen if the queen chooses a path that leads to more vuns.\nThis means the queen chooses a cell $X$ (min in $S_Q$) and the rook chooses $Y$ (min in $S_R$).\nIf $X$ is a \"bad\" cell that leads to more vuns later, and $Y$ is a \"good\" cell that leads to fewer vuns.\nThis is not how the algorithm works. Both always pick the minimum available number.\n\nThe only way for rook to pay strictly less vuns is if:\n1. At some point, the rook needs to pay a vun, but the queen doesn't. This is impossible.\n2. At some point, the queen needs to pay a vun, but the rook doesn't. This is impossible.\n\nThis implies that the only way to get a difference in vuns is if one piece *teleports* to a cell that is \"bad\" while the other piece *moves* to a \"good\" cell.\n\nThe only way `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is if the queen pays a vun, while the rook doesn't, or pays less.\nThis means:\nWhen the queen is at `curr`, $S_Q(curr)$ is empty, so queen pays 1 vun.\nWhen the rook is at `curr`, $S_R(curr)$ is NOT empty, so rook moves without paying.\nThis is impossible because $S_R(curr) \\subseteq S_Q(curr)$. If $S_Q(curr)$ is empty, $S_R(curr)$ must also be empty.\n\nThis means my understanding of the problem logic for `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is flawed, or the problem has a trick.\n\"Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number.\"\n\"If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number.\"\n\nLet's re-read the example trace carefully.\nRook: ... -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14.\nAt cell 15: (1,3). Unvisited: {14, 16}.\nRook from (1,3): reachable unvisited are none. (1,0),(1,1),(1,2) are visited. (0,3) is visited. (2,3) is visited. (3,3) is visited.\nRook must pay 1 vun. Global min unvisited is 14. So rook teleports to 14. Rook has 1 vun.\n\nQueen: ... -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16.\nAt cell 15: (1,3). Unvisited: {14, 16}.\nQueen from (1,3): reachable unvisited are none. (All horizontal, vertical, diagonal cells are visited except 14 and 16).\nQueen must pay 1 vun. Global min unvisited is 14. So queen teleports to 14. Queen has 1 vun.\n\nAt cell 14: (2,0). Unvisited: {16}.\nRook from (2,0): reachable unvisited are none. (All horizontal, vertical cells are visited except 16).\nRook has visited all cells. Process stops. Rook 1 vun.\n\nQueen from (2,0): reachable unvisited are none. (All horizontal, vertical, diagonal cells are visited except 16).\nQueen must pay 1 vun. Global min unvisited is 16. So queen teleports to 16. Queen has 2 vuns.\n\nThis is the key! The Queen visits 16, but the Rook does not.\nThe Rook stops because after teleporting to 14, all cells are visited.\nWait, no. The trace says Rook goes `... -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`.\nThen \"As a result rook pays 1 vun\". This means after teleporting to 14, the process stops.\nThis means after 14, all cells are visited.\nLet's check the example board:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nThe numbers visited by rook are: 1,3,4,6,9,5,7,13,2,8,16,11,10,12,15. (15 cells)\nThen it teleports to 14. (16th cell).\nSo, after 14 is visited, all cells are visited. So the rook path is 15 cells + 1 teleport.\n\nThe numbers visited by queen are: 1,3,4,2,5,6,9,7,13,8,11,10,12,15. (14 cells)\nThen it teleports to 14. (15th cell).\nThen it teleports to 16. (16th cell).\nSo the queen path is 14 cells + 2 teleports.\n\nThis means the difference in vuns comes from the *order* in which cells are visited.\nThe rook visits 16 earlier than the queen does.\nRook visits 16 after 8. Queen visits 16 as the very last cell.\n\nThe pattern for the example output:\nFor $N$ even, we can construct the board as follows:\nFill the first $N \\times N/2$ cells by going column by column (left half).\nFill the remaining $N \\times N/2$ cells by going column by column (right half).\nNo, that's not it.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\nIf `(r+c)` is even, assign numbers from `1` upwards.\nIf `(r+c)` is odd, assign numbers from `N*N` downwards.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern.\nFor $N=4$:\n1 16 2 15\n14 3 13 4\n5 12 6 11\n10 7 9 8\n\nLet's trace this:\nStart at 1 (0,0).

Still `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n\nIt seems the problem has a very specific solution for even $N$ and -1 for odd $N$.\nThe strategy must be to make the rook visit a large number earlier than the queen, leading to the queen having to teleport later to that large number.\nThe example board has 16 visited by rook at step 9. Queen visits 16 at the very last step.\nThis is what causes the difference.\n\nThe solution strategy is:\nIf $N$ is odd, print -1.\nIf $N$ is even:\n  Create an $N \\times N$ board.\n  Initialize `small_num = 1`, `large_num = N*N`.\n  Iterate `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c)` is even:\n      `board[r][c] = large_num`\n      `large_num -= 1`\n    Else (`(r+c)` is odd):\n      `board[r][c] = small_num`\n      `small_num += 1`\nThis is the pattern that resulted in Rook 6 vuns, Queen 0 vuns. This is `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n\nThe example output's pattern is critical.\nLet's try to generalize the example output:\nFor $N=4$:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nThe cells that get $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ (small numbers) are:\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,3)\nThe cells that get $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ (large numbers) are:\n(0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)\n\nThis is a very specific pattern.\nIt seems that the solution is to fill the first $N/2$ rows with alternating small/large numbers, and the second $N/2$ rows with alternating large/small numbers.\nLet $k = N^2/2$.\nInitialize `small_val = 1`, `large_val = N*N`.\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  If `r < N/2`:\n    For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n      If `c` is even:\n        `board[r][c] = small_val`\n        `small_val += 1`\n      Else (`c` is odd):\n        `board[r][c] = large_val`\n        `large_val -= 1`\n  Else (`r >= N/2`):\n    For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n      If `c` is even:\n        `board[r][c] = large_val`\n        `large_val -= 1`\n      Else (`c` is odd):\n        `board[r][c] = small_val`\n        `small_val += 1`\n\nLet's test this pattern for $N=4$:\n`small_val = 1`, `large_val = 16`.\nRows 0, 1:\n(0,0) even c: 1\n(0,1) odd c: 16\n(0,2) even c: 2\n(0,3) odd c: 15\n(1,0) even c: 3\n(1,1) odd c: 14\n(1,2) even c: 4\n(1,3) odd c: 13\nRows 2, 3:\n(2,0) even c: 12\n(2,1) odd c: 5\n(2,2) even c: 11\n(2,3) odd c: 6\n(3,0) even c: 10\n(3,1) odd c: 7\n(3,2) even c: 9\n(3,3) odd c: 8\n\nBoard:\n1 16  2 15\n3 14  4 13\n12  5 11  6\n10  7  9  8\n\nLet's trace this board.\nStart at 1 (0,0).\n**Rook:**\nReachable: (0,2)=2, (1,0)=3, (2,0)=12, (3,0)=10.\nMin is 2 at (0,2).

Still `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n\nThe problem is specifically asking for `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\nThe only case is $N$ is even, and the example board.\nThe pattern for $N$ even is to fill the first $N/2$ rows with $N^2/2$ numbers and the second $N/2$ rows with the remaining $N^2/2$ numbers.\nThis is the simple row-wise split.\n$N=4$:\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\nRook 0, Queen 0.\n\nThe only way to get `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is if the queen is forced to teleport to a number that is not the global minimum unvisited, but the global minimum unvisited is accessible to the rook.\nThis is impossible by the rules. Both pieces always pick the minimum unvisited number, whether by move or by teleport.\n\nThis implies the only way to get a difference is if the *sequence* of visited cells is different, leading to one piece having more \"blocked\" states than the other.\nThe example trace is very specific. The rook visits 16 early, the queen visits 16 late.\nThis must be the key. The rook \"consumes\" a large number early, leaving the queen with fewer options later.\n\nThe logic seems to be:\nIf N is odd, print -1.\nIf N is even, print the board.\nThe pattern for the board must be very specific.\nThe pattern in the example (for N=4) is what we need to generalize.\nThe cells $(r,c)$ with $r < N/2$ and $c < N/2$ get some numbers.\nThe cells $(r,c)$ with $r < N/2$ and $c \\ge N/2$ get some numbers.\nThe cells $(r,c)$ with $r \\ge N/2$ and $c < N/2$ get some numbers.\nThe cells $(r,c)$ with $r \\ge N/2$ and $c \\ge N/2$ get some numbers.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\nPlace `small_num` (1 to $N^2/2$) and `large_num` ($N^2/2+1$ to $N^2$).\nThe example output for $N=4$ has 1 at (2,1).\nSo the starting point is not (0,0).\n\nConsider filling cells $(r,c)$ such that $r+c$ is even with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ (small) and cells $(r,c)$ such that $r+c$ is odd with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ (large).\nThis is the checkerboard pattern.\nFor $N=4$:\n1  9  2 10\n11 3 12  4\n5 13  6 14\n15  7 16  8\nRook 1 vun, Queen 0 vuns. (Rook pays MORE).\n\nWhat if we fill cells $(r,c)$ such that $r+c$ is even with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ (large) and cells $(r,c)$ such that $r+c$ is odd with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ (small).\nFor $N=4$:\n9  1 10  2\n3 11  4 12\n13  5 14  6\n7 15  8 16\nRook 4 vuns, Queen 0 vuns. (Rook pays MORE).\n\nThe problem states \"Help him to find such $N \\times N$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\"\nBased on the analysis, for odd $N$, it seems impossible for `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\nFor even $N$, the example works, but my attempts to generalize a simple pattern failed to reproduce the desired outcome.\nThe example board is likely a specific construction that leverages the difference in movement.\n\nThe only remaining simple pattern that makes sense is to fill $N^2/2$ cells with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ and the other $N^2/2$ cells with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nLet's try to fill the first $N/2$ rows with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ and the second $N/2$ rows with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis leads to 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe key must be to make the rook visit a large number early.\nMaybe place all $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in a diagonal line, and the rest scattered?\nThis is becoming too complex for a general construction.\n\nThe only reliable strategy given the problem constraints and example is:\nIf $N$ is odd, print -1.\nIf $N$ is even, print the board.\nThe board construction for even $N$ must be a simple pattern that works.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's look at the cell indices $(r,c)$ for small numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$:\n1: (2,1)\n2: (3,3)\n3: (0,1)\n4: (0,0)\n5: (1,1)\n6: (0,2)\n7: (1,0)\n8: (3,1)\n\nAnd large numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$:\n9: (1,2)\n10: (2,3)\n11: (2,2)\n12: (0,3)\n13: (3,0)\n14: (2,0)\n15: (1,3)\n16: (3,2)\n\nThis pattern is not obvious.\nHowever, if $N$ is even, the number of cells is even.\nLet `odd_cells` be cells $(r,c)$ where `(r+c)` is odd.\nLet `even_cells` be cells $(r,c)$ where `(r+c)` is even.\nThere are $N^2/2$ of each.\nLet's fill `odd_cells` with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nLet's fill `even_cells` with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis is the second checkerboard pattern I tried, which resulted in `Rook 4 vuns, Queen 0 vuns`.\nThis is `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n\nThe problem asks for `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\nThe only way for this is if the example board is the intended output for $N=4$, and for other even $N$, a similar pattern exists.\nThe problem setter might have made a mistake in stating it's for `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` instead of `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\nIf it was `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`, then my checkerboard pattern (odd_cells get small numbers, even_cells get large numbers) would be a valid solution for even $N$.\n\nLet's assume the problem statement is correct and `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is required.\nThen for $N$ odd, output -1.\nFor $N$ even, we need a special pattern.\nThe pattern that works for $N=4$ (from example) is:\nFill first $N/2$ rows with alternating small and large numbers (small, large, small, large...).\nFill the next $N/2$ rows with alternating large and small numbers (large, small, large, small...).\nThis is the pattern I tried which resulted in Rook 7 vuns, Queen 5 vuns.\nThis is `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is to use the exact example for $N=4$ and hope for a general pattern for even $N$.\nThe example output for $N=4$ shows:\nSmall numbers: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,3)\nLarge numbers: (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)\n\nLet's look at the parity of coordinates for small vs large numbers in the example.\nSmall numbers:\n(0,0) E\n(0,1) O\n(0,2) E\n(1,0) O\n(1,1) E\n(2,1) O\n(3,1) E\n(3,3) E\nThis is a mix.\n\nLarge numbers:\n(0,3) O\n(1,2) O\n(1,3) E\n(2,0) E\n(2,2) E\n(2,3) O\n(3,0) O\n(3,2) O\nThis is also a mix.\n\nIt seems the problem is harder than a simple checkerboard.\nHowever, often in competitive programming, if $N$ is small, there's a specific trick.\nFor $N=1$, -1.\nFor $N$ odd, -1.\nFor $N$ even, we must print a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for *any* solution.\nGiven the difficulty in finding a simple general pattern, it's possible that the standard solution is to print -1 for odd N, and for even N, print the following specific construction:\nFill the top-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block and bottom-right $N/2 \\times N/2$ block with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nFill the top-right $N/2 \\times N/2$ block and bottom-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThis is the \"Set A/Set B\" strategy.\nWhen I tested this, it resulted in `Rook 1 vun, Queen 0 vuns`. This is `rook_vuns > queen_vuns`.\nBut what if I swap the numbers?\nFill \"Set A\" cells with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nFill \"Set B\" cells with $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\n\nLet's try this for $N=4$.\nSet A (TL/BR blocks) get $9, \\dots, 16$.\nSet B (TR/BL blocks) get $1, \\dots, 8$.\nBoard:\n9 10 1 2\n11 12 3 4\n5 6 13 14\n7 8 15 16\n\nLet's trace this.\nStart at 1 (0,2).\n**Rook:**\nReachable: (0,0)=9, (0,1)=10, (0,3)=2, (1,2)=3, (2,2)=13, (3,2)=15.\nMin is 2 at (0,3).

This works! `rook_vuns < queen_vuns` is true.\n\nSo the strategy is:\nIf $N$ is odd, print -1.\nIf $N$ is even:\n  Create an $N \\times N$ board.\n  Let `small_val = 1`, `large_val = N*N`.\n  Iterate `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r < N/2 and c < N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 and c >= N/2)`: // Set A cells (TL/BR blocks)\n      `board[r][c] = large_val`\n      `large_val -= 1`\n    Else: // Set B cells (TR/BL blocks)\n      `board[r][c] = small_val`\n      `small_val += 1`\n\nThis pattern seems to be the solution.

So it doesn't work for $N=2$.\nThe problem asks for $N \\ge 1$. $N=4$ example is the smallest $N$ with a solution given.\nThis means $N=2$ might also output -1.\nOr maybe the logic is for $N \\ge 4$ even.\n\nThe problem statement doesn't say $N \\ge 4$.\nIf $N=2$ is -1, then it's for $N$ being odd OR $N=2$.\nThis implies the solution is only for $N \\ge 4$ and even.\n\nLet's assume the example output is for $N=4$ only, and for $N=2$ it's -1.
