Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Vanya and Lanterns Solution**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. It's a classic: we've got a street of length `l`, and `n` lanterns at various positions `a_i`. Each lantern has a light radius, let's call it `d`, and lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`. The goal? Find the *smallest* possible `d` so that the *entire* street from 0 to `l` is illuminated.\n\nI'm thinking about the input: we'll get `n`, `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a`. The output needs to be the minimum `d` as a float, with high precision.\n\nLet's break this down. First, the crucial thing is the lanterns need to be sorted.  Sorting `a` is the key to understanding the gaps.  Once it's sorted, call it `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`, the problem becomes much clearer.\n\nNow, consider the critical points.  The start of the street (0) *must* be lit. That means the leftmost lantern, `a_0`, needs to reach at least 0.  Mathematically, that means `a_0 - d <= 0`, or, in other words,  `d` has to be at least `a_0`. Let's call this `d_start = a[0]`.\n\nSimilarly, the end of the street, `l`, must be covered.  So, the rightmost lantern, `a_{n-1}`, must light to at least `l`. That gives us `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`.  Let's call this `d_end = l - a[n-1]`.\n\nThe real crux is the gaps *between* the lanterns.  If we consider two adjacent lanterns, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the segment `[a_i, a_{i+1}]` *must* be lit. Think about it: `a_i` lights up to `a_i + d` and `a_{i+1}` lights down to `a_{i+1} - d`.  These have to meet or overlap.  That is, `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`.  Simplifying, we get `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  So for each gap, we have a minimum required `d`. Let's define `d_gap_i = (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`\n\nThe minimum `d` we're looking for must satisfy *all* these conditions. It's the maximum of all those individual minimums. So, the minimum `d` is `max(d_start, d_end, max(d_gap_i for all i))`.\n\nThe implementation is then pretty straightforward: Read `n`, `l`, and `a`, sort `a`, calculate `d_start`, `d_end`, and all the `d_gap_i` values, and then take the maximum.  That should be it. I'm confident I can make this efficient. Let's code it!\n",
