He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Prefixes and Suffixes Problem: A Python Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem, and here's my game plan.  The goal is to write a Python script that takes a bunch of prefix and suffix strings as input and figures out the original string they came from, outputting a 'P' or 'S' for each input string depending on its role.  The input's a bit tricky: we get `2n-2` strings, which are all the prefixes and suffixes (except the whole string) of some mystery string `s` of length `n`.  The strings are jumbled up, but we know there are exactly two of each length from 1 to `n-1`.\n\nThe main insight here is that the longest strings (length `n-1`) are critical.  One will be the prefix of length `n-1`, and the other the suffix of length `n-1`. I'll call these strings `str1` and `str2`.  The problem hinges on how we can concatenate these two longest strings to recreate `s`.  If `str1` is `s`'s prefix, then `s` must be formed by `str1 + str2[-1]` or `str1[0] + str2`.  Crucially, for this to work, the overlapping parts of those two strings *must* match. More precisely, `str1[1:]` must be equal to `str2[:-1]`. A similar logic applies if `str2` is the prefix.\n\nThe algorithm, as I see it, boils down to a few steps:\n1.  **Input Parsing:** Read `n` and all the strings, along with their original indices, storing them in a suitable data structure to maintain their order.\n2.  **String Identification:** Group the strings by length to easily find the strings of length `n-1`.\n3.  **Hypothesis and Validation:** I'll test two hypotheses: first, that `s_n_minus_1_a` is the prefix and `s_n_minus_1_b` the suffix; then, the opposite way around.\n    *   **Candidate String Generation:** If the condition `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]` is met, I'll construct a candidate string `s_candidate` by combining `s_n_minus_1_a[0]` and `s_n_minus_1_b`.\n    *   **Candidate Validation:** To check if my candidate is correct, I'll generate *all* its prefixes and suffixes and compare them to the input strings.  I'll use frequency maps (with `defaultdict`) to count occurrences of strings efficiently. If the frequencies match, the candidate is a valid solution.\n4.  **Output Generation:** Once I have a valid candidate, I need to generate the 'P' and 'S' output string. I'll iterate through the *original* input strings. If an input string matches a prefix of my candidate *and* hasn't already been used as a prefix (to handle identical prefixes and suffixes), I assign 'P'. Otherwise, it must be a suffix, and I mark it 'S'. I'll use a `used_as_prefix` list to make sure I don't double-count. This will produce the final answer.\n\nThe trickiest part is handling identical prefixes and suffixes for the same length, but I've figured out an approach: iterate the strings with their original indices, so I ensure that one identical string receives 'P' and the other receives 'S'.  I will have a `used_as_prefix` array to check if a length `k` prefix has been used or not.\n\nThe example walkthrough clarified my approach and reinforced that the logic works, even for the edge case where n = 2. So, I think I'm ready to code this up in Python!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to identify which of the given `2n-2` strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of a secret string `s` of length `n`. We are given all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`), with exactly two strings for each length.\n\nThe core idea to solve this problem is to first reconstruct the original string `s`. Once `s` is known, we can easily determine whether each input string is a prefix or a suffix.\n\nHere's the detailed approach:\n\n1.  **Identify Candidate `s`:**\n    *   The `2n-2` input strings include two strings of length `n-1`. Let's call these `str_A` and `str_B`.\n    *   One of these must be the prefix `s[0...n-2]` and the other must be the suffix `s[1...n-1]`.\n    *   **Hypothesis 1:** Assume `str_A` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str_B` is `s[1...n-1]`.\n        *   For this to be true, the substring `s[1...n-2]` must be consistent. This means `str_A[1:]` (which is `s[1...n-2]`) must be equal to `str_B[:-1]` (also `s[1...n-2]`).\n        *   If this condition holds, a candidate string `s_candidate_1` can be formed by taking `str_A` and appending the last character of `str_B`: `s_candidate_1 = str_A + str_B[-1]`. (Equivalently, `s_candidate_1 = str_A[0] + str_B`).\n    *   **Hypothesis 2:** Assume `str_B` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str_A` is `s[1...n-1]`.\n        *   Similarly, check if `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n        *   If this condition holds, a candidate string `s_candidate_2` can be formed: `s_candidate_2 = str_B + str_A[-1]`.\n\n2.  **Validate Candidate `s`:**\n    *   For each candidate string (`s_candidate_1` or `s_candidate_2`), we need to verify if it's consistent with *all* `2n-2` input strings.\n    *   Generate all prefixes and suffixes of `s_candidate` for lengths `1` to `n-1`. This will give us `n-1` prefixes and `n-1` suffixes.\n    *   Count the frequencies of these generated strings.\n    *   Count the frequencies of the *given* `2n-2` input strings.\n    *   If the frequency maps (multisets) are identical, then the candidate `s` is a valid original string. The problem guarantees that at least one such string `s` exists.\n\n3.  **Generate Output:**\n    *   Once a valid `s` (let's call it `s_final`) is found, we need to determine the 'P'/'S' assignments for the original input strings.\n    *   Initialize an array `result_chars` of size `2n-2` to store the output characters.\n    *   Maintain a boolean array `used_as_prefix_for_length` of size `n`, initialized to `False`. `used_as_prefix_for_length[k]` will be set to `True` once we've assigned one of the input strings of length `k` as the prefix `s_final[0...k-1]`.\n    *   Iterate through the *original input strings* in their original order (this is crucial for matching the output format):\n        *   For each input string `input_str` at its `original_index`:\n            *   Let `k = len(input_str)`.\n            *   If `input_str` is equal to `s_final[0:k]` (the prefix of `s_final` of length `k`) AND `used_as_prefix_for_length[k]` is `False`:\n                *   Assign `result_chars[original_index] = 'P'`.\n                *   Set `used_as_prefix_for_length[k] = True`.\n            *   Else (either `input_str` is not the prefix, or the prefix of this length has already been assigned):\n                *   Assign `result_chars[original_index] = 'S'`.\n    *   Finally, print the joined characters in `result_chars`. This strategy correctly handles cases where a prefix and a suffix of the same length are identical by arbitrarily assigning one as 'P' and the other as 'S', which is allowed by the problem statement.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings (with their original indices):\n`('ba', 0), ('a', 1), ('abab', 2), ('a', 3), ('aba', 4), ('baba', 5), ('ab', 6), ('aba', 7)`\n\n1.  **Identify strings of length `n-1 = 4`:**\n    These are `('abab', 2)` and `('baba', 5)`.\n    Let `str_A = 'abab'` and `str_B = 'baba'`.\n\n2.  **Try Hypothesis 1 (`str_A` prefix, `str_B` suffix):**\n    *   Check `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`: `'bab' == 'bab'`. This is true.\n    *   Candidate `s_candidate_1 = str_A[0] + str_B = 'a' + 'baba' = 'ababa'`.\n    *   **Validate 'ababa':**\n        *   Prefixes/Suffixes of 'ababa':\n            *   Len 1: 'a', 'a'\n            *   Len 2: 'ab', 'ba'\n            *   Len 3: 'aba', 'aba'\n            *   Len 4: 'abab', 'baba'\n        *   Frequency map for 'ababa': `{'a': 2, 'ab': 1, 'ba': 1, 'aba': 2, 'abab': 1, 'baba': 1}`\n        *   Frequency map for input strings: `{'ba': 1, 'a': 2, 'abab': 1, 'aba': 2, 'baba': 1, 'ab': 1}`\n        *   The frequency maps match. So, `s_final = 'ababa'`.\n\n3.  **Generate Output for `s_final = 'ababa'`:**\n    `result_chars = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']`\n    `used_as_prefix_for_length = [F, F, F, F, F]` (indices 1-4 for lengths 1-4)\n\n    *   `('ba', 0)`: len 2. `s_final[0:2]` is 'ab'.
