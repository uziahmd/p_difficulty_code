Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Boot Matching Conundrum**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The objective is clear: maximize the number of compatible boot pairs. We're given two strings, 'l' and 'r', representing the colors of the left and right boots respectively, and we want to find the largest set of pairs where the boots are either the same color or one of them is the generic '?' color.\n\nFirst thought is, with the constraints on 'n' being up to 150000, we can't be doing any computationally expensive approaches, like a general bipartite matching that would scale terribly. A more streamlined, greedy solution is likely the way to go.\n\nMy initial approach focuses on categorizing boots by color. Each color gets its own list, which helps in quickly identifying potential matches. We've got 26 specific colors, 'a' to 'z', plus the wildcard '?'.\n\nHere's the plan: We start with a priority system. Exact matches (same color) are most restrictive, so we tackle them first. Then we'll handle matches with the '?' boot, which are inherently more flexible.\n\nFirst, we'll try to match pairs of specific colors. If a left boot has a color, and there's a right boot of the same color, we match those. This gets rid of the most restrictive cases upfront. Anything left over, we'll use a '?' boot to make pairs. We save the '?' to match it with other boots, which is more useful.\n\nNext, we match any remaining specific color boots with the '?' boots. It’s better to use '?' boots to match specific colors than vice versa.\n\nFinally, any '?' boots that are left, are matched with each other. This maximizes pairs and ensures we use up all boots if possible. The objective is to maximize the matches and not waste any boots.\n\nThis looks like a solid greedy approach. We prioritize the most restrictive matches first (exact colors), and then use the more flexible '?' boots for any unmatched boots of the same color. Let’s implement this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left and one right boot. A boot can be part of at most one pair. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are the same (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color (e.g., '?' and 'z', 'a' and '?', '?' and '?').\n3. Specific colors are not compatible if they are different (e.g., 'f' and 'g').\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, as these boots have fewer options for compatibility. If we don't match them first, they might prevent other matches later or be left unmatched.\n\nWe can categorize boots by their color. For each specific color 'a' through 'z', and for the indefinite color '?', we store the 1-indexed indices of left boots and right boots. Using `deque` from `collections` allows for efficient `popleft()` operations.\n\nThe greedy strategy proceeds in three phases:\n\n**Phase 1: Exact specific color matches (`c` with `c`)**\nFor each specific color `c` (from 'a' to 'z'):\nMatch as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible. These are the most restrictive matches, as both boots require an exact color match. By pairing them, we use up two specific-colored boots without touching the more flexible '?' boots.\n\n**Phase 2: Specific color boots with indefinite color boots (`c` with `?`)**\nAfter Phase 1, any remaining specific-colored boots must be matched with '?' boots, or they will remain unmatched. We prioritize these matches over `?` with `?` matches because `?` boots are more flexible and can be matched later.\n- **Phase 2a: Left specific boots with Right '?' boots:** For each specific color `c`, match any remaining left boots of color `c` with available right boots of color '?'.\n- **Phase 2b: Right specific boots with Left '?' boots:** For each specific color `c`, match any remaining right boots of color `c` with available left boots of color '?'.\n\n**Phase 3: Indefinite color boots with indefinite color boots (`?` with `?`)**\nAfter Phases 1 and 2, all specific-colored boots that could be matched have been. The only boots remaining are left '?' boots and right '?' boots. Match as many of these as possible.\n\nThis greedy strategy is optimal because:\n- Phase 1 handles the most constrained matches, ensuring that specific boots that can only match each other do so, thus preserving '?' boots for more flexible pairings.\n- Phase 2 handles specific boots that now *must* use a '?' boot. By doing this before `?` with `?` matches, we ensure that specific boots find a partner. If we used a '?' boot for another '?' boot instead, a specific boot might be left unmatched, leading to a suboptimal solution.\n- Phase 3 handles the least constrained matches with any remaining '?' boots.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- We use two lists of `deque`s, `left_boots` and `right_boots`, each of size 27. Indices 0-25 correspond to 'a'-'z', and index 26 corresponds to '?'.\n- We iterate through `n` input characters to populate these deques with 1-indexed boot positions.\n- Then, we apply the three phases described above, appending matched pairs to a `result_pairs` list.\n- Finally, we print the total number of pairs and each pair.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 10`\n`l = \"codeforces\"`\n`r = \"dodivthree\"`\n\nInitial deques (1-indexed):\n`left_boots`: `c:[1,8], o:[2,6], d:[3], e:[4,9], f:[5], r:[7], s:[10], ?:[ ]`\n`right_boots`: `d:[1,3], o:[2], i:[4], v:[5], t:[6], h:[7], r:[8], e:[9,10], ?:[ ]`\n\n**Phase 1: Exact specific color matches**\n- `c='d'`: `left_d=[3]`, `right_d=[1,3]`. Match `(3,1)`. `left_d=[]`, `right_d=[3]`. `result=[(3,1)]`\n- `c='e'`: `left_e=[4,9]`, `right_e=[9,10]`. Match `(4,9)`. `left_e=[9]`, `right_e=[10]`. `result=[(3,1),(4,9)]`\n- `c='o'`: `left_o=[2,6]`, `right_o=[2]`. Match `(2,2)`. `left_o=[6]`, `right_o=[]`. `result=[(3,1),(4,9),(2,2)]`\n- `c='r'`: `left_r=[7]`, `right_r=[8]`. Match `(7,8)`. `left_r=[]`, `right_r=[]`. `result=[(3,1),(4,9),(2,2),(7,8)]`\n(Other specific colors don't have matches in both left and right lists)\n\nAfter Phase 1:\n`result = [(3,1), (4,9), (2,2), (7,8)]`\n`left_boots`: `c:[1,8], o:[6], e:[9], f:[5], s:[10], ?:[ ]`\n`right_boots`: `d:[3], i:[4], v:[5], t:[6], h:[7], e:[10], ?:[ ]`\n\n**Phase 2a: Left specific boots with Right '?' boots**\n`right_boots[26]` (for '?') is empty. No matches.\n\n**Phase 2b: Right specific boots with Left '?' boots**\n`left_boots[26]` (for '?') is empty. No matches.\n\n**Phase 3: '?' boots with '?' boots**\nBoth `left_boots[26]` and `right_boots[26]` are empty. No matches.\n\nTotal pairs: 4. The example output shows 5 pairs. This discrepancy indicates that the example output for the first case is not unique or my greedy strategy for this specific case yields a different valid maximal set. The problem states \"If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\" The provided example output for the first case is `5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1`. This set of pairs includes `(9,10)` which is left boot 'e' at index 9 with right boot 'e' at index 10. My code correctly matches `(4,9)` and then `(9,10)` in Phase 1 for color 'e'. Let's re-trace my Phase 1 for 'e'.\n\n`left_boots['e'] = [4, 9]`\n`right_boots['e'] = [9, 10]`\n1. `l_idx = left_boots['e'].popleft() = 4`, `r_idx = right_boots['e'].popleft() = 9`. Pair `(4,9)`.\n   `left_boots['e'] = [9]`, `right_boots['e'] = [10]`.\n2. Loop continues. `l_idx = left_boots['e'].popleft() = 9`, `r_idx = right_boots['e'].popleft() = 10`. Pair `(9,10)`.\n   `left_boots['e'] = []`, `right_boots['e'] = []`.\nSo, for 'e', my code correctly generates `(4,9)` and `(9,10)`.\n\nLet's re-trace the entire first example with the code logic:\n`left_boots`: `c:[1,8], o:[2,6], d:[3], e:[4,9], f:[5], r:[7], s:[10], ?:[ ]`\n`right_boots`: `d:[1,3], o:[2], i:[4], v:[5], t:[6], h:[7], r:[8], e:[9,10], ?:[ ]`\n\n**Phase 1: Exact specific color matches**\n- `c='a'` to `c='b'`: No matches.\n- `c='c'`: `left_c=[1,8]`, `right_c=[]`. No matches.\n- `c='d'`: `left_d=[3]`, `right_d=[1,3]`.

No matches.\n- `c='j'` to `c='n'`: No matches.\n- `c='o'`: `left_o=[2,6]`, `right_o=[2]`. Match `(2,2)`. `left_o=[6]`, `right_o=[]`. `result=[(3,1),(4,9),(9,10),(2,2)]`\n- `c='p'` to `c='q'`: No matches.\n- `c='r'`: `left_r=[7]`, `right_r=[8]`. Match `(7,8)`. `left_r=[]`, `right_r=[]`. `result=[(3,1),(4,9),(9,10),(2,2),(7,8)]`\n- `c='s'`: `left_s=[10]`, `right_s=[]`. No matches.\n- `c='t'`: `left_t=[]`, `right_t=[6]`. No matches.\n- `c='u'` to `c='z'`: No matches.\n\nAfter Phase 1:\n`result = [(3,1), (4,9), (9,10), (2,2), (7,8)]` (5 pairs)\nThis is exactly the set of pairs from the example output (order might differ).\nThe remaining boots are:\n`left_boots`: `c:[1,8], o:[6], f:[5], s:[10], ?:[ ]`\n`right_boots`: `d:[3], i:[4], v:[5], t:[6], h:[7], ?:[ ]`\n`left_boots[26]` and `right_boots[26]` are empty.\nPhases 2 and 3 will add no further pairs.\n\nThe total number of pairs is 5, which matches the example output.
