He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Profit in a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. I need a Python script that takes `n` problems, `k` days, and a difficulty list `a` as input and returns the maximum total profit and the problem distribution per day.\n\nMy thought process starts with breaking down the problem. The input constraints and rules are clear. The core idea is to maximize the daily profits, which are the maximum difficulty solved on each day. To achieve maximum total profit, I need to select the largest `k` values from the difficulty list `a` and ensure each serves as the maximum for its respective day.\n\nI need to find a way to place the 'split' points, that is, the end of each day's problems, and I see there's a certain way I have been forming the segments from those `k` values. It's essentially about ensuring these largest `k` values contribute to the total profit.\n\nFirst, I'll sort the difficulty list with their original indices and pick the `k` largest values. The sum of these will be the maximum profit. Now, the trick is to properly allocate each problem to a day. The sort from above will provide me with indices where the largest numbers appear and these will determine the distribution.\n\nI am now focusing on determining the `t_j` values, the number of problems solved on each day. Using these indices, I create segments such that the problem at this index becomes the largest on this day. The approach is to sort the indices of the `k` largest values (`split_indices`). These indices act as points where days end.\n\nSpecifically, I'm creating a sorted list of indices (`split_indices`) associated with the top `k` difficulties. I am going to form segments such that each maximum is *included*. The final lengths will be computed based on the `split_indices` and the total number of problems `n`. These segments, defined by the calculated `t_j` values, will ensure that the selected problems indeed become the maximum for their respective day.\n\nTo recap: find `k` largest values and their indices. Sort those indices. Use these sorted indices to partition the problems into `k` contiguous segments, making sure the segment boundaries ensure the k values are included in their respective segment. This strategy maximizes the profit.\n\nFor the script implementation, I will create pairs of (value, original_index), sort in descending order of value, pick the top `k` and get their indices, and use those to create the segments and determine the `t_j` values.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to distribute `n` problems, given their difficulties `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous sequences (days). Each day's profit is the maximum difficulty among problems solved that day. We need to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Understanding the Goal:**\nTo maximize the total profit, we want each of the `k` days to contribute the largest possible difficulty value. The absolute largest `k` difficulty values in the entire list `a` are the best candidates for these daily maximums. If we can ensure that each of these `k` largest values becomes the maximum of one of the `k` days, then their sum will be the maximum possible total profit.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest problems:**\n    *   Create a list of pairs `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems.\n    *   Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty.\n    *   Take the top `k` elements from this sorted list. These `k` problems will be the ones whose difficulties sum up to the maximum total profit.\n\n2.  **Calculate Maximum Total Profit:**\n    *   Sum the difficulties of these `k` selected problems. This is the maximum total profit.\n\n3.  **Determine Problem Distribution (`t_j` values):**\n    *   Collect the original indices of the `k` selected problems. Let these indices be `idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{k-1}`.\n    *   Sort these `k` indices in ascending order: `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}`. These are the indices of the problems that will serve as the maximums for their respective days.\n    *   We need to divide the `n` problems into `k` contiguous segments. The simplest way to do this, ensuring each `a[p_j]` is included and becomes the maximum of its segment, is as follows:\n        *   The first day's problems (`t_1`) will cover problems from index `0` up to (but not including) `p_1`. So, `t_1 = p_1 - 0`. This segment `a[0 ... p_1-1]` contains `a[p_0]`. Since `a[p_0]` is one of the `k` largest values and `p_0` is the smallest index among the `k` selected problems, `a[p_0]` will be the maximum of this segment.\n        *   For subsequent days `j` (from `2` to `k-1`): Day `j`'s problems (`t_j`) will cover problems from index `p_{j-1}` up to (but not including) `p_j`. So, `t_j = p_j - p_{j-1}`. This segment `a[p_{j-1} ... p_j-1]` contains `a[p_{j-1}]`, which will be its maximum for similar reasons.\n        *   The last day (`t_k`) will cover problems from index `p_{k-1}` up to the end of the list (`n-1`). So, `t_k = n - p_{k-1}`. This segment `a[p_{k-1} ... n-1]` contains `a[p_{k-1}]`, which will be its maximum.\n\n    *   This distribution ensures that each of the `k` selected problems `a[p_j]` falls into a unique segment, and since they are among the `k` largest problems overall, they will indeed be the maximums of their respective segments.\n\n**Edge Case:**\n*   If `k=1`, there is only one day, and it must solve all `n` problems. The length `t_1` will be `n`. The maximum profit will be the single largest element in `a`. The general strategy handles this: `split_indices` will contain one element `p_0`. The loop for `t_j` won't run, and `t_k` (which is `t_1`) will be `n - p_0`. This needs adjustment. The `current_start_idx` should be `0`, and the last segment length should be `n - current_start_idx`.\n\n**Refined `t_j` calculation:**\n1.  Initialize an empty list `t_lengths`.\n2.  `current_start_index = 0`.\n3.  Iterate `i` from `0` to `k-2`:\n    *   `segment_length = split_indices[i+1] - current_start_index`\n    *   Append `segment_length` to `t_lengths`.\n    *   Update `current_start_index = split_indices[i+1]`.\n4.  Append the length of the last segment: `n - current_start_index` to `t_lengths`.\n\nThis refined calculation handles `k=1` correctly. If `k=1`, `split_indices` will have one element `p_0`. The loop `i` from `0` to `k-2` (i.e., `0` to `-1`) won't run. `current_start_index` remains `0`. The last step appends `n - 0 = n` to `t_lengths`. This is correct.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Indexed problems:** `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  **Sorted by difficulty (descending):** `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3.  **Top `k=3` problems:** `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`\n4.  **Maximum Total Profit:** `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`\n5.  **Original indices of these problems:** `[6, 3, 0]`\n6.  **Sorted indices (`split_indices`):** `[0, 3, 6]` (`p_0=0, p_1=3, p_2=6`)\n\n7.  **Calculate `t_j`:**\n    *   `t_lengths = []`\n    *   `current_start_index = 0`\n    *   `i = 0` (for first segment):\n        *   `segment_length = split_indices[1] - current_start_index = 3 - 0 = 3`\n        *   `t_lengths = [3]`\n        *   `current_start_index = 3`\n    *   `i = 1` (for second segment):\n        *   `segment_length = split_indices[2] - current_start_index = 6 - 3 = 3`\n        *   `t_lengths = [3, 3]`\n        *   `current_start_index = 6`\n    *   Loop ends (since `k-2 = 1`).\n    *   Append last segment length: `n - current_start_index = 8 - 6 = 2`\n    *   `t_lengths = [3, 3, 2]`\n\n**Output:**\n`20`\n`3 3 2`\n\nThis matches one of the valid outputs for the example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create pairs of (difficulty, original_index)\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort by difficulty in descending order\n    # If difficulties are equal, the original index order doesn't matter for total profit,\n    # but sorting by index can provide a consistent output for t_j.\n    # We only care about the top k largest values.\n    indexed_a.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Select the top k problems\n    top_k_problems = indexed_a[:k]\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the maximum total profit\n    total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n\n    # Step 5: Get the original indices of these k problems and sort them\n    split_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])\n\n    # Step 6: Determine the number of problems for each day (t_j values)\n    t_lengths = []\n    current_start_idx = 0\n    \n    # Iterate for the first k-1 segments\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The segment for day i+1 starts at current_start_idx and ends before split_indices[i+1]\n        # This segment contains split_indices[i] as its maximum\n        segment_length = split_indices[i+1] - current_start_idx\n        t_lengths.append(segment_length)\n        current_start_idx = split_indices[i+1] # Next segment starts where this one ended\n\n    # The last segment takes all remaining problems\n    t_lengths.append(n - current_start_idx)\n\n    # Print the results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_profit) + '\\n')\n    sys.stdout.write(' '.join(map(str, t_lengths)) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
