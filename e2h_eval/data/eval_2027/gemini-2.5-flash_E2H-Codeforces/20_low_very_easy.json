For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "**Understanding the Beautiful Multiset Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem, and my initial thought is, this seems tricky but solvable with dynamic programming. The core is figuring out how to count valid sets of `c_s` values that lead to a beautiful multiset of a specific size `f`.\n\nThe constraints are manageable: `n` up to 15, `k` and `f` up to 200,000, and we're working in a modulo field.  That suggests we can explore all possible combinations efficiently, as long as we structure the solution properly.\n\nMy first instinct is to think about the binary strings as nodes in a binary tree.  The crux of the problem lies in the relationship between a string `s` and its prefixes within the multiset. The `c_s` values act as constraints on how many times a string can appear in this multiset.  Specifically, `count(s)` must be less than or equal to `c_s`.\n\nWe want to maximize the multiset size, which corresponds to maximizing the count of the empty string (the root of our tree). The key relationship is how `count(s)` depends on its children. If `s` is not a string of length `n`, then `count(s) = count(s0) + count(s1)`. If `s` has length `n`, then the count is simply the number of times `s` appears, which is limited by `c_s`.\n\nThis screams \"dynamic programming\" to me. I'm thinking of defining a `dp[s]` that represents the maximum size of the multiset given the constraints on the subtree rooted at `s`. For strings of length `n`, `dp[s]` is simply `c_s`. For shorter strings, `dp[s]` is the minimum of `c_s` and the sum of `dp[s0]` and `dp[s1]`.  The `min` operation ensures that we don't violate the `c_s` constraints.  The overall multiset size would then be `dp[\"\"]`.\n\nThe actual problem asks us to count the number of valid `c_s` configurations such that `dp[\"\"]` equals `f`. This is where it gets interesting, and where the solution design becomes crucial.  Each `c_s` has `k+1` possible values, and there are a lot of `c_s` variables (about `2^(n+1) - 2` if I counted correctly). So I will need to think how to avoid exhaustive search. I will have to start thinking how to perform DP so that it keeps track of the number of combinations that lead to `f`. It seems like I need to adjust the DP approach or create a separate one on top of the base dynamic programming. I'll need to think about that.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers `c_s` for every binary string `s` of length from 1 to `n` (inclusive), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. Each `c_s` must be between 0 and `k`. We need to output the result modulo 998244353.\n\nLet's define `max_size(s)` as the maximum number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have `s` as a prefix, given the constraints `c_t` for `t` in the subtree of `s`.\nIf `s` has length `n`, then `max_size(s)` is simply `c_s`, because `s` itself is a string of length `n`, and it can appear at most `c_s` times.\nIf `s` has length `L < n`, then any string `t` in the multiset that has `s` as a prefix must either have `s0` as a prefix or `s1` as a prefix. Thus, `max_size(s) = max_size(s0) + max_size(s1)`. However, `max_size(s)` also cannot exceed `c_s`. So, `max_size(s) = min(c_s, max_size(s0) + max_size(s1))`.\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `max_size(\"\")`, where `\"\"` is the empty string (root of the binary tree).\n\nNotice that the structure of the problem is symmetric for `s0` and `s1`. The choice of `c_s` values for strings starting with `0` (i.e., in the left subtree) is independent of the choice of `c_s` values for strings starting with `1` (i.e., in the right subtree), except for their combined effect on `c_s` for their parent `s`. This suggests a dynamic programming approach on the levels of the binary tree.\n\nLet `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all strings `s` of length `L` to `n` that are in the subtree of some string `s_0` of length `L-1`, such that `max_size(s_0)` (if `s_0` were a leaf) would be `val`. More precisely, `dp[L][val]` is the number of ways to set `c_t` for all `t` of length `L` to `n` such that `s_0` is a prefix of `t`, and `max_size(s_0)` (computed using `c_s` for `s_0` and `max_size(s_00) + max_size(s_01)` etc.) equals `val`.\n\nBase case: For `L = n`, `dp[n][val]` represents the number of ways to choose `c_s` for a single string `s` of length `n` such that `max_size(s) = val`. This means `c_s` must be `val`. Since `c_s` can be any value from `0` to `k`, if `0 <= val <= k`, there is 1 way (`c_s = val`). Otherwise, there are 0 ways.\nSo, `dp[n][val] = 1` if `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\nRecursive step: For `L < n`, to compute `dp[L][val]`, we consider a string `s` of length `L`. Its children are `s0` and `s1`.\nWe need to choose `c_s` from `0` to `k`.\nWe also need to choose `c_t` for `t` in the subtree of `s0` such that `max_size(s0) = val_0`, and `c_t` for `t` in the subtree of `s1` such that `max_size(s1) = val_1`.\nThe number of ways to do this is `dp[L+1][val_0] * dp[L+1][val_1]`.\nThen, `max_size(s) = min(c_s, val_0 + val_1)`. We want this to be `val`.\nSo, for a fixed `val` and `c_s`, we need `min(c_s, val_0 + val_1) = val`.\nThis implies two conditions:\n1. `val_0 + val_1 >= val`\n2. `c_s >= val`\n\nLet `S = val_0 + val_1`. We need `min(c_s, S) = val`.\nIf `c_s = val`, then we need `S >= val`.\nIf `c_s > val`, then we need `S = val`.\n\nLet `count_sum[L+1][S_val]` be the number of ways to achieve `val_0 + val_1 = S_val`, where `val_0` and `val_1` are `max_size` values for children at level `L+1`.\n`count_sum[L+1][S_val] = sum_{val_0=0}^{S_val} (dp[L+1][val_0] * dp[L+1][S_val - val_0])`. This is a convolution.\nLet `pref_sum[L+1][S_val]` be `sum_{j=0}^{S_val} count_sum[L+1][j]`.\n\nNow, for `dp[L][val]`:\n`dp[L][val] = sum_{c_s=0}^k (ways_to_get_val_with_this_c_s)`\n`dp[L][val] = (ways_to_get_val_with_c_s=val) + sum_{c_s=val+1}^k (ways_to_get_val_with_this_c_s)`\n\nIf `c_s = val`: We need `val_0 + val_1 >= val`. The number of ways for this is `sum_{S_val=val}^{2k} count_sum[L+1][S_val]`. This is `(pref_sum[L+1][2k] - pref_sum[L+1][val-1])`.\nIf `c_s > val`: We need `val_0 + val_1 = val`. The number of ways for this is `count_sum[L+1][val]`. This term is added for each `c_s` from `val+1` to `k`. There are `k - val` such `c_s` values.\n\nSo, `dp[L][val] = (pref_sum[L+1][2k] - pref_sum[L+1][val-1]) + (k - val) * count_sum[L+1][val]`.\nAll calculations are modulo 998244353. `pref_sum[L+1][-1]` is 0.\n\nThe maximum possible `max_size(s)` for a string `s` at level `L` is `2^(n-L) * k`.\nSo, the maximum `val` can be `2^(n-L) * k`.\nFor `L=1`, the maximum `val` is `2^(n-1) * k`.\nFor `L=0` (the root `\"\"`), the maximum `val` is `2^n * k`.\nThe `f` given in the problem is the `max_size(\"\")`, so `f` can be up to `2^n * k`.\nSince `n=15`, `2^n = 32768`. `k=2*10^5`. `2^n * k` can be `~6.5 * 10^9`, which is too large for DP states.\n\nHowever, `f` is at most `2*10^5`. This means that `max_size(\"\")` is bounded by `f`.\nThis implies that `max_size(s)` for any `s` is bounded by `f`.\nSo, the `val` in `dp[L][val]` can go up to `f`. The convolution `count_sum` will go up to `2f`.\nThe state space for `val` is `f+1`.\nThe number of levels is `n`.\nOverall complexity: `n * (f * log f)` for FFT/NTT based convolution or `n * f^2` for naive convolution.\n`n * f^2` is `15 * (2*10^5)^2 = 15 * 4 * 10^{10} = 6 * 10^{11}`, too slow.\n`n * f * log f` is `15 * 2*10^5 * log(2*10^5) approx 15 * 2*10^5 * 18 = 5.4 * 10^7`, which is feasible.\n\nWe need a number theoretic transform (NTT) for polynomial multiplication (convolution).\nThe NTT modulus is 998244353, which is a prime number of the form `c * 2^p + 1` (`119 * 2^23 + 1`), suitable for NTT.\nThe primitive root is 3.\n\nLet's refine the DP state and transitions:\n`dp[i]` will store the current `dp` array for level `i`. Initially, `dp[n]` is `[1, ..., 1]` (length `k+1`) followed by zeros.\nIterate `i` from `n-1` down to `1`.\nIn each step `i`:\n1. Calculate `poly_prod = dp[i+1] * dp[i+1]` (polynomial multiplication, which gives `count_sum[i+1]`). This is done using NTT. The length of `dp[i+1]` is `f+1`. The resulting polynomial `poly_prod` will have degree up to `2f`.\n2. Calculate prefix sums for `poly_prod`. Let `pref_sum_poly_prod[j] = sum_{l=0}^j poly_prod[l]`.\n3. Create `dp[i]` array of size `f+1`.\n   For `val` from `0` to `f`:\n     `term1 = (pref_sum_poly_prod[2*f] - pref_sum_poly_prod[val-1] + MOD) % MOD` (if `val-1 < 0`, `pref_sum_poly_prod[val-1]` is 0).\n     `term2 = (k - val) * poly_prod[val] % MOD` (if `val > k`, `k-val` might be negative, but `poly_prod[val]` would be 0 if `val > 2k`. More importantly, `c_s` cannot be `val` if `val > k`. The `k-val` factor should only apply if `val <= k`.\n     Let's be careful with `c_s`. `c_s` is from `0` to `k`.\n     If `val > k`, `dp[L][val]` must be 0.\n     So, `dp[L][val] = 0` if `val > k`.\n     For `0 <= val <= k`:\n       `dp[L][val] = (pref_sum_poly_prod[min(2*f, 2*k)] - (pref_sum_poly_prod[val-1] if val > 0 else 0) + MOD) % MOD`\n       `dp[L][val] = (dp[L][val] + (k - val) * poly_prod[val]) % MOD`\n       Note that `poly_prod` values are 0 for index `> 2k`. So `min(2*f, 2*k)` is effectively `min(2*f, 2k)`. Since `f <= k * 2^(n-1)`, `2f` can be larger than `2k`. The `pref_sum_poly_prod[2*f]` is correct as it sums up to the max possible sum.\n\nFinally, `dp[1][f]` will be the answer.\n\nThe problem requires `f` to be the maximum possible size.\nThe state `dp[L][val]` counts ways such that `max_size(s)` is exactly `val`. This is what we need.\n\nMaximum value of `val` is `f`.\nMaximum value of `val_0 + val_1` is `2f`.\nSo, the polynomial degree for convolution should be `2f`.\nThe length of arrays for NTT should be a power of 2 greater than `2f`.\n`f <= 2 * 10^5`. So `2f <= 4 * 10^5`.\nSmallest power of 2 greater than `4 * 10^5` is `2^19 = 524288`.\n\nLet's trace Example 1: `n=1, k=42, f=2`.\n`dp[1]` is the base case. Strings are `0` and `1`.\n`dp[1][val]` is 1 if `0 <= val <= k=42`, else 0.\nWe need `dp[1][f]` where `f=2`.\nThe loop runs for `i` from `n-1` down to `1`. Here `n=1`, so the loop doesn't run.\nThe problem asks for `max_size(\"\") = f`.\nBut `n=1` means strings are `0` and `1`. `max_size(\"\") = min(c_\"\", max_size(\"0\") + max_size(\"1\"))`.\nThe problem statement says \"strings of length from 1 to n\". So `c_s` for `s` of length `n` is involved.\nThe example suggests `c_0` and `c_1` are the only `c_s` values.\nIf `n=1`, the strings in the multiset are of length 1.\n`max_size(\"\") = max_size(\"0\") + max_size(\"1\")`.\nAnd `max_size(\"0\") = c_0`, `max_size(\"1\") = c_1`.\nSo `max_size(\"\") = c_0 + c_1`.\nWe need to count ways to choose `c_0, c_1` (from `0` to `k`) such that `c_0 + c_1 = f`.\nFor `n=1, k=42, f=2`:\nPossible pairs `(c_0, c_1)`:\n`(0, 2)`: `c_0=0, c_1=2`. Both `0, 2` are `<= 42`. Valid.\n`(1, 1)`: `c_0=1, c_1=1`. Both `1, 1` are `<= 42`. Valid.\n`(2, 0)`: `c_0=2, c_1=0`. Both `2, 0` are `<= 42`. Valid.\nTotal 3 ways. This matches the example.\n\nMy DP definition `dp[L][val]` represents `max_size(s)` where `s` is a string of length `L-1`. This is for a single subtree.\nThe final answer is for `max_size(\"\")`, which is at level 0.\nSo `n` iterations are needed, from `n` down to `1`.\n`dp[n]` is for `max_size(s)` where `s` is of length `n-1`. This is `min(c_s, max_size(s0) + max_size(s1))`.\nBut for `n=1`, `max_size(\"\") = c_0 + c_1`. There is no `c_\"\"`.\nThe problem states \"for every binary string `s` with length from `1` to `n`\". So `c_s` is defined only for strings of length `1` to `n`.
