She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Browser Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem in competitive programming.  Let's break down my thinking.  I need a Python script to efficiently determine the minimum time to close unwanted tabs.\n\nThe problem revolves around a set of `n` tabs, a current cursor position `pos`, and a range `[l, r]` of tabs to *keep*.  Everything outside this range needs to be closed.  There are four actions: move the cursor left or right, and close tabs to the left or right of the cursor.  `a` and `b` track the unclosed tab range, and crucially, updating `a` and `b` when tabs are closed is key.\n\nMy core strategy is to recognize that to achieve the desired state (only `[l, r]` unclosed), I must execute two key steps:\n1.  **Close Tabs to the Left:**  I need to close tabs from `1` to `l-1`.  This requires moving the cursor to a position `i` where `i >= l` and using the \"close left\" action, which closes  `[a, i-1]`. To achieve `[1, l-1]`, I must ensure that `a = 1` and the cursor is at tab `l` (or somewhere to the right).\n\n2.  **Close Tabs to the Right:**  Similarly, I need to close tabs from `r+1` to `n`.  This involves moving the cursor to `i` where `i <= r` and using the \"close right\" action.  This closes `[i+1, b]`. To achieve `[r+1, n]`, I need to make sure `b = n` initially and that the cursor is positioned on tab `r` (or to the left).\n\nTherefore, to minimize time, I need to find the most efficient sequence of moves and closes to achieve both conditions.\n\nLet's think about the edge cases.  If `l = 1` and `r = n`, I'm done – nothing to close!  The cost is zero.\n\nIf I only have to close tabs on one side (let's say `l = 1` and `r < n` as an example), the most efficient approach looks pretty simple.  I need to get to `r` (either moving left or right), then close right. That's the only thing to do. So the time is the distance between `pos` and `r` plus one action to close the tabs.  This is simply `abs(pos - r) + 1`.  This simplification shows a clear pattern that likely applies to closing tabs on either side, in most cases, after initial cursor movements.\n\nI'm starting to visualize a possible solution:\n1. If all tabs need to be kept I am done.\n2. Calculate the distance and closing action for the tab set to close on each side.\n3. Determine the most efficient approach for the problem by minimizing the cursor movement and taking into account the updates of the unclosed range limits (`a` and `b`).\nI should be able to create a Python script that takes these considerations into account to produce an optimized solution. The next step is to start writing the code!\n",
