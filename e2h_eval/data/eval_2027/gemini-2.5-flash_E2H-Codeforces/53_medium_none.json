Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:** The user needs a Python script to find the longest substring that repeats within a string of lowercase letters, with a length limit of 100. Overlapping occurrences are allowed.\n\nMy initial approach is to iterate through all possible substring lengths, starting with the longest possible (N-1 where N is the string length) and working downwards. For each length, I generate all substrings of that length and check if they appear at least twice in the string. I keep track of the longest substring found so far.\n\nI started with a nested loop approach. The outer loop iterates through possible substring lengths, and the inner loops check each substring for duplicates. This results in a time complexity of O(N^4), which, while potentially manageable given the input size constraint (N <= 100), might be inefficient.\n\nTo improve efficiency, I considered using `str.find()`. By using `s.find(sub, i + 1)`, I can search for a substring 'sub' starting from a position *after* its initial occurrence. This reduces the time complexity, as finding operations are often optimized.\n\nWith this approach, the time complexity became O(N^3) since `s.find()` would search through at most `O(N)` elements, and substring generation takes `O(L)`. The cubic time complexity looked promising, given N = 100, N^3 = 10^6 which means it will be efficient.\n\nI considered edge cases such as empty input, a string of length 1, a string with all the same characters, and a string with no repeating substrings to make sure that the algorithm returns the correct length. It did so and the revised algorithm's performance felt good.\n\nThe final code utilizes a function and a main loop to handle multiple input strings. The function performs substring comparison and returns the longest length, while the main loop reads input strings from standard input, calls the function, and prints the results to the standard output. The code handles the edge cases as well as different string length combinations, making it ready for implementation.\n",
