A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Soft Drinking Problem: My Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core is figuring out the maximum number of *toasts* we can make, given a bunch of constraints, and ensure each friend gets the same amount. The inputs are fairly straightforward: the number of friends (`n`), the amount of drinks, limes, and salt, and the required amounts per friend per toast (`nl`, `np`).\n\nMy strategy is to calculate how many toasts are possible based on each resource individually (drink, lime, salt) and then take the limiting factor. The limiting factor will be the minimum of those individual calculations.\n\nI'll start by reading the input and converting it to integers. Then, I need to calculate the total available drink (bottles * ml per bottle), total limes (limes * slices per lime), and total salt. After I compute this I can see how many toasts are possible based on the available resource (e.g. `(k * l) // (n * nl)`)\n\nThe result is pretty intuitive: I'll calculate the number of toasts I can make with drink, lime, and salt then take the minimum amount. Because the problem states that everyone drinks the same amount and can only have an integer number of toasts, I need to use integer division. In the end, the result will be the minimum amount of toasts from those individual calculations:\n\n```python\n# Read the single line of input\nline = sys.stdin.readline().split()\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line)\n\n# Calculate the total amount of each resource available\ntotal_drink_ml = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt_grams = p\n\n# Calculate how many toasts each friend can make based on each resource\n# For drink: total_drink_ml / (nl ml per friend * n friends)\ntoasts_per_friend_from_drink = total_drink_ml // (n * nl)\n\n# For lime: total_lime_slices / (1 slice per friend * n friends)\ntoasts_per_friend_from_lime = total_lime_slices // n # Each friend needs 1 slice per toast\n\n# For salt: total_salt_grams / (np grams per friend * n friends)\ntoasts_per_friend_from_salt = total_salt_grams // (n * np)\n\n# The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the minimum of these three values\nresult = min(toasts_per_friend_from_drink, toasts_per_friend_from_lime, toasts_per_friend_from_salt)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```",
