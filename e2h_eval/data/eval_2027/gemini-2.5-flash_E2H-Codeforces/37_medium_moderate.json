    "thought": "**My thinking on the Gluttony problem is as follows:**\n\nI'm aiming for a Python script to solve this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core challenge lies in constructing an array `b`, a permutation of the input array `a`, such that the sums of elements in any non-empty proper subset of indices are different in `a` and `b`. The problem states `n` is small (up to 22), so an `O(n * 2^n)` or `O(n^2 * 2^n)` solution is likely feasible.\n\nFirst, I need to translate the condition into more workable terms.  I rephrase the key requirement: find a permutation `p` such that for every subset `S`, the sum of `a`'s elements at those indices doesn't match the corresponding sum from `b` (which uses the permuted indices from `p`).\n\nConsidering small cases clarifies the behavior:\n- If `n = 1`, the condition becomes trivial. Any permutation of a single element trivially works.\n- For `n = 2`, the solution is just to swap the two elements.\n\nThe crucial insight is that we can represent the difference between element sums as  `sum(c_i)` where `c_i = a_i - b_i`.  The condition becomes `sum_{i in S} c_i != 0` for all non-empty, proper subsets. We also know `sum(c_i)` across the entire array is zero, due to the permutation property.\n\nThe phrasing \"any such permutation\" suggests a constructive approach. I'm leaning toward a greedy strategy or a pattern that might satisfy the constraints. Let's see if sorting and shifting is the answer.\n\nMy hunch is that a cyclic shift of a sorted array might work. I consider the case where `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}` after sorting `a`.\n\nI test the cyclic shift for `n = 2` (it works) and `n = 3` (it works). Proving this generally requires showing that for any subset of indices, the sum of differences doesn't equal zero. I will denote a sorted `a` with `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}` and shift it, creating values `b_0 = a_1, b_1 = a_2, ..., b_{n-1} = a_0`. If I show the sum of `a` values for a set, and the sum of `b` values for that same set are different then this is successful. I can show this if the sum of all elements in the set are negative, meaning `sum_{j in S} c_j < 0`, and the difference will not equal zero.\n\nMy strategy now is to sort the input array `a` based on its values, keeping track of original indices, then apply the cyclic shift to construct `b`. Then, I'll map the shifted values back to their original positions in the `b` array.\n\nFinally, I test with a numerical example to ensure the logic and calculations work correctly.  The logic is proven above. This proves the logic in all cases, so this completes my understanding and the proposed algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S` (i.e., `0 < |S| < n`), the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition `sum_{i in S} a_i != sum_{i in S} b_i`. This is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} (a_i - b_i) != 0`.\nLet `c_i = a_i - b_i`. We need `sum_{i in S} c_i != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\nSince `b` is a permutation of `a`, the sum of all elements in `a` is equal to the sum of all elements in `b`. Therefore, `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i`, which implies `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i = 0`. This is why the condition `|S| < n` is crucial, as for `|S|=n`, the sum is always zero.\n\nConsider the case `n=1`. The condition `0 < k < n` means there are no subsets `S` to check. Thus, any permutation works. Since `b` must be a permutation of `a`, `b` must be `a` itself.\n\nFor `n > 1`, a common strategy in such problems (where any valid answer is accepted) is to sort the array and apply a simple transformation. Let's try sorting the elements of `a` and then applying a cyclic shift.\n\n**Proposed Construction:**\n1.  Store the original array elements along with their original indices. For example, create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)`.\n2.  Sort this list based on the `value` in ascending order. Let the sorted values be `a'_0, a'_1, ..., a'_{n-1}` and their corresponding original indices be `idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{n-1}`.\n    So, `a'_0 < a'_1 < ... < a'_{n-1}`.\n3.  Construct the array `b` such that for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the element `a'_i` (which was originally at `idx_i`) is replaced by `a'_{(i+1)%n}`.\n    In other words, we want `b[idx_i] = a'_{(i+1)%n}`.\n\n**Proof of Correctness (for `n > 1`):**\nLet `a'_0, a'_1, ..., a'_{n-1}` be the sorted distinct elements of `a`.\nWe define `b` such that if `a_k = a'_i` (i.e., `a'_i` is at original index `k`), then `b_k = a'_{(i+1)%n}`.\nThe condition we need to satisfy is `sum_{j in S} a_j != sum_{j in S} b_j`.\nLet `S` be a subset of indices. Let `S_{val}` be the set of values `\\{a_j | j \\in S\\}`.\nLet `S'_{val}` be the set of values `\\{b_j | j \\in S\\}`.\nThe condition is `sum_{v \\in S_{val}} v != sum_{v' \\in S'_{val}} v'`.\n\nMore directly, let `c'_i = a'_i - a'_{(i+1)%n}`.\nFor `i = 0, ..., n-2`, `c'_i = a'_i - a'_{i+1} < 0` because `a'_i < a'_{i+1}`.\nFor `i = n-1`, `c'_{n-1} = a'_{n-1} - a'_0 > 0` because `a'_{n-1}` is the largest and `a'_0` is the smallest.\nThe sum of all `c'_i` is `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a'_i - a'_{(i+1)%n}) = (a'_0 - a'_1) + (a'_1 - a'_2) + ... + (a'_{n-1} - a'_0) = 0`.\n\nNow, consider `sum_{j in S} (a_j - b_j)`. This sum can be rewritten by mapping original indices to their sorted positions.\nLet `S_{sorted}` be the set of indices `i` such that `a'_i` is one of the elements `a_j` for `j \\in S`.\nThen `sum_{j in S} (a_j - b_j) = sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}} (a'_i - a'_{(i+1)%n}) = sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}} c'_i`.\nWe need to show `sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}} c'_i != 0` for `0 < |S_{sorted}| < n`.\n\n1.  If `n-1` is not in `S_{sorted}`: All `c'_i` for `i \\in S_{sorted}` are negative (since `i < n-1`). The sum of negative numbers is negative, so `sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}} c'_i < 0`. Thus, it's not zero.\n2.  If `n-1` is in `S_{sorted}`: The term `c'_{n-1} = a'_{n-1} - a'_0` is positive. All other terms `c'_i` for `i \\in S_{sorted}, i < n-1` are negative.\n    The sum is `(a'_{n-1} - a'_0) + sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}, i < n-1} (a'_i - a'_{i+1})`.\n    For this sum to be zero, the positive term `(a'_{n-1} - a'_0)` must exactly cancel the sum of negative terms.\n    `a'_{n-1} - a'_0 = - sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}, i < n-1} (a'_i - a'_{i+1}) = sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}, i < n-1} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)`.\n    We know that `sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i) = (a'_1 - a'_0) + (a'_2 - a'_1) + ... + (a'_{n-1} - a'_{n-2}) = a'_{n-1} - a'_0`.\n    Therefore, for `sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}, i < n-1} (a'_{i+1} - a'_i)` to equal `a'_{n-1} - a'_0`, the set `\\{i \\mid i \\in S_{sorted}, i < n-1\\}` must be exactly `\\{0, 1, ..., n-2\\}`.\n    This implies `S_{sorted}` must contain `n-1` and all indices `0, ..., n-2`. So `S_{sorted} = \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}`.\n    However, the problem states `0 < |S| < n`, which means `|S_{sorted}| < n`.\n    Thus, `S_{sorted}` cannot be `\\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}`.\n    Therefore, `sum_{i \\in S_{sorted}} c'_i` can never be zero for `0 < |S_{sorted}| < n`.\n\nThis proves that the cyclic shift strategy works for `n > 1`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem statement):**\n`a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`, `n=4`\n\n1.  Store with original indices: `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`.\n2.  Sort by value: `sorted_elements = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`.\n    Let `a'_0=1, idx_0=3`\n    Let `a'_1=10, idx_1=2`\n    Let `a'_2=100, idx_2=1`\n    Let `a'_3=1000, idx_3=0`\n3.  Construct `b` (initialized to `[0, 0, 0, 0]`):\n    For `i=0`: `original_index = idx_0 = 3`. Value to place is `a'_{(0+1)%4} = a'_1 = 10`. So `b[3] = 10`.\n    For `i=1`: `original_index = idx_1 = 2`. Value to place is `a'_{(1+1)%4} = a'_2 = 100`. So `b[2] = 100`.\n    For `i=2`: `original_index = idx_2 = 1`. Value to place is `a'_{(2+1)%4} = a'_3 = 1000`. So `b[1] = 1000`.\n    For `i=3`: `original_index = idx_3 = 0`. Value to place is `a'_{(3+1)%4} = a'_0 = 1`. So `b[0] = 1`.\n\n    Resulting `b` array: `[1, 1000, 100, 10]`. This is a valid answer.\n\n**Special Case `n=1`:**\nIf `n=1`, the logic for `n > 1` doesn't strictly apply because the conditions `0 < k < n` are not met. For `n=1`, there are no proper non-empty subsets. So the array `a` itself is a valid `b`. The code handles this by printing `a` directly.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Store elements with their original indices\n    # This list will store (value, original_index) tuples\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort based on values\n    indexed_a.sort()\n\n    # Create the result array b, initialized with zeros\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Construct b by cyclically shifting sorted values\n    # If indexed_a[i] is (a'_i, original_idx_i),\n    # we want to place a'_{(i+1)%n} at original_idx_i in b.\n    for i in range(n):\n        original_index = indexed_a[i][1]\n        \n        # The value to be placed at original_index is the next element in the sorted list\n        # (cyclically)\n        value_to_place = indexed_a[(i + 1) % n][0]\n        \n        b[original_index] = value_to_place\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
