Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to get the sum of all the card values to zero, and I need to find the *minimum* number of new cards to achieve this. The value of any card (new or old) can't exceed `x` in absolute value.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the current sum of the cards Vanya already has. Let's call this `S`. The problem reduces to finding the smallest number of cards I can add to make the total zero. Therefore, I need to make the sum of the added cards equal to `-S`.\n\nTo minimize the cards needed, I want each new card to contribute the maximum possible value toward `-S`. If `-S` is positive, each new card should have the value `x`. If `-S` is negative, each new card should be `-x`. If `-S` is zero, no new cards are needed.\n\nSo, I'll calculate the absolute value of `-S`, which is `abs(S)`. Then, I'll see how many times `x` fits into this absolute sum. To ensure I cover all of `abs(S)`, I'll use the `ceil` function to round up to the nearest integer. That's the minimum number of new cards needed. I'm using `math.ceil()` to be explicit and easy to read.\n\nLet's test this with a couple of examples. If Vanya has cards with `-1, 1, 2` and `x = 2`, the current sum is 2. The absolute value of the needed sum is 2. So `ceil(2 / 2)` equals 1. This means Vanya needs 1 more card (with the value of -2). That checks out.\n\nIf the cards are `-2, -2` and `x = 3`, the current sum is -4. I need a sum of 4. `ceil(4 / 3)` equals 2. That checks out as well.\n\nThe maximum possible sum is 1,000,000 and the minimal value for x is 1. The approach seems efficient and should work within the given constraints. I'll read in the input and calculate accordingly. Finally, I'll print the result using the python code that I have written to solve this problem.",
