Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Morse Code Sequence Count Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and my immediate thought is \"Python solution, please!\"  It's about counting sequences formed from concatenated Morse code representations, which must be substrings of a growing string `S`.  The key here is that we have to report the count modulo 10^9 + 7 after *each* character append to `S`.\n\nLet's break this down.  We've got the Morse code representation - dots as '0', dashes as '1'.  Valid codes have length 1 to 4, which gives us 30 possible strings.  But, only 26 of them actually map to English letters (those pesky four, \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111,\" are invalid).  So, `valid_codes` is going to be crucial.\n\nThe input is a series of append operations (either '0' or '1') to build `S`.  For each append, we need to output the running count of valid sequences modulo 10^9 + 7.  The problem explicitly states we're counting *non-empty* sequences formed from *any substring* of `S`.\n\nInitially, I thought of a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` would represent sequences ending at index `i` of `S`. But that doesn't quite capture the \"any substring\" requirement. The challenge is that each character appended potentially creates new substrings, meaning we have to consider all possible sequences within *all* substrings, not just ones ending at a particular index.\n\nSo, how do we efficiently count sequences within *every* possible substring?  We need to look at substrings starting at every index of S.\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem but the classic approach won't work in this case. I think a new approach is necessary.\nWe are looking for a method that tracks the total number of valid sequences. I should rethink the dynamic programming approach, maybe there is another formulation.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a growing string `S`. We need to output this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of '0's and '1's. When a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S + c`. We need to find the total number of valid letter sequences for all substrings of the new `S`.\n\nLet `P` be the set of 26 Morse code strings that correspond to English letters. These are all strings of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code representation forms the suffix `S[i:]` (i.e., starting at index `i` and ending at the current end of `S`).\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, let the new length be `N`. We need to calculate `dp[i]` for `0 <= i < N`.\n\nFor a given suffix `S[i:N]`, we can form sequences of letters:\n1.  By taking `S[i:N]` itself as a single Morse code string, if `S[i:N]` is in `P`. This adds 1 to the count.\n2.  By taking `S[i:j]` as the first Morse code string (where `S[i:j]` is in `P`) and then appending any sequence that can be formed from the remaining suffix `S[j:N]`. The number of such sequences is `dp[j]`.\n\nSo, `dp[i] = (sum(dp[j] for j where S[i:j] in P) + sum(1 for j where S[i:j] in P))`.\nThe base case is `dp[N] = 0` (an empty string cannot represent any non-empty sequence).\nThe total count for the entire string `S` would be `sum(dp[i] for i in range(N))`.\n\nLet's refine this. When `S` grows by one character, say `S` becomes `S_old + c`. Let `N_old` be the length of `S_old`, and `N = N_old + 1` be the length of the new `S`.\nWe need to compute `dp[i]` for `0 <= i < N`.\nThe values `dp[i]` for `0 <= i < N_old` are affected because the suffix `S[i:]` is now longer.\nSpecifically, `dp[i]` for `0 <= i < N_old` now includes combinations where `S[i:N]` is formed by `S[i:j]` followed by sequences from `S[j:N]`.\nThe new `dp[N-1]` (for the suffix `S[N-1:N]`, which is just the last character `c`) needs to be computed from scratch.\n\nLet `dp[i]` denote the number of sequences that can be formed using the substring `S[i:]` (which goes to the very end of the current `S`).\nWhen `S` has length `k`, the `dp` array stores `dp[0], dp[1], ..., dp[k-1]`.\nWhen a new character `s_k` is appended, `S` becomes `S_0 S_1 ... S_k`.\nThe new `dp` array will have `k+1` elements.\nThe new `dp[k]` is calculated based on `S[k:k+1]`.\nThe new `dp[i]` for `i < k` is calculated based on `S[i:k+1]`.\n\nLet `current_dp[i]` be the number of sequences that can be formed using the suffix `S[i:]`.\nWhen `S` has length `N`:\n`current_dp[N]` is 0.\nFor `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `current_dp[i] = 0`\n  For `length` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `i + length <= N`:\n      Let `sub = S[i : i + length]`\n      If `sub` is in `P`:\n        `current_dp[i] = (current_dp[i] + 1 + current_dp[i + length]) % MOD`\n\nThe total count for the current `S` is `sum(current_dp[i] for i in range(N)) % MOD`.\n\nLet's trace this with an example. `S = \"111\"`. `P` contains \"1\", \"11\", \"111\".\nInitially `S` is empty.\n1.  Append '1'. `S = \"1\"`. `N = 1`.\n    *   `dp[1] = 0`.\n    *   `i = 0`: `S[0:1]` is \"1\". \"1\" is in `P`.\n        `dp[0] = (1 + dp[1]) = 1`.\n    Total `sum(dp) = dp[0] = 1`. Output: 1.\n\n2.  Append '1'. `S = \"11\"`. `N = 2`.\n    *   `dp[2] = 0`.\n    *   `i = 1`: `S[1:2]` is \"1\". \"1\" in `P`.\n        `dp[1] = (1 + dp[2]) = 1`.\n    *   `i = 0`:\n        *   `S[0:1]` is \"1\". \"1\" in `P`. Add `(1 + dp[1]) = (1 + 1) = 2`.\n        *   `S[0:2]` is \"11\". \"11\" in `P`. Add `(1 + dp[2]) = (1 + 0) = 1`.\n        `dp[0] = (2 + 1) = 3`.\n    Total `sum(dp) = dp[0] + dp[1] = 3 + 1 = 4`. Wait, example output is 3.\n    The example output counts sequences from *any substring*. My `dp[i]` definition is for sequences ending at `N`.\n    The problem asks for `sum(num_sequences_for_substring(S[i:j]))`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of sequences of letters that can be formed using Morse codes, whose concatenation forms the prefix `S[0:k]`. This is not what is asked.\nThe problem asks for the total number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of `S`.\n\nLet `total_count` be the answer after `k` characters. When `k+1`-th character is appended, `S` becomes `S'`.\nThe new `total_count` will be:\n`total_count_old` (for substrings of `S`)\n`+`\n`new_sequences_ending_at_index_k` (for substrings `S'[i:k+1]`)\n\nLet `f[i]` be the number of sequences of letters that can be formed using `S[i:]` (the suffix starting at `i` and ending at the current end of `S`).\nWhen a character is appended, `S` grows by one. Let `N` be the new length.\nWe need to calculate `f[i]` for `0 <= i < N`.\n`f[N]` is 0.\nFor `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `f[i] = 0`\n  For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `i + L <= N`:\n      `substring = S[i : i + L]`\n      If `substring` is a valid Morse code:\n        `f[i] = (f[i] + 1 + f[i + L]) % MOD`\n\nThe `f` values represent sequences that *end* at the current end of `S`.\nThe total count is `sum(f[i] for i in range(N))`. This is actually the sum of sequences that end at *any* position `j` from `i` to `N-1`. This is because `f[i+L]` already includes sequences ending at `N`.\nNo, `f[i]` is the count of sequences that use `S[i:]`.\nIf we have `S = \"111\"`.\n`N=1, S=\"1\"`: `f[0]=1` (for \"1\"). Total = 1.\n`N=2, S=\"11\"`:\n  `f[2]=0`\n  `f[1]`: `S[1:2]=\"1\"`. \"1\" is valid. `f[1] = (1 + f[2]) = 1`.\n  `f[0]`:\n    `S[0:1]=\"1\"`. \"1\" is valid. Add `(1 + f[1]) = (1+1) = 2`.\n    `S[0:2]=\"11\"`. \"11\" is valid. Add `(1 + f[2]) = (1+0) = 1`.\n    `f[0] = (2+1) = 3`.\nTotal = `f[0] + f[1] = 3 + 1 = 4`. This is still not matching the example.\nThe example output for \"11\" is 3. The sequences are \"T\" (from \"1\"), \"M\" (from \"11\"), \"TT\" (from \"11\").\nMy `f[0]` correctly counts \"T\" (from \"1\"), \"M\" (from \"11\"), \"TT\" (from \"11\").\nMy `f[1]` counts \"T\" (from \"1\").\nThe problem is asking for distinct letter sequences. \"T\" from `S[0:1]` and \"T\" from `S[1:2]` are distinct.\nThe example output for `S=\"11\"` is 3.\n\"1\" -> T\n\"11\" -> M\n\"11\" -> TT\nThis means `f[0]` for \"11\" is 3. `f[1]` for \"1\" is 1.\nThe sum `f[0] + f[1]` is `3+1=4`. This implies that `f[0]` is for `S[0:N]` and `f[1]` is for `S[1:N]`.\nThe problem phrasing: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThis means we iterate over all possible substrings `S[i:j]`, and for each `S[i:j]`, we count the number of sequences it can represent. Then sum these counts.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the total count of sequences ending at index `k` (i.e., using substring `S[j:k+1]` for some `j <= k`).\nWhen `S` has length `N`, we need to compute `dp[N-1]`.\n`dp[k] = sum( (1 + dp[j-1]) for j where S[j:k+1] is a valid Morse code)`.\nBase case: `dp[-1] = 0`.\nLet's try this. `S` is built up. Let `S_curr` be the current string.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of sequences that can be formed using `S_curr[0:i+1]` (i.e., ending at index `i`).\nWhen a new character `c` is appended, `S_curr` becomes `S_prev + c`. Let `N` be the new length.\nWe need to calculate `dp[N-1]`.\n`dp[N-1] = 0`.\nFor `L` from `1` to `4`:\n  If `N - L >= 0`:\n    `substring = S_curr[N-L : N]`\n    If `substring` is in `P`:\n      `dp[N-1] = (dp[N-1] + 1 + (dp[N-L-1] if N-L-1 >= 0 else 0)) % MOD`.\nThe total answer is `sum(dp[i] for i in range(N)) % MOD`.\n\nExample: `S = \"111\"`. `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nInitial `dp` array is empty. `S_curr = \"\"`.\n1.  Append '1'. `S_curr = \"1\"`. `N = 1`.\n    `dp = [0]`\n    Calculate `dp[0]`:\n      `L=1`: `N-L=0`. `substring = S_curr[0:1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" in `P`.\n        `dp[0] = (0 + 1 + (dp[-1] (which is 0))) = 1`.\n    Current `dp = [1]`.\n    Total answer = `sum(dp) = 1`. Output: 1.\n\n2.  Append '1'. `S_curr = \"11\"`. `N = 2`.\n    `dp = [1, 0]` (old `dp[0]` is carried over, `dp[1]` is new)\n    Calculate `dp[1]`:\n      `L=1`: `N-L=1`. `substring = S_curr[1:2] = \"1\"`. \"1\" in `P`.\n        `dp[1] = (0 + 1 + (dp[0])) = (1 + 1) = 2`.\n      `L=2`: `N-L=0`. `substring = S_curr[0:2] = \"11\"`. \"11\" in `P`.\n        `dp[1] = (2 + 1 + (dp[-1] (which is 0))) = (2 + 1) = 3`.\n    Current `dp = [1, 3]`.\n    Total answer = `sum(dp) = 1 + 3 = 4`. Still not 3.\n\nThe problem formulation is tricky. \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThis means for each substring `sub` of `S`, we find `count(sub)`, the number of ways `sub` can be parsed into a sequence of letters. Then we sum `count(sub)` over all substrings.\n\nLet `f[k]` be the number of sequences of letters that can be formed using the string `S_curr[0:k]`. This is not what we want.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse `S[0:i]` into a sequence of letters. `dp[0]=1` for empty string.\n`dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j < i where S[j:i] is a valid code)`.\nThis counts sequences ending at `i`.\nLet `current_dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[i:N]` into a sequence of letters.\nThis is what I used first, but the total sum was wrong.\n\nLet's re-read the example: `S=\"111\"`.\nSubstrings are:\n\"1\": represents \"T\". Count = 1.\n\"11\": represents \"M\", \"TT\". Count = 2.\n\"111\": represents \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". Count = 4.\nTotal = `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. This matches the example output for \"111\".\n\nThis means for each substring `sub`, we calculate how many letter sequences it can represent.\nLet `count_sequences(text)` be this function.\n`count_sequences(text)`:\n  Let `dp_sub[i]` be the number of ways to parse `text[i:]` into sequences of letters.\n  `dp_sub[len(text)] = 1` (empty string can be parsed in 1 way, as an empty sequence).\n  For `i` from `len(text)-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp_sub[i] = 0`\n    For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n      If `i + L <= len(text)`:\n        `morse_code = text[i : i + L]`\n        If `morse_code` is in `P`:\n          `dp_sub[i] = (dp_sub[i] + dp_sub[i + L]) % MOD`\n  `return (dp_sub[0] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` (subtract 1 because `dp_sub[0]` includes the empty sequence).\n\nNow, when `S` has length `N`, we need to calculate `sum(count_sequences(S[i:j]) for 0 <= i < j <= N)`.\nThis is `O(N^2)` substrings, and `count_sequences` takes `O(4*length_of_substring)` time. Total `O(N^3)`.\n`N=3000` means `N^3 = 2.7 * 10^{10}`, too slow.\n\nWe need a faster way to update the total sum.\nWhen `S` grows from `S_prev` (length `N-1`) to `S` (length `N`), the new substrings are those ending at index `N-1`.\nThese are `S[0:N]`, `S[1:N]`, ..., `S[N-1:N]`.\nWe need to calculate `count_sequences(S[i:N])` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`, and add these to the running total.\nCalculating `count_sequences(S[i:N])` for each `i` is `O(4 * (N-i))`.\nSumming this for all `i` is `O(4 * N^2) = O(N^2)`.\n`N=3000` means `N^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is feasible.\n\nLet `dp_suffixes[i]` be `count_sequences(S[i:N])`.\nWhen `S` has length `N`, we calculate `dp_suffixes[i]` for `i = N-1` down to `0`.\n`dp_suffixes[N]` is defined as 0 for convenience (no letters).\nFor `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_suffixes[i] = 0`\n  For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `i + L <= N`:\n      `substring = S[i : i + L]`\n      If `substring` is in `P`:\n        `dp_suffixes[i] = (dp_suffixes[i] + 1 + dp_suffixes[i + L]) % MOD`\nThis `dp_suffixes[i]` directly gives `count_sequences(S[i:N])`.\nThe `1` accounts for `substring` itself being a single letter sequence.\nThe `dp_suffixes[i+L]` accounts for `substring` followed by any sequence from `S[i+L:N]`.\n\nLet's re-trace `S=\"111\"` with this definition:\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`S_list` will store the characters of `S`. `dp_suffixes` will store `dp_suffixes[i]` values.\n\n1.  Append '1'. `S_list = ['1']`. `N = 1`.\n    `dp_suffixes` array needs size `N+1`. Initialize `dp_suffixes = [0, 0]`.\n    `dp_suffixes[1] = 0`.\n    `i = 0`: `S_list[0:1]` is \"1\".

Count = 1. Total = 1.\n`S=\"11\"`:\n  Substring \"1\": \"T\". Count = 1.\n  Substring \"1\": \"T\". Count = 1.\n  Substring \"11\": \"M\", \"TT\". Count = 2.\n  Total = `1+1+2 = 4`.\n  Wait, the example output says 3 for \"11\".\n  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n  This means the \"T\" from `S[0:1]` and \"T\" from `S[1:2]` are considered the same if their Morse code is the same? No, \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\n  This implies that \"T\" from `S[0:1]` and \"T\" from `S[1:2]` are distinct.\n  The example output for \"11\" is 3. This means:\n  \"T\" (from `S[0:1]`)\n  \"M\" (from `S[0:2]`)\n  \"TT\" (from `S[0:2]`)\n  The example output does not include \"T\" from `S[1:2]`. This means the problem is asking for sequences that *end at the current end of S*.\n  This is `sum(count_sequences(S[i:N]) for i in range(N))`.\n  But my `dp_suffixes[i]` is exactly `count_sequences(S[i:N])`.\n  So the total sum should be `sum(dp_suffixes[i] for i in range(N))`.\n\nLet's re-read the problem very carefully: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThe example output for `S=\"11\"` is 3.\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\nThese are exactly the sequences formed by `S[0:1]` and `S[0:2]`.\nIt seems the example output is counting sequences for `S[0:N]` only, not for all substrings.\nNo, it explicitly says \"some substring of S\".\n\"Let us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to S, so S is \"111\".\nAs you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\"\nFor `S=\"111\"`, the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\".\nLet's list the sequences for each substring:\n`S[0:1]=\"1\"`: \"T\" (1 sequence)\n`S[1:2]=\"1\"`: \"T\" (1 sequence)\n`S[2:3]=\"1\"`: \"T\" (1 sequence)\n`S[0:2]=\"11\"`: \"M\", \"TT\" (2 sequences)\n`S[1:3]=\"11\"`: \"M\", \"TT\" (2 sequences)\n`S[0:3]=\"111\"`: \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" (4 sequences)\nTotal = `1+1+1+2+2+4 = 11`.\nThe example output for \"111\" is 7.\n\nThis means my interpretation of \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\" is incorrect.\nThe example's list for \"111\" is:\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"111\")\nThis list does not distinguish between \"1\" at index 0 and \"1\" at index 1. It only lists the unique sequences of letters.\nThis makes the problem much harder. We need to find the *set* of all possible sequences, then count the size of the set.\nA set of strings can grow very large. `m=3000`. `26^4` is already large.\nThe total number of sequences can be \"tremendous\", which suggests we are not counting unique sequences but rather occurrences.\nIf it were unique sequences, `10^9 + 7` modulo would be strange. Usually, modulo is for counts of *distinct* items.\n\"Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo 10^9 + 7.\"\n\nLet's assume the problem statement means exactly what the example output implies.\nFor `S=\"111\"`, the output 7 comes from these sequences:\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"111\")\nThis list is the union of sequences generated by `S[0:1]`, `S[0:2]`, `S[0:3]`.\nIf this is the case, then the problem is asking for `count_sequences(S[0:N])` after each step.\nLet's verify this for `S=\"11\"`:\n`S[0:1]=\"1\"`: \"T\" (1 sequence)\n`S[0:2]=\"11\"`: \"M\", \"TT\" (2 sequences)\nTotal = `1+2 = 3`. This matches the example output for \"11\".\n\nSo, the problem asks for `count_sequences(S)` where `S` is the string accumulated so far.\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways to parse `S[0:k]` into a sequence of letters.\n`dp[0] = 1` (empty string, empty sequence).\nFor `k` from `1` to `N`:\n  `dp[k] = 0`\n  For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k - L >= 0`:\n      `substring = S[k-L : k]`\n      If `substring` is in `P`:\n        `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k-L]) % MOD`\nThe answer after `N` characters is `(dp[N] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` (subtract 1 for the empty sequence).\n\nLet's try this with `S=\"111\"`.\n`S_list` will be `S`. `dp` array will store `dp[k]` values.\nInitial `S_list = []`, `dp = [1]` (for `dp[0]`).\n1.  Append '1'. `S_list = ['1']`. `N = 1`.\n    `dp` array needs size `N+1`. `dp = [1, 0]`.\n    Calculate `dp[1]`:\n      `L=1`: `k-L=0`. `substring = S_list[0:1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" in `P`.\n        `dp[1] = (0 + dp[0]) = 1`.\n    Current `dp = [1, 1]`.\n    Answer = `(dp[1] - 1 + MOD) % MOD = (1 - 1) = 0`. This is not 1.\n\nThe issue is how `count_sequences(text)` is defined.\n`count_sequences(text)` should be `dp_sub[0]` in my earlier definition (where `dp_sub[i]` is sequences from `text[i:]`), but `dp_sub[len(text)]` should be 0, not 1.\nIf `dp_sub[len(text)] = 0`, then `dp_sub[0]` will be the sum of `(1 + dp_sub[i+L])` which is exactly the count of non-empty sequences.\n\nLet's retry `count_sequences(text)`:\n  `dp_sub[len(text)] = 0` (empty suffix has 0 non-empty sequences).\n  For `i` from `len(text)-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp_sub[i] = 0`\n    For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n      If `i + L <= len(text)`:\n        `morse_code = text[i : i + L]`\n        If `morse_code` is in `P`:\n          `dp_sub[i] = (dp_sub[i] + 1 + dp_sub[i + L]) % MOD`\n  `return dp_sub[0]`.\n\nUsing this definition for `count_sequences(S)`:\nInitial `S_list = []`.\n1.  Append '1'. `S_list = ['1']`. `N = 1`.\n    `dp_sub` array size `N+1`. `dp_sub = [0, 0]`.\n    `dp_sub[1] = 0`.\n    `i = 0`: `S_list[0:1]` is \"1\".

Example output: 7.\n    My calculation for `S[0:3]=\"111\"`:\n    \"O\" (111)\n    \"T\" (1) + \"M\" (11) -> TM\n    \"M\" (11) + \"T\" (1) -> MT\n    \"T\" (1) + \"T\" (1) + \"T\" (1) -> TTT\n    \"T\" (1)\n    \"M\" (11)\n    Total 6. Where is the 7th? The example lists 7.\n    \"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n    \"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n    \"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n    \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n    \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n    \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n    \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\n    This list is indeed 7 items long.\n    My `dp_sub[0]` calculation for `S=\"111\"` gives 6.\n    Let's check `dp_sub[0]` for \"111\" by hand:\n    `dp_sub[3] = 0`\n    `dp_sub[2]` for `S[2:3]=\"1\"`: `1 + dp_sub[3] = 1`.\n    `dp_sub[1]` for `S[1:3]=\"11\"`:\n      `S[1:2]=\"1\"`: `1 + dp_sub[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n      `S[1:3]=\"11\"`: `1 + dp_sub[3] = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n      Total for `dp_sub[1]` is `2+1 = 3`.\n    `dp_sub[0]` for `S[0:3]=\"111\"`:\n      `S[0:1]=\"1\"`: `1 + dp_sub[1] = 1 + 3 = 4`.\n      `S[0:2]=\"11\"`: `1 + dp_sub[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n      `S[0:3]=\"111\"`: `1 + dp_sub[3] = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n      Total for `dp_sub[0]` is `4+2+1 = 7`.\n    Aha! My manual `dp_sub[0]` calculation was wrong in the trace. The code logic for `dp_sub[0]` sums up the contributions correctly.\n    So, for `S=\"111\"`, `dp_sub[0]` is 7. This matches the example.\n\nTherefore, the problem is indeed asking for `count_sequences(S)` where `S` is the full string accumulated so far.\nThe approach:\n1.  Maintain the string `S` as a list of characters.\n2.  Maintain a `dp` array, where `dp[i]` is the number of non-empty sequences of letters that can be formed using the suffix `S[i:]`.\n3.  When a new character is appended, say `c`, to `S`:\n    a.  Append `c` to `S_list`. Let the new length be `N`.\n    b.  Resize `dp` to `N+1` elements. `dp[N]` is initialized to 0.\n    c.  For `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n        `dp[i] = 0`\n        For `L` from `1` to `4`:\n          If `i + L <= N`:\n            `substring = S_list[i : i + L]` (convert to string for lookup)\n            If `substring` is in `P`:\n              `dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1 + dp[i + L]) % MOD`\n    d.  The answer for this step is `dp[0]`. Print it.\n\nThe `P` set:\nStrings of length 1: \"0\", \"1\" (2 total)\nStrings of length 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" (4 total)\nStrings of length 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\" (8 total)\nStrings of length 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0011\", \"0100\", \"0101\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\", \"1110\", \"1111\" (16 total)\nTotal = 2+4+8+16 = 30.\nExclude: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nSo `P` has `30 - 4 = 26` elements.\n\nPrecompute `P`:\n`valid_codes = set()`\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n`for length in range(1, 5):`\n  `for i in range(2**length):`\n    `s = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)`\n    `if s not in invalid_codes:`\n      `valid_codes.add(s)`\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is `m = 3000`.\nIn each step, we iterate `i` from `N-1` down to `0` (`N` times).\nInside, we iterate `L` from `1` to `4` (constant 4 times).\nString slicing `S_list[i : i + L]` and converting to string for set lookup takes `O(L)` time.\nTotal time complexity per step: `O(N * 4 * 4) = O(N)`.\nTotal time complexity for `m` steps: `sum_{N=1 to m} O(N) = O(m^2)`.\n`m = 3000`, so `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is perfectly fine for competitive programming (usually `10^8` operations per second).\n\nMemory: `S_list` takes `O(m)` space. `dp` array takes `O(m)` space. Total `O(m)`.\n`3000` integers and `3000` characters is negligible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    # Precompute valid Morse codes\n    valid_codes = set()\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        # Generate all binary strings of current length\n        for i in range(2**length):\n            s = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if s not in invalid_codes:\n                valid_codes.add(s)\n\n    # S will store the current Morse code string as a list of characters\n    S_list = []\n    # dp[i] will store the number of non-empty sequences of English letters\n    # that can be formed using the suffix S_list[i:]\n    # dp array will be dynamically sized\n    dp = []\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S_list.append(char)\n        N = len(S_list)\n\n        # Resize dp array. dp[N] will be 0 (no sequences from empty suffix)\n        # We need dp values up to N, so N+1 elements\n        # Python's list extend/append handles this, but we need to reinitialize\n        # for indices beyond current N-1\n        dp = [0] * (N + 1) # All values are 0, including dp[N]\n\n        # Calculate dp[i] for i from N-1 down to 0\n        for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):\n            current_dp_i = 0\n            for length in range(1, 5):\n                if i + length <= N:\n                    # Extract substring S_list[i : i + length]\n                    substring = \"\".join(S_list[i : i + length])\n                    \n                    if substring in valid_codes:\n                        # If substring is a valid Morse code:\n                        # 1.
