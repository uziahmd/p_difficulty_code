The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Abnormal Permutation Pairs Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Abnormal Permutation Pairs\" problem (hard version). It wants a Python solution, and the core challenge is this: given `n`, find the number of permutation pairs `(p, q)` where `p` is lexicographically *smaller* than `q`, but has *more* inversions than `q`. We need to print the result modulo `mod`.  `n` can be up to 500, and `mod` can be quite large, which is a key consideration.\n\nMy immediate thought is that this screams dynamic programming.  The problem deals with permutations and inversions, which are classically handled with DP.  Since we're comparing two permutations, I anticipate a multi-dimensional DP setup.\n\nLet's break down the conditions. The lexicographical condition means there's a point `k` where `p` and `q` are identical up to `k-1`, and at position `k`, `p[k] < q[k]`. The inversions condition is straightforward: `inv(p) > inv(q)`.\n\nNow, the classic DP approach for inversions involves `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of permutations of length `i` with exactly `j` inversions.  This seems relevant.  However, the maximum number of inversions for `n=500` is huge (124750).  That's a lot of states for `j`!  So I'm leaning toward using this, but need to be mindful of optimization.\n\nThinking about building these permutations element by element, the recurrence for `dp_inv[i][j]` is:  `dp_inv[i][j] = sum(dp_inv[i-1][j - k])` for `k` from 0 to `i-1`.  I recall that this can be optimized to: `dp_inv[i][j] = dp_inv[i][j-1] + dp_inv[i-1][j] - dp_inv[i-1][j-i]`. Much better!  This looks promising. The base case is `dp_inv[0][0] = 1`.\n\nSo now, let `max_inv = n*(n-1)/2`. I need to figure out how to elegantly incorporate the lexicographical constraint, comparing `p` and `q`.  Iterating on the first differing position `k` is probably the way to go, but I need to integrate this with the inversion count. I'm going to have to carefully consider the contributions to the inversion counts as I build these permutations, and how the lexicographical constraint affects the possible values for p and q at that differing position. I can see this involving a nested DP structure, potentially. Let's start sketching it out.\n",
