    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this complex problem.  It's a tricky one, and it's making me think hard about the best dynamic programming approach.**\n\nOkay, the goal is to count pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`, and the number of inversions in `p` is greater than the number of inversions in `q`. We need to print the result modulo a given number.\n\nFirst, I've got a grasp on inversions.  The maximum inversions for a permutation is when the elements are in reverse order, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.  Minimum is zero when it's in ascending order.  There are `n!` possible permutations, making `n! * n!` total pairs. The number of pairs `(p, q)` such that `p < q` is `( (n!)^2 - n!) / 2`. The same applies for the inversion count.\n\nThis sounds like dynamic programming. I'll need to use a `dp` table.  I can precompute the number of permutations with a certain number of inversions. I can define `dp[i][j]` to represent the number of permutations of the first `i` numbers with exactly `j` inversions. The maximum inversions for `i` elements is `i * (i-1) / 2`. The formula for `dp[i][j]` is computed by taking the sum of `dp[i-1][j-k]` for all possible values of `k`.\n\nThe formula for `dp_inv[k][inv]` is: `dp_inv[k][inv] = (dp_inv[k][inv-1] + dp_inv[k-1][inv] - dp_inv[k-1][inv-k]) % mod`. And `dp_inv[0][0] = 1`.\n\nThe main part, though, is how to relate these permutations to their inversions and lexicographical comparison. So, I need to come up with a new DP approach based on the two constraints. I will use `dp[i][diff_inv_idx][state]` to keep track of the number of pairs for a certain prefix of permutations, the difference between the number of inversions and the lexicographical state between the current prefixes.  I'll offset the `diff_inv` to handle negative values (due to `inv(p) - inv(q)`).\n\nMy intuition here is that I need to iterate through the places where the permutations first differ (lexicographical comparison) and build up the answer from there. So, I will set `k` to be the first index in permutations where they differ.\n\nThe core is making sure that the inversion difference condition `inv(p) > inv(q)` is met. Let `inv(p)` be the number of inversions in the entire `p` permutation and `inv(q)` be the number of inversions in `q`. Let `inv_prefix` be inversions up to position `k-1`, where `p_k` and `q_k` are chosen. I have to find a formula relating the inversions between `p` and `q` from position `k` to `n-1` to the lexicographical ordering, and ensure that their overall inversions fulfill the constraint.\n\nIt seems difficult to capture the dependency on suffix permutations and inversions using that `dp` state. I'm wondering if I can avoid iterating on the positions where they differ and directly compute the answer.\n\nI could try calculating the count of all pairs that are lexicographically smaller and the count of all pairs where the inversion in `p` is larger than the number of inversions in `q`. Let `A` be the number of lexicographically smaller pairs and `B` be the number of `inv(p)` larger than `inv(q)` pairs. My goal is to find their intersection.\n\nI could also iterate through all the `inv_p - inv_q = diff` values, calculate the count for each diff. `dp[i][j]` from before will be used here. Then I will have to iterate through each `i` and see where lexicographical ordering condition comes into play. It appears that it is still tricky.\n\nI will precompute the inversions and prefix sums. This allows me to see if there is a more efficient approach. It also helps to see that `n*(n-1)/4` is the average number of inversions. That won't help directly, but it may aid in optimizing.\n\nUltimately, I realize I need a more sophisticated DP. It's not immediately obvious how the elements' choices for the suffix will affect the number of inversions, so",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1, \\ldots, n` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`, and the number of inversions in `p` is greater than the number of inversions in `q`. We need to output the answer modulo `mod`.\n\nLet `inv(perm)` denote the number of inversions in a permutation `perm`.\nThe maximum number of inversions for a permutation of `k` elements is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nLet `MAX_INV_N = n * (n - 1) / 2`.\n\nFirst, we need a way to count permutations with a specific number of inversions.\nLet `dp_inv[k][j]` be the number of permutations of `1, \\ldots, k` with exactly `j` inversions.\nThe recurrence for `dp_inv[k][j]` is:\n`dp_inv[k][j] = sum_{x=0}^{k-1} dp_inv[k-1][j-x]`, where `x` is the number of new inversions formed by inserting `k` into a permutation of `k-1` elements. `x` can range from `0` (insert `k` at the end) to `k-1` (insert `k` at the beginning).\nThis can be optimized using prefix sums or by noting the relation:\n`dp_inv[k][j] = (dp_inv[k][j-1] + dp_inv[k-1][j] - dp_inv[k-1][j-k] + mod) % mod` for `j > 0`.\nBase cases: `dp_inv[0][0] = 1`. `dp_inv[k][0] = 1` for all `k` (only `[1, 2, \\ldots, k]` has 0 inversions).\nAlso, `dp_inv[k][j] = 0` if `j < 0` or `j > k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\nWe can precompute `dp_inv` for `k` from `0` to `n` and `j` from `0` to `MAX_INV_N`.\n\n```python\nMAX_INV_N = n * (n - 1) // 2\ndp_inv = [[0] * (MAX_INV_N + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\ndp_inv[0][0] = 1\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    dp_inv[i][0] = 1  # Permutation [1, ..., i] has 0 inversions\n    for j in range(1, i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1):\n        val = (dp_inv[i][j - 1] + dp_inv[i - 1][j]) % mod\n        if j - i >= 0:\n            val = (val - dp_inv[i - 1][j - i] + mod) % mod\n        dp_inv[i][j] = val\n```\n\nNow, let's define our main DP state. We will iterate through the first position `k` (0-indexed) where `p_k \\ne q_k`.\nFor `j < k`, we have `p_j = q_j`. This means `p` and `q` have identical prefixes of length `k`.\nLet `dp[i][diff_inv]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p', q')` of `1, \\ldots, i` such that `p'` and `q'` are identical, and `inv(p') - inv(q') = diff_inv`.\nSince `p' = q'`, `inv(p') = inv(q')`, so `diff_inv` must be 0.\nThis means `dp[i][0]` is the number of permutations of `1, \\ldots, i` (which is `i!`).\nThis `dp` state is not quite right.\nThe values in `p_0, \\ldots, p_{k-1}` are not necessarily `1, \\ldots, k`. They are `k` distinct values from `1, \\ldots, n`.\n\nLet's use a standard DP for counting pairs `(p, q)` with conditions.\n`dp[i][j][state]` will represent the number of ways to pick prefixes of length `i` for `p` and `q` using `i` distinct numbers from `1, \\ldots, n`, such that:\n- `j` is the difference `inv(p_prefix) - inv(q_prefix)`.\n- `state` indicates the lexicographical comparison:\n    - `0`: `p_prefix` is identical to `q_prefix`.\n    - `1`: `p_prefix` is lexicographically smaller than `q_prefix`.\n    - `2`: `p_prefix` is lexicographically greater than `q_prefix`.\n\nThe `diff_inv` can range from `-(i*(i-1)/2)` to `i*(i-1)/2`. We need to offset this by `MAX_INV_N`.\nSo `j_idx = j + MAX_INV_N`. The range for `j_idx` is `0` to `2 * MAX_INV_N`.\n\n`dp[i][j_idx][state]` will store the count.\nInitialize `dp[0][MAX_INV_N][0] = 1` (empty prefixes are identical, 0 inversions, 0 diff_inv).\n\nIterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`: (processing `i`-th element, which is `p_i` and `q_i`)\nFor each `j_idx` from `0` to `2 * MAX_INV_N`:\n  For each `state` in `{0, 1, 2}`:\n    If `dp[i][j_idx][state] == 0`, continue.\n\n    We are choosing `p_i` and `q_i` from the `n-i` available numbers.\n    The numbers already used are `i` specific values. The remaining `n-i` values are available.\n    When we choose `p_i = x` and `q_i = y` from the `n-i` available numbers:\n    - The number of inversions `x` adds with the `i` elements already in `p_0 \\ldots p_{i-1}` is `cnt_gt_x = (number of values in p_0 \\ldots p_{i-1} that are greater than x)`.\n    - Similarly `cnt_gt_y = (number of values in q_0 \\ldots q_{i-1} that are greater than y)`.\n    The `diff_inv` changes by `cnt_gt_x - cnt_gt_y`.\n\nThis approach is problematic because `cnt_gt_x` depends on the actual values chosen for `p_0 \\ldots p_{i-1}`, not just their count. This means the DP state needs to encode the set of values used, which is too much.\n\nA common technique for this problem is to iterate over the first position `k` where `p_k \\ne q_k`.\nFor `j=0 \\ldots k-1`, `p_j = q_j`.\nLet `p_k = x` and `q_k = y`. We must have `x < y` for `p` to be lexicographically smaller than `q`.\nThe values `p_0, \\ldots, p_{k-1}` are `k` distinct values. Let them be `v_0, \\ldots, v_{k-1}`.\nThe values `x` and `y` are two distinct values from `\\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\setminus \\{v_0, \\ldots, v_{k-1}\\}$.\nThe remaining `n-(k+1)` values are for the suffixes `p_{k+1}, \\ldots, p_{n-1}` and `q_{k+1}, \\ldots, q_{n-1}`. These suffixes use the same set of `n-(k+1)` values, namely `\\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\setminus \\{v_0, \\ldots, v_{k-1}, x, y\\}$.\n\nLet `f[k][inv_p_minus_inv_q]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1 \\ldots k` such that `inv(p) - inv(q) = inv_p_minus_inv_q`.\nThis is a convolution: `f[k]` is `dp_inv[k]` convolved with `(dp_inv[k] reversed)`.\n`f[k][d] = sum_{j} dp_inv[k][j] * dp_inv[k][j-d]`.\n`f[k][d]` can be computed in `O(k * (k*(k-1)/2))` time.\n`diff_inv` can range from `-k*(k-1)/2` to `k*(k-1)/2`.\nLet `f[k][d_idx]` be `f[k][d + MAX_INV_N]`.\n\nLet `g[k][d_idx]` be the number of pairs `(p, q)` of permutations of `1 \\ldots k` such that `p <_{lex} q` and `inv(p) - inv(q) = d`.\nThis is exactly what we need to compute.\n`g[k][d_idx]` can be computed iteratively for `k=1 \\ldots n`.\nTo compute `g[k][d_idx]`:\nConsider the first element `p_0, q_0`.\nCase 1: `p_0 = q_0 = x`. There are `k` choices for `x`.\n  The remaining `k-1` elements for `p` and `q` are permutations of `\\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n  Map these `k-1` elements to `1, \\ldots, k-1` to use `g[k-1]`.\n  The inversions contributed by `x` with `p_0` and `q_0` are 0.\n  So `diff_inv` doesn't change from `g[k-1]`.\n  The number of inversions `x` adds to `p` with `p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}` is `x-1` (if `x` is the largest element, it adds 0; if `x` is smallest, it adds `k-1`).\n  No, this is not how it works. When we choose `x` for `p_0`, it contributes `x-1` inversions with elements `1, \\ldots, x-1` if they are in the suffix.\n  This is the key: when we choose `x` as the first element, it forms `x-1` inversions with `1, \\ldots, x-1`.\n  So, if `p_0 = q_0 = x`, then `inv(p)` increases by `x-1` and `inv(q)` increases by `x-1`. The difference `inv(p)-inv(q)` remains `d`.\n  The remaining `k-1` elements are `\\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{x\\}$. We can map these to `1, \\ldots, k-1` in an order-preserving way.\n  So, this contributes `sum_{x=1}^k g[k-1][d_idx]` to `g[k][d_idx]`.\n  This is `k * g[k-1][d_idx]`.\n\nCase 2: `p_0 < q_0`. Let `p_0 = x`, `q_0 = y` with `x < y`.\n  There are `k * (k-1) / 2` pairs `(x, y)` from `\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}`.\n  `p_0=x` adds `x-1` inversions. `q_0=y` adds `y-1` inversions.\n  The `diff_inv` becomes `d + (x-1) - (y-1) = d + x - y`.\n  The remaining `k-1` elements for `p` and `q` are permutations of `\\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{x\\}` and `\\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\setminus \\{y\\}` respectively.\n  These are *different* sets of `k-1` elements. This is the difficulty.\n\nThe solution strategy is to define `dp[i][j][state]` as the number of pairs `(p', q')` of permutations of length `i` where `p'` and `q'` use a *specific set* of `i` distinct values, `p'` has `j` inversions, and `state` indicates `p' <_{lex} q'`, `p' = q'`, or `p' >_{lex} q'`.\nThis is still too complex because the specific set of values matters.\n\nLet's re-examine the example `n=4`.\n`MAX_INV_N = 4 * 3 / 2 = 6`.\n`dp_inv` table:\n`dp_inv[0][0] = 1`\n`dp_inv[1][0] = 1`\n`dp_inv[2][0] = 1, dp_inv[2][1] = 1`\n`dp_inv[3][0] = 1, dp_inv[3][1] = 2, dp_inv[3][2] = 2, dp_inv[3][3] = 1`\n`dp_inv[4][0] = 1, dp_inv[4][1] = 3, dp_inv[4][2] = 5, dp_inv[4][3] = 6, dp_inv[4][4] = 5, dp_inv[4][5] = 3, dp_inv[4][6] = 1`\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of pairs `(p, q)` of permutations of `1 \\ldots i` such that `p <_{lex} q` and `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\nThe `j` here is `inv(p) - inv(q)`. We need to offset it. `OFFSET = MAX_INV_N`.\n`dp[i][j_idx]` where `j_idx = j + OFFSET`.\n\n`dp[i][j_idx]` is the final answer for `n=i`.\nHow to compute `dp[i]` from `dp[i-1]`?\nConsider `p` and `q` of length `i`.\n`p = [p_0, p_1, \\ldots, p_{i-1}]`, `q = [q_0, q_1, \\ldots, q_{i-1}]`.\nThe values `p_0, \\ldots, p_{i-1}` are a permutation of `1, \\ldots, i`.\nThe values `q_0, \\ldots, q_{i-1}` are a permutation of `1, \\ldots, i`.\n\nLet `dp_total_diff[k][d_idx]` be the number of pairs `(p, q)` of permutations of `1 \\ldots k` such that `inv(p) - inv(q) = d`.\nThis is `sum_{j} dp_inv[k][j] * dp_inv[k][j-d]`.\n`dp_total_diff[k]` is the convolution of `dp_inv[k]` with `dp_inv[k]` reversed.\n`dp_total_diff[k][d_idx]` can be computed in `O(MAX_INV_N * MAX_INV_N)` for each `k`. Total `O(n * MAX_INV_N^2)`.\n`500 * (500*499/2)^2` is too slow. `MAX_INV_N` is `O(n^2)`. So `O(n^5)`.\n\nThe final answer is `sum_{j > 0} dp_ans[n][j + OFFSET]`.\n`dp_ans[i][cur_diff + OFFSET]` means for prefixes of length `i`, `cur_diff` is `inv(p_prefix) - inv(q_prefix)`.\nThis is the correct DP formulation.\n`dp[i][diff_inv_idx][state]`\n`dp[i][diff_inv_idx][0]` counts pairs `(p', q')` of length `i` using `i` specific elements, with `p'=q'`, and `inv(p') - inv(q') = diff_inv`. Since `p'=q'`, `diff_inv` must be 0. So `dp[i][OFFSET][0]` stores `i!`.\n`dp[i][diff_inv_idx][1]` counts pairs `(p', q')` of length `i` using `i` specific elements, with `p'<_{lex}q'`, and `inv(p') - inv(q') = diff_inv`.\n`dp[i][diff_inv_idx][2]` counts pairs `(p', q')` of length `i` using `i` specific elements, with `p'>_{lex}q'`, and `inv(p') - inv(q') = diff_inv`.\nThe `i` specific elements are `1, \\ldots, i`.\n\nTransitions for `dp[i][diff_inv_idx][state]` from `dp[i-1][prev_diff_inv_idx][prev_state]`:\nWhen we add the `i`-th element (value `i`):\nWe consider inserting `i` into a permutation of `1, \\ldots, i-1`.\nThis is where the DP `dp_inv` is used.\nThis DP is `dp[length][diff_inv_idx][lex_state]`. `length` from `0` to `n`.\n`diff_inv_idx` from `0` to `2 * MAX_INV_N`.\n`lex_state` from `0` to `2`.\n\n`dp[i][j][0]` = number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` where `p=q` and `inv(p)-inv(q)=j`.\nThis means `j=0`. So `dp[i][OFFSET][0]` is `i!`.\n`dp[i][j][1]` = number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` where `p<q` and `inv(p)-inv(q)=j`.\n`dp[i][j][2]` = number of pairs `(p,q)` of permutations of `1..i` where `p>q` and `inv(p)-inv(q)=j`.\n\nInitialize `dp[0][OFFSET][0] = 1`.

All other `eq[i][j]` are 0.\nThe `fact` array stores factorials modulo `mod`.\n\nThe answer is `sum_{j=1}^{MAX_INV_N} dp[n][j+OFFSET]`.\n\nConsider `P_i` and `Q_i` as permutations of `1 \\ldots i`.\nWhen we decide `P_i` and `Q_i` from `P_{i-1}` and `Q_{i-1}`:\nWe insert `i` into `P_{i-1}` and `Q_{i-1}`.\nSuppose `P_{i-1}` has `inv_p` inversions and `Q_{i-1}` has `inv_q` inversions.\nWe insert `i` into `P_{i-1}` at position `x` (0-indexed). This creates `x` new inversions.\nWe insert `i` into `Q_{i-1}` at position `y` (0-indexed). This creates `y` new inversions.\nThe new `inv_p'` is `inv_p + x`. The new `inv_q'` is `inv_q + y`.\nThe new difference is `(inv_p - inv_q) + (x - y)`.\n\nThe `lex_state` changes:\n1. If `p_x` (new `i`) is placed before `q_y` (new `i`), and `p_x < q_y` (this is impossible if `i` is the same value).\nThis implies that we are comparing permutations of `1 \\ldots i-1` and then inserting `i`.\n\nThis DP structure is crucial:\n`dp[k][inv_diff_p_minus_q]` for permutations of `1 \\ldots k`.\n`dp[k][d]` is a pair `(count_lex_less, count_lex_equal)`.\n`count_lex_equal` means `p_prefix = q_prefix`.\n`count_lex_less` means `p_prefix < q_prefix`.\n`inv_diff_offset = MAX_INV_N`.\n`dp[i][j]` is `(count_lex_less, count_lex_equal)` for permutations of `1 \\ldots i` with `inv(p) - inv(q) = j - OFFSET`.\n\nInitialize `dp[0][OFFSET] = (0, 1)`.

This is `O(n^5)`.\nThis is where the problem becomes hard. `n=500` implies `O(n^3)` or `O(n^2 log n)`.\n\nThe `dp_inv` calculation is `O(n * MAX_INV_N) = O(n^3)`.\nThe `dp` table for `(count_less, count_equal, count_greater)`:\nLet `dp[i][j]` be `(count_less, count_equal, count_greater)` for permutations of `1..i` with `inv(p) - inv(q) = j - OFFSET`.\n`dp[0][OFFSET] = (0, 1, 0)`.\nFor `i` from `1` to `n`:\n  `new_dp` = array of `(0,0,0)` of size `2*MAX_INV_N + 1`.\n  `total_less = 0`, `total_greater = 0`.\n  For `prev_diff_idx` from `0` to `2*MAX_INV_N`:\n    `prev_less, prev_equal, prev_greater = dp[i-1][prev_diff_idx]`\n\n    // Contribution from `prev_equal`\n    If `prev_equal > 0`:\n      For `diff_val` from `-(i-1)` to `i-1`:\n        `ways = i - abs(diff_val)`\n        `cur_diff_idx = prev_diff_idx + diff_val`\n        If `cur_diff_idx < 0` or `cur_diff_idx > 2*MAX_INV_N`, continue.\n        If `diff_val < 0`:\n          `new_dp[cur_diff_idx][0] = (new_dp[cur_diff_idx][0] + prev_equal * ways) % mod`\n        Else if `diff_val == 0`:\n          `new_dp[cur_diff_idx][1] = (new_dp[cur_diff_idx][1] + prev_equal * ways) % mod`\n        Else:\n          `new_dp[cur_diff_idx][2] = (new_dp[cur_diff_idx][2] + prev_equal * ways) % mod`\n\n    `total_less = (total_less + prev_less) % mod`\n    `total_greater = (total_greater + prev_greater) % mod`\n\n  // Contribution from `prev_less` and `prev_greater`\n  // This is where we need to sum over all possible `inv(p_suffix) - inv(q_suffix)`\n  // The suffixes are permutations of `1..i`.\n  // For `prev_less`, we just need to add `total_less * (total ways to form suffix pairs)`.\n  // The total ways to form suffix pairs is `i! * i!`.\n  // This `i! * i!` is distributed over all `diff_inv` according to `dp_total_diff[i][diff_inv_idx]`.\n  // This is the correct insight: `dp_total_diff[i][diff_inv_idx]` is the number of pairs of permutations of `1..i` with `inv(p)-inv(q)=diff_inv`.\n  // So, for each `diff_inv_idx_suffix` in `dp_total_diff[i]`:\n  // `new_dp[diff_inv_idx_suffix][0] = (new_dp[diff_inv_idx_suffix][0] + total_less * dp_total_diff[i][diff_inv_idx_suffix]) % mod`\n  // `new_dp[diff_inv_idx_suffix][2] = (new_dp[diff_inv_idx_suffix][2] + total_greater * dp_total_diff[i][diff_inv_idx_suffix]) % mod`\n\n  `dp[i] = new_dp`\n\nThis `dp_total_diff[i]` calculation is `O(i * MAX_INV_N)` for each `i`, which is `O(n * n^2) = O(n^3)`.\nThe main loop: `O(n * (MAX_INV_N * i + MAX_INV_N)) = O(n * (n^2 * n + n^2)) = O(n^4)`.\nThis is still `O(n^4)`.\nThe `diff_val` loop is `O(i)`.\n`n * (MAX_INV_N * i)` is `n * n^2 * n = n^4`.\n\nThe only way `O(n^4)` becomes `O(n^3)` is if `MAX_INV_N` is `O(n)`. But it's `O(n^2)`.\nThis means the `MAX_INV_N` loop must be faster.\n\nLet `S_k(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} dp_inv[k-1][x-j]`.\nThe `dp_inv[k][j]` is `S_k(j)`.\nThe `dp_total_diff[k][d_idx]` is `sum_j dp_inv[k][j] * dp_inv[k][j - (d_idx - OFFSET)]`.\nThis is sum over `j` of `dp_inv[k][j] * dp_inv[k][j-d']`.\nThis is a standard polynomial multiplication.\n`P_k(x) = sum_j dp_inv[k][j] x^j`.\n`P_k_rev(x) = sum_j dp_inv[k][j] x^{-j}`.\n`dp_total_diff[k]` is coefficients of `P_k(x) * P_k_rev(x)`.\nFFT/NTT can do this in `O(MAX_INV_N log MAX_INV_N)`.\nTotal time for `F[k]` would be `O(n * MAX_INV_N log MAX_INV_N) = O(n^3 log(n^2)) = O(n^3 log n)`. This would pass.\nHowever, `mod` is not necessarily prime, so NTT might not be usable.\nIf `mod` is not prime, we need to use CRT with several prime moduli, then combine. This is too complex for competitive programming.\n\nLet's recheck the problem constraints and example. `n=4`, `mod=403458273`. The example output is `17`.\nThe `dp_inv` table:\n`dp_inv[0]=[1]`\n`dp_inv[1]=[1]`\n`dp_inv[2]=[1,1]`\n`dp_inv[3]=[1,2,2,1]`\n`dp_inv[4]=[1,3,5,6,5,3,1]`\n\nThe `dp_total_diff` table for `n=4`:\n`OFFSET = 6`.\n`dp_total_diff[4][d+6] = sum_{j=0}^6 dp_inv[4][j] * dp_inv[4][j-d]`.\n`d` from `-6` to `6`.\n`d=0`: `1*1 + 3*3 + 5*5 + 6*6 + 5*5 + 3*3 + 1*1 = 1+9+25+36+25+9+1 = 106`.\n`dp_total_diff[4][6] = 106`.\n`d=1`: `1*3 + 3*5 + 5*6 + 6*5 + 5*3 + 3*1 = 3+15+30+30+15+3 = 96`.\n`dp_total_diff[4][7] = 96`.\n`d=2`: `1*5 + 3*6 + 5*5 + 6*3 + 5*1 = 5+18+25+18+5 = 71`.\n`dp_total_diff[4][8] = 71`.\n... this takes `O(MAX_INV_N^2)` for each `k`. Total `O(n * MAX_INV_N^2)`.\n\nThis means the `O(n^4)` or `O(n^5)` must be the intended solution, and `n=500` is small enough for it.\n`n=500`, `MAX_INV_N = 500*499/2 = 124750`.\n`n^4 = 500^4 = 6.25 \\times 10^{10}`. This is definitely too slow.\n`n^3 = 1.25 \\times 10^8`. This might pass.\n\nLet's check the complexity of the loops again:\nOuter `i` loop: `n` iterations.\nInner `prev_diff_idx` loop: `2 * MAX_INV_N` iterations (`O(n^2)`).\n  Inside this loop, `prev_equal` branch: `diff_val` loop is `O(i)`.\n  So `O(n * n^2 * n) = O(n^4)`. This is the bottleneck.\n\nIs there a way to optimize the `prev_equal` branch?\n`next_dp[new_diff_idx][0] += prev_equal * (i - abs(diff_val))`\n`next_dp[new_diff_idx][1] += prev_equal * (i - abs(diff_val))`\n`next_dp[new_diff_idx][2] += prev_equal * (i - abs(diff_val))`\n\nThis is a convolution: `next_dp` is `prev_equal` convolved with `(i - abs(diff_val))` sequence.\nLet `C_i[d] = i - abs(d)` for `d` from `-(i-1)` to `i-1`.\n`next_dp_slice[new_diff_idx] = sum_{prev_diff_idx} prev_equal * C_i[new_diff_idx - prev_diff_idx]`.\nThis is a convolution of `prev_equal` array (for current `i-1`) with `C_i` array.\nThis part can be done with NTT/FFT.\n`O(MAX_INV_N log MAX_INV_N)` for each `i`.\nTotal `O(n * MAX_INV_N log MAX_INV_N) = O(n^3 log n)`. This would pass.\nBut again, `mod` is not prime.\n\nIf `mod` is not prime, and `n^4` is too slow, then there must be a different DP state or a different observation.\nA common trick is to use prefix sums of convolutions.\n`next_dp[k] = sum_x A[x] B[k-x]`.\n`next_dp[k] - next_dp[k-1] = sum_x A[x] (B[k-x] - B[k-1-x])`.\nLet `B_d = i - abs(d)`.\n`B_d - B_{d-1}` is `1` if `d < 0`, `-1` if `d > 0`.\nSpecifically:\nIf `d > 1`: `B_d - B_{d-1} = (i-d) - (i-(d-1)) = -1`.\nIf `d = 1`: `B_1 - B_0 = (i-1) - i = -1`.\nIf `d = 0`: `B_0 - B_{-1} = i - (i-1) = 1`.\nIf `d < 0`: `B_d - B_{d-1} = (i-(-d)) - (i-(-d+1)) = (i+d) - (i+d-1) = 1`.\n\nThis allows computing `next_dp` values in `O(MAX_INV_N)` from previous `next_dp` values.\nThis is similar to `dp_inv` recurrence.\nLet `dp_conv[d] = sum_{p_diff_idx} dp[i-1][p_diff_idx][1] * (i - abs(d - (p_diff_idx - OFFSET)))`.\nWe want to compute `dp_conv` efficiently.\n`dp_conv[k]` is the sum `sum_x A[x] B[k-x]`.\n`A[x]` is `dp[i-1][x][1]`. `B[y]` is `i - abs(y - OFFSET)`.\nThis is `O(MAX_INV_N^2)` still.\n\nThe problem is the \"hard version\", suggesting `n^3` or `n^2 log n`.\nThe only way to get `O(n^3)` from `O(n^4)` is if the `MAX_INV_N` loop is `O(n)` instead of `O(n^2)`.\nThis means `MAX_INV_N` must be `O(n)`. But it's `O(n^2)`.\n\nLet's assume `O(N^4)` is somehow acceptable.\n`500^4 = 6.25 * 10^{10}` operations is too much.\n`500^3 = 1.25 * 10^8` operations is acceptable.\n`N = 500`. `MAX_INV_N = 124750`.\nThe `dp_inv` table is `N * MAX_INV_N` in size. `500 * 124750 = 6.2 \\times 10^7`.\nThe `dp` table is `N * (2*MAX_INV_N) * 3` in size. `500 * 2 * 124750 * 3 = 3.7 \\times 10^8`.\nThis is too much memory.\n\nWait, the `dp` table for `i` only depends on `i-1`. So we only need two rows of `dp` table.\n`2 * (2*MAX_INV_N) * 3` integers. `2 * 2 * 124750 * 3 = 1.5 \\times 10^6` integers. This is fine.\n\nThe `O(N^4)` complexity is from:\n`N` iterations for `i`.\n`MAX_INV_N` iterations for `prev_diff_idx`.\n`i` iterations for `diff_val`.\n`N * MAX_INV_N * N = N^4`.\n\nThe convolution `sum_{diff_val} prev_equal * (i - abs(diff_val))` can be optimized.\nLet `A_k` be `dp[i-1][k][1]`.\nLet `B_d = i - abs(d)`.\nWe need to compute `C_j = sum_k A_k B_{j-k}`.\nThis is `C_j = sum_k A_k (i - abs(j-k))`.\nThis is `sum_k A_k (i - (j-k))` for `j-k >= 0` and `sum_k A_k (i + (j-k))` for `j-k < 0`.\nThis can be split into prefix/suffix sums.\n`C_j = i * sum_k A_k - j * sum_{k:j-k>=0} A_k + sum_{k:j-k>=0} k A_k + j * sum_{k:j-k<0} A_k - sum_{k:j-k<0} k A_k`.\nThis requires prefix sums of `A_k` and `k A_k`.\nLet `S_A[x] = sum_{k=0}^x A_k`.\nLet `S_kA[x] = sum_{k=0}^x k A_k`.\nThen `sum_{k:j-k>=0} A_k = S_A[j]`.\n`sum_{k:j-k<0} A_k = S_A[MAX_INV_N*2] - S_A[j]`.\nThis allows computing `C_j` in `O(1)` for each `j`, after `O(MAX_INV_N)` precomputation of prefix sums.\nSo, the `prev_equal` update can be `O(MAX_INV_N)`.\nThis brings the total complexity to `O(N * MAX_INV_N) = O(N^3)`. This is acceptable.\n\nFinal Algorithm:\n1. Initialize `MAX_INV_N = n * (n - 1) // 2`.\n2. Initialize `OFFSET = MAX_INV_N`.\n3. `dp` table: `dp[prev_diff_idx][lex_state]` and `next_dp[new_diff_idx][lex_state]`.\n   `dp` and `next_dp` are arrays of size `2 * MAX_INV_N + 1`.
