Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Amusing Joke\" problem.  It's pretty straightforward, really. The core challenge is determining if a pile of letters can be made *exactly* from two names.\n\nMy first thought is, I need to get the input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.  Then, the key is to determine if the characters in the pile match the combined characters of the guest and host names in terms of both *frequency* and *total characters*.\n\nMy initial instinct is to go with a frequency count. I would concatenate the guest's and host's names, then count how many times each character appears in that combined string.  I'd do the same for the pile of letters. Finally, I'd just compare the two frequency maps. If they're identical, it's a \"YES,\" otherwise a \"NO.\" That feels solid and easy to understand.\n\nBut, hang on a second.  I know sorting! If two strings have the same characters with the same frequencies, then their sorted versions will be equal. So, here's a simpler approach: concatenate the guest and host names. Then, compare the lengths of the combined name string and the pile string. If the lengths don't match, it's immediately \"NO.\" If they *do* match, I'll sort both the combined names and the pile of letters. Finally, I'll just check if the sorted strings are equal.\n\nThat's cleaner, more Pythonic, and avoids the potential for off-by-one errors that can happen when I mess up the frequency counter.\n\nLet me try an example to make sure this is solid. Okay, `SANTACLAUS` and `DEDMOROZ`, and then `SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS`. Yep, after concatenation and sorting, everything lines up. Sorted, combined names must match pile. Good. I'm going with that. I'll get this script done and tested in no time.\n",
