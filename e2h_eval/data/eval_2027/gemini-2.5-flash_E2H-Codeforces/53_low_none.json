Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Longest Repeated Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this problem: given a string of lowercase letters, find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice, even if the occurrences overlap. The string's length is capped at 100, which is helpful.  My thought process is starting to take shape.\n\nFirst, I need to methodically go through all the possibilities.  That means considering all possible substrings.  Each substring is defined by its start position and length (or end position, same thing). Then, for *each* substring, I have to figure out how many times it actually appears in the original string.\n\nIf I find a substring that repeats at least twice, its length becomes a candidate for the answer.  The key is to keep track of the *maximum* length I've found so far.\n\nI ran through a few examples in my head to make sure I'm on the right track, and it looks like a good approach. The `abcd` case is straightforward – no repetitions, so the answer is zero. `ababa` and `zzz` are more interesting; they show how the overlapping repeats change the final result.\n\nThe core algorithm I'm formulating in my head:\n\n1.  Let the input string be `s`.  Its length is `N` (and N <= 100).\n2.  Iterate through substring lengths `L`, starting from `N-1` and going down to `1`. This is critical. By going in descending order, the first valid `L` I find will be the maximum.\n3.  For each `L`, iterate through all possible starting positions `i`. The substring is `s[i:i+L]`.\n4.  Check if this substring, `s[i:i+L]`, is repeated in the string. I need to do this efficiently. The condition \"appears at least twice\" translates to finding another position `j` (where `j != i`) where `s[j:j+L]` is exactly the same as `s[i:i+L]`.\n5.  If a repeat is found, then `L` is the answer, and I can stop immediately because I started looking at the longest possible lengths first.\n6.  If no repeating substring is found after checking all lengths, the answer is 0.\n\nIt looks like a manageable problem. I'm now pretty confident in my approach; all that's left is to refine the checking logic, maybe optimize it, and implement the code.\n",
