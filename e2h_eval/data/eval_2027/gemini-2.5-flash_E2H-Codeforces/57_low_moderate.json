His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order.

Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Competitive Programming Problem: Ranking in an Olympiad**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a competitive programming challenge. The core task is to determine Vasya's best and worst possible ranks in an Olympiad. I've got this: *N* participants, Vasya included. Vasya's total score must be at least *x*, and we have two sets of scores: *a_i* for tour 1 and *b_i* for tour 2. Critically, these scores aren't explicitly linked to individual participants. The ranking is based on total points (higher is better), with ties broken arbitrarily by the jury.\n\nMy immediate thought is to break this down into the extreme cases.  The *best* rank means Vasya needs the highest possible score, and among those with equal scores, the best placement.  The *worst* rank means minimizing Vasya's score while still meeting the *x* point requirement, and then taking the worst possible position within any ties.\n\nTo find the best rank, I need to maximize Vasya's total. Since the *a_i* and *b_i* are unassigned, I need to figure out which combination leads to the best result such that Vasya meets the *x* point criteria.  The problem description is very explicit - there exist *i* and *j* where *a_i* + *b_j* >= *x*. I don't need to try all combinations. Let's say Vasya receives `a_k` and `b_l`. We want to maximize the sum of those points. So, the best-case total score is simply the maximum available `a` plus the maximum available `b` as long as their sum is greater than or equal to *x*.\n\nTherefore, I'll sort both the `a` and `b` arrays in ascending order. Then, I can take the largest element from each and consider the sum of those elements for Vasya. If this combination is sufficient, or if there is no combination that suffices, Vasya will have the maximum possible score. This would place him at rank 1, or tied for rank 1 (with jury's decision). I can handle the jury decision using a comparison operator.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given `N` scores for the first tour (`a_i`) and `N` scores for the second tour (`b_i`), but without knowing which participant got which score. We only know that Vasya's total score is at least `x`. The ranking is based on the sum of points from both tours, with higher scores being better. If multiple participants have the same total score, the jury can assign places arbitrarily among them.\n\nLet's denote the sorted arrays of scores as `A` (from `a_i`) and `B` (from `b_i`). It's generally useful to sort one in ascending order and the other in descending order when considering pairings to maximize or minimize sums, or to find specific conditions.\n\n**1. Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank, Vasya wants to maximize his total score. The absolute maximum score any participant can achieve is `max(A) + max(B)`. If Vasya gets this score, he will be ranked 1st, as no one can score higher. This is possible if `max(A) + max(B) >= x`. The problem guarantees that there exists *some* pair `a_i, b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. The pair `max(A), max(B)` would definitely satisfy this condition if it's the highest possible score.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank for Vasya is always **1**. He can achieve the highest possible sum of points (`max(A) + max(B)`) and since no one can score higher, he will be among the top participants. With the jury's arbitrary assignment rule, he can be assigned the 1st place.\n\n**2. Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, Vasya wants to minimize his total score, subject to the condition that his score is at least `x`. Also, he wants to maximize the number of people who score *strictly more* than him, and among those with the same score as him, he wants to be ranked last.\n\nLet's consider a fixed pairing strategy for all `N` participants. We need to find a pairing of `A` and `B` such that Vasya's score is minimized, but still at least `x`.\n\nThe problem states \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\". This means we can match any `a_i` with any `b_j`, as long as each `a_i` and `b_j` is used exactly once.\n\nTo make Vasya's rank as bad as possible, we want to:\n1.  Assign Vasya the lowest possible score `S_Vasya` such that `S_Vasya >= x`.\n2.  Maximize the scores of all *other* `N-1` participants.\n\nThis suggests a greedy approach.\nSort `A` in ascending order: `A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`\nSort `B` in descending order: `B = [b_n, b_{n-1}, ..., b_1]`\n\nConsider pairing `A[i]` with `B[i]` for all `i`. This specific pairing strategy (`A[0]` with `B[0]`, `A[1]` with `B[1]`, etc., after sorting `A` ascending and `B` descending) is known to maximize the sum of minimums (or minimize the sum of maximums, depending on how you look at it). More importantly, it creates a set of `N` sums. For example, if `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [6, 5, 4]`, the sums would be `1+6=7`, `2+5=7`, `3+4=7`. This pairing tends to make the sums more \"balanced\" or \"spread out\" in a specific way.\n\nLet's iterate through all possible scores Vasya could have. Vasya's score is `a_i + b_j`. We need to find a pairing for all `N` participants such that Vasya gets `a_i + b_j` and `a_i + b_j >= x`, and then count how many people score `S_Vasya` or more.\n\nA simpler approach for the worst case:\nWe want to find the smallest possible sum `S` such that `S >= x`, and there is a valid pairing of `A` and `B` that results in `S` for Vasya.\nTo achieve this, we can try to pair the smallest `a_i` with the largest `b_j`, then the next smallest `a_i` with the next largest `b_j`, and so on.\nSort `A` in ascending order.\nSort `B` in descending order.\nNow, consider `A[i]` and `B[i]`. If Vasya takes `A[i]` and `B[i]`, his score is `A[i] + B[i]`.\nThis specific pairing `(A[i], B[i])` for all `i` (after `A` ascending, `B` descending) is a valid assignment of scores for all participants.\nLet `S_i = A[i] + B[i]`.\nWe are looking for the minimum `S_i` such that `S_i >= x`.\nIf Vasya gets this `S_i`, his rank will be `1 + (number of people who scored > S_i) + (number of people who scored S_i and are ranked before him)`.\nTo maximize his rank, we assume all people with `S_j > S_i` are ranked before him, and all people with `S_j = S_i` (including himself) are ranked such that he is last among them.\n\nLet's count how many participants *could* score at least `x`.\nConsider `A` sorted ascendingly and `B` sorted descendingly.\n`A = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`\n`B = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}]` (where `b_0` is the largest, `b_{n-1}` is the smallest)\n\nWe can find the maximum number of participants who can score at least `x`.\nThis is a standard two-pointer problem.\nInitialize `count = 0`.\nInitialize `ptr_a = 0` (for `A` - smallest scores) and `ptr_b = n-1` (for `B` - smallest scores).\nWe want to match `a_i` with `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nIf `A[ptr_a] + B[ptr_b] >= x`, it means we can form a pair that meets the criteria. We increment `count`, and move `ptr_a` up and `ptr_b` down (using `A[ptr_a]` and `B[ptr_b]` for this pair). This is because `A[ptr_a]` is the smallest available `a` and `B[ptr_b]` is the smallest available `b`. If their sum is `x` or more, any larger `a` or `b` would also satisfy the condition. By pairing the smallest `a` with the largest `b` that still satisfies `a+b >= x`, we maximize the chances for other pairs to also satisfy the condition.\n\nActually, for the worst case, we want to minimize Vasya's score *while still being at least x*, and maximize the scores of others.\nThe total number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `x` is found by sorting `A` ascending and `B` ascending. Then, for each `a_i` in `A`, we want to find the smallest `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. This means `b_j >= x - a_i`. We can use binary search (or a two-pointer approach if both `A` and `B` are sorted in the same direction) to count how many pairs can satisfy this.\n\nLet's use the two-pointer approach for the worst case:\nSort `a` in ascending order.\nSort `b` in ascending order.\nWe want to find the maximum number of participants `k` such that each of them can get a total score of at least `x`.\nLet `i` be a pointer for `a` (from 0 to `n-1`) and `j` be a pointer for `b` (from `n-1` down to 0).\nIf `a[i] + b[j] >= x`: This means `a[i]` (a relatively small score) combined with `b[j]` (a relatively large score) makes a valid pair. We can use this pair for one participant. We increment `i` (to use the next `a` score) and decrement `j` (to use the next `b` score). We count this as one participant who can score `x` or more.\nIf `a[i] + b[j] < x`: This means `a[i]` is too small to combine with `b[j]` to reach `x`. Since `b[j]` is the largest remaining `b` score for `a[i]`, `a[i]` cannot form a pair with any other remaining `b` score to reach `x`. So, `a[i]` cannot be part of a pair that sums to `x` or more *if we use `b[j]` for another participant*. To maximize the count of participants scoring `x` or more, we *must* discard `a[i]` (or pair it with a `b` that results in less than `x`, effectively not counting it towards the `x` goal for this specific count). So we increment `i`.\n\nAlgorithm for worst rank:\n1.  Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2.  Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3.  Initialize `count = 0`, `i = 0`, `j = n - 1`.\n4.  While `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n    a.  If `a[i] + b[j] >= x`:\n        This means we can form a pair `(a[i], b[j])` that sums to at least `x`. We count this participant.\n        `count += 1`\n        `i += 1` (use the next smallest `a`)\n        `j -= 1` (use the next largest `b`)\n    b.  Else (`a[i] + b[j] < x`):\n        This means `a[i]` is too small to form a sum of at least `x` with `b[j]`. Since `b[j]` is the largest available `b` score at this point, `a[i]` cannot form a sum of `x` or more with any `b` from `b[0]` to `b[j]`. So, `a[i]` cannot be part of a \"successful\" pair *if we are prioritizing pairing smallest `a` with largest `b` to maximize successful pairs*. We discard `a[i]` and try the next smallest `a`.\n        `i += 1`\n\nThe `count` obtained by this process is the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `x`. Vasya is one of these participants.\nIn the worst case, Vasya is ranked last among these `count` participants. So his rank would be `N - (count - 1)` if `count` participants score `x` or more, and the remaining `N - count` score less than `x`.\nThe `count` participants who achieve `x` or more will be ranked from `1` to `count` (or better, `N - count + 1` to `N` if they are the lowest scoring ones).\nThe `N - count` participants who score less than `x` will be ranked worse than the `count` participants.\nSo, if `count` participants score `x` or more, Vasya can be considered one of them. To get the worst rank, he'd be the lowest ranked among these `count` people. His rank would be `(N - count) + 1`. This is because `N - count` people will score strictly less than `x` (or less than Vasya's minimal `x` score). All these `N - count` people will be ranked after Vasya. Vasya will be ranked just before them.\nNo, that's not right. If `count` people score `S_k >= x`, and `N-count` people score `S_l < x`. Vasya is one of the `count` people. To get worst rank, he is the last among these `count` people. So `count-1` people are strictly better than him (among the `x` group). And `N-count` people are strictly worse than him. So his rank will be `(count - 1) + 1 = count`.\nLet's re-evaluate:\nIf `k` participants score `S_p >= x`, and `N-k` participants score `S_q < x`.\nThe `k` participants will occupy ranks `1` through `k` (or some subset of ranks if there are ties).\nThe `N-k` participants will occupy ranks `k+1` through `N`.\nVasya is one of the `k` participants. To get his worst rank, he is ranked last among these `k` participants. So his rank is `k`.\n\nExample Walkthrough:\n`N=6, X=7`\n`A = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]` -> Sorted `A = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`B = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]` -> Sorted `B = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\nWorst rank calculation:\nSorted `A = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSorted `B = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]` (ascending)\n\n`i=0, j=5, count=0`\n1. `a[0]=3, b[5]=8`. `3+8=11 >= 7`. `count=1`. `i=1, j=4`.\n2. `a[1]=4, b[4]=6`. `4+6=10 >= 7`. `count=2`. `i=2, j=3`.\n3. `a[2]=4, b[3]=4`. `4+4=8 >= 7`. `count=3`. `i=3, j=2`.\n4. `a[3]=4, b[2]=4`. `4+4=8 >= 7`. `count=4`. `i=4, j=1`.\n5. `a[4]=5, b[1]=3`. `5+3=8 >= 7`. `count=5`. `i=5, j=0`.\n6. `a[5]=6, b[0]=0`. `6+0=6 < 7`. `i=6`.\nLoop ends because `i=6` (not `< n`).\n\nThe `count` is 5. So, 5 participants can score at least `x`. In the worst case, Vasya is the 5th among them. So his rank is 5.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\nFinal check on logic:\n*   **Best rank:** Always 1. Vasya can take `max(A)` and `max(B)` (if `max(A) + max(B) >= x`), which is the highest possible score. Since no one can score higher, he can be assigned 1st place due to jury's choice. The problem guarantees `a_i + b_j >= x` for some `i, j`, so `max(A) + max(B)` must be at least `x`.\n*   **Worst rank:** Find the maximum number of participants `k` who can score at least `x`. Vasya is one of these `k` participants. To get his worst rank, he is ranked last among them. So his rank is `k`. The two-pointer approach (sort `a` asc, `b` asc; `i` from left, `j` from right) correctly finds this maximum `k`.\n\nThe constraints `N <= 10^5` mean `O(N log N)` (for sorting) or `O(N)` (for two-pointers after sorting) is acceptable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best possible rank for Vasya is always 1.\n    # Vasya can be assigned the highest possible score (max(a) + max(b)).\n    # Since no one can score higher, he will be among the top participants.\n    # With the jury's arbitrary assignment rule for ties, he can be assigned 1st place.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst possible rank for Vasya.\n    # We want to maximize the number of participants who score at least x.\n    # Vasya will be one of these participants, and in the worst case, he'll be ranked last among them.\n    # Sort both arrays in ascending order.\n    # Use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j)\n    # such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n    # To maximize this count, we try to pair the smallest available 'a' with the largest available 'b'\n    # to satisfy the condition.
