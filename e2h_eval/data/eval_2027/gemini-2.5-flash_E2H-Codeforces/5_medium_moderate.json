Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the game plan for tackling this \"Colored Boots\" problem, as I see it:**\n\nWe've got `n` left and `n` right boots, each with a color (a letter or '?'). The goal is to maximize the compatible pairs. A pair is compatible if the colors match exactly or if one/both colors are '?'. We need to output the count of these pairs and their indices.\n\nThe core of the strategy is this: *Prioritize the strongest matches first.* The strongest match is a specific color-to-specific color (like 'c' to 'c'). Next, specific to '?'. The weakest is '?' to '?'. This greedy approach works because an exact match is more restrictive than specific-to-'?' or '?' to '?'.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure**: I'll use `defaultdict(list)` for `left_map` and `right_map`. This will make it easier to store the indices of boots for each color (and automatically creates an empty list for a new color). Store the *1-based* indices of boots in `left_map[color]` and `right_map[color]`.\n2.  **Matching Strategy:**\n    1.  **Phase 1: Specific to Specific:** Iterate through the lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'). For each letter, match `min(len(left_map[char]), len(right_map[char]))` pairs.\n    2.  **Phase 2: Specific to '?':** First, try matching `left_map[char]` with `right_map['?']` for each letter. Then, try matching `right_map[char]` with `left_map['?']`.\n    3.  **Phase 3: '?' to '?':** Match whatever remaining '?' boots are available.\n3.  **Output:** Print the number of pairs, followed by the left and right boot indices for each pair.\n\nThis strategy is efficient because we only iterate through the letters and boot indices. The time complexity should be *O(n + alphabet size)*, where `n` is the number of boots (which is up to 150,000) and the alphabet size is constant (26). The space complexity is *O(n)* to store the boot indices.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs and to output these pairs. Compatibility rules are: two specific colors are compatible if they are the same; an indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nThe core idea is to prioritize matches based on their restrictiveness. More restrictive matches should be made first, as they use up resources (boots) that have fewer alternative matching options.\n\nHere's the prioritized matching strategy:\n\n1.  **Exact Specific Color Matches:** Match boots where both the left and right boot have the same specific color (e.g., 'f' with 'f'). These are the most restrictive matches because a specific color boot can only match another boot of the exact same specific color or a '?' boot. By matching specific-to-specific first, we ensure that these highly constrained pairings are made.\n\n2.  **Specific Color to Indefinite ('?') Matches:** After all exact specific matches are made, we move to matching specific-colored boots with '?' boots.\n    *   Match remaining left boots with a specific color (e.g., 'a') with any available right boots of indefinite color ('?').\n    *   Match remaining right boots with a specific color (e.g., 'z') with any available left boots of indefinite color ('?').\n    This phase is crucial because a specific-colored boot that couldn't find an exact match still has the option to match a '?' boot. A '?' boot, on the other hand, is the most flexible and can match anything. Using a specific boot with a '?' boot is better than saving the '?' boot for a '?' to '?' match (which is the least restrictive).\n\n3.  **Indefinite ('?') to Indefinite ('?') Matches:** Finally, match any remaining left boots of indefinite color ('?') with any remaining right boots of indefinite color ('?'). These are the least restrictive matches and are made last, using up any remaining flexible boots.\n\nThis greedy approach guarantees the maximum number of pairs because at each step, we make the most constrained matches first, ensuring that boots with fewer matching possibilities are paired up effectively, without blocking better opportunities for other boots.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  **Data Structures:** We use `collections.defaultdict(list)` to store the indices of boots for each color. `left_map[char]` will be a list of 1-indexed indices of left boots with color `char`, and similarly for `right_map`. This allows efficient access and modification (adding/removing indices).\n\n2.  **Populating Maps:** Iterate through the input strings `l` and `r`, and for each boot, add its 1-indexed position to the corresponding color's list in `left_map` or `right_map`.\n\n3.  **Matching Process:**\n    *   **Phase 1:** Iterate through all characters from 'a' to 'z'. For each `char`, while both `left_map[char]` and `right_map[char]` are not empty, pop one index from each and form a pair.\n    *   **Phase 2:**\n        *   First, iterate through 'a' to 'z'. For each `char`, while `left_map[char]` is not empty and `right_map['?']` is not empty, pop indices and form a pair.\n        *   Then, iterate through 'a' to 'z' again. For each `char`, while `left_map['?']` is not empty and `right_map[char]` is not empty, pop indices and form a pair.\n    *   **Phase 3:** While both `left_map['?']` and `right_map['?']` are not empty, pop indices and form a pair.\n\n4.  **Output:** Print the total number of pairs, followed by each pair on a new line. The order of pairs doesn't matter.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N + C), where N is the number of boots and C is the size of the alphabet (26 for lowercase Latin letters). We iterate through the input strings once (O(N)) to populate the maps. Then, we iterate through the alphabet (C times) for each phase, and inside these loops, we perform `pop()` operations. Each boot index is added to a list once and popped from a list at most once. Therefore, the total number of `pop()` operations is at most N. This makes the overall time complexity very efficient.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store all boot indices in the `defaultdict` lists. In the worst case, all boots could have distinct colors or all could be '?', requiring storage proportional to N.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough for `N` up to 150,000.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-indexed boot indices by color.\n    # defaultdict(list) is perfect for this, as it automatically creates an empty list\n    # for a new key if accessed.\n    left_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_map = defaultdict(list)\n\n    # Populate the maps with boot indices.\n    # We use i + 1 to store 1-indexed values as required by the output.\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_map[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_map[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    # This list will store the pairs of (left_boot_idx, right_boot_idx).\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Strategy: Prioritize matches in decreasing order of restrictiveness.\n\n    # Phase 1: Exact specific color matches ('a' through 'z' with 'a' through 'z').\n    # Iterate through all possible specific lowercase letters.\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        # While there are boots of this specific color on both sides, form a pair.\n        while left_map[char] and right_map[char]:\n            left_idx = left_map[char].pop()  # Get an available left boot of this color\n            right_idx = right_map[char].pop() # Get an available right boot of this color\n            pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n\n    # Phase 2: Specific color to '?' matches.\n    # These are less restrictive than exact matches but more restrictive than '?' to '?'.\n    \n    # 2a: Left specific color ('a'-'z') with Right '?'\n    # Iterate through all specific lowercase letters for left boots.\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        # While there are specific left boots of this color and available right '?' boots, form a pair.\n        while left_map[char] and right_map['?']:\n            left_idx = left_map[char].pop()\n            right_idx = right_map['?'].pop()\n            pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n    \n    # 2b: Left '?' with Right specific color ('a'-'z')\n    # Iterate through all specific lowercase letters for right boots.\n    # It's important to do this in a separate loop from 2a, as boots from left_map['?']\n    # and right_map['?'] might be used in different ways.\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        # While there are available left '?' boots and specific right boots of this color, form a pair.\n        while left_map['?'] and right_map[char]:\n            left_idx = left_map['?'].pop()\n            right_idx = right_map[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n\n    # Phase 3: '?' to '?' matches.\n    # These are the least restrictive matches, using any remaining indefinite boots.\n    while left_map['?'] and right_map['?']:\n        left_idx = left_map['?'].pop()\n        right_idx = right_map['?'].pop()\n        pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n\n    # Output the results.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for p in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{p[0]} {p[1]}\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the solution.\nsolve()\n\n```",
