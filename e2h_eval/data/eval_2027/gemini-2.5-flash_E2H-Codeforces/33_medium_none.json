You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I've got this competitive programming problem: replace digits in a number (`a`) with digits from a sequence (`s`) to maximize the resulting value.  The core idea is to make the most significant digits as large as possible.  Since we're dealing with numbers, I'll use the intuitive approach of prioritizing the digits from left to right.\n\nFirst, I need to sort the digits from the sequence `s` in descending order. This ensures I always choose the largest available digit for potential replacements. Then, I'll iterate through the digits of the original number `a`, also from left to right.  For each digit in `a`, I'll compare it to the largest remaining digit from the sorted `s`.\n\nIf the digit from `s` is *larger* than the current digit in `a`, I replace `a`'s digit with the larger one from `s`. This obviously increases the value. I also need to make sure to mark this digit from `s` as \"used\" so I don't use it again.\n\nIf the digit from `s` is *not larger* (meaning it's less than or equal), I don't make a replacement. There's no point in making the number smaller, and replacing the digit would result in either the same number or a smaller number. I move on to the next digit in `a`. Since the digits in `s` are sorted, I know any remaining digit will be smaller and wouldn't improve the current digit in `a`.  This approach guarantees that I achieve the maximum possible number.\n\nThe algorithm uses a pointer to keep track of the largest unused digit in the sorted `s`. I check this pointer's boundary to prevent out-of-range errors and to know when I have no more digits from `s` left. If I use all the available digits from `s`, I simply stop the process.\n\nLet's test this with a couple of examples. It's important to verify that it works correctly for all edge cases like empty inputs or when `s` has only smaller digits. The algorithm should run in O(n + m log m) which is acceptable.\n\nAfter iterating, I'll convert the modified list of digits back into a string and print it out. This solution should work efficiently and accurately solve the problem.\n",
