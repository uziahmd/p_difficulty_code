            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Thought Process: Solving Vanya and Cards**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The core idea is simple: Vanya needs to get the *total sum* of all his cards to zero. I'm focusing on minimizing the number of *new* cards he needs to achieve this.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal and Constraints:** The primary goal is to minimize the new cards. The inputs, `n` (number of existing cards), and `x` (maximum card value's absolute value), are key. The existing cards have values within the range `[-x, x]`, and Vanya can *add* any integer card value within this same range.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Existing Sum:** First, I need to figure out the current total, `current_sum`, of the given cards.\n\n3.  **Determine the \"Gap\":** Vanya wants the final sum to be zero. So, I need to find the \"gap\" or *target* sum needed to reach zero. This is simply `-current_sum`.\n\n4.  **Greedy Approach for Minimization:** To minimize the number of new cards, I'll leverage the largest possible absolute value, which is `x`. I'll use cards that will get the sum as close to the target quickly. If `target_sum_needed` is positive, new cards with value `x` are used; if negative, new cards with value `-x`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Number of Cards:** The number of cards is calculated by finding `ceil(abs(target_sum_needed) / x)`.\n\n6.  **Handle the Edge Case:** If the `current_sum` is zero, Vanya needs zero new cards, which is a trivial case handled by the above formula.\n\n7.  **Example Walkthroughs:** I've mentally walked through two example scenarios to confirm the logic.\n\n8.  **Formula Verification:**  I've double-checked the formula using integer division for calculating `ceil()`. While correct, I'll stick to `math.ceil()` in the code for improved clarity.\n\n9.  **Data Type Considerations:** The calculations involving up to 1000 cards, and `x=1000`, pose no issue for data overflow in Python. The logic and the solution are efficient and should meet the needs of any input constraints of the competition problem.\n\nThis approach should be both correct and efficient for solving the problem. The core is the *greedy* strategy of using the largest possible card values to minimize the total cards. The formula `ceil(abs(current_sum) / x)` encapsulates this logic perfectly.\n",
