The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:** I'm trying to write a Python script to solve this competitive programming problem called \"Rudolf and Snowflakes (hard version)\". The goal is to figure out if a given number `n` can be represented as the sum of a geometric series related to snowflake construction rules. Let's start by understanding those rules.\n\nA snowflake starts with a single center vertex. Then, it expands by connecting the center to `k` new vertices (where `k > 1`). The subsequent expansion step can happen at least once: each \"leaf\" vertex connects to `k` more vertices. I have defined `m` to be the number of times this subsequent step is performed. So, there is one vertex at level 0. `k` vertices at level 1, `k^2` vertices at level 2 and `k^(d)` vertices on level `d`.\n\nThis expands into a formula: the total number of vertices `N` (which is the input `n` in the problem) is `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`, where `d = m + 1`. This is a geometric series. My objective is to check if an input number can be represented as `(k^(d+1) - 1) / (k-1)` for some `k > 1` and `d >= 2`.\n\nSince `n` is as large as 10^18, and we need to be efficient with the `n` values we are testing.\n\nSo, I'm checking to see if `n` can be represented in this series. I know, for the case d=2, the equation is n = 1 + k + k^2. We can rearrange and use the quadratic formula to solve for k to see if the resulting `k` is an integer > 1. I know that `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`. The only valid solution here is when `4n - 3` is a perfect square. Moreover, S, the square root must also be greater than 3.\n\nFor the other case d >= 3, k is a number between 2 and `n^(1/d)`.\n\nFor each input I first check the d=2 condition. Otherwise, I will run a loop, iterating `d` from 3 up to around 60 (to ensure enough numbers are checked). Then I use binary search to try to find a `k` that works for each given `d`.\n\nInside the binary search, I need to compute `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d` which involves the potentially costly repeated multiplications and large number calculations. Since the numbers are so big, I must be careful about integer overflows!\n\nSo, the plan is: a function that handles all these cases and returns True or False.\n\nLet's start coding this solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given integer `n` (up to `10^18`) can represent the number of vertices in a \"snowflake\" graph. A snowflake is constructed with a central vertex, connected to `k` new vertices (`k > 1`). This is then followed by `m` additional expansion steps (`m >= 1`), where each leaf vertex is connected to `k` more new vertices.\n\nLet's analyze the number of vertices:\n1.  **Initial vertex:** 1\n2.  **First expansion:** `k` new vertices are added. Total: `1 + k`.\n3.  **Subsequent expansions (m times):**\n    *   After 1st subsequent expansion (total `m=1`): Each of the `k` leaf vertices gets `k` new vertices. So `k * k = k^2` new vertices are added. Total: `1 + k + k^2`.\n    *   After 2nd subsequent expansion (total `m=2`): Each of the `k^2` leaf vertices gets `k` new vertices. So `k^2 * k = k^3` new vertices are added. Total: `1 + k + k^2 + k^3`.\n    *   After `m`-th subsequent expansion: `k^(m+1)` new vertices are added. Total: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m+1)`.\n\nLet `d = m+1`. Since `m >= 1`, we have `d >= 2`.\nSo, `n` must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series:\n`n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`\nwhere `k > 1` and `d >= 2`.\n\nThis sum can also be written as `n = (k^(d+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n\nWe need to check if such `k` and `d` exist for a given `n`.\n\n**Case 1: `d = 2`**\n`n = 1 + k + k^2`\nThis is a quadratic equation in `k`: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\nUsing the quadratic formula: `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(1 - 4 * (1 - n))) / 2 = (-1 +/- sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.\nFor `k` to be a valid integer `> 1`:\n1.  `4n - 3` must be a perfect square. Let `4n - 3 = S^2` for some integer `S`.\n2.  We need `k = (-1 + S) / 2` (since `k > 0`).\n3.  `S` must be odd for `(-1 + S)` to be even, making `k` an integer. `4n - 3` is always odd, so `S^2` is odd, which means `S` is always odd.\n4.  `k > 1` implies `(-1 + S) / 2 > 1`, so `-1 + S > 2`, which means `S > 3`.\n\nSo, for `d = 2`, we check if `4n - 3` is a perfect square `S^2` and if `S > 3`. If both conditions are met, then `n` is a snowflake number.\n\n**Case 2: `d >= 3`**\n`n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`\nSince `k > 1`, the smallest possible `k` is 2.\nThe maximum value of `d`: If `k=2`, `n = 2^(d+1) - 1`. For `n <= 10^18`, `2^(d+1) - 1 <= 10^18`, so `2^(d+1) <= 10^18 + 1`. This implies `d+1 <= log2(10^18 + 1) approx 59.79`. So, `d` can go up to `58` (if `d+1=59`) or `59` (if `d+1=60`). Let's iterate `d` from 3 up to `59`.\n\nFor a fixed `d` in this range, we need to find if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that `n = 1 + k + ... + k^d`.\nWe can use binary search for `k`.\nThe lower bound for `k` is `2`.\nThe upper bound for `k`: Since `k^d < n`, `k < n^(1/d)`. So `k` can be at most `int(n**(1/d)) + 2` (add a small buffer for floating point precision).\nFor `d=3`, `k_max` is roughly `(10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6`.\nFor `d=59`, `k_max` is roughly `(10^18)^(1/59) approx 2`.\n\n**Binary Search Algorithm for `k` for a fixed `d`:**\n1.  Initialize `low = 2`, `high = int(n**(1/d)) + 2`.\n2.  While `low <= high`:\n    a.  `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n    b.  If `mid < 2`, set `low = mid + 1` and continue (we need `k > 1`).\n    c.  Calculate `current_sum = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^d`.\n        *   This sum needs to be calculated carefully to avoid overflow if intermediate `mid^i` values exceed `n` or `10^18`.\n        *   Initialize `current_sum = 1`, `power_k = mid`.\n        *   Iterate `i` from 1 to `d`:\n            *   Add `power_k` to `current_sum`.\n            *   If `current_sum > n` at any point, it means `mid` is too large. Mark `overflow = True` and break.\n            *   To compute the next `power_k` (`power_k * mid`), check for overflow before multiplication: `if n // mid < power_k`, then `power_k * mid` would exceed `n`. Mark `overflow = True` and break.\n            *   `power_k *= mid`.\n    d.  If `not overflow` and `current_sum == n`: we found a valid `k`. Return `True`.\n    e.  If `overflow` or `current_sum > n`: `mid` is too large. Set `high = mid - 1`.\n    f.  Else (`current_sum < n`): `mid` is too small. Set `low = mid + 1`.\n\nIf after iterating through all `d` values and performing binary search for `k`, no combination is found, then `n` is not a snowflake number.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   `d=2` check: `O(log N)` for `sqrt`, effectively constant time for `N <= 10^18`.\n*   `d >= 3` loop: `d` iterates from 3 to `~59` (approx 57 iterations).\n    *   Binary search for `k`: The range for `k` is roughly `[2, 10^6]` (for `d=3`). `log2(10^6) approx 20` iterations.\n    *   Inside binary search, sum calculation: `d` terms. This takes `O(d)` time.\n    *   Total operations: `57 * 20 * 59` (worst case `d=59` for sum calc) `approx 67260` operations per test case.\n*   For `T = 10^4` test cases: `10^4 * 67260 approx 6.7 * 10^8` operations. This is on the higher side for a typical 1-2 second time limit but might pass due to average case performance or Python's integer handling being faster for smaller numbers. The `pow` function in Python for `k^d` with large `k` and `d` can be slow, but our iterative sum calculation with overflow checks is efficient.\n\n**Example `n=10^18`:**\n*   `d=2`: `4*10^18 - 3`. `sqrt(4*10^18 - 3)` is not an integer. So `d=2` fails.\n*   `d >= 3`: Binary search. No `k` will be found.\n*   Result: `NO`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # Case 1: d = 2 (n = 1 + k + k^2)\n    # k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(1 - 4(1 - n))) / 2\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2\n    \n    # Check if 4n - 3 is a perfect square S^2 and S > 3\n    val = 4 * n - 3\n    if val >= 0: # val must be non-negative for sqrt\n        s_float = math.isqrt(val) # integer square root\n        if s_float * s_float == val:\n            # s must be odd for k to be integer, which is guaranteed because 4n-3 is always odd.\n            # k > 1 implies (-1 + s) / 2 > 1 => -1 + s > 2 => s > 3\n            if s_float > 3:\n                # k = (s_float - 1) // 2\n                # Since s_float is odd and > 3, k will be an integer > 1.\n                print(\"YES\")\n                return\n\n    # Case 2: d >= 3 (n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d)\n    # Iterate d from 3 up to a reasonable maximum.\n    # Max d: If k=2, n = 2^(d+1) - 1.
