Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to write a Python script for the \"New Year Candles\" problem. Seems like a classic simulation or greedy problem. We're given an initial number of candles (`a`) and a conversion rate (`b`) where `b` burned-out candles can be made into 1 new one. The goal is to maximize the total burn time.\n\nLet's break down the core logic. We have a resource conversion scenario: new candles get consumed (burn out) and can then be converted back into the resource (new candles). We want to maximize the total time, so we need to maximize the number of candles burned.\n\n**Variables and Initial Conditions**\n\nWe can represent this with a few variables: `total_hours` (initialized to 0), `current_new_candles` (initially `a`), and `burned_out_candles` (initially 0).\n\n**The Simulation Process**\n\nThe process will be iterative:\n1.  Burn all `current_new_candles`. This adds `current_new_candles` to `total_hours`.\n2.  These candles become `burned_out_candles`.\n3.  `current_new_candles` is now 0.\n4.  Convert `burned_out_candles` into new candles. The number of new candles is `burned_out_candles // b`. The remainder becomes the new `burned_out_candles`. Add the new candles to `current_new_candles`.\n5.  Repeat until `current_new_candles` becomes 0.\n\n**Example Trace**\n\nLet's trace the example `a=4, b=2`:\n\n*   Initially: `total_hours = 0, current_new_candles = 4, burned_out_candles = 0`\n*   Iteration 1: Burn 4 candles. `total_hours = 4, burned_out_candles = 4, current_new_candles = 0`. Convert 4 burned to 2 new candles. `current_new_candles = 2, burned_out_candles = 0`.\n*   Iteration 2: Burn 2 candles. `total_hours = 6, burned_out_candles = 2, current_new_candles = 0`. Convert 2 burned to 1 new candle. `current_new_candles = 1, burned_out_candles = 0`\n*   Iteration 3: Burn 1 candle. `total_hours = 7, burned_out_candles = 1, current_new_candles = 0`. Convert 1, which gives 0 new candles and 1 remainder.  `burned_out_candles = 1, current_new_candles = 0`.\n\nThe process ends when current candles are 0. The total time is 7.\n\nThis simulation appears correct.\n\n**Verification and Optimization**\n\nWe can trace another example `a=6, b=3`. Let's test `a=1000`, `b=2`.\n\nWith `a=1000` and `b=2`, after one round we have roughly half the candles. The number of candles is always decreasing, quickly, which ensures the loop terminates in a timely fashion. This looks like a reasonably efficient simulation for these input constraints.\n\n**Input/Output Handling**\n\nThe problem specifies input as a single line with two integers `a` and `b`. The output is the total hours, a single integer.\n\n**Code Implementation**\n\nBased on this analysis, the python code for the solution looks like:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    a_str, b_str = line.split()\n    a = int(a_str)\n    b = int(b_str)\n\n    total_hours = 0\n    current_new_candles = a\n    burned_out_candles = 0\n\n    while current_new_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_new_candles\n        burned_out_candles += current_new_candles\n        current_new_candles = 0\n\n        new_candles_from_burned = burned_out_candles // b\n        burned_out_candles = burned_out_candles % b\n        current_new_candles += new_candles_from_burned\n\n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n```\n\n**Final Considerations**\n\nThe constraints `1 <= a <= 1000, 2 <= b <= 1000` are reasonable. The simulation approach works because burning a candle is the only way to generate burnt candles and burning a",
