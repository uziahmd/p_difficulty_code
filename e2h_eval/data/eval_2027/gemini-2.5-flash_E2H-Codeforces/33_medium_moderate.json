You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Reflecting on the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nI've been tasked with crafting a Python script to tackle the \"Replacing Digits\" problem, a classic exercise in optimization and strategic digit replacement. My approach hinges on a greedy strategy: to maximize the resultant number, I must elevate the most significant digits first.\n\nThe core principle is to scan the input number, `a`, from left to right. For each digit, I seek the largest available digit from the sequence `s` that surpasses the current digit in `a`. The rationale is straightforward: a larger leftmost digit invariably yields a larger overall number. I'll maintain a sorted version of `s`, `s_sorted`, to streamline the search for the optimal replacement.\n\nThe algorithm's structure is methodical:\n1.  Convert `a` to a mutable list.\n2.  Sort `s` in descending order.\n3.  Iterate through `a`.\n4.  For each digit `a[i]`, iterate through `s_sorted` from the start of `s`.\n5.  If an `s` digit is larger than `a[i]`, replace `a[i]` and advance to the next `a` digit. This pointer-based approach effectively marks a digit as used (the next digit of `s` will then be selected).\n\nI'll use a pointer, `s_ptr`, to efficiently track the largest available digit in `s_sorted`, avoiding costly operations.\n\nThe script's efficiency hinges on this strategy. As `s_ptr` increases, once it reaches the end of `s_sorted`, or if it reaches a digit that is not greater than the current digit in `a`, I know no further replacement will be possible.\n\nAfter thorough analysis and testing of various edge cases, I am confident that this is a very efficient and elegant solution.\n",
