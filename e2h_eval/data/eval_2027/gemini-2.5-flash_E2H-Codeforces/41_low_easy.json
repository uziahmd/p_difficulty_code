There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Zoning Restrictions Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem. Let's see, it's about maximizing profit from building houses. I've got `n` spots, each with a potential height `a` between 0 and `h`, and the profit for a house of height `a` is simply `a^2`. The catch is these restrictions, `m` of them. Each restriction, `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, means that within the range `[l_i, r_i]`, the *maximum* height can't exceed `x_i`.\n\nThe key insight is that because the *maximum* height within a range has to be at most `x_i`, then *every* house within that range is also limited by `x_i`. This simplifies things significantly.\n\nGiven the small constraints (`n, h, m <= 50`), I think a polynomial-time solution should be perfectly fine. Something like `O(n * h * m)` or `O(n * h^2)` should be achievable.\n\nHere's my plan: For each spot `j`, I need to determine the maximum allowed height, `max_h[j]`. This height is limited both by the global maximum, `h`, and by the restrictions. So, for a spot `j`, I need to find all the restrictions that apply to it (i.e., where `l_i <= j <= r_i`) and then take the minimum of `h` and all the `x_i` values from those restrictions.\n\nI'll formalize this. I'll initialize an array, `allowed_height[1...n]`, where `allowed_height[j]` will store the maximum possible height for spot `j`. Initially, every spot has `allowed_height[j] = h`. Then, I'll go through each of the `m` restrictions. For each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, I'll iterate through the spots from `l_i` to `r_i` and update their allowed heights by taking the minimum: `allowed_height[j] = min(allowed_height[j], x_i)`.\n\nAfter processing all the restrictions, the `allowed_height` array will contain the true maximum height for each spot.  Since the profit, `a^2`, is monotonically increasing for `a >= 0`, to maximize my profit, for each spot `j`, I'll simply build a house with height `allowed_height[j]`. That should be the optimal solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `j`, we can build a house with an integer height `a` between `0` and `h` (inclusive), earning `a^2` dollars. There are `m` restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house within a range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on the height of a house at a specific spot `j`.\n1.  **Global maximum height**: The height of any house must be at most `h`.\n2.  **Zoning restrictions**: For every restriction `i` given by `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, if spot `j` is within the range `[l_i, r_i]` (i.e., `l_i <= j <= r_i`), then the house at spot `j` must have a height of at most `x_i`. This is because if `height[j] > x_i`, then the maximum height in the range `[l_i, r_i]` would be at least `height[j]`, which violates the restriction `max(height[l_i], ..., height[r_i]) <= x_i`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, its height `height[j]` must be less than or equal to `h`, and also less than or equal to `x_i` for every restriction `i` that covers spot `j`. Therefore, the maximum possible height for a house at spot `j` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_i` values from restrictions that cover spot `j`.\n\nLet `max_allowed_height[j]` be the maximum permissible height for a house at spot `j`.\nWe can initialize `max_allowed_height[j] = h` for all `j` from `1` to `n`.\nThen, for each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\nFor every spot `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive), we update `max_allowed_height[j] = min(max_allowed_height[j], x_i)`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, the `max_allowed_height` array will store the absolute maximum height possible for each house while satisfying all global and zoning restrictions.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we should choose the largest possible height for each house. Since the profit function `a^2` is strictly increasing for `a >= 0`, building a house with height `max_allowed_height[j]` at spot `j` will yield the maximum possible profit for that spot.\n\nThe total maximum profit will be the sum of `(max_allowed_height[j])^2` for all `j` from `1` to `n`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n`, `h`, `m`.\n2.  Create an array `max_allowed_height` of size `n+1` (using 1-based indexing for convenience, or adjust to 0-based). Initialize all elements to `h`.\n3.  For each of the `m` restrictions:\n    a.  Read `l_i`, `r_i`, `x_i`.\n    b.  Iterate `j` from `l_i` to `r_i`:\n        Set `max_allowed_height[j] = min(max_allowed_height[j], x_i)`.\n4.  Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n5.  Iterate `j` from `1` to `n`:\n    Add `(max_allowed_height[j])^2` to `total_profit`.\n6.  Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\n`max_allowed_height = [0, 3, 3, 3]` (index 0 unused)\n\nRestrictions:\n1.  `l=1, r=1, x=1`:\n    `max_allowed_height[1] = min(max_allowed_height[1], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n    `max_allowed_height` is now `[0, 1, 3, 3]`\n2.  `l=2, r=2, x=3`:\n    `max_allowed_height[2] = min(max_allowed_height[2], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`\n    `max_allowed_height` is now `[0, 1, 3, 3]`\n3.  `l=3, r=3, x=2`:\n    `max_allowed_height[3] = min(max_allowed_height[3], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`\n    `max_allowed_height` is now `[0, 1, 3, 2]`\n\nCalculate total profit:\n`total_profit = (max_allowed_height[1])^2 + (max_allowed_height[2])^2 + (max_allowed_height[3])^2`\n`total_profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: `O(n)`\n*   Processing restrictions: `m` restrictions. For each restriction, we iterate `r_i - l_i + 1` spots. In the worst case, `r_i - l_i + 1` can be `n`. So, `O(m * n)`.\n*   Calculating total profit: `O(n)`\nTotal time complexity: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`.\nGiven `n, m <= 50`, `m*n` is at most `50 * 50 = 2500`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(n)` for `max_allowed_height` array.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize max_allowed_height for each spot.\n    # All houses can initially be built up to height 'h'.\n    # Using 1-based indexing for spots 1 to n.\n    max_allowed_height = [h] * (n + 1) \n\n    # Process each zoning restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # For each spot j in the range [l, r], \n        # its height must be at most x.\n        # So, update the max_allowed_height for these spots.\n        for j in range(l, r + 1):\n            max_allowed_height[j] = min(max_allowed_height[j], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        # To maximize profit, build each house at its maximum allowed height.\n        # Profit from a house of height 'a' is a^2.\n        total_profit += max_allowed_height[j] ** 2\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
