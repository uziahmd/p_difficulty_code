Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Decoding the Morse Code Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this intriguing competitive programming problem. The goal is to calculate the number of valid sequences of English letters that can be formed from a continuously updated Morse code string. Essentially, I'm dealing with a dynamic substring search problem.\n\nLet's break it down. I'm given a string `S` that's built up one '0' or '1' at a time. After each addition, I need to figure out how many possible letter sequences can be constructed where their combined Morse code representations are a substring of the current `S`. The answer needs to be modulo `10^9 + 7`, of course.\n\nThe challenge lies in efficiently accounting for all the possible letter combinations that can form within `S`. Each letter is represented by a Morse code pattern, which can be 1 to 4 characters long (\"0\" or \"1\"). There are only 26 valid English letters, so I know I'm dealing with 30 possible Morse code representations (the four invalid ones can be ignored).\n\nI'm starting with an empty string, and `S` can grow to a length of 3000 at most, so I'm dealing with a manageable size. For instance, if `S` is \"111\", the possible substrings are \"1\", \"11\" and \"111\", so I need to find all the letter sequences I can derive from those substrings.\nThe combinations can be more complex. Say I have `\"111\"`. The substrings are \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\". \"111\" can represent the letter \"O\". But the sequence \"111\" can be broken down as \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", meaning the sequence \"TTT\". Or it can be broken down to \"1\" \"11\" meaning the sequence \"TM\".\n\nMy intuition tells me that dynamic programming or a similar technique is probably the way to go here. I need to figure out a method to efficiently track the valid letter sequences that are possible at each step, after each append operation. I'm thinking of building up some sort of DP table, where each entry represents the number of valid sequences ending at a particular position within the string, but I need to be careful to consider overlaps and combinations.\n\nThe problem seems to boil down to efficiently finding substrings of `S` that can be decoded into sequences of English letters and then counting these sequences, always remembering to apply the modulo operation to avoid integer overflow. I need to make sure I don't double count sequences, especially where there are overlaps. This is going to be a fun one!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code representation forms a substring of a growing string `S`. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet's define what constitutes a valid Morse code for an English letter:\n1.  It's a string of '0's and '1's.\n2.  Its length is between 1 and 4.\n3.  It's not one of \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nThere are `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` such strings. After excluding the 4 invalid ones, 26 strings remain, each uniquely mapping to an English letter.\n\nLet `S` be the current string after `k` appends. We are looking for sequences `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` such that their concatenated Morse codes `M_1 M_2 ... M_p` is a substring of `S`.\n\nThis problem can be modeled using dynamic programming on substrings. When a new character is appended to `S`, extending it to `S'`, we need to update the total count. Let `S_k` denote `S` after `k` appends.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose Morse code representation forms a *prefix* of `S[i:]` (the suffix of `S` starting at index `i`).\nThe total answer for `S` would be the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(S) - 1`. However, this is not quite right. `dp[i]` counts sequences starting at `S[i]`. We need sequences whose Morse code is *any* substring.\n\nA more direct approach for substrings:\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code representation forms a *prefix* of `S[i:]`.\nTo calculate `dp[i]`:\n`dp[i] = sum(dp[i + len(M)] + 1)` for all valid Morse codes `M` such that `S[i:i+len(M)] == M`.\nThe `+1` accounts for the sequence consisting of just the letter corresponding to `M`.\nThe base case is `dp[len(S)] = 0`.\n\nWhen `S` grows by one character, say `S_k = S_{k-1} + char`.\nThe new character is `S_k[k-1]`.\nWe need to calculate the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1` where `dp[i]` is defined with respect to `S_k`.\nThe crucial observation is that `m` is up to `3000`. A naive recalculation of all `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1` after each append would be `O(m * m * max_len_morse) = O(m^2 * 4)`, which is `3000^2 * 4 = 3.6 * 10^7` operations per update. Summing these up, it would be `O(m^3)`, too slow.\n\nLet's refine the DP state.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code forms a prefix of `S` of length `i`.\n`dp[0] = 1` (representing an empty sequence, which is a base for building longer sequences).\n`dp[i] = sum(dp[i - len(M)])` for all valid Morse codes `M` such that `S[i - len(M) : i] == M`.\nThis `dp[i]` counts how many ways to parse the prefix `S[0:i]` into a sequence of Morse codes.\n\nThe problem asks for sequences from *any substring*.\nLet `S` be the current string of length `N`.\nFor each starting position `j` from `0` to `N-1`, we want to count the number of sequences that can be formed from `S[j:]`.\nLet `count_at_start[j]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[j:]` as the Morse code string.\n`count_at_start[j] = sum(count_at_start[j + len(M)] + 1)` for all valid Morse codes `M` such that `S[j:j+len(M)] == M`.\nBase case: `count_at_start[N] = 0`.\n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S + c`. Its length becomes `N+1`.\nThe values `count_at_start[j]` for `j < N` remain the same, as they refer to suffixes of `S` that are also suffixes of `S+c`.\nWe only need to calculate `count_at_start[N]` (for the new string `S+c`).\n`count_at_start[N]` refers to the suffix `S[N:]`, which is just the new character `c`.\nThis is incorrect. `count_at_start[j]` refers to the count of sequences whose *entire* Morse code representation is `S[j:]`.\nThe problem says \"represented with some substring of `S`\". This means we need to sum `count_at_start[j]` for all `j`.\n\nLet's define `dp[i]` as the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[i:]` as the Morse code string.\nWhen `S` grows to `S'`, `S' = S + char`.\nThe length of `S'` is `N+1`.\nWe need to compute `dp[N]` for `S'`.\n`dp[N]` (for `S'`) = `sum(dp[N + len(M)] + 1)` for valid `M` such that `S'[N:N+len(M)] == M`.\nThe values `dp[i]` for `i < N` (for `S'`) are the same as `dp[i]` (for `S`).\nSo, after each append, we just calculate one new `dp` value.\nThe total answer is `sum(dp[i] for i in 0 to N)`.\nThis is `O(m * 4)` for calculating the new `dp` value, and `O(m)` for summing. Total `O(m^2)`.\n`3000^2 = 9 * 10^6` operations, which should be acceptable.\n\nLet's list the valid Morse codes and the invalid ones.\nValid codes (26 total):\nLength 1: \"0\", \"1\"\nLength 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\nLength 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\" (excluding \"1110\")\nLength 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\" (excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1111\")\n\nSpecifically, the invalid ones are: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nAll other strings of length 1 to 4 are valid.\n\nLet `current_S` be the string `S`.\nLet `dp` be a list. `dp[i]` stores the count of sequences for `current_S[i:]`.\nInitialize `current_S = \"\"`\nInitialize `dp = [0]` (representing `dp[0]` for an empty string, which is 0 sequences).\n\nWhen `char` is appended:\n`current_S += char`\n`N = len(current_S)`\n`new_dp_val = 0`\nIterate `length` from 1 to 4:\n  If `N - length >= 0`:\n    `substring = current_S[N - length : N]`\n    If `substring` is a valid Morse code:\n      `new_dp_val = (new_dp_val + dp[N - length] + 1) % MOD`\nAppend `new_dp_val` to `dp`.\nThe total answer for this step is `sum(dp) % MOD`.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `S` grows `\"\" -> \"1\" -> \"11\" -> \"111\"`\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\nInitially, `S = \"\"`, `dp = [0]`, `total_ans = 0`.\n\n1.  Append '1'. `S = \"1\"`. `N = 1`.\n    Calculate `dp[0]` (for `S=\"1\"`):\n    `length = 1`: `substring = S[0:1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n      `new_dp_val = (0 + dp[1] + 1) % MOD`. `dp[1]` here means `dp[N-length]` for the *new* `dp` array.\n      This means `dp` should be indexed starting from the end of the string.\n      Let `dp[i]` be the count of sequences whose Morse code is `S[i:]`.\n      When `S` has length `N`, `dp` will have `N+1` elements: `dp[0], ..., dp[N]`.\n      `dp[N]` is always 0 (empty suffix).\n\nLet `dp` be an array of size `m+1`. `dp[i]` will store the count for `S[i:]`.\nInitially `dp` is all zeros. `S` is empty.\n\nAppend '1':\n`S = \"1\"`. `N = 1`.\nNeed to calculate `dp[0]` for `S=\"1\"`.\n`dp[1]` (for `S=\"1\"`) is 0.\n`dp[0]` = `(dp[0+len(M)] + 1)` for valid `M` that is a prefix of `S[0:]`.\n  `M = \"1\"` (length 1). `S[0:1] == \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n  `dp[0]` = `(dp[1] + 1) = (0 + 1) = 1`.\nCurrent `dp` array: `[1, 0]`.\nTotal answer = `sum(dp) = 1`.\n\nAppend '1':\n`S = \"11\"`. `N = 2`.\n`dp` array for `S=\"1\"` was `[1, 0]`.\nNow we need `dp[0], dp[1]` for `S=\"11\"`. `dp[2]` is 0.\n`dp[1]` (for `S=\"11\"`):\n  `M = \"1\"` (length 1). `S[1:2] == \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n  `dp[1] = (dp[1+1] + 1) = (dp[2] + 1) = (0 + 1) = 1`.\n`dp[0]` (for `S=\"11\"`):\n  `M = \"1\"` (length 1). `S[0:1] == \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n  `dp[0] = (dp[0+1] + 1) = (dp[1] + 1) = (1 + 1) = 2`.\n  `M = \"11\"` (length 2). `S[0:2] == \"11\"`. \"11\" is valid.\n  `dp[0] = (dp[0] + dp[0+2] + 1) = (2 + dp[2] + 1) = (2 + 0 + 1) = 3`.\nCurrent `dp` array: `[3, 1, 0]`.\nTotal answer = `sum(dp) = 3 + 1 = 4`.\nWait, example output is 3. What's wrong?\nAh, the example output for \"11\" is 3.\n\"1\" -> 'T'\n\"11\" -> 'M'\n\"11\" -> \"TT\" (T then T)\nSequences: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\". Total 3.\nMy `dp[0]` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1. Sum is 4.\n`dp[0]` for `S=\"11\"`:\n  \"1\" (T) -> `dp[1]` + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. (Sequences: \"T\", \"TT\")\n  \"11\" (M) -> `dp[2]` + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. (Sequences: \"M\")\nTotal `dp[0]` = 2 + 1 = 3.\nThis matches `dp[0]` for \"11\".\n`dp[1]` for `S=\"11\"`:\n  \"1\" (T) -> `dp[2]` + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. (Sequences: \"T\")\nTotal `dp[1]` = 1.\n`dp[2]` for `S=\"11\"` is 0.\nThe total answer is `dp[0] + dp[1] = 3 + 1 = 4`. Still not 3.\n\nLet's re-read: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of `S` in Morse code.\"\nFor `S = \"11\"`:\nSubstrings are \"1\" (at index 0), \"1\" (at index 1), \"11\" (at index 0).\n1.  Substring \"1\" (from `S[0]`): can be 'T'. Sequence: \"T\".\n2.  Substring \"1\" (from `S[1]`): can be 'T'. Sequence: \"T\".\n3.  Substring \"11\" (from `S[0]`):\n    *   Can be 'M'. Sequence: \"M\".\n    *   Can be 'T' + 'T'. Sequence: \"TT\".\n\nThe problem asks for the *number of non-empty sequences of English letters*. This implies distinct sequences.\n\"T\" (from `S[0]`) and \"T\" (from `S[1]`) are the same sequence \"T\". We should count it only once.\nSo, the set of sequences is {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. The count is 3.\n\nThis means my DP approach is counting sequences based on *where* they appear in `S`, not distinct sequences globally.\nIf `dp[i]` is the count of sequences starting at index `i`, then `sum(dp[i])` sums up counts for `S[0:]`, `S[1:]`, etc.\nThis will overcount. For example, \"T\" from `S[0]` and \"T\" from `S[1]` are both counted.\n\nWe need to store the *set* of sequences. But sequences can be arbitrarily long. Storing them explicitly is not feasible.\nThis means the DP state must be designed to count unique sequences.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed using `S[i:]` as the Morse code string. This is what I had.\nThe example output implies that `dp[0]` is the answer for `S`.\nIf `S = \"11\"`, `dp[0]` should be 3.\n  `dp[2] = 0`\n  `dp[1]` for `S=\"11\"`:\n    `M = \"1\"`. `S[1:2] = \"1\"`. Valid.\n    `dp[1] = (dp[2] + 1) = (0 + 1) = 1`.\n  `dp[0]` for `S=\"11\"`:\n    `M = \"1\"`. `S[0:1] = \"1\"`. Valid.\n    `val1 = (dp[1] + 1) = (1 + 1) = 2`.\n    `M = \"11\"`. `S[0:2] = \"11\"`. Valid.\n    `val2 = (dp[2] + 1) = (0 + 1) = 1`.\n    `dp[0] = (val1 + val2) = (2 + 1) = 3`.\nThis matches the example output for `S=\"11\"`. So the answer is `dp[0]` for the current `S`.\nThis means `dp[i]` should be defined as: number of sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing `S[i:]`.\n\nLet's trace `S = \"111\"`. `N = 3`.\n`dp` for `S=\"11\"` was `[3, 1, 0]`.\nNow append '1'. `S = \"111\"`.\n`dp` array will be `[?, ?, ?, 0]`. `dp[3]` is 0.\nNeed to compute `dp[2]`, `dp[1]`, `dp[0]` for `S=\"111\"`.\n\n`dp[2]` for `S=\"111\"`: (suffix \"1\")\n  `M = \"1\"`. `S[2:3] = \"1\"`. Valid.\n  `dp[2] = (dp[3] + 1) = (0 + 1) = 1`. (Sequence: \"T\")\n\n`dp[1]` for `S=\"111\"`: (suffix \"11\")\n  `M = \"1\"`. `S[1:2] = \"1\"`. Valid.\n  `val1 = (dp[2] + 1) = (1 + 1) = 2`. (Sequences: \"T\", \"TT\")\n  `M = \"11\"`. `S[1:3] = \"11\"`. Valid.\n  `val2 = (dp[3] + 1) = (0 + 1) = 1`. (Sequence: \"M\")\n  `dp[1] = (val1 + val2) = (2 + 1) = 3`.

(Sequences: \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\")\n  `M = \"11\"`. `S[0:2] = \"11\"`. Valid.\n  `val2 = (dp[2] + 1) = (1 + 1) = 2`. (Sequences: \"M\", \"MT\")\n  `M = \"111\"`. `S[0:3] = \"111\"`. Valid.\n  `val3 = (dp[3] + 1) = (0 + 1) = 1`. (Sequence: \"O\")\n  `dp[0] = (val1 + val2 + val3) = (4 + 2 + 1) = 7`.\n\nThis matches the example output: 1 -> 3 -> 7.\nSo the answer for string `S` is `dp[0]`.\n\nThe DP state `dp[i]` is defined as the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code representation is exactly `S[i:]`.\nWhen a new character is appended to `S`, say `S_old` becomes `S_new = S_old + char`.\nLet `N_old` be `len(S_old)`. `N_new = N_old + 1`.\nWe need to compute `dp[i]` for `S_new` for all `i` from `0` to `N_new`.\nThe `dp` values for `i` from `0` to `N_old-1` for `S_new` are the same as `dp` values for `S_old`.\nThe only new value we need to compute is `dp[N_old]` for `S_new`.\n`dp[N_new]` is always 0.\nSo, we can maintain the `dp` array. When `char` is appended:\n1.  Append `char` to `S`.\n2.  Let `N` be the new length of `S`.\n3.  We need to compute `dp[N-1]` (the new `dp[N-1]` for the current `S`).\n    `dp[N-1] = 0`\n    For `length` from 1 to 4:\n      If `N - length >= N - 1`: (i.e., `N - length` is `N-1` or less)\n        `substring = S[N - 1 : N - 1 + length]`\n        If `len(substring) == length` and `substring` is a valid Morse code:\n          `dp[N-1] = (dp[N-1] + dp[N - 1 + length] + 1) % MOD`\n\nThis is still not quite right. `dp[i]` for `S_new` should depend on `dp[i+len(M)]` for `S_new`.\nSo, when `S` grows by one character, say `S_k` is `S_{k-1} + c`.\nLet `dp_k[i]` be the count for `S_k[i:]`.\n`dp_k[k] = 0`.\n`dp_k[k-1]` = `sum(dp_k[k-1+len(M)] + 1)` for valid `M` that is `S_k[k-1:k-1+len(M)]`.\n`dp_k[k-2]` = `sum(dp_k[k-2+len(M)] + 1)` for valid `M` that is `S_k[k-2:k-2+len(M)]`.\n...\n`dp_k[0]` = `sum(dp_k[len(M)] + 1)` for valid `M` that is `S_k[0:len(M)]`.\n\nThis means we need to recompute `dp_k[i]` for `i` from `k-1` down to `0`.\nFor each `i`, we check `S_k[i:i+len]` for `len` in `1..4`.\nThis is `O(m * 4)` for each `i`, and `m` such `i` values. Total `O(m^2 * 4)`.\nThis is `3000^2 * 4 = 3.6 * 10^7`. This might be acceptable.\n\nLet's define `dp` array of size `m+1`. `dp[i]` will store the answer for `S[i:]`.\n`S` will be built as a list of characters for efficient appends and slicing.\n\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n`current_S_list = []`\n`dp = [0] * (m + 1)` # dp[i] for S[i:]\n\nFor each `_` in `range(m)`:\n  `char = input_char()`\n  `current_S_list.append(char)`\n  `N = len(current_S_list)`\n\n  `dp[N] = 0` # Base case for current S, empty suffix\n\n  `for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):`\n    `current_dp_val = 0`\n    `for length in range(1, 5):`\n      `if i + length <= N:`\n        `substring = \"\".join(current_S_list[i : i + length])`\n        `if substring not in invalid_codes:`\n          `current_dp_val = (current_dp_val + dp[i + length] + 1) % MOD`\n    `dp[i] = current_dp_val`\n\n  `print(dp[0])`\n\nThis looks correct and fits the time complexity. `m=3000`.\nOuter loop `m` times.\nInner loop `N` times (up to `m`).\nInnermost loop `4` times.\nString slicing and `join` takes `O(length)` time.\nTotal time complexity: `m * N * 4 * 4 = m * m * 16`.\n`3000 * 3000 * 16 = 1.44 * 10^8`. This might be too slow. Python string `join` is slow.\nWe should use `current_S_list` directly to avoid `join`.\n\nOptimization for substring check:\nInstead of `\"\".join(current_S_list[i : i + length])`, we can build the substring character by character.\nOr, better, since `current_S_list` is just `m` length, we can use it as a list of characters.\n`current_S_list[i]` is a char. `current_S_list[i+1]` is a char.\nThe `substring` can be built incrementally.\nFor `i` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `current_dp_val = 0`\n  `current_substring = []`\n  `for length in range(1, 5):`\n    `if i + length <= N:`\n      `current_substring.append(current_S_list[i + length - 1])`\n      `s = \"\".join(current_substring)` # This is still `O(length)`\n      `if s not in invalid_codes:`\n        `current_dp_val = (current_dp_val + dp[i + length] + 1) % MOD`\n    `else:`\n      `break` # Substring too long\n  `dp[i] = current_dp_val`\n\nThis is `O(m * m * 4 * 4)` because `\"\".join(current_substring)` is `O(length)`. Max `length` is 4. So `O(m^2 * 16)`.\nThe `current_substring` list grows.\nA better way to get `substring` without `join`:\n`s = current_S_list[i]` for length 1\n`s = current_S_list[i] + current_S_list[i+1]` for length 2\n...\n`s = current_S_list[i] + current_S_list[i+1] + current_S_list[i+2] + current_S_list[i+3]` for length 4.\nThis is `O(1)` for each `s` if `current_S_list` is a list of strings, or `O(length)` if it's a list of characters and we concatenate them.\nIf `current_S_list` is a Python string, `current_S[i:i+length]` is `O(length)`.\nSo `m * m * 4 * 4` remains.\n\nLet's test the `O(m^2 * 4)` complexity. `3000^2 * 4 = 3.6 * 10^7`.\nThis should be acceptable in competitive programming (usually `10^8` operations per second).\nThe `substring` creation `current_S_list[i : i + length]` is actually `O(length)` in Python for lists.\nSo `m * N * 4 * 4` is indeed `m^2 * 16`.\n`3000 * 3000 * 16 = 1.44 * 10^8`. This is borderline.\nLet's consider the actual operations: list slicing `current_S_list[i : i + length]` creates a new list of characters. Then `\"\".join()` joins them.\nThis is effectively `O(length)` for string creation.\n\nCould we avoid rebuilding the string/list `current_S_list` every time?\nThe `current_S_list` is only appended to. It grows.\nThe `dp` array is of size `m+1`.\n`dp[i]` for `S[i:]`.\nWhen `N` increases by 1, `current_S_list` gets one character appended.\nWe iterate `i` from `N-1` down to `0`.\nFor each `i`, we check `S[i:i+1]`, `S[i:i+2]`, `S[i:i+3]`, `S[i:i+4]`.\nThe `substring` lookup in `invalid_codes` (a set) is `O(length)`.\nSo, the total operations for `substring` creation and lookup is `sum_{k=1 to N} sum_{i=0 to k-1} sum_{len=1 to 4} O(len)`.\nThis is `sum_{k=1 to N} k * 4 * 4 = N^2 * 8`.\nTotal `m * m^2 * 8 = m^3 * 8`? No.\nThe `N` is the current length of `S`.\nTotal time: `sum_{N=1 to m} (N * 4 * 4) = 16 * sum_{N=1 to m} N = 16 * m * (m+1) / 2 = 8 * m * (m+1)`.\nThis is `O(m^2)`.\n`8 * 3000 * 3001` is roughly `8 * 9 * 10^6 = 7.2 * 10^7`. This is perfectly fine.\nMy analysis of string slicing `O(length)` was for each `substring` creation.\nSo for `length=1`, it's `O(1)`. For `length=2`, `O(2)`. For `length=3`, `O(3)`. For `length=4`, `O(4)`.\nTotal for inner loop is `O(1+2+3+4) = O(10)`.\nSo it's `O(m^2 * 10)`. `9 * 10^6 * 10 = 9 * 10^7`. This is good.\n\nFinal check on the logic:\n`dp[i]` is the count of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code is `S[i:]`.\nWhen we compute `dp[i]`, we consider all possible first letters `L_1` whose Morse code `M_1` is `S[i:i+len(M_1)]`.\nFor each such `M_1`, we add `1` (for the sequence `L_1` itself) plus `dp[i+len(M_1)]` (for sequences `L_1 L_2 ... L_p`).\nThis is the standard way to count distinct ways to parse a string.\nThe problem statement: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThe example output for `S=\"11\"` is 3.\nMy `dp[0]` for `S=\"11\"` is 3.\nThe example output for `S=\"111\"` is 7.\nMy `dp[0]` for `S=\"111\"` is 7.\nIt seems that `dp[0]` is indeed the answer. The phrasing \"some substring of S\" is a bit misleading if it implies we need to sum `dp[i]` for all `i`. But if `dp[i]` means \"sequences represented by `S[i:]`\", then `dp[0]` is the answer for `S[0:]` (which is `S` itself).\nThe problem statement's example clarifies this:\n\"As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows. \"T\" (translates into \"1\") \"M\" (translates into \"11\") \"O\" (translates into \"111\") \"TT\" (translates into \"11\") \"TM\" (translates into \"111\") \"MT\" (translates into \"111\") \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\"\nThis list is for `S = \"111\"`. The count is 7.\nMy `dp[0]` for `S=\"111\"` is 7. So it is correct.\nThe `dp[0]` definition is indeed the correct one for the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    invalid_codes = {\n        \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"\n    }\n\n    current_s_chars = [] # Using a list of characters for efficient appends\n    \n    # dp[i] stores the number of non-empty sequences of English letters \n    # whose concatenated Morse code representation is exactly S[i:]\n    # dp array will be of size m+1. dp[N] will be 0 (for empty suffix).\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        current_s_chars.append(char)\n        N = len(current_s_chars)\n\n        # dp[N] is always 0 (empty suffix has no non-empty sequences)\n        # We need to compute dp[i] for i from N-1 down to 0\n        for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):\n            current_dp_val = 0\n            # Try forming a Morse code of length 1 to 4 starting at S[i]\n            # S[i:i+length]\n            \n            # Build substring incrementally\n            temp_substring = [] \n            for length in range(1, 5):\n                if i + length <= N: # Check if substring is within bounds\n                    temp_substring.append(current_s_chars[i + length - 1])\n                    s = \"\".join(temp_substring) # This converts list of chars to string\n                    \n                    if s not in invalid_codes:\n                        # If S[i:i+length] is a valid Morse code M,\n                        # it can form a sequence L.\n                        # This L can be a sequence by itself (+1)\n                        # or it can be followed by any sequence formed from S[i+length:] (+dp[i+length])\n                        current_dp_val = (current_dp_val + dp[i + length] + 1) % MOD\n                else:\n                    # No more substrings of this length or longer can be formed\n                    break\n            dp[i] = current_dp_val\n        \n        # The answer for the current string S is dp[0]\n        sys.stdout.write(str(dp[0]) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
