He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Trailing Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The goal is to find all positive integers 'n' whose factorials end with exactly 'm' zeroes.  I need to output the count of these 'n's and the 'n's themselves, sorted in ascending order.  Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to *calculate* the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.  It boils down to the number of times 10 appears as a factor.  Since 10 = 2 * 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the problem really simplifies to counting the factors of 5.\n\nLegendre's formula gives us a clean way to do this: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`. This sum keeps going as long as the term `n / 5^k` is greater than or equal to 1.  Essentially, it counts how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, and so on, are present in `n!`.\n\nNow, I'm looking for the values of 'n' that make `Z(n) = m`.  I need to understand the behavior of this `Z(n)` function.  I can see that it's *non-decreasing*. As 'n' increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or goes up.  Crucially, it only increases when 'n' is a multiple of 5, and it jumps when 'n' is a multiple of a higher power of 5, like 25, 125, etc.\n\nI've been thinking, and I can start testing values...  If I find an `n_0` where `Z(n_0) = m`, then all subsequent 'n' values where `Z(n)` remains 'm' are also valid solutions. I noticed the function values look like this: 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6....\n\nSo, to solve this, I need to find the smallest 'n' for which Z(n) = m. After that, I need to count the sequential n's where Z(n) is still equal to m, and output them accordingly. It's time to translate this into a Python script and put these ideas to the test!\n",
