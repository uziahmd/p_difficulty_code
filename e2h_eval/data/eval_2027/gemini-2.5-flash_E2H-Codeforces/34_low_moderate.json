And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Calculating Average Sleep Time with a Sliding Window**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks,\" where a week is a set of `k` consecutive days from Polycarp's `n` sleep records, `a1, a2, ..., an`.  My goal is efficiency here, given the potential size of the data.\n\nI've determined that there are `n - k + 1` weeks.  For each week, I'll need to sum the sleep times for those `k` days. Then, I'll total up those weekly sums and divide by the number of weeks to get the average.\n\nInitially, I considered a simple approach, iterating through each week and summing the `k` days within it.  That would be an O((n - k + 1) * k) time complexity, which is concerning. With potentially large `n` and `k` values, that could become an `O(n^2)` operation – too slow.  We need something better.\n\nThe key is a sliding window technique.  I'll calculate the sum for the first week, `S_1`. Then, for each subsequent week, I can reuse the previous sum and adjust it. The sum for week `i+1`, `S_{i+1}`, is equal to the sum for week `i`, minus the first element of week `i` and plus the next element not in week `i`, namely `a_{i+k}`. This will greatly speed up the calculation.\n\nSo, I'll calculate `S_1` (which is `a_1 + ... + a_k`). Then, each subsequent `S_i` will simply be `S_{i-1} - a_{i-1} + a_{i+k-1}`.  This way, each new `S_i` is computed in constant time!  This approach reduces the calculation to O(n) time, which is much more efficient.  Now, I just need to sum all these `S_i` values to get the `TotalSum` and divide by the number of weeks, `n - k + 1`, to get the final average. This method will result in an optimal O(n) time complexity.\n",
