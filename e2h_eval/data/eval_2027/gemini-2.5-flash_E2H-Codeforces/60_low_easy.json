Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Decoding the Morse Code Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Morse code problem and need to build a Python script to solve it.  Let's break down the core elements.  It seems we're dealing with binary representations of English letters, with '0' as a dot and '1' as a dash. The constraint is that the Morse code strings are limited to lengths 1 to 4, and there are some invalid combinations in that range. We've got 26 letters, so we should be able to make the direct mappings.\n\nThe process is iterative. We're given an initial empty string, `S`, and we append either '0' or '1' to it `m` times.  After each append operation, the core task is to count the number of *non-empty sequences* of English letters that can be generated from *any substring* of the current `S`. The result needs to be modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nLet's clarify what a sequence means. If \"1\" translates to 'T', \"11\" to 'M', and \"111\" to 'O', and `S` is \"111\", the possible sequences include \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", and \"TTT\". This means if a substring of `S` can be interpreted as a concatenation of valid Morse code representations, the corresponding sequence of letters is valid. We need to count the *unique* sequences.\n\nThis feels like a Dynamic Programming problem.  I'm thinking of defining `dp[i]` to represent the number of ways to parse the substring `S[0...i-1]` into valid sequences of letters.  When we append a new character to `S`, say '0', we effectively create a new longer `S` (`S + '0'`). Now, my job is to update the `dp` table for this new, extended `S`.\n\nThe key is to consider all possible substrings of the current `S`.  For a given `S`, if a substring can be decoded into one or more English letters, we should add to our count. It is a question of substrings representing valid codes which can be then concatenated to create valid sequence of english letters. So, each time we build `S`, we want to identify its valid substrings and increment the count appropriately.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing any substring of the current Morse code string `S`. Each English letter corresponds to a unique Morse code string of length 1 to 4, with four specific exceptions (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") that do not represent any letter.\n\nLet's first define the set of valid Morse code strings.\nStrings of length 1: \"0\", \"1\" (2 valid)\nStrings of length 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" (4 valid)\nStrings of length 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\" (8 valid)\nStrings of length 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0011\" (invalid), \"0100\", \"0101\" (invalid), \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\", \"1110\" (invalid), \"1111\" (invalid)\nSo, for length 4, there are $16 - 4 = 12$ valid strings.\nTotal valid strings: $2+4+8+12 = 26$.\n\nLet `valid_codes` be a set containing all these 26 valid Morse code strings.\n\nThe problem requires us to find, after each character is appended to `S`, the total number of unique sequences of English letters that can be formed from *any* substring of `S`. This suggests a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet `S_current` be the string `S` after some appends.\nFor each possible ending position `j` in `S_current` (from `0` to `len(S_current) - 1`), we can consider all substrings `S_current[i...j]` (where `i <= j`).\nFor each such substring, we want to find all possible sequences of English letters it can represent.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S_current[k...len(S_current)-1]` into a sequence of English letters.\nThis definition is for a *specific* substring `S_current[k...len(S_current)-1]`.\nThe problem asks for *any* substring.\n\nA more suitable DP approach would be to track, for each starting position `i` in `S_current`, the set of all possible sequences of English letters that can be formed from `S_current[i...j]` for any `j >= i`.\n\nLet `total_sequences` be a `set` to store all unique sequences found so far.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, let `S_new = S + c`.\nThe new character `c` is at index `N-1` (0-indexed) where `N = len(S_new)`.\nWe need to consider all substrings ending at `N-1`. These are `S_new[0...N-1]`, `S_new[1...N-1]`, ..., `S_new[N-1...N-1]`.\n\nFor each starting position `i` from `0` to `N-1`:\nConsider the substring `sub = S_new[i...N-1]`.\nWe need to find all sequences that `sub` can represent.\nLet `f[k]` be the number of ways to parse the prefix `sub[0...k-1]` into a sequence of English letters.\n`f[0] = 1` (empty prefix can be parsed in one way: empty sequence).\nFor `k` from `1` to `len(sub)`:\n  `f[k] = 0`\n  For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k >= l`:\n      Let `prefix_code = sub[k-l...k-1]`.\n      If `prefix_code` is in `valid_codes`:\n        `f[k] = (f[k] + f[k-l]) % MOD`\n\nThe value `f[len(sub)]` would be the total number of sequences that `sub` can represent.\nHowever, this is not enough, as we need to sum up all unique sequences. `f[k]` counts *ways*, not *unique sequences*. For example, \"TT\" and \"M\" are different sequences but might both be formed from \"11\".\n\nThe example clarifies this:\n`S = \"111\"`\nValid codes: \"1\" -> T, \"11\" -> M, \"111\" -> O.\nSequences:\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"1\" + \"1\" = \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"1\" + \"11\" = \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"11\" + \"1\" = \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" = \"111\")\nTotal: 7 unique sequences.\n\nThis implies we need to count the *number of ways* a substring can be parsed into a sequence of English letters. Each distinct parsing represents a distinct sequence.\n\nLet `current_S` be the string built so far. Let its length be `N`.\nWe need to calculate the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `N-1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to parse the suffix `current_S[i...N-1]` into a sequence of English letters.\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `current_S[k...N-1]`.\n`dp[N] = 1` (representing an empty sequence, which allows for appending a letter to it).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[k] = 0`\n  For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + l <= N`:\n      Let `code = current_S[k...k+l-1]`.\n      If `code` is in `valid_codes`:\n        `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD`\n\nAfter computing all `dp[k]` values for the current `S`, the total number of non-empty sequences formed by substrings ending at `N-1` is `(dp[0] + dp[1] + ... + dp[N-1]) % MOD`.\nHowever, this only counts sequences ending at `N-1`. The problem asks for \"some substring of S\". This means we need to sum up all `dp[k]` values for *all* possible substrings.\n\nLet `total_count` be the running total of sequences.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S_new`. Let `N` be `len(S_new)`.\nWe need to calculate the number of sequences that can be formed from substrings of `S_new` that were *not* substrings of the previous `S`. These are precisely the substrings ending at `N-1`.\n\nLet `ways_to_parse_suffix[k]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S_new[k...N-1]`.\n`ways_to_parse_suffix[N] = 1` (base case for empty suffix).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `ways_to_parse_suffix[k] = 0`\n  For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + l <= N`:\n      `sub = S_new[k : k+l]`\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code:\n        `ways_to_parse_suffix[k] = (ways_to_parse_suffix[k] + ways_to_parse_suffix[k+l]) % MOD`\n\nThe total number of *new* sequences (those formed by substrings ending at `N-1`) is `(ways_to_parse_suffix[0] + ways_to_parse_suffix[1] + ... + ways_to_parse_suffix[N-1]) % MOD`.\nLet this sum be `new_sequences_count`.\nThe overall `total_answer` after appending the character is `(previous_total_answer + new_sequences_count) % MOD`.\n\nLet's trace the first example: `S = \"\"` initially. `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`total_answer = 0`. `current_S = []`.\n\n**1. Append '1'**\n`current_S = ['1']`. `N = 1`.\n`ways_to_parse_suffix` array of size `N+1 = 2`.\n`ways_to_parse_suffix[1] = 1`.\nFor `k = 0`:\n  `ways_to_parse_suffix[0] = 0`.\n  `l = 1`: `k+l = 1 <= N`. `sub = current_S[0:1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n    `ways_to_parse_suffix[0] = (ways_to_parse_suffix[0] + ways_to_parse_suffix[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n  `l = 2,3,4`: `k+l > N`.\n`new_sequences_count = (ways_to_parse_suffix[0]) % MOD = 1`.\n`total_answer = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\nOutput: 1.\n\n**2. Append '1'**\n`current_S = ['1', '1']`. `N = 2`.\n`ways_to_parse_suffix` array of size `N+1 = 3`.\n`ways_to_parse_suffix[2] = 1`.\nFor `k = 1`:\n  `ways_to_parse_suffix[1] = 0`.\n  `l = 1`: `k+l = 2 <= N`. `sub = current_S[1:2] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n    `ways_to_parse_suffix[1] = (ways_to_parse_suffix[1] + ways_to_parse_suffix[2]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\nFor `k = 0`:\n  `ways_to_parse_suffix[0] = 0`.\n  `l = 1`: `k+l = 1 <= N`. `sub = current_S[0:1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n    `ways_to_parse_suffix[0] = (ways_to_parse_suffix[0] + ways_to_parse_suffix[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n  `l = 2`: `k+l = 2 <= N`. `sub = current_S[0:2] = \"11\"`. \"11\" is valid.\n    `ways_to_parse_suffix[0] = (ways_to_parse_suffix[0] + ways_to_parse_suffix[2]) % MOD = (1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n`new_sequences_count = (ways_to_parse_suffix[0] + ways_to_parse_suffix[1]) % MOD = (2 + 1) % MOD = 3`.\n`total_answer = (1 + 3) % MOD = 4`.\nWait, example output is 3. Why?\nThe example output `1, 3, 7` suggests that `total_answer` is not cumulative in the way I defined it.\nIt seems `total_answer` is the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `N-1` for the *current* `S`.\nThis means:\nAfter `S=\"1\"`, `dp[0]=1`. Sum = 1.\nAfter `S=\"11\"`, `dp[0]=2`, `dp[1]=1`. Sum = 3.\nAfter `S=\"111\"`, `dp[0]=4`, `dp[1]=2`, `dp[2]=1`. Sum = 7.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `dp[k]` for `S=\"111\"`, `N=3`.\n`ways_to_parse_suffix[3] = 1`.\n`k = 2`: `sub = \"1\"`. Valid. `ways_to_parse_suffix[2] = ways_to_parse_suffix[3] = 1`.\n`k = 1`:\n  `sub = \"1\"` (len 1). Valid. `ways_to_parse_suffix[1] += ways_to_parse_suffix[2] = 1`.\n  `sub = \"11\"` (len 2). Valid. `ways_to_parse_suffix[1] += ways_to_parse_suffix[3] = 1+1 = 2`.\n`k = 0`:\n  `sub = \"1\"` (len 1). Valid. `ways_to_parse_suffix[0] += ways_to_parse_suffix[1] = 2`.\n  `sub = \"11\"` (len 2). Valid. `ways_to_parse_suffix[0] += ways_to_parse_suffix[2] = 2+1 = 3`.\n  `sub = \"111\"` (len 3). Valid. `ways_to_parse_suffix[0] += ways_to_parse_suffix[3] = 3+1 = 4`.\n\nSo for `S=\"111\"`:\n`ways_to_parse_suffix[0] = 4` (sequences from \"111\": \"TTT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"O\")\n`ways_to_parse_suffix[1] = 2` (sequences from \"11\": \"TT\", \"M\")\n`ways_to_parse_suffix[2] = 1` (sequences from \"1\": \"T\")\nTotal sum = `4 + 2 + 1 = 7`. This matches the example.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n1.  Initialize `current_S = \"\"`.\n2.  Initialize `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n3.  Precompute `valid_codes` set.\n4.  For each incoming character `c`:\n    a. Append `c` to `current_S`.\n    b. Let `N = len(current_S)`.\n    c. Create `dp` array of size `N+1`.\n    d. Set `dp[N] = 1`. (Base case for empty suffix)\n    e. Iterate `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n        i. `dp[k] = 0`.\n        ii. Iterate `l` from `1` to `4`:\n            If `k + l <= N`:\n                `sub = current_S[k : k+l]`\n                If `sub` is in `valid_codes`:\n                    `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD`\n    f. Calculate `current_total_sequences = sum(dp[k] for k in range(N)) % MOD`.\n    g. Print `current_total_sequences`.\n\nThis DP calculates `dp[k]` as the number of ways to parse the suffix `current_S[k...N-1]` into a sequence of English letters. Summing `dp[k]` for `k` from `0` to `N-1` gives the total number of sequences that can be formed from *any suffix* of `current_S`. Since any substring can be viewed as a suffix of some prefix, this correctly counts all sequences from all substrings.\n\nLet's check the constraints. `m <= 3000`.\nFor each of `m` operations:\n  `current_S` grows up to length `m`.\n  The DP loop runs `N` times (for `k`).\n  Inside, it runs `4` times (for `l`).\n  String slicing `current_S[k:k+l]` takes `O(l)` time (or `O(1)` if using string views/pointers, but Python strings are immutable).\n  Set lookup is `O(l)` on average for string `l`.\nTotal time complexity: `m * N * 4 * l_max` where `l_max = 4`.\nWorst case: `3000 * 3000 * 4 * 4 = 16 * 9 * 10^6 = 144 * 10^6`. This might be too slow for Python.\nA Python string slice creates a new string. String concatenation `current_S += char` also creates a new string.\nUsing a list of characters for `current_S` would make appends `O(1)` and slicing (to make a string for lookup) `O(l)`.\n`current_S` as a `list` of '0'/'1' characters:\n`sub = \"\".join(current_S[k : k+l])` would be `O(l)`.\nSo the complexity remains `O(m * N * l_max)`.\n`3000 * 3000 * 4 = 36 * 10^6`. This should be acceptable for Python.\n\nLet's list the valid codes explicitly:\nLength 1: \"0\", \"1\"\nLength 2: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\"\nLength 3: \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\"\nLength 4: \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\"\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    # Precompute valid Morse codes\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    valid_codes = set()\n    \n    # Generate all possible codes of length 1 to 4\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        # Iterate through all binary strings of current length\n        # This is equivalent to iterating from 0 to 2^length - 1\n        # and converting to binary string\n        for i in range(2**length):\n            code = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length) # Convert to binary string, pad with leading zeros\n            if code not in invalid_codes:\n                valid_codes.add(code)\n\n    current_s_list = [] # Use a list of characters for efficient appends\n    \n    # dp_values will store dp[k] for the current string S.\n    # dp_values[k] = number of ways to parse S[k...N-1]\n    # dp_values will be updated in each iteration.\n    # We need dp_values[N] = 1 as base case.\n    # The length of dp_values will be N+1.\n    # Initialize with [1] to represent dp[0]=1 for empty string (conceptually)\n    # This will be adjusted as the string grows.\n    \n    # Let dp_values[k] be the number of ways to parse the suffix S[k...N-1].\n    # dp_values[N] = 1 (empty suffix can be parsed in one way - as an empty sequence)\n    # The total number of sequences for the current S is sum(dp_values[k] for k in 0 to N-1)\n    \n    # We can optimize the DP calculation.\n    # When a new character is added, S_new = S_old + char.\n    # Let N_old be len(S_old), N_new be len(S_new).\n    # dp_old has N_old+1 elements.\n    # dp_new will have N_new+1 elements.\n    # dp_new[N_new] = 1.\n    # For k from N_new-1 down to 0:\n    #   dp_new[k] = 0\n    #   For l in 1..4:\n    #     if k+l <= N_new:\n    #       sub = S_new[k:k+l]\n    #       if sub in valid_codes:\n    #         dp_new[k] = (dp_new[k] + dp_new[k+l]) % MOD\n    \n    # The sum of dp_new[k] for k from 0 to N_new-1 is the answer.\n    \n    # To optimize the string slicing for `sub = \"\".join(current_s_list[k : k+l])`,\n    # we can maintain `current_s_str` as a string for fast slicing.\n    # Appending to `current_s_str` will be `current_s_str += char`, which is O(N)\n    # if `N` is the current length.\n    # However, N is at most 3000.
