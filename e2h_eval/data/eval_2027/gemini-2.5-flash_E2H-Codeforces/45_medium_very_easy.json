There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Tennis Championship\" problem and devise a Python solution.** My initial understanding is that we have `n` players in a knockout tournament, and the winner's maximum game count is what we're after. The tricky part is the rule: two players can only compete if their prior game counts differ by at most one.\n\n**First things first, I'm focusing on the winner's journey.**  To maximize their games, they need to keep finding eligible opponents.  The winner, by definition, must win every game.  So, at any point, all remaining players can be considered to have perfect win records. Let's call the number of games played by the winner `k`.\n\n**The heart of the problem lies in the opponent rule.**  If a player has won `k-1` games, their next opponent *must* have won either `k-1` or `k-2` games, so the rule is satisfied. My thinking is to build the tournament incrementally, considering sub-tournaments that fulfill this rule.\n\n**Let's think about building the maximum-sized tournaments recursively.** Let `dp[k]` represent the minimum number of players needed for a tournament where the winner plays `k` games. When the winner plays `k` games, they need to defeat an opponent in the *k-th* game.\n\n*   To create a `dp[k]` tournament, the winner could have either played *k-1* games and defeated an opponent who played *k-1* games. This results in the number of players needed for the tournament becoming `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1]`.\n*   Alternatively, the winner might play *k-1* games, then face an opponent with *k-2* wins. This leads to `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`.\n\n*This recursion, `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`, is screaming \"Fibonacci sequence\"!* With `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 2` as base cases, the number of players forms a Fibonacci series (`1, 2, 3, 5, 8...`).\n\n**Now, given the input `n` (total players), my goal is to find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`.** The corresponding index then represents the maximum games the winner can play.\n\n**Here's the plan for my code:** I'll calculate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until one exceeds `n`. The previous Fibonacci number gives me the maximum number of players I can have. Once I find this bound, I can derive the desired result for the largest `k`. The initial terms of the sequence will be fib\\[0]=1, fib\\[1]=2, and so forth.\n\nThe number of iterations will depend on the value of n. However, since the sequence grows quickly, it's not a concern. The largest integer would be fib[k] <= 10^18. So we iterate up to this k, which is not very large (about 90 for the 10^18 limit)\n\n**This all leads to a straightforward algorithm**: I will initialize with the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 2), and then iteratively compute the next one until a number greater than `n` appears, which is the stopping condition.\n\nThe answer is the index minus 1 for the maximum k. This corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`. I'm confident this will efficiently solve the problem given the tournament constraints!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet's denote the number of games a player has won as their \"experience level\". All players start with 0 experience. When two players play, the winner's experience level increases by 1. The rule states that if player A has `k_A` wins and player B has `k_B` wins, they can play if `|k_A - k_B| <= 1`.\n\nWe want to maximize the winner's games. Let the winner be `W`.\nSuppose `W` eventually plays `k` games.\nTo play their first game, `W` (0 wins) must play an opponent (0 wins). `|0-0| <= 1`. This is valid. `W` wins, now has 1 win.\nTo play their second game, `W` (1 win) must play an opponent `O`. `O` must have `j` wins such that `|1-j| <= 1`. So `j` can be 0 or 1.\nTo play their `m`-th game, `W` (with `m-1` wins) must play an opponent `O` (with `j` wins) such that `|(m-1)-j| <= 1`. So `j` can be `m-2` or `m-1`. (Note: `j` cannot be `m` or more, as `W` is the one progressing).\n\nLet `fib[k]` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games, while satisfying the rule.\n*   `k=0`: A single player who hasn't played any games yet. `fib[0] = 1`.\n*   `k=1`: The winner plays 1 game. This requires 2 players (winner and one opponent, both starting with 0 wins). `fib[1] = 2`.\n*   `k=2`: The winner plays 2 games. The winner (with 1 win) needs an opponent.\n    *   Option 1: Opponent has 1 win. This means two sub-tournaments, each producing a winner with 1 win. Each requires `fib[1]` players. Total: `fib[1] + fib[1] = 2 + 2 = 4` players.\n    *   Option 2: Opponent has 0 wins. This means one sub-tournament producing a winner with 1 win (`fib[1]` players), and one fresh player (1 player). Total: `fib[1] + fib[0] = 2 + 1 = 3` players.\n    To minimize players for a `k`-game winner, we choose Option 2. So `fib[2] = 3`.\n*   In general, for the winner to play their `k`-th game, they must have `k-1` wins. Their opponent must have `k-1` or `k-2` wins. To minimize the total number of players for `fib[k]`, we should pair the `k-1` game winner with a `k-2` game winner. This results in the recurrence:\n    `fib[k] = fib[k-1] + fib[k-2]` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence, shifted and with different initial values:\n`fib[0] = 1`\n`fib[1] = 2`\n`fib[2] = 3` (`fib[1] + fib[0]`)\n`fib[3] = 5` (`fib[2] + fib[1]`)\n`fib[4] = 8` (`fib[3] + fib[2]`)\n...\n\nWe are given `n` players and need to find the maximum `k` such that `fib[k] <= n`.\n\n**Example Walkthroughs:**\n*   `n=2`: `fib[1]=2`. Max games = 1.\n*   `n=3`: `fib[1]=2`, `fib[2]=3`. Max games = 2.\n*   `n=4`: `fib[1]=2`, `fib[2]=3`. `fib[3]=5 > 4`. Max games = 2.\n*   `n=10`: `fib[1]=2`, `fib[2]=3`, `fib[3]=5`, `fib[4]=8`. `fib[5]=13 > 10`. Max games = 4.\n\nThe pattern holds for the examples.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `f_prev = 1` (representing `fib[0]`) and `f_curr = 2` (representing `fib[1]`).\n2.  Initialize `games_played = 1` (representing `k=1`, which is the maximum games for `n=2`).\n3.  Iteratively generate the next Fibonacci number:\n    While `f_curr <= n`:\n    a.  Calculate `f_next = f_prev + f_curr`.\n    b.  Update `f_prev = f_curr`.\n    c.  Update `f_curr = f_next`.\n    d.  Increment `games_played` (because we successfully found a Fibonacci number `f_prev` which is `<= n`, corresponding to `games_played` games).\n4.  When the loop terminates, `f_curr` is the first Fibonacci number strictly greater than `n`. The value `f_prev` is the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`. The `games_played` counter would have been incremented one too many times (for `f_curr`). So, the maximum number of games is `games_played - 1`.\n\nThe input `n` can be up to `10^18`. Python's integers handle arbitrary size, so there won't be overflow issues. The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate to reach `10^18` is small (around 90), making this approach very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # fib[k] represents the minimum number of players required for the winner\n    # to play k games, following the rule.\n    # fib[0] = 1 (1 player, 0 games played)\n    # fib[1] = 2 (2 players, winner plays 1 game)\n    # fib[k] = fib[k-1] + fib[k-2] for k >= 2\n\n    # We are looking for the largest k such that fib[k] <= n.\n\n    # f_prev will hold fib[k-1] (or fib[k-2] in the loop)\n    # f_curr will hold fib[k] (or fib[k-1] in the loop)\n    # games_played will track the current k\n    \n    # Initial state: For k=0, fib[0]=1.
