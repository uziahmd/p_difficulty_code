The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The Number Games - My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"The Number Games\" problem and immediately I see it's about trees and maximizing something, which screams greedy algorithm potential. The core of this seems to be about removing contestants from districts while keeping a connected component and maximizing the remaining fans.\n\nThe input gives me the number of districts (`n`), the number of contestants to remove (`k`), and the tree structure itself. The fan count for each district is straightforward: `2^i`. This exponential growth is key. I need to output the district numbers of the removed contestants.\n\nMy immediate instinct is to focus on that exponential fan growth. I want to keep the districts with the highest `i` values because they contribute the most fans. This means selecting a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of `2^i` for its nodes.\n\nThe connection requirement is critical. I can't just pick the `n-k` largest districts in isolation. They have to be connected. This is where the tree structure comes into play. I need to figure out how to navigate the tree to build that optimal connected subgraph.\n\nThe greedy approach feels right, but I have to be careful about the connectivity constraint. I'm thinking of starting with the district `n`, which contributes the most fans, and then iteratively adding neighbors in decreasing order of their district numbers, as long as adding them keeps the subgraph connected and doesn't exceed `n-k` districts. It's essentially growing the connected component around `n` while maximizing the sum of node values. \n\nThe idea is that if I *don't* include `n`, I can always replace one of the lower valued districts with `n` and increase the sum of fans, as long as I can maintain the connectedness of `n-k` districts. It seems like the proof of this could be a straightforward induction.\n\nI need to confirm the algorithm. I'll need to use a graph data structure to make it easy to traverse, and implement this greedy strategy. I have to be careful about edge cases, making sure that I don't try to add a district more than once, and maintaining a count of the districts already included.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove `k` contestants (districts) such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and the total number of fans of the remaining contestants is maximized. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`.\n\nTo maximize the sum of `2^i` for the remaining districts, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger `i` values, as `2^i` grows exponentially. This means we want to keep districts `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, and so on, as much as possible.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of their district numbers, starting from `n`. We want to select `n-k` districts.\n1.  The district `n` (with `2^n` fans) is almost certainly part of the optimal solution. If it's not, we could potentially replace some smaller-numbered district in the optimal connected component with `n` and increase the total fans, provided `n` can be connected.\n2.  This suggests a greedy approach: Start with district `n`. Then, iteratively add the largest-numbered *neighbor* of the currently selected districts that has not yet been selected. Repeat this until we have selected `n-k` districts.\n\nLet's formalize this greedy strategy:\n1.  Initialize a set `kept_districts` with district `n`.\n2.  Initialize a `priority_queue` (or max-heap) to store potential districts to add. For each neighbor `v` of `n`, if `v` is not `n`, add `v` to the priority queue. The priority is `v` itself (larger `v` means higher priority).\n3.  Maintain a `visited` set to keep track of districts already added to `kept_districts` or processed. Mark `n` as visited.\n4.  While the number of `kept_districts` is less than `n-k`:\n    a.  Extract the district `u` with the largest number from the `priority_queue`.\n    b.  If `u` has already been visited, skip it and go to the next largest.\n    c.  Add `u` to `kept_districts`.\n    d.  Mark `u` as visited.\n    e.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.  If `v` has not been visited, add `v` to the `priority_queue`.\n\nAfter `n-k` districts have been selected, the remaining `k` districts are the ones to be removed. We then sort these `k` removed districts and print them.\n\n**Why this greedy approach works (Proof Sketch):**\nSuppose there is an optimal solution `O` that keeps `n-k` districts, and our greedy solution `G` keeps `n-k` districts. If `G` is not optimal, there must be a first district `x` (in decreasing order of district numbers) that `G` *removes* but `O` *keeps*. Since `x` is the largest such district, all districts `y > x` are handled identically by `G` and `O` (either both keep or both remove).\nIf `G` removes `x`, it means `x` was either not reachable from the current connected component formed by `G` using larger districts, or `G` had already selected `n-k` districts. The latter is not possible because `x` is the *first* district `G` removes that `O` keeps, implying `G` has not yet selected `n-k` districts. So `x` must not have been reachable.\nHowever, `O` keeps `x`, meaning `x` is part of `O`'s connected component. This implies `x` must be connected to some district `y` in `O` where `y > x`. Since `y > x`, `G` would have also kept `y`. If `y` is kept by `G`, then `x` would be a neighbor of `y` and would have been added to `G`'s priority queue and picked (since it's the largest available). This creates a contradiction. Therefore, the greedy strategy is optimal.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   **Adjacency List:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list.\n*   **Priority Queue:** Python's `heapq` module provides a min-heap. To simulate a max-heap, store negative values or use a custom class with `__lt__`. For simple integers, storing `(-district_number, district_number)` and extracting by `(-priority, actual_value)` works, or just store `district_number` and use `heapq.heappop()` on a min-heap, then negate it. A more straightforward way is to just store the district numbers and use `heapq.heappop()` on a min-heap of negative numbers.\n*   **Visited Set:** A boolean array or hash set can track visited districts.\n*   **Complexity:**\n    *   Building adjacency list: `O(N)`\n    *   Heap operations: Each district is added to the heap at most once and extracted at most once. Each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint). So, `O(N log N)` for heap operations.\n    *   Overall: `O(N log N)`\n    *   Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is feasible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # We want to keep n-k districts.\n    # The fan count is 2^i, so larger i is always better.\n    # We will use a greedy approach starting from the largest district 'n'.\n    # We maintain a set of 'kept_districts' and a max-priority queue of\n    # adjacent districts to explore.\n\n    kept_count = 0\n    kept_districts_set = set() # To quickly check if a district is kept\n    \n    # Use a boolean array for visited status, as N can be large but indices are 1 to N\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Max-priority queue: store negative district numbers to simulate max-heap with heapq\n    pq = []\n\n    # Start with district 'n'\n    # Add 'n' to kept districts\n    kept_districts_set.add(n)\n    visited[n] = True\n    kept_count += 1\n\n    # Add neighbors of 'n' to the priority queue\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n            heapq.heappush(pq, -neighbor) # Push negative to get max-heap behavior\n\n    # Greedily add districts until we have n-k districts\n    while kept_count < n - k and pq:\n        current_district = -heapq.heappop(pq) # Get the largest district\n\n        if visited[current_district]:\n            continue # Already processed or kept\n\n        # Add current_district to kept districts\n        kept_districts_set.add(current_district)\n        visited[current_district] = True\n        kept_count += 1\n\n        # Add its unvisited neighbors to the priority queue\n        for neighbor in adj[current_district]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, -neighbor)\n    \n    # Identify removed districts\n    removed_districts = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in kept_districts_set:\n            removed_districts.append(i)\n\n    # Output the removed districts in increasing order\n    # They are already in increasing order if we iterate from 1 to n,\n    # but explicit sort ensures it.\n    # removed_districts.sort() # Not strictly necessary if collected in order\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, removed_districts)) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
