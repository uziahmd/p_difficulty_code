The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Rock-Paper-Scissors Loss Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to figure out how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The core challenge is that the number of rounds, `n`, can be massive, potentially up to 2 billion, so a straightforward round-by-round simulation isn't going to cut it.\n\nThe rules are pretty standard: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors snips Paper, and Paper wraps Rock. A red spot means the player lost that round. Draws are ignored.\n\nNikephoros and Polycarpus have these cyclic strategies. Nikephoros's moves follow the sequence `A`, and Polycarpus's sequence is `B`. The important thing to latch onto is that these sequences will repeat cyclically.  Nikephoros plays `A[0]` in round 0, `A[1]` in round 1, and so on, looping back to `A[0]` after `A[m-1]`. Polycarpus does the same thing with sequence `B`.\n\nThe input I'll receive is the total number of rounds (`n`), Nikephoros's strategy (`A`), and Polycarpus's strategy (`B`). The output I need are two integers: Nikephoros's losses and Polycarpus's losses.\n\nSince `n` is huge, I have to find a pattern. Because of the cyclic nature of their moves, the pair of moves (Nikephoros's move, Polycarpus's move) will repeat. The period of repetition is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences, `m` (length of `A`) and `k` (length of `B`). LCM(m,k) can be calculated as `(m * k) / GCD(m, k)`.\n\nThe crucial thing is that `m` and `k` are bounded by 1000, which means the LCM can be at most a million. That's manageable! So, I can simulate a complete cycle (of length the LCM) to count the losses within that cycle. Then, I can scale it up for the total number of rounds.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  Read `n`, `A`, and `B`, and calculate `m` and `k`.\n2.  Create a helper function `get_winner(move_N, move_P)` to determine the winner of a single round. I can use a dictionary or a set to represent the winning conditions efficiently: `wins = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}`. This function will return `1` if Nikephoros wins, `-1` if Polycarpus wins, and `0` for a draw.\n3.  Calculate `L = LCM(m, k)`.\n4.  Simulate the first `L` rounds to count Nikephoros's and Polycarpus's losses in one cycle: `n_losses_N_cycle` and `n_losses_P_cycle`.\n5.  Calculate how many full cycles are in `n`: `num_full_cycles = n // L`.\n6.  The total losses for each player from the full cycles will be: `losses_N_full_cycles = num_full_cycles * n_losses_N_cycle`, and `losses_P_full_cycles = num_full_cycles * n_losses_P_cycle`.\n7.  Calculate the remaining rounds after the full cycles: `remaining_rounds = n % L`.\n8.  Simulate the remaining rounds and add the losses to the previous values.\n9.  Return the total losses for both players.\n\nI should be able to implement this and handle the large `n` efficiently.\n",
