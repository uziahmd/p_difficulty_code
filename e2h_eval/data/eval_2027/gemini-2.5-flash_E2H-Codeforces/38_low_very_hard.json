    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown: Navigating Directed Graphs for Optimal Reachability**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me, and it's a classic graph theory challenge. The core is all about understanding reachability in a directed graph.  I need to figure out two crucial things:\n\n1.  What's the absolute smallest number of nodes (`n`) needed to construct a \"p-reachable\" directed graph?\n2.  Given that minimum `n`, what's the maximum number of unidirectional pairs I can possibly cram into one of these `p`-reachable graphs?\n\nLet's clarify some definitions, starting with reachability.  An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is \"reachable from each other\" if there's a path both from `u` to `v` and from `v` to `u`. The problem specifically states `u < v`, so I'm really looking at pairs where `u` and `v` are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC). I'll call these \"bidirectionally reachable pairs\".\n\nA graph is \"p-reachable\" if it contains precisely `p` bidirectionally reachable pairs, adhering to the `u < v` constraint. Now, I understand \"unidirectional pairs\" as any pair of nodes `(u, v)` where `u` can reach `v`, but `v` cannot reach `u`. The nodes must be distinct.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to pinpoint the smallest possible `n` for a p-reachable graph, and then maximize the number of unidirectional pairs in that same graph.\n\nTo attack this, I need to understand how the number of bidirectionally reachable pairs relates to the SCC structure.  If I have an SCC of size `k`, any two distinct nodes within it are reachable from each other both ways.  The number of unordered pairs is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.  Since I'm interested in the `u < v` condition, this is exactly `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\nIf my graph has `N` nodes and SCCs of sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, the total number of bidirectionally reachable pairs, the sum will be the sum of `k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2` for all SCCs. I know that sum must be equal to my target value `p`. Furthermore, the sum of all `k_i` values must be less than or equal to `N`.\n\nTo minimize `N`, the overall number of nodes in the graph, I need to maximize the individual `k_i` values, for each of the SCCs. The function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` is convex and grows quadratically, so to achieve a target sum `p` with the fewest total nodes `sum(k_i)`, I need to use as few SCCs as possible and make them as large as I can get them.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable graphs with `n` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's break down the definitions:\n\n**Bidirectionally Reachable Pairs (BRPs):**\nAn ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is bidirectionally reachable if `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other. This means `u` and `v` must belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within it are reachable from each other. The number of such pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nA graph is `p`-reachable if the total count of such pairs equals `p`. If a graph has SCCs of sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, the total number of BRPs is `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)` for `i=1 to m`.\n\n**Unidirectional Pairs (UPs):**\nAn ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there's a path from `u` to `v`, and no path from `v` to `u`. This implies `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `SCC(u)` to `SCC(v)` in the condensation graph (DAG of SCCs).\n\n---\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nTo minimize the total number of nodes `N`, we need to find `k_1, ..., k_m` such that `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2) = p` and `sum(k_i)` is minimized.\nThe function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` is convex. To achieve a sum `p` with minimum `sum(k_i)`, we should use as few terms `k_i` as possible, and make them as large as possible. This means we should try to use one large `k` first, then a smaller `k`, and so on, until `p` is exhausted.\n\nLet `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nWe want to find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= p`. Let this be `k_1`.\nThen we have `p_1 = p - f(k_1)` remaining. We find the largest `k_2` such that `f(k_2) <= p_1`, and so on.\nThe minimum number of nodes `n` will be `k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`.\n\nExample: `p = 3`\n1. Largest `k` such that `k(k-1)/2 <= 3`:\n   `k=1: 0`\n   `k=2: 1`\n   `k=3: 3`\n   So `k_1 = 3`. Remaining `p = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n   Minimum nodes `n = 3`.\n\nExample: `p = 4`\n1. Largest `k` such that `k(k-1)/2 <= 4`:\n   `k=1: 0`\n   `k=2: 1`\n   `k=3: 3`\n   `k=4: 6`\n   So `k_1 = 3`. Remaining `p = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n2. Largest `k` such that `k(k-1)/2 <= 1`:\n   `k=1: 0`\n   `k=2: 1`\n   So `k_2 = 2`. Remaining `p = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n   Minimum nodes `n = k_1 + k_2 = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n\nThis greedy strategy works. We can precompute `f(k)` values. Since `p <= 2 * 10^5`, `k(k-1)/2 <= 2 * 10^5` implies `k^2` is roughly `4 * 10^5`, so `k` is roughly `sqrt(4 * 10^5) = 2 * sqrt(10^5) = 2 * 100 * sqrt(10) approx 2 * 100 * 3.16 = 632`. We only need to precompute up to `k` around 632.\n\n```python\n# Precompute f(k) = k*(k-1)/2\nmax_k = 1\nwhile max_k * (max_k - 1) // 2 <= 2 * 10**5:\n    max_k += 1\n# max_k will be around 633\nf_values = [k * (k - 1) // 2 for k in range(max_k + 1)]\n\ncurrent_p = p\nmin_nodes = 0\nwhile current_p > 0:\n    # Find largest k such that f_values[k] <= current_p\n    # We can use binary search or iterate downwards from max_k\n    k_found = 0\n    for k_val in range(max_k, 0, -1):\n        if f_values[k_val] <= current_p:\n            k_found = k_val\n            break\n    \n    min_nodes += k_found\n    current_p -= f_values[k_found]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs for `n` nodes**\n\nLet `n` be the minimum number of nodes found in Part 1. We have `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, such that `sum(k_i) = n` and `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2) = p`.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we want to arrange these `m` SCCs and the remaining `n - sum(k_i)` isolated nodes (if any) in a way that creates many paths in one direction but not the other.\n\nConsider `n` nodes. The maximum possible number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u != v` is `n * (n - 1)`.\nEach such pair `(u, v)` is either:\n1. Bidirectionally reachable (u and v in same SCC).\n2. Unidirectional (path u->v, no path v->u).\n3. Unidirectional (path v->u, no path u->v).\n4. Unreachable (no path u->v and no path v->u).\n\nLet `N_BRP` be the number of bidirectionally reachable pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v`. This is `p`. The total number of BRPs (including `(v,u)`) is `2p`.\nLet `N_UP` be the number of unidirectional pairs `(u, v)` with `u != v`. This is what we want to maximize.\nLet `N_UR` be the number of unreachable pairs `(u, v)` with `u != v`.\n\nThe total number of ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u != v` is `n * (n - 1)`.\nSo, `n * (n - 1) = 2p + N_UP + N_UR`.\nTo maximize `N_UP`, we need to minimize `N_UR`. This means we want to make all pairs reachable in at least one direction.\n\nConsider a graph where all SCCs are arranged in a linear chain (a topological sort). For example, `SCC_1 -> SCC_2 -> ... -> SCC_m`.\nIf we have `m` SCCs of sizes `k_1, ..., k_m` and `n_1` isolated nodes (size 1 SCCs) that are not part of any `k_i > 1` SCC, we can arrange all `m + n_1` SCCs/isolated nodes in a line.\nLet the nodes in `SCC_i` be `S_i`. We add edges from every node in `S_i` to every node in `S_{i+1}`.\nIn such a configuration, for any two distinct nodes `u, v`:\n- If `u, v` are in the same `S_i`, they form 2 BRPs (`(u,v)` and `(v,u)`).\n- If `u` is in `S_i` and `v` is in `S_j` with `i < j`, then there's a path `u -> v` but no path `v -> u`. These form 2 UPs (`(u,v)` and `(v,u)`).\n- If `u` is in `S_i` and `v` is in `S_j` with `i > j`, then there's a path `v -> u` but no path `u -> v`. These form 2 UPs (`(u,v)` and `(v,u)`).\n\nIn this linear arrangement, all pairs of distinct nodes are reachable in at least one direction. Thus, `N_UR = 0`.\nThe total number of ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u != v` is `n * (n - 1)`.\nThe total number of BRPs (both `(u,v)` and `(v,u)`) is `2p`.\nSo, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs `N_UP` is `n * (n - 1) - 2p`.\n\nThis construction is always possible:\n1. Identify the SCCs `S_1, ..., S_m` from the greedy decomposition for `p`.\n2. The remaining `n - sum(k_i)` nodes are isolated nodes (trivial SCCs of size 1). Let these be `S_{m+1}, ..., S_{m'}`.\n3. Arrange all `m'` SCCs/isolated nodes in a line. For example, add an edge from the last node of `S_j` to the first node of `S_{j+1}` for all `j`. To ensure all-to-all reachability, add edges from every node in `S_j` to every node in `S_{j+1}`.\n\nThis construction ensures that for any `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` with `i < j`, there is a path `u -> v` but no path `v -> u`.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `n * (n - 1) - 2p`.\n\nLet's re-check the example cases:\n\n**p = 3:**\n1. Minimum nodes `n = 3`. (SCC of size 3: `3*(3-1)/2 = 3`)\n2. Maximum UPs = `n * (n - 1) - 2p = 3 * (3 - 1) - 2 * 3 = 3 * 2 - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\n**p = 4:**\n1. Minimum nodes `n = 5`. (SCCs of sizes 3 and 2: `3*(3-1)/2 + 2*(2-1)/2 = 3 + 1 = 4`)\n2. Maximum UPs = `n * (n - 1) - 2p = 5 * (5 - 1) - 2 * 4 = 5 * 4 - 8 = 20 - 8 = 12`.\nOutput: `5 12`.\nWait, example output is `5 6`. Why is there a discrepancy?\n\nLet's re-read the definition of unidirectional pairs carefully:\n\"an ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` in a directed graph unidirectional if `u != v`, there exists a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\"\nMy calculation of `N_UP` counts *all* such pairs. My `N_UP` counts `(u,v)` and `(v,u)` separately if they are unidirectional.\nFor example, if `u` is in `S_1` and `v` is in `S_2` (where `S_1 -> S_2`), then `(u,v)` is unidirectional. `(v,u)` is *also* unidirectional (path `v -> u` does not exist, path `u -> v` exists).\nThe definition of `N_UP` is for `(u,v)` where `u!=v`.\nIf `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` with `i < j`, then `(u,v)` is unidirectional.\nIf `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j` with `i > j`, then `(u,v)` is NOT unidirectional. Instead, `(v,u)` is unidirectional.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `N_UP` for the linear chain `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_{m'}`.\nFor any `u \\in S_i` and `v \\in S_j`:\n- If `i = j`: `u, v` are in the same SCC. These are BRPs.\n- If `i < j`: `u -> v` exists, `v -> u` does not. So `(u,v)` is a unidirectional pair. There are `k_i * k_j` such pairs for fixed `i, j`.\n- If `i > j`: `v -> u` exists, `u -> v` does not. So `(u,v)` is NOT a unidirectional pair. `(v,u)` IS a unidirectional pair.\n\nSo, the number of unidirectional pairs `(u,v)` (where `u!=v`, `u->v` exists, `v->u` does not) is `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`.\nThis is `sum_{i=1}^{m'-1} sum_{j=i+1}^{m'} (k_i * k_j)`.\n\nLet `n` be the total number of nodes.\n`n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_{m'}`.\nConsider `n^2 = (k_1 + ... + k_{m'})^2 = sum(k_i^2) + 2 * sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`.\nSo, `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j) = (n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\n\nThe number of unidirectional pairs is `(n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\nThis is `(n^2 - (sum(k_i) + sum(k_i*(k_i-1)))) / 2 = (n^2 - (n + 2p)) / 2`.\nThis is `(n^2 - n - 2p) / 2 = (n*(n-1) - 2p) / 2`.\nThis is exactly `N_UP / 2` from my previous calculation.\nSo my previous `N_UP` was counting `(u,v)` and `(v,u)` if they were of the \"unidirectional type\". The problem's definition for `(u,v)` unidirectional means `u->v` exists and `v->u` does not. If `u->v` exists and `v->u` does not, then `(u,v)` is unidirectional, but `(v,u)` is NOT unidirectional. So the count should be `(n*(n-1) - 2p) / 2`.\n\nLet's re-check the examples with this formula:\n**p = 3:**\n`n = 3`.\nMax UPs = `(3 * (3 - 1) - 2 * 3) / 2 = (3 * 2 - 6) / 2 = (6 - 6) / 2 = 0 / 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\n**p = 4:**\n`n = 5`.\nMax UPs = `(5 * (5 - 1) - 2 * 4) / 2 = (5 * 4 - 8) / 2 = (20 - 8) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`. Matches example.\n\n**p = 0:**\n`n = 0`. (No nodes needed if p=0)\nMax UPs = `(0 * (-1) - 0) / 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `0 0`. Matches example.\n\nThis formula `(n*(n-1) - 2p) / 2` seems correct for the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `min_nodes = 0`.\n2. Initialize `current_p = p`.\n3. Create a list `scc_sizes` to store the sizes of SCCs.\n4. While `current_p > 0`:\n   a. Find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p`.\n   b. Add `k` to `min_nodes`.\n   c. Add `k` to `scc_sizes`.\n   d. Subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `current_p`.\n5. The number of nodes with `k=1` (isolated nodes) is `current_p` (which will be 0 after step 4, but `current_p` is only for sum of `k*(k-1)/2`. The remaining `current_p` is always 0. The number of nodes with `k=1` should be handled if `p` is not fully covered by `k>1` SCCs. Wait, the algorithm for `min_nodes` is correct. `k*(k-1)/2` for `k=1` is 0. So `current_p` will eventually become 0. `min_nodes` will correctly sum up all `k` values, including `k=1` if `p` requires it. For example, if `p=1`, `k=2` is chosen, `min_nodes=2`, `current_p=0`. If `p=0`, `min_nodes=0`.\n6. Calculate `max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_nodes * (min_nodes - 1) - 2 * p) // 2`.\n7. Print `min_nodes` and `max_unidirectional_pairs`.\n\nEdge case `p=0`:\n`min_nodes = 0`.\n`max_unidirectional_pairs = (0 * (-1) - 2 * 0) // 2 = 0`.\nCorrect.\n\nThe maximum value of `p` is `2 * 10^5`.\n`k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 2 * 10^5` implies `k^2 approx 4 * 10^5`, so `k approx 632`.\nThe `f_values` array can go up to `k=633` (index 633).\nThe loop `for k_val in range(max_k, 0, -1)` runs at most `max_k` times. The outer `while` loop runs at most `max_k` times (e.g., if `p` is sum of many `f(2)`). So the overall complexity for finding `min_nodes` is roughly `O(max_k^2)` in the worst case, which is `O(633^2)` which is fine (`4 * 10^5`).\nThe calculation of `max_unidirectional_pairs` is `O(1)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Precompute f(k) = k*(k-1)/2\n    # Max k for p = 2*10^5: k*(k-1)/2 <= 2*10^5 => k^2 approx 4*10^5 => k approx 632.4\n    # So we need k up to 633 or 634\n    \n    max_k_val = 0\n    while max_k_val * (max_k_val - 1) // 2 <= p: # Find max k such that f(k) <= p\n        max_k_val += 1\n    # max_k_val is now 1 greater than the actual max k that satisfies the condition for p\n    # For example, if p=3, max_k_val becomes 4 (since f(3)=3, f(4)=6).\n    # So, f_values should be indexed up to max_k_val.\n    \n    f_values = [0] * (max_k_val + 1)\n    for k in range(1, max_k_val + 1):\n        f_values[k] = k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n    current_p = p\n    min_nodes = 0\n    \n    # We don't need to store scc_sizes explicitly for the second part, only min_nodes.\n    # The sum of k_i for the nodes is min_nodes.\n    \n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find largest k_val such that f_values[k_val] <= current_p\n        k_found = 0\n        # Iterate downwards from max_k_val\n        for k_idx in range(max_k_val, 0, -1):\n            if f_values[k_idx] <= current_p:\n                k_found = k_idx\n                break\n        \n        # This k_found must be at least 1 if current_p > 0 (since f(1)=0, f(2)=1).\n        # If current_p > 0, k_found will be at least 2 if current_p >= 1.\n        # If current_p = 0, loop terminates.\n        \n        min_nodes += k_found\n        current_p -= f_values[k_found]\n        \n        # Optimization: if current_p becomes smaller, max_k_val can be reduced\n        # This is implicitly handled because we iterate down from max_k_val,\n        # but if current_p is very small, we might not need to check large k_idx values.\n        # However, the current max_k_val is already based on the initial p.\n        # It's fine to just use the initial max_k_val.\n\n    # Calculate max unidirectional pairs\n    # Total ordered pairs (u,v) with u!=v is min_nodes * (min_nodes - 1)\n    # Total bidirectionally reachable pairs (u,v) and (v,u) is 2 * p\n    # Remaining pairs are unidirectional (u,v) where u->v exists but v->u does not.\n    # Or (v,u) where v->u exists but u->v does not.\n    # In the linear chain construction, all remaining pairs are of this type.\n    # The count of (u,v) where u->v exists and v->u does not is (Total - 2p) / 2\n    \n    max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_nodes * (min_nodes - 1) - 2 * p) // 2\n\n    print(f\"{min_nodes} {max_unidirectional_pairs}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
