            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Guard Duty Dilemma: A Permutation Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem staring me in the face, and the core of it is all about connecting spaceships to bases without any of the lines crossing.  First things first, the number of Rebel ships (`R`) has to equal the number of bases (`B`); otherwise, forget it, output \"No\" and move on.  Let's just call that common value `N`.\n\nMy initial thought is that the *no-intersection* condition is the tricky part.  I'm thinking I'll need to check if any two line segments cross each other, and the orientation test seems like the right tool for the job. Specifically, using cross products (or orientation tests, to be more precise) to determine the orientation of three points. The `orient` function (returning -1, 0, or 1 for counter-clockwise, collinear, or clockwise, respectively) will be crucial.  If two segments, `AB` and `CD`, intersect, then the orientation of C and D relative to AB will be opposite, *and* the orientation of A and B relative to CD will also be opposite. That gives me a way to *strictly* check for intersections (where they cross, not just touch). The \"no three points are collinear\" condition simplifies this since overlapping segments won't be an issue.\n\nThe problem's constraints are a huge clue.  With `N` being at most 10, it looks like a brute-force approach might actually work. If I fix the order of the Rebel ships, I only need to consider permutations of the bases.  `10!` (factorial of 10) is a manageable number, even for a Python script.  I can try all `N!` possible assignments of bases to ships and check if any of them work (no intersecting segments). If I find at least one valid non-intersecting configuration, I output \"Yes.\" If I exhaust all the possibilities and find that no assignments work, then I output \"No.\"  That's the basic strategy: permute, orient, and check.\n",
