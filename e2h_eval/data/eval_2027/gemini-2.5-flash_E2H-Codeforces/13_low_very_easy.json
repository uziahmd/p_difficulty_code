For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Triad Classifier**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify these three notes as major, minor, or \"strange.\"  Right, so the fundamentals are clear – we're dealing with semitones, these cyclic note relationships, and unordered sets of three notes.  Let's break this down into digestible steps.\n\nFirst, I need a good numerical representation for the notes.  A dictionary mapping note names to integers (0-11) will be perfect.  That'll make the distance calculations straightforward.  `C = 0`, `C# = 1`, and so on.\n\nNext, the distance calculation.  We're dealing with a cyclic system, so I'll need to use the modulo operator to handle those \"wrap-around\" scenarios. Given two notes, n1 and n2, the distance between them is `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. This should correctly give me the number of semitones between them, from the lower note to the higher.\n\nNow for the input processing.  I need to read in those three space-separated notes and convert them to their numerical representations using my `note_map`.  Storing them in a list makes sense, call it `notes_val`.\n\nThe core logic is to check all the possible orderings of those three notes. Because it's an *unordered* set, I have to account for every permutation. Six possibilities, right?  For each arrangement (X, Y, Z), I can calculate the distances XY and YZ. I'm looking for either a 4-3 pattern (major) or a 3-4 pattern (minor).\n\nIf I find a 4-3 anywhere it's major, a 3-4 minor. And since it's unambiguous, if both conditions fail it's 'strange'. This shouldn't be too bad. I think I've got a solid plan.  Let's get to coding.\n",
