The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Pythonic Plan for Xenia's Ring Road Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: Xenia's on a ring road with 'n' houses, and she's got 'm' tasks to complete.  The tasks are defined by a list 'a', where each element `a_i` tells me which house Xenia needs to go to for that task. She starts at house 1, and can only move clockwise, one house at a time. The goal is to minimize the total time.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my thought process:\n\n*   **Understanding the Core:**  The sequential nature of the tasks is key. Xenia *has* to finish them in the order given in the list `a`.  This means it's a series of jumps from one house to another.\n\n*   **Keeping Track:**  I'll need to keep track of Xenia's current house. Let's call that `current_house`. Initially, it's 1. I'll also need a variable to accumulate the total time, `total_time`, which is also initialized to 0.\n\n*   **Iterating Through the Tasks:** I'll loop through the list `a`. For each task (represented by `a_i`), I need to calculate the time it takes Xenia to move from `current_house` to `a_i`.\n\n*   **Clockwise Movement Logic:**  The \"clockwise only\" constraint is where things get interesting.  If the target house (`a_i`) is further along the ring from the current house, the time is simply the difference.  But if the target house is *before* the current house, it means Xenia has to go all the way around the ring.\n\n    I worked out the logic for calculating that clockwise distance:\n    *   If `a_i >= current_house`: the time is simply the difference: `a_i - current_house`.\n    *   If `a_i < current_house`:  I realized a more efficient approach is `n - current_house + a_i`. This gives the shortest clockwise path.\n\n*   **Calculating the Time:** The time taken for that specific task, will be added to my `total_time` variable.\n\n*   **Updating the Current Position:** After each task, I must update `current_house` to reflect Xenia's new position (i.e., `current_house = a_i`).\n\n*   **The Algorithm:**\n    1.  Read in the inputs: `n`, `m`, and the list `a`.\n    2.  Initialize `current_house = 1` and `total_time = 0`.\n    3.  Loop through the list `a`.\n    4.  Inside the loop, for each task represented by `target_pos`:\n        *   Calculate `time_taken` based on the logic I worked out above.\n        *   Add `time_taken` to `total_time`.\n        *   Update `current_house` to `target_pos`.\n    5.  Finally, output `total_time`.\n\n*   **Checking the Logic** For the example input, the math seems correct. It's a nice and clear approach. Time to translate this into a Python script!\n",
