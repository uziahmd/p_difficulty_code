    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing an element from the array will remove one occurrence of that element, and then we look at the min and max of the remaining array.\n\n Observation:\n The instability is defined as (max - min). When we remove an element, the new min and/or max might change.\n\n Let's sort the array. Then the entire array's min is the first element and max is the last.\n\n However, note: if we remove an element, then the new min could be either the original min (if we didn't remove the only min) or a larger value.\n Similarly, the new max could be either the original max or a smaller value.\n\n Since the array can have duplicates, we cannot simply remove one occurrence and then check the entire array because n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Consider that the instability after removal is (new_max - new_min). The candidate removals are limited because:\n\n 1. Removing an element that is the current minimum: then the new min would be the next smallest element (unless there are multiple minima, then the min remains the same).\n 2. Removing an element that is the current maximum: then the new max would be the next largest element.\n\n However, note that sometimes removing an element that is neither the min nor the max might also help? Actually, the min and max are determined by the extreme values. Removing an element in the middle doesn't change the min or max.\n\n Therefore, the idea is:\n\n Sort the array. Then the overall instability without removal is (last - first).\n\n Now, when we remove one element, the instability becomes:\n\n Option 1: Remove the first element (the global min). Then the new array has min = second element (a[1]), and max = last element (a[-1]). Instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n Option 2: Remove the last element (the global max). Then the new array has min = first element (a[0]), and max = second last element (a[-2]). Instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n But what about removing an element that is not the global min or global max? \n\n Example: [1, 3, 3, 7]. \n   Removing the first element: [3,3,7] -> instability 7-3=4.\n   Removing the last element: [1,3,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n   Removing an inner element: say the first 3 -> [1,3,7] -> instability 7-1=6; similarly removing the second 3 -> [1,3,7] -> 6.\n\n So the best is to remove the last element.\n\n However, consider an array with duplicate extremes. For example: [1, 1, 2, 3]. \n   Removing the first 1: [1,2,3] -> instability 3-1=2.\n   Removing the last 3: [1,1,2] -> instability 2-1=1.\n   Removing the middle 1: [1,2,3] -> 2, same as first removal.\n\n What if we have an array with multiple minima and multiple maxima?\n\n Actually, we must consider that the array might have several minima and several maxima. But note:\n\n The min of the entire array is the smallest number, and the max is the largest.\n\n However, when we remove one element, the new min is the smallest number that remains. Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, the instability after removal is (max_remaining - min_remaining). The max_remaining is the maximum of the array without the removed element, and min_remaining is the minimum of the array without the removed element.\n\n How to compute without checking each removal? We note that the removal of an element that is not the global min or global max doesn't change the min and max? Not exactly: if the array has duplicate minima, then removing one minimum might not change the min (because there's still a minimum left). Similarly for maxima.\n\n Actually, the min_remaining is:\n   If the removed element is the only occurrence of the current min, then min_remaining is the next smallest number (which is the second element in sorted order, but if there are duplicates, then the next distinct value might be later).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We can consider:\n\n   Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element (if there are multiple smallest, then removing one of them might leave the smallest unchanged)\n   Candidate 2: Remove the largest element (similarly)\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is the smallest and there are duplicates? Then the min remains the same.\n\n So we need to consider:\n\n   Let b = sorted(a)\n\n   Option 1: Remove the first occurrence (the smallest) but if there are multiple smallest, then the min of the remaining array is still b[0] (because we removed one copy and there's another). Then the instability is b[-1] - b[0].\n\n   Option 2: Remove the last occurrence (the largest) but if there are multiple largest, then the max remains b[-1] and the instability is b[-1] - b[0] (same as above).\n\n But wait, that is not correct. \n\n Let me reframe: The min of the remaining array is the smallest value that remains. Similarly for max.\n\n Therefore, the min_remaining is:\n   If we remove an element that is greater than the min, then the min remains the original min (unless we remove all occurrences of the min, but we only remove one). Similarly for max.\n\n So actually, the min_remaining is always the original min unless we remove the only occurrence of the min. Similarly, max_remaining is the original max unless we remove the only occurrence of the max.\n\n Therefore, the two possibilities for improvement are:\n\n   Possibility A: Remove the only occurrence of the min (so the new min is the next smallest number). Then the instability becomes (max - next_smallest).\n   Possibility B: Remove the only occurrence of the max (so the new max is the next largest number). Then the instability becomes (next_largest - min).\n\n But note: there might be other removals that are not the min or max? Actually, no. Because if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max remain the same as the original, so the instability remains (max - min). \n\n Therefore, the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum among:\n\n   candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]   [if we remove the first element, then the new min is b[1] and the max is still b[-1]]\n   candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]   [if we remove the last element, then the new max is b[-2] and the min is still b[0]]\n\n However, consider the case where the array has duplicate minima. Then even if we remove one min, the min remains the same. Then the instability would be (b[-1] - b[0]) which is the same as the original.\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove any element. So we have two types of removals:\n\n   Type 1: Removal of an element that is the min (and it was the only min) -> then new min = next distinct value (but wait, we don't know the distinct value, we just know the next element in sorted array might be the same as the min?).\n\n Actually, let's break down:\n\n   Let m = min(a), M = max(a)\n\n   If there is more than one m, then removing one m doesn't change the min. Similarly for M.\n\n   So the effect on min and max depends on:\n\n     - If we remove an element that is the min and there is at least two mins, then the min remains m.\n     - Otherwise, the min becomes the next smallest value (which is the smallest value that is greater than m, and that value is the next distinct value in the sorted array).\n\n   Similarly for max.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   candidate1: Remove an element that is the min. But if there are duplicates, then the min doesn't change. Then the instability is (M - m). This is the same as the original, so not helpful.\n\n   candidate2: Remove an element that is the min and it is the only occurrence of m. Then the min becomes the next value (which is the first value in the sorted array that is greater than m). Similarly for max.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove only one element. We are not forced to remove the first element. However, the key is: the min_remaining is the smallest element in the remaining array, and the max_remaining is the largest element in the remaining array.\n\n   We can consider two scenarios:\n\n   Scenario 1: The removed element is the only min. Then the new min is the next smallest distinct value (or the next smallest element in the sorted array, which might be the same as the min if there are duplicates? Actually, no: if we remove one min and there are duplicates, then the next smallest is still m. Only if we remove the last occurrence of m then the next smallest is the next distinct value.\n\n   So we need to know the frequency of m and M.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note:\n\n     The instability after removal is determined by:\n\n        new_min = \n            if the removed element is the only occurrence of the global min: then the next smallest value (which is the first element in the sorted array that is not equal to m, but note: the sorted array may have consecutive m's. So we can find the first index where the element is greater than m, but that might be expensive.\n\n   Another idea: Instead of considering the entire set of removals, note that the min and max of the array are fixed. The removal can only:\n\n        - Decrease the min (if we remove the only min)\n        - Decrease the max (if we remove the only max)\n        - Or leave both unchanged (if we remove an element that is not the only min and not the only max)\n\n   Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is:\n\n        min( \n            original_instability,   # but note: we are forced to remove one element, and we can choose which one. So we don't want to keep the original_instability if we can lower it.\n\n        However, we have two ways to lower:\n\n        candidate1: Remove the only min -> then instability = M - (the next smallest distinct value) but wait, the next smallest distinct value is not necessarily the next element in the sorted array. Actually, the next smallest value is the smallest value that is greater than m, which is the first element in the sorted array that is not m. But we don't know the distinct values.\n\n   Actually, we can precompute:\n\n        Let b = sorted(a)\n\n        The original instability is b[-1]-b[0]\n\n        Now, if we remove one element, the instability is:\n\n            If we remove an element that is not the global min and not the global max, then the min and max remain the same -> instability = b[-1]-b[0]\n\n            If we remove the global min (and it is the only occurrence of the min) then the new min is the next distinct value. How to get the next distinct value? \n\n                We can traverse from the beginning until we find a value greater than b[0]. But note: there might be duplicates. The next distinct value is the smallest value that is greater than b[0]. In the sorted array, we can find the first index i such that b[i] > b[0]. Then the new min is b[i] and the instability is b[-1] - b[i].\n\n            Similarly, if we remove the global max (and it is the only occurrence) then the new max is the largest value that is less than b[-1]. We can find the last index j such that b[j] < b[-1]. Then the instability is b[j] - b[0].\n\n        But wait: what if we remove an element that is the global min but there are duplicates? Then the min doesn't change. Similarly for max.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          candidate1: Remove an element that is the min (if the min appears only once) -> instability = b[-1] - (the next distinct value after min)\n          candidate2: Remove an element that is the max (if the max appears only once) -> instability = (the previous distinct value of max) - b[0]\n\n        However, note: we might have multiple candidates. Actually, we are allowed to remove any one element. So we must consider every element that is the min or the max? But wait, if we remove an element that is not the min but is part of the min (duplicate) then the min doesn't change. Similarly for max.\n\n        Actually, the only removals that change the min or the max are those that remove the last occurrence of the min or the last occurrence of the max.\n\n        But note: the array might have multiple minima and multiple maxima. We are not required to remove the first occurrence of min or the last occurrence of max. We can remove any one element.\n\n        However, the effect on the min and max is:\n\n          The new min is the smallest value in the array after removal. The smallest value is the original min unless we remove every occurrence of the min (but we remove only one). So if there is at least two min, then removing one min leaves the min unchanged.\n\n        Therefore, the removal of an element that is the min (even if there are duplicates) does not change the min if there is at least two min. Similarly for max.\n\n        So the only removals that change the min are those that remove the last occurrence of the min (i.e., the count of min becomes one less and if the count becomes zero then the min changes). Similarly for max.\n\n        But note: the array is given as a list. We are not told the distinct values.\n\n        Approach:\n\n          Let b = sorted(a)\n          Let min_val = b[0], max_val = b[-1]\n\n          Count of min_val: c_min = frequency of min_val in the array.\n          Count of max_val: c_max = frequency of max_val in the array.\n\n          Then:\n\n            If we remove one occurrence of min_val and c_min > 1, then the min remains min_val, and the instability is max_val - min_val (same as original).\n            If we remove one occurrence of min_val and c_min == 1, then the new min is the next distinct value (which is the first element in b that is greater than min_val). Let that value be x. Then the instability is max_val - x.\n\n            Similarly, if we remove one occurrence of max_val and c_max == 1, then the new max is the previous distinct value (which is the last element in b that is less than max_val). Let that value be y. Then the instability is y - min_val.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to remove any element. So we can also remove an element that is neither min nor max, but then the instability remains the same.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is the minimum of:\n\n            original_instability (if we remove an element that is not the only min and not the only max) OR\n            (if we remove the only min) then max_val - (next distinct min) OR\n            (if we remove the only max) then (previous distinct max) - min_val\n\n          However, note: we are not forced to remove the min or the max. We can remove an element that is the min (if it's the only one) and that gives candidate1, or an element that is the max (if it's the only one) and that gives candidate2, or an element that is neither and then we get the original_instability.\n\n          But wait, if we remove an element that is the min (only one) then the instability becomes candidate1, and if we remove an element that is the max (only one) then candidate2, and if we remove an element that is neither then the instability remains original_instability.\n\n          However, we are trying to minimize the instability. So we want the minimum value among candidate1, candidate2, and the original_instability? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is the min (only one) then we get candidate1, and that might be better than the original_instability? \n\n          Example: [1,2,100] \n            original_instability = 99.\n            Remove the min (1): then the array becomes [2,100] -> instability 98 -> worse.\n            Remove the max (100): then the array becomes [1,2] -> instability 1 -> better.\n\n          So we don't necessarily get a better instability by removing the min (only one) in this case.\n\n          Therefore, we must consider:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = (if there is exactly one occurrence of min_val) then (max_val - next_min) else None (meaning we cannot reduce by removing min)\n            candidate_remove_max = (if there is exactly one occurrence of max_val) then (prev_max - min_val) else None\n\n          But note: we are allowed to remove any element. So we can also remove an element that is the min (even if there are duplicates) and then the instability remains the same. Similarly for max.\n\n          However, we are interested in the minimum possible instability.\n\n          We can consider:\n\n            candidate1 = if there is exactly one min: max_val - (b[index_of_first_greater_than_min])   [index_of_first_greater_than_min is the smallest index i such that b[i] != min_val? Actually, we need the next distinct value. Since the array is sorted, we can do:\n\n            Let i = 0\n            while i < n and b[i] == min_val:\n                i += 1\n            Then if i < n: next_min = b[i]\n            Then candidate_remove_min = max_val - next_min\n\n            Similarly for max:\n\n            Let j = n-1\n            while j>=0 and b[j] == max_val:\n                j -= 1\n            Then if j >=0: prev_max = b[j]\n            candidate_remove_max = prev_max - min_val\n\n          But wait: what if we remove an element that is the min (only one) and the next distinct value is the same as the min? No, because we skipped all the min_vals and found the next distinct value.\n\n          Also, note: we are allowed to remove an element that is not the min or max, but then the instability remains the original. So we must compare:\n\n            candidate_remove_min (if exists) and candidate_remove_max (if exists) and the possibility of removing an element that doesn't change the min and max (then instability = original_instability) but wait: if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the same as the original.\n\n          However, we are trying to minimize. So the minimal instability is the minimum among:\n\n            candidate_remove_min (if we can remove the only min and get a lower instability)\n            candidate_remove_max (if we can remove the only max and get a lower instability)\n            and the original_instability (if we remove an element that is neither, or if removing the only min or only max doesn't help, then we might have to use the original_instability? But note: we are forced to remove one element. We are allowed to choose which one. So we can choose the best one.\n\n          Actually, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n            candidate_remove_min (if exists) and candidate_remove_max (if exists) and ... wait, but there might be more than one way to remove an element that changes the min or max? Actually, we are only concerned with the two candidates: removing the only min or the only max.\n\n          However, note: we are not forced to remove the only min or the only max. We can remove any element. But the only chance to improve the instability is by removing an element that is the min (if it's the only one) or the max (if it's the only one). Otherwise, the instability remains the same.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            ans = min( \n                (original_instability),   # but wait, if we remove an element that is neither, we get the same instability. But maybe we can get a lower one by removing the min or max even if they are duplicated? Actually, no: if we remove a duplicate min, the min doesn't change. Similarly for max.\n\n                (candidate_remove_min if the condition holds else float('inf')),\n                (candidate_remove_max if the condition holds else float('inf'))\n            )\n\n          However, note: if we remove an element that is the min (and there are duplicates) then the min doesn't change, so the instability is the same as the original. Similarly for max.\n\n          But wait, is there a possibility that removing an element that is not the min or max might actually change the min or max? No, because if the element is not the min, then the min remains the smallest (which is the original min). Similarly for max.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n            candidate_remove_min (if we remove the only min) and candidate_remove_max (if we remove the only max) and the original_instability (if we remove an element that is not the only min and not the only max) ?\n\n          But note: the original_instability is the same as the instability when we remove an element that is not the only min and not the only max. However, we are allowed to choose which element to remove. We want the minimum instability we can get.\n\n          Actually, we don't have to compare with the original_instability separately because:\n\n            candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max are computed under the condition that the removal changes the min or max. But if we remove an element that doesn't change the min or max, the instability remains the original_instability.\n\n          However, we can also get the same instability by removing an element that is not the min and not the max. So the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n            candidate_remove_min (if applicable) and candidate_remove_max (if applicable) and ... but wait, we must also consider that the original_instability might be the best? \n\n          Actually, we are minimizing. We want the smallest value.\n\n          Example: [1,2,3] \n            original_instability = 2.\n            candidate_remove_min: remove 1 (only one) -> new min is 2, so instability = 3-2 = 1.\n            candidate_remove_max: remove 3 (only one) -> new max is 2, so instability = 2-1 = 1.\n\n            Then the minimal instability is 1.\n\n          Example: [1,1,2,3]\n            original_instability = 3-1 = 2.\n            candidate_remove_min: there are two 1's, so removing one 1: min remains 1, so instability = 3-1 = 2.\n            candidate_remove_max: there is one 3, so removing 3: new max is 2, instability = 2-1 = 1.\n\n            Then the minimal instability is 1.\n\n          Example: [1,2,2,3]\n            original_instability = 3-1 = 2.\n            candidate_remove_min: remove 1 (only one) -> new min=2, instability=3-2=1.\n            candidate_remove_max: remove 3 (only one) -> new max=2, instability=2-1=1.\n\n          Example: [1,2,3,4] \n            original_instability = 3.\n            candidate_remove_min: remove 1 -> 4-2=2.\n            candidate_remove_max: remove 4 -> 3-1=2.\n\n          So we can see that the answer is the minimum between candidate_remove_min (if exists) and candidate_remove_max (if exists) and the original_instability is not needed because if we don't remove the only min or the only max, we get the original_instability. But note: sometimes we can get a lower value by removing the only min or the only max.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. So we can choose the removal that gives the smallest instability.\n\n          Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            candidate1 = a large number (like infinity)\n            candidate2 = a large number\n\n            If the frequency of min_val is 1:\n                # Find the next distinct value after min_val\n                i = 0\n                while i < n and b[i] == min_val:\n                    i += 1\n                if i < n:\n                    candidate1 = max_val - b[i]\n\n            Similarly, if the frequency of max_val is 1:\n                j = n-1\n                while j >=0 and b[j] == max_val:\n                    j -= 1\n                if j >=0:\n                    candidate2 = b[j] - min_val\n\n            Then the answer is min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2) ?\n\n          But wait: in the example [1,2,3,4]: \n            original_instability = 3\n            candidate1 = 4-2 = 2 (if we remove 1)\n            candidate2 = 3-1 = 2 (if we remove 4)\n\n            Then the answer is 2.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. We don't have to remove the only min or the only max. But if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, the instability remains 3. So we don't want that.\n\n          But our candidate1 and candidate2 are the results of removing the only min and the only max. And we are taking the minimum of the original_instability (which is 3) and the candidates (2 and 2). So we get 2.\n\n          However, what if we remove an element that is the min (only one) and then the instability becomes 2, which is better than 3.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"minimize instability\". So we take the minimum.\n\n          However, wait: is it possible that removing an element that is not the min or the max might lead to a lower instability? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3,100] \n            original_instability = 99.\n\n            candidate_remove_min: remove 1 (only one) -> next distinct min is 2, then instability = 100-2 = 98.\n            candidate_remove_max: remove 100 (only one) -> next distinct max is 3, then instability = 3-1 = 2.\n\n            Then the minimal instability is 2.\n\n          But what if we remove an element that is not the min or the max? For example, remove 2: then the array becomes [1,3,100] -> instability 99, same as original.\n          Remove 3: [1,2,100] -> 99.\n\n          So the minimal instability is 2, achieved by removing the max.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n            Step 2: Sort the list -> b\n            Step 3: Let min_val = b[0], max_val = b[-1]\n            Step 4: Count frequency of min_val and max_val? Actually, we can use:\n\n                    count_min = (number of times min_val appears in the array)\n                    count_max = (number of times max_val appears in the array)\n\n            Step 5: Compute original_instability = max_val - min_val\n\n            Step 6: candidate1 = a big number, candidate2 = a big number.\n\n                    if count_min == 1:\n                        # find the next distinct value after min_val\n                        i = 0\n                        while i < n and b[i] == min_val:\n                            i += 1\n                        candidate1 = max_val - b[i]   # if i reaches n, then there is no next distinct value? But then the array is all min_val, but then max_val==min_val so candidate1 would be 0? But then n>=2, so if all are min_val then we have at least two, so count_min>1. So we are safe.\n\n                    if count_max == 1:\n                        j = n-1\n                        while j>=0 and b[j]==max_val:\n                            j -= 1\n                        candidate2 = b[j] - min_val\n\n            Step 7: Answer = min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n          However, wait: what if the array is [1,1,1,1] (all ones)? Then min_val=1, max_val=1, count_min=4, count_max=4.\n\n            original_instability = 0.\n            candidate1: since count_min!=1, skip -> candidate1 remains big.\n            candidate2: since count_max!=1, skip -> candidate2 remains big.\n\n            Then answer = min(0, big, big) = 0.\n\n          Example: [1,1,2] \n            min_val=1, max_val=2, count_min=2, count_max=1.\n            original_instability = 1.\n            candidate1: not applicable (count_min>1) -> skip.\n            candidate2: applicable -> j starts at 2 (last index) and we go backwards: \n                j=2: b[2]=2 -> j becomes 1.\n                j=1: b[1]=1 -> stop.\n                candidate2 = b[1] - min_val = 1-1 = 0.\n\n            Then answer = min(1, big, 0) = 0.\n\n          But wait: [1,1,2] -> remove the only max (which is 2) -> array becomes [1,1] -> instability 0. Correct.\n\n          Example: [1,2,2] \n            min_val=1, max_val=2, count_min=1, count_max=2.\n            original_instability = 1.\n            candidate1: applicable -> i=0: b[0]=1 -> i becomes 1. Then candidate1 = 2 - b[1] = 2-2=0.\n            candidate2: not applicable (count_max>1) -> skip.\n\n            Then answer = min(1, 0, big)=0.\n\n          This is correct: remove the min (the only one) -> [2,2] -> instability 0.\n\n          Example: [1,1,2,2] \n            min_val=1, max_val=2, count_min=2, count_max=2.\n            original_instability = 1.\n            candidate1: not applicable.\n            candidate2: not applicable.\n            Then answer = 1.\n\n          But wait: if we remove one element, we can remove a 1 or a 2. \n            Remove a 1: [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1.\n            Remove a 2: [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1.\n\n          So the answer is 1.\n\n          But note: the above algorithm returns 1.\n\n          However, consider [1,2,3,4] again: \n            candidate1: count_min=1 -> i=0: b[0]=1, then i=1 -> b[1]=2 -> candidate1 = 4-2=2.\n            candidate2: count_max=1 -> j=3: b[3]=4, then j=2 -> b[2]=3 -> candidate2=3-1=2.\n            Then answer = min(3,2,2)=2.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          One more: [1,2,100,101] \n            min_val=1, max_val=101, count_min=1, count_max=1.\n            candidate1: remove min -> next distinct is 2 -> 101-2=99.\n            candidate2: remove max -> previous distinct is 100 -> 100-1=99.\n            Then answer = min(100,99,99)=99.\n\n          But wait: what if we remove 100? Then the array becomes [1,2,101] -> instability=100. \n          What if we remove 2? Then [1,100,101] -> instability=100.\n          What if we remove 1? -> [2,100,101] -> instability=99.\n          What if we remove 101? -> [1,2,100] -> instability=99.\n\n          So the minimal instability is 99.\n\n          The algorithm returns 99.\n\n          However, note: the original_instability is 100, and the two candidates are 99 and 99, so the minimum is 99.\n\n          But wait, why did I think removing 100 gives 100? Because the min is 1 and the max is 101, so 101-1=100.\n\n          The algorithm is correct.\n\n          However, there is a catch: the array might have multiple distinct values and we are only looking at the immediate next distinct value for min and the immediate previous distinct value for max. This is correct because:\n\n            For the min: if we remove the only min, the new min is the smallest value that is greater than the original min. In a sorted array, that is the next distinct value.\n\n            Similarly for the max.\n\n          Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            b = sorted(a)\n            min_val = b[0]\n            max_val = b[-1]\n            orig_instability = max_val - min_val\n\n            # Count the frequency of min_val and max_val\n            count_min = 0\n            for num in a:\n                if num == min_val:\n                    count_min += 1\n            count_max = 0\n            for num in a:\n                if num == max_val:\n                    count_max += 1\n\n            # Alternatively, we can use:\n            #   count_min = a.count(min_val)   but a can be up to 10^5, so two counts is acceptable.\n\n            candidate1 = 10**9  # a big number\n            candidate2 = 10**9\n\n            if count_min == 1:\n                # Find the first index where the element is greater than min_val\n                i = 0\n                while i < n and b[i] == min_val:\n                    i += 1\n                # Since we have at least one min and count_min==1, then i must be less than n (unless n==1, but n>=2)\n                candidate1 = max_val - b[i]\n\n            if count_max == 1:\n                j = n-1\n                while j>=0 and b[j]==max_val:\n                    j -= 1\n                if j >=0:   # if j became -1, then there was no element before the max, but that should not happen because n>=2 and if count_max==1 then there is at least one element before the max? Actually, if n==2 and the two elements are the same, then count_max=2, so we don't enter. So safe.\n                    candidate2 = b[j] - min_val\n\n            ans = min(orig_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n\n            print(ans)\n\n          Let's test with provided examples.\n\n          Example 1: Input \"4\\n1 3 3 7\"\n            a = [1,3,3,7]\n            b = [1,3,3,7]\n            min_val=1, max_val=7, orig_instability=6.\n\n            count_min: 1 -> count_min=1, so candidate1: \n                i=0: b[0]==1 -> i=1 -> b[1]==3 -> candidate1 = 7-3=4.\n            count_max: 1 -> candidate2:\n                j=3: b[3]==7 -> j=2 -> b[2]==3 -> candidate2=3-1=2.\n\n            Then ans = min(6,4,2)=2.\n\n          Example 2: Input \"2\\n1 100000\"\n            a=[1,100000]\n            b=[1,100000]\n            orig_instability=99999.\n            count_min=1 -> candidate1: 100000 - b[1] (which is 100000) -> but wait, in sorted array: \n                i=0: b[0]==1 -> i=1 -> then b[1]==100000 -> candidate1 = 100000 - 100000 = 0.\n            count_max=1 -> candidate2: j=1: b[1]==100000 -> j=0 -> b[0]==1 -> candidate2=1-1=0.\n            Then ans = min(99999,0,0)=0.\n\n          However, the example output is 0.\n\n          But wait: the example input is \"2\\n1 100000\", and the example output is \"0\".\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But note: the example input is given as: ['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000'] and the output is ['2','0'].\n\n          However, the example input format is two separate test cases? Actually, the problem reads one integer n and then n integers.\n\n          Our code reads one test case. The example input is provided as two separate lines for two examples. But the problem says:\n\n          The first line of the input contains one integer n ... \n\n          So we assume one test case per run.\n\n          But the example input is given as two separate examples. We should run the code for each test case? \n\n          Actually, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input with two test cases.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can either leave the minimum and maximum values unchanged or alter them if the removed element was the only occurrence of the current minimum or maximum. The goal is to find the optimal element to remove such that the resulting instability is minimized.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the new minimum and maximum after removing any element. The minimal instability will be the smallest value among:\n   - The original instability (if we remove an element that is neither the only minimum nor the only maximum).\n   - The instability after removing the only minimum (if it exists), which would make the new minimum the next distinct value in the sorted array.\n   - The instability after removing the only maximum (if it exists), which would make the new maximum the previous distinct value in the sorted array.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the minimum and maximum values.\n   - Calculate the original instability as the difference between the last and first elements in the sorted array.\n   - Check if the minimum or maximum appears only once in the array. If so, compute the new instability by considering the next or previous distinct value.\n   - The answer is the minimum value among the original instability and the computed instabilities from removing the only minimum or maximum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = sorted(a)\nmin_val = b[0]\nmax_val = b[-1]\norig_instability = max_val - min_val\n\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\n\ncandidate1 = float('inf')\ncandidate2 = float('inf')\n\nif count_min == 1:\n    i = 0\n    while i < n and b[i] == min_val:\n        i += 1\n    candidate1 = max_val - b[i]\n\nif count_max == 1:\n    j = n - 1\n    while j >= 0 and b[j] == max_val:\n        j -= 1\n    if j >= 0:\n        candidate2 = b[j] - min_val\n\nans = min(orig_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting and Initial Values**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) values. The original instability is calculated as `max_val - min_val`.\n3. **Counting Frequencies**: The code counts how many times the minimum and maximum values appear in the array.\n4. **Candidate Instabilities**: \n   - If the minimum value appears only once, the code calculates the instability after removing it by finding the next distinct value in the sorted array.\n   - Similarly, if the maximum value appears only once, the code calculates the instability after removing it by finding the previous distinct value.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum value among the original instability and the two candidate instabilities (if they exist). This ensures the solution is optimal for all possible removals of a single element.",
