The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: \n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   string A (Nikephoros' sequence) and string B (Polycarpus' sequence)\n\n Since the sequences are cyclic, we can think of the i-th round (0-indexed) as:\n   a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b = B[i % len(B)]\n\n But note: n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the n rounds into complete cycles of the two sequences. However, note that the two sequences have different lengths.\n\n Let L1 = len(A), L2 = len(B). The combined cycle would be LCM(L1, L2) but since L1, L2 <= 1000, the LCM might be too large to consider as a cycle? Actually, we can use the fact that the state (i mod L1, j mod L1) is periodic with period LCM(L1, L2). But note: the rounds are linear, so we can consider:\n\n   Let T = LCM(L1, L2). Then the pattern of outcomes for the first T rounds will repeat.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Precompute the outcome for one full cycle of T rounds (but T can be up to 1000*1000 / gcd(1000,1000) which is at most 1000000, and n can be 2e9, so we cannot simulate T rounds if T is 1000000 and then do 2e9/T cycles? Actually, we can, because T is the LCM and we can compute the total wins in T rounds and then multiply by the number of cycles, and then handle the remainder.\n\n However, note: we are only asked for the total red spots (which are the losses). Each loss for a player adds one red spot.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate without using LCM by breaking the n rounds into two independent cycles?\n\n Another approach: since the two sequences are independent, we can consider the rounds in terms of two pointers that cycle independently.\n\n Let:\n   Let f(i) = outcome of the round when Nikephoros uses A[i] and Polycarpus uses B[j] (where i and j are indices modulo their respective lengths).\n\n But note: the rounds are synchronized by the same index (round number). So for round r (0-indexed), \n   index1 = r % L1\n   index2 = r % L2\n\n We want to count:\n   For each round r from 0 to n-1:\n        if A[r % L1] vs B[r % L2] results in a loss for Nikephoros (i.e., the outcome is that Nikephoros loses) then increment his red spots.\n        similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over 2e9 rounds.\n\n Idea: \n   We can precompute the entire pattern for one full cycle of the two sequences? The cycle length is T = LCM(L1, L2). Then the total rounds n can be broken into:\n        cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n   Then the total losses for Nikephoros is: cycles * (losses in T rounds for Nikephoros) + (losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephoros)\n\n But note: the two sequences are independent and the round index r is the same for both, so the cycle is determined by the pair (r mod L1, r mod L2). The cycle T is the least common multiple of L1 and L2.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Compute T = LCM(L1, L2) = (L1 * L2) // GCD(L1, L2)\n\n 2. Precompute an array for one cycle of T rounds (each element is a tuple (a, b) from the sequences) and then determine for each round whether it's a loss for Nikephoros or Polycarpus.\n\n However, T might be very large (if L1 and L2 are 1000, then T can be 1000000). Then n is 2e9, and we can do:\n\n   total_cycles = n // T\n   remainder = n % T\n\n   Then we need to count:\n      loss_Nikephoros_cycle = 0\n      loss_Polycarpus_cycle = 0\n\n   But how to compute the counts for one cycle without iterating T rounds? \n\n Alternatively, we can use double iteration (m and k) to cover all pairs? But note: the rounds are not by pairs of indices independently, but by the same round index (so the pair (i, j) occurs when i = j mod something? Actually, no: the round index r gives (r % L1, r % L2). The set of pairs (i, j) that occur is exactly the set of pairs (i, j) such that there exists r with i = r mod L1 and j = r mod L2, which is equivalent to i ≡ j (mod g) where g = gcd(L1, L2). \n\n However, we can use the idea of counting the number of rounds with a particular outcome without iterating over T.\n\n We can precompute for each possible pair (x, y) (where x in {0,...,L1-1}, y in {0,...,L2-1}) the outcome? But the round r corresponds to (r % L1, r % L2). The condition for a given (x, y) to appear is that r ≡ x (mod L1) and r ≡ y (mod L2). This system has a solution if and only if x ≡ y (mod g) [where g = gcd(L1, L2)], and then the solutions form an arithmetic progression with step T.\n\n But note: we don't need to know the exact r, but we can count the frequency of each pair (x,y) that satisfies x ≡ y (mod g) in the first T rounds.\n\n Actually, the entire set of pairs (x,y) that appear in the cycle of length T is exactly the set of pairs (x,y) such that x mod g = y mod g. And the number of times a particular (x,y) appears in the cycle is 1 (because the cycle length T is the LCM, so each pair (x,y) that satisfies the congruence condition appears exactly once per cycle).\n\n How many pairs (x,y) are there? \n   The condition is: x mod g = y mod g. There are g residues mod g. For residue r (0<=r<g), the x values are {x | x % g = r} and they form an arithmetic progression with step g, so there are L1//g numbers for x, and similarly L2//g for y. Therefore, the total pairs is g * (L1//g) * (L2//g) = (L1 * L2) // g = (L1 * L2) / gcd(L1,L2) = T.\n\n So indeed, each pair (x,y) that satisfies the congruence condition appears exactly once in the cycle.\n\n Then we can:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute the outcome for each pair (x,y) (with x from 0 to L1-1, y from 0 to L2-1) that satisfies (x % g == y % g). But wait, we don't have to iterate over all pairs (there are T pairs, and T can be 10^6, which is acceptable because m,k<=1000 -> maximum T is 1000*1000/1 = 1e6, and 1e6 is acceptable for a loop in Python? Actually, 1e6 is acceptable, but note: worst-case T could be 1000*1000 (if gcd=1) which is 1e6, and then we do 1e6 iterations. Then we can do:\n\n   g = gcd(L1, L2)\n   T = L1 * L2 // g\n\n   Then, we can create two arrays (for one cycle) for the losses of Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\n   However, we don't need to store the entire cycle. We can:\n\n   Let:\n        count_N = 0\n        count_P = 0\n\n   Then, for each x in range(L1):\n        for each y in range(L2):\n            if (x % g != y % g): skip\n            else:\n                outcome = decide_outcome(A[x], B[y])\n                if outcome == 'N': # meaning Nikephoros loses\n                    count_N += 1\n                elif outcome == 'P': # Polycarpus loses\n                    count_P += 1\n\n   Then, for the entire n rounds:\n\n        cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n        total_N = cycles * count_N\n        total_P = cycles * count_P\n\n        Now, we need to simulate the remaining 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) and add the losses.\n\n        But note: the remainder rounds are the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle.\n\n        However, we cannot simulate remainder up to 2e9? Actually, remainder is less than T (which is at most 1e6) so we can iterate over remainder rounds.\n\n        But wait, the remainder is the number of rounds left, and we can index the rounds from 0 to remainder-1.\n\n        For round r (0-indexed from 0 to remainder-1):\n            x = r % L1\n            y = r % L2\n            outcome = decide_outcome(A[x], B[y])\n\n        Then update total_N and total_P accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the above double loop for the entire cycle (over T = L1*L2//g) is O(T) which is about 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: if we do two nested loops: the outer loop runs L1 (<=1000) and the inner loop runs L2 (<=1000) but we are skipping some? Actually, the condition (x%g == y%g) reduces the inner loop to only the y's that are congruent to x mod g. The number of y's that are congruent to a fixed residue mod g is (L2 // g) [if we consider the residues]. But actually, we can precompute for each x, the valid y's by:\n\n        residue = x % g\n        Then y must satisfy y % g == residue, and y from 0 to L2-1.\n\n        The number of y's for a fixed residue is (L2 // g) [if we consider that the residues cycle every g, and the full set of residues from 0 to L2-1 has floor(L2/g) complete sets plus possibly one incomplete set?] Actually, the count is (L2 + g - 1) // g? No, the standard way: the number of integers y in [0, L2-1] such that y % g = residue is (L2 - residue + g - 1) // g? Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let start = residue if residue < L2 else ... but simpler: we can iterate y from 0 to L2-1 and check y % g == residue, but that is O(L2) for each x, so overall O(L1 * L2) which is 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute for each residue r in [0, g-1] the list of y indices that have that residue. Then for each x, we get residue = x % g, then we take the list for that residue and iterate over those y's.\n\n   But since L1, L2 <= 1000, we can do:\n\n        g = gcd(L1, L2)\n        # Precompute a list of residues for each y: we don't need to, because we can simply iterate.\n\n   However, we can optimize the counting for the cycle by not iterating over every y for each x, but by iterating over residues and then over multiples.\n\n   But for simplicity and since T is at most 1e6, we can do:\n\n        total_N_cycle = 0\n        total_P_cycle = 0\n\n        # We'll iterate over x from 0 to L1-1, and for each x, iterate over y from 0 to L2-1, but only if (x % g == y % g)\n        for x in range(L1):\n            r1 = x % g\n            for y in range(L2):\n                if y % g == r1:\n                    # determine outcome between A[x] and B[y]\n                    res = outcome(A[x], B[y])\n                    if res == 'N':\n                        total_N_cycle += 1\n                    elif res == 'P':\n                        total_P_cycle += 1\n\n        Then, we have the counts for one cycle.\n\n   But wait, is this correct? Because the condition (x % g == y % g) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a round index r such that r mod L1 = x and r mod L2 = y (and we are considering the cycle of length T). And indeed, in the cycle of length T, each valid (x,y) appears exactly once.\n\n   However, note: the above double loop does not iterate over T pairs, but over L1 * (number of y for each x) which is L1 * (L2//g) [if we assume uniform distribution] but actually the total number of pairs is T = L1 * L2 // g, which matches.\n\n   But note: the above double loop is O(L1 * L2) which is 10^6, so acceptable.\n\n   However, we can also avoid the double loop by iterating over residues and then over the indices in the residue class. But the above is clear.\n\n   Then, we compute:\n\n        cycles = n // T\n        rem = n % T\n\n        total_red_N = cycles * total_N_cycle\n        total_red_P = cycles * total_P_cycle\n\n        Then we need to simulate the first 'rem' rounds.\n\n        for r in range(rem):\n            x = r % L1\n            y = r % L2\n            res = outcome(A[x], B[y])\n            if res == 'N':\n                total_red_N += 1\n            elif res == 'P':\n                total_red_P += 1\n\n        Print total_red_N, total_red_P\n\n   But wait, is the cycle T the correct period? Yes, because the state (r mod L1, r mod L2) repeats every T rounds.\n\n   However, note: we are counting the entire cycle including the pairs (x,y) that satisfy the congruence. And the simulation for the remainder is the first 'rem' rounds, which are the same as the first 'rem' rounds in the cycle.\n\n   But note: the remainder simulation: we are using r from 0 to rem-1. This is correct.\n\n   Now, we need a helper function `outcome(a, b)` that returns:\n        If a beats b, then return 'draw'? Actually, no: we need to know who wins.\n\n        Rules:\n          Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n          Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n          Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n        If a == b: draw -> no one loses.\n\n        Otherwise, if a beats b, then the loser is the opponent? Actually, if a beats b, then b loses (so Polycarpus loses in this round, so we mark that for Polycarpus). Similarly, if b beats a, then Nikephoros loses.\n\n        So:\n\n          outcome(a, b) returns:\n            if a == b: then 'draw' (we don't care, because no loss)\n            else if (a, b) is one of the winning pairs: then the winner is a, so the loser is b (Polycarpus) -> return 'P'\n            else: then the winner is b, so the loser is a (Nikephoros) -> return 'N'\n\n        Winning pairs:\n          (R, S) -> R wins -> loser is S (Polycarpus) -> return 'P'\n          (S, P) -> S wins -> loser is P (Polycarpus) -> return 'P'\n          (P, R) -> P wins -> loser is R (Nikephoros) -> return 'N'\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        def outcome(a, b):\n            if a == b:\n                return None   # or 'draw', but we don't use it for counting losses.\n            elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                return 'P'   # Polycarpus loses (because a wins, so b is the loser)\n            else:\n                return 'N'   # Nikephoros loses (because b wins, so a is the loser)\n\n        However, let me test:\n\n          Example: a='P', b='R' -> should be 'N' (because P beats R, so R is the loser, which is a? Wait: no, in the round: \n            Nikephoros shows 'P', Polycarpus shows 'R'. \n            According to the rules: Paper beats Rock, so Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses. So the loser is Polycarpus -> so we return 'P'? \n\n        Correction: \n          In the example: \n            a = 'P' (Nikephoros) and b = 'R' (Polycarpus). \n            Outcome: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So we should return 'P' (meaning Polycarpus loses).\n\n          But in the example above, I said (P, R) is one of the winning pairs for a, so return 'P'. That is correct.\n\n          Now, if a='R', b='P': \n            a='R', b='P': \n            Rock vs Paper: Paper beats Rock -> so the loser is a (Nikephoros). So we return 'N'.\n\n          So the function:\n\n          def outcome(a, b):\n              if a == b:\n                  return None\n              # Now, check if a wins: \n              if (a, b) == ('R','S') or (a, b) == ('S','P') or (a, b) == ('P','R'):\n                  return 'P'   # Polycarpus loses\n              else:\n                  return 'N'   # Nikephoros loses\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a dictionary or a more compact representation.\n\n        However, note: the condition for a win for a (Nikephoros) is the three cases above.\n\n   But wait, what if we do:\n\n        if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n\n        Then the other three are:\n            ('R','P'): a loses -> returns 'N'\n            ('R','R'): draw -> already handled by the first condition.\n            ('S','R'): a loses -> returns 'N'\n            ('S','S'): draw.\n            ('P','P'): draw.\n            ('P','S'): a wins? Actually, no: (P, S) is not in the list. But wait: \n                P vs S: \n                According to rules: Scissors beats Paper, so Paper (a) loses. So (P,S) is not a win for a, it's a loss for a. So we return 'N'. \n\n        But our condition for a win for a is only the three specific pairs.\n\n        So the code for outcome is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the game is played for n rounds, and we are counting the losses (each loss gives one red spot).\n\n   But note: the outcome function returns either 'N' (meaning Nikephoros loses) or 'P' (meaning Polycarpus loses). We don't count draws.\n\n   Then, the remainder part:\n\n        for r in range(rem):\n            x = r % L1\n            y = r % L2\n            res = outcome(A[x], B[y])\n            if res == 'N':\n                total_red_N += 1\n            elif res == 'P':\n                total_red_P += 1\n\n   But wait, the above loop for the remainder is O(rem) and rem can be up to 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note: n can be as large as 2e9, but T is the LCM of two numbers (each <=1000) so T is at most 1000000 (if L1=1000, L2=1000, then T=1000000). Then the remainder is always < T, so the loop runs at most 10^6 times, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: what if n is 2e9? Then the number of cycles is 2e9 // T, and T is 1000000, so cycles is 2000, which is an integer that we can store.\n\n   However, the above method does:\n\n        Step 1: Compute gcd and then T.\n        Step 2: Iterate over all x in [0, L1-1] and all y in [0, L2-1] (with condition) to count the cycle losses -> O(L1 * L2) = 1e6.\n        Step 3: Compute cycles = n // T, rem = n % T -> O(1)\n        Step 4: Multiply the cycle losses by cycles -> O(1)\n        Step 5: Iterate over the remainder rounds (at most 1e6) -> O(1e6)\n\n   Total operations: about 1e6 (cycle counting) + 1e6 (remainder) = 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   Let's test with the example: \n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        Here, n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        L1=3, L2=4, g = gcd(3,4)=1, T = 3*4//1 = 12.\n\n        Then we would compute the cycle of 12 rounds.\n\n        Then cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, rem = 7.\n\n        Then we simulate 7 rounds.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"3 2\".\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid computing the cycle by simulating the entire 7 rounds? But the example is small.\n\n        Let's do the 7 rounds manually (as in the problem):\n\n          Round0: A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw -> no loss.\n          Round1: A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> P vs S: S is not in the winning set for P? Actually, the winning set for P is only when the opponent is R (by the rule: Paper beats Rock). But here opponent is S, so the rule: Scissors beats Paper. So P (a) loses -> so Nikephoros loses (count_N +=1). So outcome returns 'N'.\n          Round2: A[2]='S', B[2]='P' -> S vs P: S beats P? Yes, because Scissors beats Paper. So the winner is S (Nikephoros) and the loser is Polycarpus -> returns 'P' (so count_P +=1).\n          Round3: A[0]='R', B[3]='P' -> R vs P: Paper beats Rock, so loser is R (Nikephoros) -> returns 'N' (count_N +=1).\n          Round4: A[1]='P', B[0]='R' -> P vs R: Paper beats Rock, so loser is R (Polycarpus) -> returns 'P' (count_P +=1).\n          Round5: A[2]='S', B[1]='S' -> draw -> no loss.\n          Round6: A[0]='R', B[2]='P' -> same as round3: 'N' (count_N +=1).\n\n        Then after 7 rounds:\n            count_N = 3, count_P = 2.\n\n        Now, in our simulation for the remainder (7 rounds) we get 3 and 2.\n\n        But wait, in our cycle counting for the entire cycle (12 rounds) we would have to count the outcomes for 12 rounds. However, we are not doing that because we break into cycles and remainder.\n\n        Our code for the remainder part (7 rounds) is:\n\n            for r in range(7):\n                x = r % 3\n                y = r % 4\n                a = A[x]; b = B[y]\n                res = outcome(a, b)\n\n            We did the above and got 3 for N and 2 for P.\n\n        So the code for the remainder part is correct.\n\n        But wait, why did we not use the cycle? Because the cycle was 12 and 7 < 12, so we did the remainder.\n\n        Now, consider another example: \n            Input: \n                5\n                RRRRRRRR\n                R\n\n            Output: \"0 0\"\n\n        Here, n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B=\"R\" (length 1)\n        g = gcd(8,1)=1, T=8*1//1=8.\n\n        Then cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, rem=5.\n\n        For each round r from 0 to 4:\n            A[r % 8] = 'R'\n            B[r % 1] = 'R'\n\n        So each round is draw. Therefore, no losses.\n\n        So the code returns 0 and 0.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input format is:\n\n        ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n   But wait, the second example input is:\n\n        5\n        RRRRRRRR\n        R\n\n   But in the problem statement, the example output is:\n\n        ['3 2', '0 0']\n\n   So we output \"3 2\" for the first and \"0 0\" for the second.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        import math\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A = input().strip()\n        B = input().strip()\n\n        L1 = len(A)\n        L2 = len(B)\n\n        # If n==0, then no rounds, but n>=1 so we don't worry.\n\n        # Compute gcd of L1 and L2\n        g = math.gcd(L1, L2)\n        T = L1 * L2 // g   # LCM\n\n        # Define outcome function\n        def outcome(a, b):\n            if a == b:\n                return None\n            # Check if a wins\n            if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                return 'P'\n            else:\n                return 'N'\n\n        # Count for one cycle: we are going to iterate over all pairs (x,y) that satisfy (x % g == y % g)\n        # But note: the condition for the pair (x,y) to appear is that there exists r such that r % L1 = x and r % L2 = y, which requires x % g = y % g (since g divides both L1 and L2).

And we are going to count each valid (x,y) once.\n\n        total_N_cycle = 0\n        total_P_cycle = 0\n\n        # We can iterate over x in range(L1) and y in range(L2) and check condition.\n        for x in range(L1):\n            r1 = x % g\n            for y in range(L2):\n                if y % g == r1:\n                    res = outcome(A[x], B[y])\n                    if res == 'N':\n                        total_N_cycle += 1\n                    elif res == 'P':\n                        total_P_cycle += 1\n\n        # But note: we are counting the entire cycle of T rounds. However, we can also compute the cycle by iterating over r from 0 to T-1, but that would be T iterations (which is 1e6) and we are already doing 1e6 (the double loop above) so we can use that.\n\n        cycles = n // T\n        rem = n % T\n\n        total_red_N = cycles * total_N_cycle\n        total_red_P = cycles * total_P_cycle\n\n        # Now, simulate the remaining 'rem' rounds\n        for r in range(rem):\n            x = r % L1\n            y = r % L2\n            a_char = A[x]\n            b_char = B[y]\n            res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n            if res == 'N':\n                total_red_N += 1\n            elif res == 'P':\n                total_red_P += 1\n\n        print(f\"{total_red_N} {total_red_P}\")\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        total_N_cycle and total_P_cycle: we are counting the entire cycle (12 rounds). But we don't need the entire cycle because n=7 is less than T=12. However, we computed the cycle counts for the 12 rounds and then multiplied by 0 (cycles=0) and then added the first 7 rounds.\n\n        But wait, the cycle counts (for the 12 rounds) are not used because cycles=0. Then we only simulate the 7 rounds.\n\n        How about if n=12? Then we use the cycle counts.\n\n        Example: n=12, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        Then we would simulate 12 rounds (the entire cycle) and then we can compare with the cycle counts.\n\n        We can compute the cycle counts by the double loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note: the 12 rounds are the same as the 7 rounds (which we know) plus 5 more rounds.\n\n        Round7: r=7, x=7%3=1, y=7%4=3 -> A[1]='P', B[3]='P' -> draw (already in the 7th round above, but wait: in the example above, we only did 7 rounds. Let me do round7 to round11.\n\n        Round7: r=7 -> (1,3): 'P' vs 'P' -> draw.\n        Round8: r=8 -> (2,0): A[2]='S', B[0]='R' -> S vs R: S beats R? No, Rock beats Scissors. So R beats S -> so the winner is R (Polycarpus) -> loser is Nikephoros -> 'N'\n        Round9: r=9 -> (0,1): A[0]='R', B[1]='S' -> R beats S -> 'P'\n        Round10: r=10 -> (1,2): A[1]='P', B[2]='P' -> draw.\n        Round11: r=11 -> (2,3): A[2]='S', B[3]='P' -> S beats P -> 'P'\n\n        So the entire 12 rounds:\n\n        Losses for Nikephoros: \n            Round1: N\n            Round3: P (so Polycarpus loses, not Nikephoros)\n            Round3: actually we had:\n                Round0: draw\n                Round1: N\n                Round2: P\n                Round3: N\n                Round4: P\n                Round5: draw\n                Round6: N\n                Round7: draw\n                Round8: N\n                Round9: P\n                Round10: draw\n                Round11: P\n\n            Count_N: rounds 1,3,6,8 -> 4\n            Count_P: rounds 2,4,9,11 -> 4\n\n        So the cycle counts (for T=12) are 4 and 4.\n\n        Then if n=12, we would output \"4 4\".\n\n        Now, if n=13, then cycles=1, rem=1.\n\n        Then total_red_N = 4, total_red_P = 4, then we add the 13th round:\n\n            r=12: x=12%3=0, y=12%4=0 -> A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw -> no change.\n\n        Then output \"4 4\".\n\n        But wait, the 13th round is the same as round0 (which was draw) so indeed no change.\n\n        Now, if n=14, then:\n\n            cycles=1, rem=2.\n\n            We add the first 2 rounds of the cycle (round0 and round1) again.\n\n            Round0: draw -> nothing.\n            Round1: N (so total_red_N becomes 5, total_red_P remains 4).\n\n            Output \"5 4\".\n\n        This seems correct.\n\n   However, note: the cycle T is the least common multiple, so the entire cycle is 12 rounds. The next 12 rounds (rounds 12 to 23) would be the same as rounds 0 to 11.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: is the condition (x % g == y % g) necessary for the existence of a round index r? Yes, because of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and the cycle T is the LCM. However, note that the double loop above iterates over every (x,y) with x in [0, L1-1] and y in [0, L2-1] and with x%g==y%g. But the total number of these pairs is T, and each round index r (from 0 to T-1) corresponds to a unique (x,y) with x=r%L1, y=r%L2, and these satisfy the congruence. Also, the map from r to (x,y) is bijective over the set of pairs (x,y) satisfying the congruence.\n\n   Therefore, the cycle counts are correctly computed.\n\n   Let's run the code for the example n=12, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\".\n\n        g = gcd(3,4)=1, T=12.\n\n        Then we iterate x from 0 to 2, and for each x, y from 0 to 3, and check y%1==x%1. Since 1 is modulus, and any number mod1 is 0, so condition is always true (unless x%1 is 0 and y%1 is 0, which is always true). So we iterate all 3*4=12 pairs.\n\n        Then we get the same as above: 4 for N and 4 for P.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition (x % g == y % g) is equivalent to x ≡ y (mod g). And since g=1, the condition is always true (because any two integers are congruent mod1). So we are iterating all pairs.\n\n   Now, if g>1, then we skip some pairs. For example, if A=\"RR\", B=\"SS\", then g=gcd(2,2)=2.\n\n        Condition: for a given x (0 or 1), residue = x % 2, then y must have the same residue mod2.\n\n        So for x=0 (even index): y must be even (0 or 2? but B has length2, so y=0,1 -> but wait, y in [0,1]: so y=0 (even) and y=1 (odd). So for x=0, we take y=0; for x=1, we take y=1.\n\n        Then we only consider (A[0],B[0]) and (A[1],B[1]). \n\n        But note: the round indices: \n            r=0: (0,0) -> (A[0], B[0])\n            r=1: (1,1) -> (A[1], B[1])\n            r=2: (0,0) -> (A[0], B[0]) again? \n\n        Wait, no: the cycle T = LCM(2,2)=2.\n\n        Then the rounds are:\n\n            Round0: (0,0)\n            Round1: (1,1)\n            Round2: (0,0) -> so the cycle is 2 rounds.\n\n        So the pairs (0,0) and (1,1) are the only ones that occur, and they occur periodically.\n\n        The condition (x % g == y % g) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a round index r (in the cycle of length T) that gives (x,y). \n\n        Therefore, we are correctly counting only the pairs that actually occur.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        import math\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()\n        B_str = input().strip()\n\n        L1 = len(A_str)\n        L2 = len(B_str)\n\n        # Edge case: n=0, but n>=1 so skip.\n        g = math.gcd(L1, L2)\n        T = L1 * L2 // g\n\n        # Define the outcome function\n        def outcome(a, b):\n            if a == b:\n                return None\n            if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P',",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently handling large `n` (up to 2·10^9) without iterating through each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, or scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The goal is to count how many times each player loses over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat cyclically, so the outcomes of rounds will also repeat in a periodic pattern. The period is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This allows us to compute the losses for one full period and then extrapolate for the remaining rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate the LCM of the sequence lengths to determine the period `T` of repeating outcomes.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one period, simulate the game and count the losses for both players.\n   - **Efficient Calculation**: Use the periodic nature to compute total losses by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of full cycles (`n // T`) and then simulate any remaining rounds (`n % T`).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    L1 = len(A_str)\n    L2 = len(B_str)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(L1, L2)\n    T = L1 * L2 // g\n    \n    def outcome(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return None\n        if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            return 'P'\n        else:\n            return 'N'\n    \n    total_N_cycle = 0\n    total_P_cycle = 0\n    \n    for x in range(L1):\n        r1 = x % g\n        for y in range(L2):\n            if y % g == r1:\n                res = outcome(A_str[x], B_str[y])\n                if res == 'N':\n                    total_N_cycle += 1\n                elif res == 'P':\n                    total_P_cycle += 1\n    \n    cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n    \n    total_red_N = cycles * total_N_cycle\n    total_red_P = cycles * total_P_cycle\n    \n    for r in range(rem):\n        x_index = r % L1\n        y_index = r % L2\n        a_char = A_str[x_index]\n        b_char = B_str[y_index]\n        res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        if res == 'N':\n            total_red_N += 1\n        elif res == 'P':\n            total_red_P += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_red_N} {total_red_P}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths is computed to determine the period `T` of repeating outcomes.\n3. **Outcome Function**: This function checks the result of each round based on the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. It returns `None` for a draw, `'N'` if Nikephoros loses, or `'P'` if Polycarpus loses.\n4. **Cycle Simulation**: The code iterates over all possible pairs of indices from the two sequences that satisfy the congruence condition (ensuring they appear in some round). For each valid pair, it counts the losses.\n5. **Total Losses Calculation**: The total losses are computed by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of full cycles (`cycles = n // T`). The remaining rounds (`rem = n % T`) are simulated individually to account for any partial cycles.\n6. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the game outcomes, avoiding the need for brute-force simulation of each round.",
