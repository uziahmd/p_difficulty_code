She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\n We need to leave only the tabs from l to r (inclusive). The cursor starts at `pos`.\n\n Operations allowed:\n  - Move the cursor left: from current tab i to max(i-1, a) [where a is the current minimum index of unclosed tabs]\n  - Move the cursor right: from current tab i to min(i+1, b) [where b is the current maximum index of unclosed tabs]\n  - Close all tabs to the left: then update a to be the current minimum index (which would be the cursor's current tab + 1? Actually, after closing, the segment becomes [current cursor, b] so a becomes the cursor's current value, and the cursor remains? But note: the problem says \"close all the tabs to the left\" meaning from [a, i-1] (if any) are closed. Similarly for right.\n\n However, note that the state is defined by the current set of unclosed tabs. Initially, the tabs are from 1 to n, and the cursor is at `pos`.\n\n We are allowed to close in two ways: left or right. After closing, the boundaries a and b change.\n\n The goal is to have only the segment [l, r] open.\n\n Let's think:\n\n There are two parts to close: \n   - The left part: from 1 to l-1 must be closed.\n   - The right part: from r+1 to n must be closed.\n\n We can do the operations in any order, but note that when we close one side, the other side might still be open and we can move the cursor accordingly.\n\n However, note: we don't necessarily have to close the entire left and right separately. We can also consider that we might close from the middle and then the two sides.\n\n But note: the problem says we can only close all the tabs to the left (from a to i-1) or all the tabs to the right (from i+1 to b). So we cannot arbitrarily choose which ones to close? Actually, we are forced to close contiguous segments from the cursor.\n\n How do we approach?\n\n Let me break down:\n\n Case 1: If the entire range [1, n] is already [l, r] (i.e., if l==1 and r==n) then we don't need to do anything.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we have to close two parts: the left part (if any) and the right part (if any).\n\n However, note: we might not need to close both. For example, if the required segment [l, r] is the entire set of tabs, then nothing to do.\n\n Also, note that the cursor starts at `pos`. The initial boundaries are [1, n].\n\n The operations:\n\n Option 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n Option 2: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n Option 3: Maybe we can combine by moving the cursor to one end and then close one side, then move to the other and close.\n\n But note: when we close, the boundaries change and the movement is constrained by the current boundaries.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b))\"\n\n And the closing operations: \"close all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b])\"\n\n So, if we are at a tab and we close the left, then the new a becomes i (the current tab) because we close from a to i-1, so the next a is i. Similarly, closing the right sets b to i.\n\n Now, note: we are only concerned with leaving [l, r]. This means we must close all tabs < l and all tabs > r.\n\n We can consider:\n\n  - If the cursor is initially in [l, r], then we don't need to worry about the tabs inside [l, r] being closed.\n\n Steps:\n\n  We have two boundaries to adjust: \n    left boundary: we want a = l (so that there are no tabs from 1 to l-1)\n    right boundary: we want b = r (so that there are no tabs from r+1 to n)\n\n How do we achieve that?\n\n Since we can close from the current cursor, we can:\n\n  1. Move the cursor to the left boundary (to l",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given tab position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target states of the tabs and cursor, then determining the optimal sequence of operations (moving the cursor or closing tabs) to reach the desired state.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Check**: If the entire range of tabs is already within [l, r], no operations are needed.\n2. **Left and Right Boundaries**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` (left boundary issue) and/or to the right of `r` (right boundary issue).\n3. **Cursor Position**: \n   - If the cursor is not within the target segment [l, r], move it to the nearest end of the segment (either `l` or `r`), which takes `abs(pos - l)` or `abs(pos - r)` moves.\n   - After moving, close the appropriate side (left or right) if necessary. Closing a side requires one operation per side.\n4. **Combining Operations**: The total operations include moving the cursor to the required positions and closing the tabs outside the segment. The minimal operations are derived by considering the closest boundaries to the cursor's starting position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_issue = (l > 1)\n    right_issue = (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_issue and not right_issue:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_issue and right_issue:\n        if pos < l:\n            seconds = (l - pos) + 1\n        else:\n            seconds = (pos - l) + (r - pos) + 1\n    elif left_issue:\n        seconds = max(0, l - pos) + 1\n    else:\n        seconds = max(0, pos - l) + 1\n        \n    print(seconds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the entire range of tabs (from 1 to n) is already within the target segment [l, r]. If so, it prints `0` because no operations are needed.\n2. **Boundary Issues**: The code checks if there are tabs to the left of `l` (left_issue) or to the right of `r` (right_issue).\n3. **Cursor Movement and Closure**:\n   - If both left and right boundaries need attention, the cursor must be moved to `l` if it's to the right of `l`, or directly to `l` and then to `r` if it's to the left of `l`. Each move and closure operation is counted.\n   - If only one boundary needs attention, the cursor is moved to the nearest end of the segment, and the corresponding side is closed.\n4. **Output**: The total number of operations (seconds) is printed, which includes moving the cursor and closing tabs as needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases by breaking down the problem into manageable parts and calculating the minimal operations required based on the cursor's initial position and the target segment boundaries.",
