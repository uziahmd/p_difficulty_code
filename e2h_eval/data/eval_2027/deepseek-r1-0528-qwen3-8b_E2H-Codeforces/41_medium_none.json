There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given: n, h, m and then m lines of [l, r, x]\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities, but note that the restrictions might overlap.\n\n Idea:\n We have to assign a height for each spot i (from 1 to n) in the range [0, h] such that for every restriction (l, r, x), \n the maximum height in [l, r] is at most x.\n\n We can think of it as: we want to maximize sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i^2) subject to a_i in [0, h] and for each restriction j: max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} a_i <= x_j.\n\n Since n and m are small (<=50), we can try to use DP with state that considers the restrictions. However, note that the restrictions are given by intervals and there might be up to 50 of them.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n Since the profit function is quadratic and separable, we want to set each a_i as high as possible. But the restrictions impose upper bounds on the maximum in some intervals.\n\n We can also note that the problem can be transformed into: what is the minimum \"damage\" (or how much we have to lower the heights) due to the restrictions?\n\n However, note that the restrictions are multiple and overlapping.\n\n Another idea: since n is at most 50, but h is at most 50, we cannot iterate over all 50^50 possibilities.\n\n Instead, we can use a different approach:\n\n Let's consider that without any restrictions, we would set every house to height h, and the profit would be n * (h**2).\n\n Now, each restriction (l, r, x) forces that the maximum in [l, r] is at most x. If x < h, then in that interval we cannot have h.\n\n Moreover, if we set a house to a value less than h, we lose (h^2 - a_i^2). But note: sometimes we might not need to lower every house in the interval to x, only the ones that are above the required maximum. However, the condition is that the entire interval must be <= x. So the highest house in the interval must be <= x.\n\n We can try to use an approach that considers the restrictions one by one and adjusts the maximum allowed in certain segments.\n\n Alternatively, we can use constraint propagation. But note that the constraints are independent and we have multiple.\n\n Since n and m are small, we can use state space of the restrictions? But 50 restrictions is too many for state.\n\n Another idea: we can sort the restrictions by their x (the maximum allowed) and then use the fact that if two restrictions overlap, the more restrictive one (with smaller x) must be satisfied.\n\n However, we can also think of using a greedy / linear programming relaxation? But we need exact solution.\n\n Insight: the problem is equivalent to having to set each house to a value between 0 and h, and then check that for every restriction (l, r, x) the maximum in [l, r] is <= x.\n\n We can use DP that goes from left to right and keeps track of the current maximum over some ranges? But the state might be too complex because we have to remember the maximum for every restriction's interval? That is too heavy.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the idea of \"minimum height\" that must be imposed by the restrictions. However, we are constrained by the restrictions and we want to maximize the profit.\n\n Since the profit is a convex function (quadratic increasing for [0, h]), we want to set as many houses as high as possible (to h) unless forced otherwise.\n\n We can think of the restrictions as imposing a maximum height on a set of intervals. Then, for each house, the actual maximum height we can assign is the minimum x among all restrictions that cover that house.\n\n However, note: it is not just the minimum x, because a restriction might force a whole interval to have maximum x, but if two restrictions overlap, the house must satisfy both. So for house i, let M_i = min{ x_j | i in [l_j, r_j] } (if there is no restriction covering i, then we can use h). But wait: is that correct?\n\n Consider: if we set house i to M_i, then does that satisfy all restrictions? Not exactly. Because a restriction might require that the maximum in its entire interval is at most x_j. If we set house i to M_i, then we must ensure that for every restriction j that covers house i, we have M_i <= x_j. But note: M_i is defined as the minimum x_j for which i is covered. Then indeed M_i <= x_j for every j that covers i. However, consider a restriction j that does not cover i, but covers some other house k. Then we don't care about house i for that restriction. But the catch: the same restriction j might cover several houses. The condition for restriction j is that the maximum over [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. If we set each house independently to the minimum x_j that covers it, then the maximum in the interval [l_j, r_j] is the maximum of the values we set for houses in [l_j, r_j]. And for a house k in [l_j, r_j], we set it to M_k = min{x_i' | k is in [l_i', r_i']}. But note: it is possible that M_k > x_j for some k in [l_j, r_j]? Actually, no, because if k is in [l_j, r_j], then by definition M_k <= x_j (since restriction j covers k). Therefore, the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is at most x_j.\n\n However, wait: what if we set a house to M_i, but M_i is the minimum x from all restrictions that cover i. Then in an interval [l_j, r_j], for each house k in [l_j, r_j] we have set it to at most x_j (because the restriction j covers k, so M_k <= x_j). Therefore, the entire interval [l_j, r_j] is set to values <= x_j, so the maximum is <= x_j.\n\n Therefore, one solution is: for each house i, set a_i = min( h, min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j )   [but note: if there is no restriction covering i, then we set it to h]\n\n However, is that optimal? We are setting each house to the minimum of h and the most restrictive (lowest) x from the restrictions that cover it. But note: we might be able to set some houses higher if they are only constrained by some restrictions and not others? Actually, no: because if a house is constrained by a restriction with x_j, then we cannot set it above x_j. So the maximum we can set is the minimum x_j from the covering restrictions (and not exceeding h). Therefore, this assignment is feasible.\n\n But is it optimal? Consider: we want to maximize the sum of squares. The square function is increasing and strictly convex. Therefore, we want to set as many houses as possible to the highest value allowed. In our assignment, we set house i to M_i (which is the minimum x_j among the restrictions that cover i, capped at h). However, note: if we set a house to M_i, then we are satisfying all restrictions that cover it. But is there a possibility to set a house higher than M_i? No, because if we set it higher, then a restriction that requires at most M_i (which is the smallest x_j covering the house) would be violated.\n\n Therefore, the assignment a_i = min(h, min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j) is the maximum height we can assign to house i without violating any restriction.\n\n Then the profit is sum_{i=1}^{n} (min(h, min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j))^2.\n\n But wait: what if the same house is covered by multiple restrictions with different x_j? Then we take the minimum. And that is the maximum height allowed for that house.\n\n However, consider: what if two restrictions do not cover the same house, but two adjacent houses are constrained differently and we can set one house higher than necessary because the adjacent one is set lower? \n\n Let me clarify: the condition for a restriction is only about the maximum in the entire interval. So if we set a house to a value higher than the minimum x_j of the restrictions covering it, then we break the condition of the restriction with the smallest x_j. Therefore, the above assignment is the maximum we can set for each house.\n\n However, note: the above reasoning seems to imply that we can set each house independently. But is that true?\n\n Example: \n   n=2, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,2] with x=5.\n   Then for house1: min(h, min_{covering restrictions} x_j) = min(10,5)=5.\n   Similarly for house2: 5.\n   Profit = 5^2 + 5^2 = 50.\n\n   What if we set house1 to 4 and house2 to 5? Then the maximum in [1,2] is 5 -> satisfies the restriction. \n   But the profit is 4^2+5^2 = 16+25=41, which is less than 50.\n\n   What if we set house1 to 5 and house2 to 4? Then the maximum is 5, and profit is 25+16=41.\n\n   What if we set house1 to 3 and house2 to 5? Then maximum is 5, and profit is 9+25=34.\n\n   So clearly, the independent assignment (each house set to the minimum of h and the minimum x_j covering it) gives the highest profit.\n\n Why is that? Because the square function is increasing and convex, so we want to set each house as high as possible. The independent constraint for each house is the minimum x_j from the restrictions that cover it (because if we set a house higher, then the restriction that has x_j equal to that minimum is broken). Therefore, we set each house to the minimum x_j (capped by h) and that is the maximum allowed.\n\n However, wait: consider two restrictions that do not overlap. For example, two separate intervals. Then we set each house to the minimum of the x_j's from the restrictions that cover it. But if a house is not covered by any restriction, we set it to h. This seems correct.\n\n But now consider overlapping restrictions. Example:\n\n   n=3, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n   Restriction2: [2,3] with x=7\n\n   House1: only covered by Restriction1 -> set to 5.\n   House2: covered by both -> set to min(5,7)=5.\n   House3: covered by Restriction2 -> set to 7.\n\n   Then the maximum in [1,2] is 5 (good) and in [2,3] is max(5,7)=7 (good). Profit = 5^2+5^2+7^2 = 25+25+49 = 99.\n\n   Is there a better assignment? Suppose we set house2 to 6. Then:\n        House1:5, House2:6, House3:7.\n        Restriction1: max(5,6)=6 -> violates x=5.\n        So we cannot set house2 to 6.\n\n   Alternatively, set house2 to 4? Then:\n        Restriction1: max(5,4)=5 -> ok.\n        Restriction2: max(4,7)=7 -> ok.\n        Profit: 25+16+49 = 90, which is worse.\n\n   So the independent assignment is indeed optimal.\n\n However, wait: what if we have two restrictions that are not conflicting? \n\n   n=3, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5\n   Restriction2: [2,3] with x=7\n\n   Then:\n        House1:5, House2:7, House3:7 -> profit=25+49+49=123.\n\n   What if we set house2 and house3 to 10? Then:\n        Restriction1: ok (only house1 is 5, and house2,3 are 10 doesn't matter for restriction1)\n        Restriction2: max(10,10)=10 -> violates x=7.\n\n   So we cannot set house2 and house3 to 10.\n\n   But note: the independent assignment sets house2 to min(10,7)=7 and house3 to 7.\n\n   However, is there a way to set house2 and house3 to a value greater than 7? No, because of restriction2.\n\n   Therefore, the independent assignment is optimal.\n\n But wait, consider a more complex example with two restrictions that together force a lower bound for the entire street?\n\n   Actually, the above examples suggest that the assignment for each house is the minimum x_j from the restrictions that cover it (capped by h). Then the entire assignment is feasible and maximizes the profit for each house independently.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute for each house i (from 1 to n) the minimum x_j among all restrictions j that cover i (i.e., l_j <= i <= r_j). If there is no restriction covering i, then the minimum is infinity (so we cap by h).\n\n   Step 2: For each house i, set a_i = min(h, min_x[i]), where min_x[i] is the minimum x_j from the covering restrictions (or a large number if none).\n\n   Step 3: Compute the profit as the sum of a_i^2 for i from 1 to n.\n\n However, wait: is this always valid? Consider that the condition for a restriction is that the entire interval must have maximum <= x_j. In our assignment, for a house i in [l_j, r_j] we set a_i <= x_j (because min_x[i] <= x_j, and then a_i = min(h, min_x[i]) <= x_j). Therefore, the maximum in the interval [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j.\n\n Therefore, the assignment is feasible.\n\n But wait, what if we have two restrictions that do not cover the same house, but together they force a lower maximum in an overlapping part? \n\n   Example: \n        n=3, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,3] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,3] with x=7\n\n   Then for each house, the minimum x_j from the two restrictions is 5. So we set all houses to 5.\n\n   This satisfies both restrictions (max=5 <=5 and <=7). And the profit is 3*25=75.\n\n   But note: the second restriction is less restrictive, so we could set the houses to 7? However, the first restriction forces 5, so we cannot.\n\n   So the above method is correct.\n\n However, note: what if there are no restrictions? Then for every house, min_x[i] is infinity, so we set each house to h, and the profit is n * h^2.\n\n But wait: the problem states that there is a global maximum height h. So even without restrictions, we cannot exceed h.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n But wait: the sample input:\n\n   Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n   Without restrictions, we would set [3,3,3] -> profit=3*(3^2)=27.\n\n   However, the example output is 14.\n\n   According to our method:\n\n        House1: covered by [1,1] (x=1) -> set to min(3,1)=1.\n        House2: covered by [2,2] (x=3) -> set to min(3,3)=3.\n        House3: covered by [3,3] (x=2) -> set to min(3,2)=2.\n\n        Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n   So that matches.\n\n   Another sample:\n\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        House1: no restriction -> 10\n        House2: covered by [2,3] (x=8) -> min(10,8)=8\n        House3: covered by [2,3] and [3,4] -> min(8,7)=7\n        House4: covered by [3,4] (x=7) -> 7\n\n        Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262.\n\n   So that matches.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read n, h, m\n   Initialize an array `min_height` of length n+1 (for houses 1 to n) with a large number (say, h+1 or more, but we know x_i in [0,h], so we can use h+1)\n\n   For each of the m restrictions (l, r, x):\n        For i from l to r:\n            min_height[i] = min(min_height[i], x)\n\n   Then, for i from 1 to n:\n        actual_height = min_height[i] if min_height[i] < h else h   [But wait: if min_height[i] is h, then we set to h. However, note: if min_height[i] is h, then we set to h. But if min_height[i] is greater than h? No, because x_i is at most h. So min_height[i] is in [0, h] or if no restriction then we started with h+1, but then we cap by h.\n\n   Actually, we should cap by h: because even if we get a min_height[i] that is, say, 5, then we set to 5. But if we get min_height[i] = h, then we set to h.\n\n   However, note: if we start with a large number (like h+1) for houses not covered, then we set those to h. But if we have a restriction with x = h, then min_height[i] becomes h, and then we set to h (which is correct).\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        For each house i, let m_i = minimum x_j for which i is in [l_j, r_j]. Then set a_i = min(m_i, h)\n\n   But note: if we set a house to h, that's the maximum. And if there is a restriction that requires a house to be at most x_j, then we set it to min(x_j, h). However, if x_j is greater than h, then we set to h (but the problem says x_i between 0 and h, so we don't have to worry).\n\n   Steps:\n\n      n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n      # Initialize an array for the minimum x for each house (index from 1 to n)\n      min_vals = [10**9] * (n+1)   # 1-indexed, index 0 unused\n\n      for _ in range(m):\n          data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          l, r, x = data\n          # Traverse from l to r and update the min_vals for each index\n          for i in range(l, r+1):\n              if x < min_vals[i]:\n                  min_vals[i] = x\n\n      total_profit = 0\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          height = min_vals[i] if min_vals[i] < 10**9 else h\n          if height > h:\n              height = h\n          # But note: we set min_vals[i] from the restrictions, and if there was no restriction, min_vals[i] remains 10**9, then we set to h.\n          # Alternatively, we can do: height = min(min_vals[i], h) if min_vals[i] != 10**9 else h, but actually we can just do:\n          #   height = min(min_vals[i], h)   if we consider that min_vals[i] is at least 0 and at most h (if covered) or 10**9 (if not covered). Then we can cap by h.\n          # Actually, we can simply do: height = min(min_vals[i], h)   but if min_vals[i] is 10**9, then min(10**9, h) = h (since h<=50, 10**9 is bigger). So we can write:\n\n          # Let's change: we don't need the if-else, we can do:\n          #   height = min(min_vals[i], h)   if we set min_vals[i] initially to 10**9 (which is > h) then for uncovered houses we get min(10**9, h)=h.\n\n      But wait: what if we have a restriction with x greater than h? The problem states that x_i is between 0 and h, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"0<=x_i<=h\", so we can rely on that.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply set for each house i:\n\n        height_i = min(min_vals[i], h)\n\n   Then, profit += height_i ** 2\n\n   But note: what if a house is covered by a restriction with x_i > h? Then we set to h. But the problem says x_i <= h, so it won't happen.\n\n   So the code:\n\n      n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n      min_vals = [10**9] * (n+1)\n\n      for i in range(m):\n          l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n          for j in range(l-1, r):   # if we use 0-indexing for our list, but the input is 1-indexed.\n              # But wait, the above loop was for 1-indexed indices from l to r. However, in the code above we used 1-indexed indices. Let me adjust.\n\n      Actually, we defined min_vals for indices 1..n (so index 1 to n). The input l, r are 1-indexed.\n\n      We can do:\n\n        for idx in range(n):\n            # We'll create a list for 0-indexed positions? Or we can use 1-indexed.\n\n      Alternatively, we can store the min_vals for 0-indexed:\n\n        min_vals = [10**9] * n   # 0-indexed for n houses\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            for j in range(l-1, r):   # j from l-1 to r-1\n                if x < min_vals[j]:\n                    min_vals[j] = x\n\n      Then, for each house j (0-indexed) we set:\n          height = min(min_vals[j], h)\n          profit += height * height\n\n   But wait, in the example input \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\":\n\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n\n        min_vals initially = [10**9, 10**9, 10**9]\n\n        First restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1 -> j from 0 to 0: min_vals[0] = min(10**9,1)=1.\n        Second: l=2, r=2, x=3 -> j from 1 to 1: min_vals[1]=min(10**9,3)=3.\n        Third: l=3, r=3, x=2 -> j from 2 to 2: min_vals[2]=min(10**9,2)=2.\n\n        Then, \n            house0: min(1,3)=1 -> 1^2=1\n            house1: min(3,3)=3 -> 3^2=9\n            house2: min(2,3)=2 -> 2^2=4\n        Total = 14.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the above nested loop for m (which is up to 50) and each restriction we do (r-l+1) which is at most 50, so worst-case 50*50 = 2500 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the restrictions are given and we have to read m lines. And n, m <=50, so worst-case 50*50=2500.\n\n   Code:\n\n      n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n      # Create an array for the n houses (0-indexed, indices 0 to n-1)\n      min_vals = [10**9] * n\n\n      for _ in range(m):\n          l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n          # Convert to 0-indexed: the house indices from l-1 to r-1\n          for j in range(l-1, r):\n              # j from l-1 to r-1 (inclusive)\n              if x < min_vals[j]:\n                  min_vals[j] = x\n\n      total = 0\n      for j in range(n):\n          height = min_vals[j]  # because if min_vals[j] is 10**9, then we set to h (since 10**9>h, but we can do: min(min_vals[j], h))\n          # Actually, we must cap by h. Even if min_vals[j] is 10**9 (meaning no restriction), we set to h.\n          # But if min_vals[j] is set from a restriction, then we take the minimum with h. However, the problem says x_i in [0,h] so min_vals[j] is at most h, but wait: we did min_vals[j] = x (which is <= h) so if we set by a restriction, then min_vals[j] <= h. Only when no restriction, we leave it as 10**9, then we cap.\n\n          # So we can do: height = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] <= h else h   OR just use min(min_vals[j], h)\n\n          # Since min_vals[j] is either from a restriction (so <= h) or 10**9 (then we set to h), we can use:\n          height_val = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] != 10**9 else h\n          # But wait: what if a restriction sets min_vals[j] to a value greater than h? The problem says x_i in [0,h] so it's not possible.\n\n          # Alternatively, we can simply do: height_val = min(min_vals[j], h)   because if min_vals[j] is 10**9, then min(10**9, h) = h.\n\n          # Let's use the latter for simplicity.\n\n      But wait: what if a restriction sets min_vals[j] to a value greater than h? The problem says x_i in [0,h] so we don't have to worry. So we can do:\n\n          height_val = min_vals[j]   # because we know min_vals[j] is either from a restriction (<=h) or 10**9 (then we use h) but we can use:\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n          height_val = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] != 10**9 else h\n\n      But note: we set min_vals[j] to 10**9 initially, and then we update only by x (which is <= h). So min_vals[j] will never be greater than h. Therefore, we can simply set:\n\n          height_val = min_vals[j]   # because if there was a restriction, then min_vals[j] <= h, and if not, we set to h.\n\n      But wait: no, because if there is no restriction, min_vals[j] is 10**9, and we don't want to use 10**9.\n\n      So we must cap by h. We can do:\n\n          height_val = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] != 10**9 else h\n\n      Or:\n\n          height_val = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] <= h else h   # but min_vals[j] from a restriction is <= h, so we don't need the else.\n\n      Actually, the condition for a house that is covered: min_vals[j] <= h (by the input). For an uncovered house: min_vals[j] = 10**9 (which is > h). So we can do:\n\n          if min_vals[j] == 10**9:\n              height_val = h\n          else:\n              height_val = min_vals[j]\n\n      But note: it's simpler to use:\n\n          height_val = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] != 10**9 else h\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the 10**9 by initializing to h+1 (then if min_vals[j] is set to x (<=h) then min_vals[j] <= h, and if not set, then it's h+1, so then we set to h). But then we have to compare with h+1.\n\n   However, since n, m are small, we can use the above.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the above reasoning assumed that the assignment for each house is independent. Is that really the case? \n\n   Consider: two restrictions that are not overlapping, but together they force a lower maximum in a way that affects adjacent houses? \n\n   Actually, the condition for each restriction is local to the interval. The independent assignment does not consider interactions between houses. However, note that the square function is separable and the constraints are independent per house (in the sense that the constraint for a house is the minimum x_j from the restrictions covering it). And because the square function is increasing and convex, we want to set each house as high as possible. The independent assignment sets each house to the maximum allowed by all covering restrictions, and that is the best we can do for that house without violating any restriction. \n\n   Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n   However, note: what if we have two restrictions that are not overlapping, and we set the houses in the first interval to the minimum x of that interval, and the houses in the second interval to the minimum x of that interval, and the houses in between to h. Then the entire assignment is feasible and we get the maximum profit.\n\n   Therefore, we output the sum of squares.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the example in the problem statement.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n   We already verified these.\n\n   One more corner: no restrictions.\n\n        Input: \"1 10 0\"\n\n        Then we set the house to 10, profit=100.\n\n   Another corner: multiple restrictions that cover the same house, but the minimum x is taken.\n\n        Input: \"1 10 2\\n1 1 5\\n1 1 7\"\n\n        Then min_vals[0] becomes 5 (from the two restrictions, the minimum is 5). Then set to 5, profit=25.\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the restrictions are given in the input. We must read m restrictions.\n\n   Code:\n\n      n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n      min_vals = [10**9] * n   # 0-indexed list for n houses\n\n      for i in range(m):\n          data = input().split()\n          if not data:\n              continue\n          l = int(data[0])\n          r = int(data[1])\n          x = int(data[2])\n          # Adjust l, r to 0-indexed: the house indices from l-1 to r-1\n          for j in range(l-1, r):\n              # j from l-1 to r-1 (inclusive)\n              if x < min_vals[j]:\n                  min_vals[j] = x\n\n      total = 0\n      for j in range(n):\n          if min_vals[j] == 10**9:\n              total += h*h\n          else:\n              total += min_vals[j]*min_vals[j]\n\n      print(total)\n\n   But wait, the above uses 10**9. We can also use a variable for the initial value, but 10**9 is safe because h<=50.\n\n   However, note: the problem says x_i in [0, h] and h<=50, so we can use 51 as the initial value (since x_i <= h, so if we set initial to 51, then we can do: if min_vals[j] > h: then set to h, but wait: we are updating by x, and x<=h, so we can initialize to h+1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        min_vals = [h+1] * n   # because x is at most h, so if we set to h+1, then we know that if after processing we have min_vals[j] <= h, then we use that, else (if still h+1) then we use h.\n\n        Then, for each house j, the actual height is min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] <= h else h? But wait, we set min_vals[j] to the minimum x from the restrictions, and x<=h, so min_vals[j] is at most h. Then we don't need the else.\n\n        Actually, no: if we set initial to h+1, then if there is no restriction, we want to set to h. But if we set min_vals[j] to the minimum of the restrictions (if any) and if there is none, then min_vals[j] is still h+1. Then we have to cap by h.\n\n        We can do: height_val = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] <= h else h   but then if min_vals[j] is h+1, we set to h. But note: we set min_vals[j] to the minimum of the x's (which are <= h) and we started with h+1, so min_vals[j] is either an x (<=h) or h+1 (if no restriction). Then:\n\n            height_val = min_vals[j]   if min_vals[j] <= h, else h.\n\n        But wait, if min_vals[j] is an x (<=h) then we use that, else if it's h+1 then use h.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: height_val = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] != h+1 else h.\n\n        However, note: we are updating by x (which is <=h) and we set min_vals[j] = min(initial, x). So if we set initial to h+1, then min_vals[j] will be the minimum of h+1 and the x's. So if there is at least one restriction, then min_vals[j] becomes the minimum x (which is <=h) and if not, then remains h+1.\n\n        Then we can do:\n\n            height_val = min_vals[j] if min_vals[j] != h+1 else h\n\n        But wait: what if a restriction sets min_vals[j] to h? Then we use h, which is correct.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            height_val = min_vals[j]   # because if there is a restriction, min_vals[j] is <= h, and if not, then min_vals[j] is h+1 (which is > h) and then we cap to h.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if min_vals[j] == h+1:\n                total += h*h\n            else:\n                total += min_vals[j]*min_vals[j]\n\n   Which is simpler.\n\n   Let me choose the initialization to h+1.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        min_vals = [h+1] * n   # each element is initially h+1\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            for j in range(l-1, r):   # j from l-1 to r-1\n                if x < min_vals[j]:\n                    min_vals[j] = x\n\n        total = 0\n        for j in range(n):\n            if min_vals[j] == h+1:\n                total += h*h\n            else:\n                total += min_vals[j]*min_vals[j]\n\n        print(total)\n\n   Let's test with the first example:\n\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        min_vals = [4,4,4]   (because h+1=4)\n\n        First restriction: [1,1] x=1 -> update index0: 1<4 -> set to 1.\n        Second: [2,2] x=3 -> update index1: 3<4 -> set to 3.\n        Third: [3,3] x=2 -> update index2: 2<4 -> set to 2.\n\n        Then: \n            index0: 1 -> 1^",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with specific zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height \\( h \\), and the profit is the sum of the squares of the heights of all houses. The zoning restrictions specify that the tallest house in certain intervals must not exceed a specified height. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to assign heights to each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied (i.e., the maximum height in any specified interval does not exceed the given restriction) while maximizing the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the heights.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive zoning restriction that includes it. This is because any house included in a restriction must not exceed the smallest maximum height specified in any overlapping restriction.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Initialize an array to keep track of the minimum allowable height for each house. Start with a value higher than the maximum allowed height \\( h \\).\n   - For each zoning restriction, update the corresponding houses' minimum allowable heights to the smaller value if the restriction's height is more restrictive.\n   - After processing all restrictions, for each house, if no restriction applies, its height is set to \\( h \\); otherwise, it is set to the most restrictive height found.\n   - Calculate the total profit by summing the squares of the heights of all houses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmin_vals = [h + 1] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for j in range(l - 1, r):\n        if x < min_vals[j]:\n            min_vals[j] = x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor j in range(n):\n    if min_vals[j] == h + 1:\n        total += h * h\n    else:\n        total += min_vals[j] * min_vals[j]\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the number of houses \\( n \\), the maximum allowable height \\( h \\), and the number of restrictions \\( m \\). We initialize an array `min_vals` with \\( h + 1 \\) to represent that initially, no restrictions apply, so each house can be built up to height \\( h \\).\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, we update the `min_vals` array for the houses within the specified interval. If the restriction's height \\( x \\) is more restrictive (smaller) than the current value, we update the corresponding house's entry.\n3. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, we iterate over each house. If no restriction was applied (indicated by `min_vals[j]` still being \\( h + 1 \\)), the house's height is set to \\( h \\). Otherwise, the height is the most restrictive value found. The profit is calculated by summing the squares of these heights.\n4. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all zoning restrictions are satisfied while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of quadratic functions and careful handling of overlapping constraints.",
