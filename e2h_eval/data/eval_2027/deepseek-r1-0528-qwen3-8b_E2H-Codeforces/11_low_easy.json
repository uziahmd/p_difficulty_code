A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total milliliters of drink: total_drink = k * l\n    Each toast requires nl milliliters. So, the number of toasts from drink = total_drink // nl\n\n 2. Calculate the total lime slices: total_lime_slices = c * d\n    Each toast requires 1 slice. So, the number of toasts from lime = total_lime_slices\n\n 3. Calculate the salt requirement: Each toast requires np grams. The available salt is p grams.\n    So, the number of toasts from salt = p // np\n\n 4. The limiting factor is the minimum of these three values.\n\n 5. However, note that each friend must have the same amount and they are making toasts together.\n    But the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for each toast they make.\n\n    Actually, the problem states: \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n    Let T be the total number of toasts. Then:\n      - Total drink needed: T * nl\n      - Total lime slices needed: T (each toast uses one slice)\n      - Total salt needed: T * np\n\n    But also, the total toasts must be such that the drink, lime, and salt are sufficient.\n\n    However, note that the condition is per toast: so we can compute the maximum T as:\n\n        T_drink = (k * l) // nl\n        T_lime = (c * d)\n        T_salt = p // np\n\n    Then the maximum T is the minimum of T_drink, T_lime, T_salt.\n\n    But wait: the problem says \"each friend can make [number] toasts\", meaning that the entire group is making toasts together and each friend gets the same number.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not say that each toast is shared by one friend. It says each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice, and np grams for each toast they make.\n\n    This means that if there are n friends and they are making t toasts per friend, then the total toasts is n * t.\n\n    But wait, let me read again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    So for one toast per friend, we need n * nl milliliters, n * 1 slice, and n * np grams.\n\n    Alternatively, if we think in terms of total toasts (let T be the total number of toasts), then:\n\n        - Each toast uses nl milliliters -> total drink used = T * nl\n        - Each toast uses 1 lime slice -> total lime slices used = T\n        - Each toast uses np grams of salt -> total salt used = T * np\n\n    But note: the condition is that each friend must drink the same amount. Since each toast is associated with one friend? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... for each toast\". This implies that if a friend makes one toast, then they use nl, one slice, and np. And if the entire group makes T_total toasts, then the distribution is that some friends might make more than others? \n\n    However, the problem states: \"provided they all drink the same amount.\" So each friend must make the same number of toasts. Let that number be x.\n\n    Then total toasts T_total = n * x.\n\n    Conditions:\n        n * x * nl <= k * l   => x <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n        n * x <= c*d          => x <= (c*d) / n\n        n * x * np <= p       => x <= p / (n*np)\n\n    Therefore, the maximum x (toasts per friend) is the floor of the minimum of:\n\n        (k*l) / (n*nl)   [drink constraint per friend]\n        (c*d) / n        [lime constraint per friend]\n        p / (n*np)       [salt constraint per friend]\n\n    But wait, the example:\n\n        Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n        Here: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        Using the above method:\n\n        Drink constraint: (4*5) / (3*3) = 20 / 9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor 2\n        Lime constraint: (10*8) / 3 = 8",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to ensure that all friends drink the same amount and that the resources (drink, lime slices, and salt) are sufficient for the total number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt. The constraints are:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters, so the maximum number of toasts from the drink is `(k * l) // nl`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice, so the maximum number of toasts from limes is `c * d`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `np` grams, so the maximum number of toasts from salt is `p // np`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The limiting factor is the smallest of these three values. However, since each friend must make the same number of toasts, we need to find the minimum value among the three constraints and then divide it by the number of friends, taking the floor value.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the three constraints, finding the minimum among them, and then dividing by the number of friends (using integer division) to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n    max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n    max_toasts_salt = p // np\n    \n    min_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    \n    result = min_toasts // n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input consists of eight integers separated by spaces, which are read and parsed into individual variables.\n2. **Resource Calculation**: \n   - **Total Drink**: Calculated as the product of the number of bottles (`k`) and the volume per bottle (`l`).\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Calculated as the product of the number of limes (`c`) and the number of slices per lime (`d`).\n3. **Constraint Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts possible with the available drink is found by integer division of the total drink by the drink required per toast (`nl`).\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts possible with the available lime slices is simply the total number of slices.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts possible with the available salt is found by integer division of the total salt by the salt required per toast (`np`).\n4. **Determine Minimum Toasts**: The smallest value among the three constraints determines the maximum number of toasts that can be made overall.\n5. **Calculate Per Friend Toasts**: The result is obtained by dividing the minimum number of toasts by the number of friends (`n`), again using integer division to ensure whole numbers.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures that each friend can make an equal number of toasts without exceeding any resource limits.",
