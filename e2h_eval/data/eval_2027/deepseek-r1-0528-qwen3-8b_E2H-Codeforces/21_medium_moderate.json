The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Separate the chests into two groups: even and odd.\n    - Even group: chests with even a_i\n    - Odd group: chests with odd a_i\n\n 2. Similarly, separate the keys into two groups: even and odd.\n    - Even keys: keys with even b_j\n    - Odd keys: keys with odd b_j\n\n 3. Note: \n    - An even chest requires an odd key (because even + odd = odd)\n    - An odd chest requires an even key (because odd + even = odd)\n\n 4. So, we can form two bipartite graphs:\n    - The even chests can only be opened by odd keys.\n    - The odd chests can only be opened by even keys.\n\n 5. Therefore, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of:\n    - The maximum matching from even chests to odd keys (but note: we are not building a graph, just counting)\n    - The maximum matching from odd chests to even keys.\n\n However, note that we have two independent sets of constraints. Since the keys are limited and each key can be used only once, we can:\n\n Let:\n   E_c = number of even chests\n   O_c = number of odd chests\n\n   E_k = number of even keys\n   O_k = number of odd keys\n\n But note: \n   - To open an even chest, we need an odd key. The total available odd keys is O_k, but we can only use each once.\n   - Similarly, for odd chests, we need even keys (E_k).\n\n However, the catch: we cannot use the same key twice. But note that the two sets of chests (even and odd) require two different kinds of keys (odd and even respectively). Therefore, the two sets are independent.\n\n But wait: what if there are more even chests than odd keys? Then we can open at most O_k even chests. Similarly, for odd chests, we can open at most E_k odd chests.\n\n However, there is no direct interaction between even chests and odd keys for odd chests and even keys because the keys are of different types.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use all keys or all chests. We want the maximum matching.\n\n So, the answer is simply the minimum of (number of even chests, number of odd keys) plus the minimum of (number of odd chests, number of even keys)?\n\n Actually, let's think:\n\n For even chests: we can open at most min(E_c, O_k) chests (since we have E_c even chests and O_k odd keys, and each even chest requires one odd key).\n For odd chests: we can open at most min(O_c, E_k) chests.\n\n However, wait: is that correct? Actually, we can use any odd key for any even chest, so we are limited by the minimum of the two. Similarly for odd chests.\n\n But note: the entire set of keys is partitioned into even and odd. And the entire set of chests is partitioned into even and odd.\n\n Therefore, the maximum matching is the sum of these two minima.\n\n However, let me test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4\n        Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> \n          9: odd, 14: even, 6: even, 2: even, 11: odd\n        Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> \n          8: even, 4: even, 7: odd, 20: even\n\n        Even chests: 3 (14,6,2)\n        Odd chests: 2 (9,11)\n\n        Even keys: 3 (8,4,20)\n        Odd keys: 1 (7)\n\n        Then by our formula:\n          Even chests can be matched with odd keys: min(3,1) = 1\n          Odd chests can be matched with even keys: min(2,3) = 2\n          Total = 3 -> which matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E_c=5, O_c=0\n        Keys: [5] -> odd -> E_k=0, O_k=1\n\n        Then: \n          Even chests: min(5,1)=1\n          Odd chests: min(0,0)=0\n          Total=1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n        Chests: [10] -> even -> E_c=1, O_c=0\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0\n\n        Then:\n          Even chests: min(1,0)=0\n          Odd chests: min(0,4)=0\n          Total=0 -> matches.\n\n So the solution is:\n\n   Read n, m\n   Read list of n integers for chests\n   Read list of m integers for keys\n\n   Count even_chests = count of even numbers in chests\n   Count odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n   Count even_keys = count of even numbers in keys\n   Count odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   Then, answer = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n However, wait: is that always true?\n\n Let me consider another example:\n\n Example 4:\n   Chests: [1,2] -> even_chests=1, odd_chests=1\n   Keys: [2,3] -> even_keys=1, odd_keys=1\n\n   Then by our formula: min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n   But let's check: \n        Chest 1 (odd) requires an even key -> we have one even key (2) -> use it for chest1.\n        Chest 2 (even) requires an odd key -> we have one odd key (3) -> use it for chest2.\n\n   So 2 is correct.\n\n Example 5: \n   What if we have more keys of the required type than chests? \n   Example: \n        Chests: [1,2] (even_chests=1, odd_chests=1)\n        Keys: [2,3,4] -> even_keys=2, odd_keys=1\n\n        Then: min(1,1) + min(1,2) = 1+1 = 2 -> correct.\n\n Example 6: \n   What if we have more chests of a type than the opposite key?\n        Chests: [1,2,3] -> even_chests=1, odd_chests=2\n        Keys: [2,4] -> even_keys=2, odd_keys=0\n\n        Then: min(1,0) + min(2,2) = 0+2 = 2.\n\n        Check: \n          Chest1 (odd) requires even key -> we have two even keys, so we can use one for chest1.\n          Chest2 (even) requires odd key -> no odd key, so cannot open.\n          Chest3 (odd) requires even key -> we have one even key left (after using one for chest1) -> so we can open chest3? \n          But wait: we have two even keys, so we can use two even keys for two odd chests? \n\n        Actually, the condition for even chest is odd key, so the even keys are used for odd chests.\n\n        So: \n          Chest1 (odd) -> needs even key: use key2 (even)\n          Chest3 (odd) -> needs even key: use key4 (even)\n          Chest2 (even) -> needs odd key: none.\n\n        So we open 2 chests (chest1 and chest3). \n\n        But according to our formula: \n          even_chests = 1 -> requires odd_keys (0 available) -> 0\n          odd_chests = 2 -> requires even_keys (2 available) -> min(2,2)=2\n          total=2.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n However, note that the above reasoning is based on the fact that:\n   - Each even chest requires an odd key, and we can assign any odd key to any even chest (so the limiting factor is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys).\n   - Similarly, each odd chest requires an even key, and the limiting factor is the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\n But note: the same key cannot be used twice. However, because we are only considering two independent bipartitions (even chests and odd keys, and odd chests and even keys), and there is no overlap in the keys (even keys are only for odd chests and odd keys are only for even chests), we can independently take the minima.\n\n Therefore, code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   chests = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   keys = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chest = 0\n   for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n\n   odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n   even_key = 0\n   for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n\n   odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n   print(result)\n\n Let me run the provided examples through this:\n\n Example 1: \n   n=5, m=4\n   chests = [9,14,6,2,11]\n        even_chest: 14,6,2 -> 3; odd_chest: 9,11 -> 2\n   keys = [8,4,7,20]\n        even_key: 8,4,20 -> 3; odd_key: 7 -> 1\n   result = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1+2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n Example 2:\n   n=5, m=1\n   chests = [2,4,6,8,10] -> even_chest=5, odd_chest=0\n   keys = [5] -> even_key=0, odd_key=1\n   result = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1+0 = 1 -> correct.\n\n Example 3:\n   n=1, m=4\n   chests = [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n   keys = [20,30,40,50] -> even_key=4, odd_key=0\n   result = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0+0 = 0 -> correct.\n\n So the code is as below.\n\n However, note: the problem says the numbers can be up to 10^9, but modulo 2 is safe.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to one being even and the other being odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests with keys such that each chest-key pair meets the condition (even + odd) ≡ 1 mod 2. This means even-numbered chests must be paired with odd-numbered keys, and vice versa.\n2. **Intuition**: By categorizing both chests and keys into even and odd groups, we can independently determine the maximum number of valid pairs. The solution involves counting how many even and odd chests and keys there are, then finding the minimum between the number of even chests and odd keys, and similarly for odd chests and even keys. The sum of these two minima gives the answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible pairs as the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints (up to 10^5 elements).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Categorizing Chests and Keys**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking each number's parity.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Pairs**: The solution computes the maximum number of chests that can be opened by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys. The sum of these two values gives the answer.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages simple counting and arithmetic operations to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
