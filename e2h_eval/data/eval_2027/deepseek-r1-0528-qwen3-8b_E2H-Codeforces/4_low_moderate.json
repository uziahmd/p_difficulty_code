The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: \n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   string A (Nikephoros' sequence) and string B (Polycarpus' sequence)\n\n Since the sequences are cyclic, we can think of the i-th round (0-indexed) as:\n   a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b = B[i % len(B)]\n\n But note: n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the n rounds into complete cycles of the two sequences. However, note that the two sequences have different lengths.\n\n Let L1 = len(A), L2 = len(B). The combined cycle would be LCM(L1, L2) but since L1, L2 <= 1000, the LCM might be too large to iterate over (because 1000*1000 is 1e6, which is acceptable for one cycle, but note: the LCM could be as large as 1e6, and n is up to 2e9, so we cannot simulate the entire cycle if we do it by LCM?).\n\n Alternatively, we can count the wins/losses per round without iterating over every round.\n\n However, note: in each round, we are comparing two fixed characters from their respective sequences. The outcome is determined by the pair (a_i, b_i).\n\n There are three outcomes: \n   Draw: when a_i == b_i -> no red spot.\n   Win for Nikephoros: when (a_i, b_i) is one of (R,S), (S,P), (P,R)\n   Win for Polycarpus: when (a_i, b_i) is one of (S,R), (P,S), (R,P)\n\n But note: the problem states that the loser gets a red spot. So:\n   If Nikephoros loses, then Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n   If Polycarpus loses, then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n So we need to count:\n   For each round i (from 0 to n-1):\n        a = A[i % L1]\n        b = B[i % L2]\n\n        if a == b: nothing happens.\n        else:\n            if (a,b) is a win for Nikephoros (so loss for Polycarpus) then Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n            if (a,b) is a win for Polycarpus (so loss for Nikephororos) then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n But note: the rules are:\n    Rock beats Scissors -> (R, S) is win for Nikephoros (if a=R, b=S)\n    Scissors beats Paper -> (S, P) is win for Nikephoros (if a=S, b=P)\n    Paper beats Rock -> (P, R) is win for Nikephoros (if a=P, b=R)\n\n    Conversely, the wins for Polycarpus are:\n        (S, R): Scissors vs Rock -> Polycarpus wins (since Scissors beats Paper? Wait, let me clarify:\n\n    Actually, according to the rules:\n        Rock beats Scissors -> so if Nikephoros shows Rock and Polycarpus shows Scissors, then Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses).\n        Scissors beats Paper -> so if Nikephoros shows Scissors and Polycarpus shows Paper, then Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses).\n        Paper beats Rock -> so if Nikephoros shows Paper and Polycarpus shows Rock, then Nikephoros wins (Polycarpus loses).\n\n    Then the reverse (wins for Polycarpus) are:\n        (R, S): wait, no. The rule is symmetric? Actually, the rules are such that the same set of comparisons apply in reverse for Polycarpus.\n\n    Alternatively, we can define:\n        win_nike(a, b): \n            (a=='R' and b=='S') or (a=='S' and b=='P') or (a=='P' and b=='R')\n\n        Similarly, win_poly(a, b) is the negation of win_nike(a, b) OR we can define by the same rules but with roles reversed?\n\n    Actually, we can also note: the outcome is determined by the pair (a, b). The rules are cyclic: R->S->P->R.\n\n    We can also note: if we consider the cycle: R beats S, S beats P, P beats R.\n\n    Then for a given (a, b):\n        if a beats b -> then Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses: Polycarpus gets a red spot)\n        else if b beats a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and each round's outcome depends on the current move in their respective sequences. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2 billion, a brute-force approach is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodicity of the sequences to compute the results efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players using cyclic sequences of moves. Each round's outcome is determined by comparing the current moves from each player's sequence. The key observation is that the sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Insight**: The combined cycle of both sequences repeats every `lcm(m, k)` rounds. However, since `m` and `k` are at most 1000, the least common multiple (LCM) could be up to 1,000,000, which is manageable. We can simulate one full cycle of the combined sequence and then use division and modulus to extend the result to `n` rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Cycle Detection**: Identify the cycle length by finding the LCM of the lengths of both sequences.\n   - **Simulation**: For each position within one cycle, determine the outcome of the round (win, loss, or draw) and count the red spots accordingly.\n   - **Efficient Calculation**: Use the cycle length to break down `n` rounds into complete cycles and a partial cycle, then sum the results from these parts.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each position in the combined cycle once, which is O(LCM(m, k)). Given that `m` and `k` are up to 1000, the LCM is at most 1,000,000, making this approach feasible even for large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    total_red_nike = 0\n    total_red_poly = 0\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    cycle_length = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    complete_cycles = n // cycle_length\n    remainder_rounds = n % cycle_length\n    \n    # Precompute outcomes for all positions in one cycle\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n           (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            total_red_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_red_nike += 1\n            \n    total_red_nike *= complete_cycles\n    total_red_poly *= complete_cycles\n    \n    for i in range(remainder_rounds):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n           (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            total_red_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_red_nike += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{total_red_nike} {total_red_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The combined cycle length is computed as the LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B`.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each position in one full cycle, the code checks the outcome of the round (whether it's a win for Nikephoros, a win for Polycarpus, or a draw) and updates the counts of red spots accordingly.\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. It calculates the total red spots by multiplying the results from one cycle by the number of complete cycles and then processes the remaining rounds individually.\n5. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures optimal performance by minimizing the number of operations through cycle detection and efficient computation, making it suitable for large values of `n`.",
