Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (each between 1 and 10) so we can use combinatorial methods.\n\n The problem is to check if there exists a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between R rebels (spaceships) and B bases such that:\n   - Each base gets one spaceship and each spaceship gets one base.\n   - The straight lines connecting the base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect (except at endpoints).\n\n However, note: the condition is that any two (straight) paths do not intersect. This is equivalent to saying that the set of segments (from base to assigned spaceship) must be non-crossing.\n\n But note: the bases and spaceships are distinct points, and we are allowed to assign any base to any spaceship.\n\n We have two sets of points: \n   Set S: R rebels (spaceships)\n   Set Bases: B bases\n\n Conditions:\n   1. We need a bijection (matching) from S to Bases (so R must equal B? Actually, the input says: first line has two integers R and B, then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases. And the example: first input is \"3 3\", second input is \"2 1\". \n\n Wait: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" with every base having exactly one guardian and each spaceship having exactly one base. So it requires a perfect matching. Therefore, we must have R = B, because the matching is bijective.\n\n But note: the example input \"2 1\" leads to output \"No\", which implies that when R != B, we cannot have a perfect matching. However, the problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This means that the number of bases must equal the number of spaceships (otherwise, one base would be without a guardian or vice versa). \n\n But wait: the problem statement says: \"the assignment is a perfect matching\", which typically requires the two sets to be of the same size.\n\n So step 1: Check if R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n\n However, the problem does not explicitly say that R must equal B, but the definition of perfect matching requires |S| = |Bases|. So if R != B, then no matching exists.\n\n But note: the example input format: \n   First line: R, B\n   Then R lines for rebels\n   Then B lines for bases\n\n Example 1: \"3 3\" -> Yes\n Example 2: \"2 1\" -> No\n\n So we can assume that if R != B, we output 'No'. \n\n However, let's read the problem again: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This is a bipartite matching with |S| = |Bases| for a perfect matching. So indeed, if R != B, we cannot have a perfect matching.\n\n But wait: what if R > B? Then we cannot assign each spaceship to a base because there are more spaceships than bases. Similarly, if R < B, then we cannot assign each base to a spaceship. So we require R == B.\n\n Therefore, if R != B, we output 'No'.\n\n Now, assuming R == B, we need to check if there exists a non-crossing matching.\n\n How to check for non-crossing matching?\n\n Note: The matching is a set of segments (from a base to a rebel) and they must not cross (except at endpoints). \n\n Observation: In the plane, we can fix an order of the bases and the rebels. One common way to check for non-crossing matchings is to consider a rotation system or to use a recursive splitting.\n\n However, note that the points are in general position (no three points collinear). \n\n Idea: We can try to find a matching that is non-crossing. But the problem is small (R, B up to 10, so maximum 10 points). We can try to use a combinatorial method.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if R == B. If not, return 'No'.\n 2. We have two sets: S (rebels) and Bases (bases). We can combine them into one set and then sort by x-coordinate (or y-coordinate) to get an order.\n\n However, note: the condition is about the segments (base to rebel) not crossing. A known fact is that if we fix an ordering of the points (say, by x-coordinate) and then connect the i-th point in one set to the i-th point in the other set (after sorting both sets independently and then matching in order), then the matching is non-crossing.\n\n But wait: is that always true? Let me test:\n\n Example: \n   Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n   Bases: [(-2,1), (0,3)]\n\n If we sort both by x-coordinate:\n\n   Rebels: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n   Bases: [ (-2,1), (0,3) ]\n\n Then matching: \n   Base (-2,1) to Rebel (0,0): segment from (-2,1) to (0,0)\n   Base (0,3) to Rebel (2,0): segment from (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n Now, do these segments cross?\n   Segment1: from (-2,1) to (0,0)\n   Segment2: from (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n These two segments do not share endpoints and we can check: \n   They form two lines: \n      Line1: from (-2,1) to (0,0): parametric equations: \n          x = -2 + 2t, y = 1 - t, for t in [0,1] -> but wait, let's use the standard way.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the orientation test: two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) cross if the points of one segment lie in different half-planes defined by the other segment.\n\n   For segment1: (-2,1) to (0,0) and segment2: (0,3) to (2,0):\n\n   Consider the two endpoints of segment2 relative to segment1:\n      Point (0,3): \n        Vector from (-2,1) to (0,3): (2,2)\n        Vector from (-2,1) to (0,0): (2,-1)\n        Cross product: (2)(-1) - (2)(2) = -2 -4 = -6 <0.\n\n      Point (2,0):\n        Vector from (-2,1) to (2,0): (4,-1)\n        Vector from (-2,1) to (0,0): (2,-1)\n        Cross product: (2)(-1) - (4)(-1) = -2 + 4 = 2 >0.\n\n   So (0,3) is on one side and (2,0) on the other. Then the two segments would cross.\n\n   Therefore, the matching in sorted order by x-coordinate does cross.\n\n So the idea of matching in sorted order by x-coordinate might not work.\n\n Alternative idea: \n\n We can use the following property: \n   In a set of non-crossing segments, the entire set must be planar. Moreover, we can use a recursive approach (divide and conquer) by considering the convex hull or by ordering the points appropriately.\n\n Another known idea: \n   We can fix a direction (like by angle from a reference point) and then connect the i-th point in one set to the i-th point in the other set (when both sets are sorted by that angle).\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the direction. However, we can choose a direction such that the matching is non-crossing.\n\n Actually, a well-known fact: \n   Given two sets of points (with same cardinality) in the plane, there exists a non-crossing matching if and only if there exists an ordering of the points (by a cyclic coordinate, i.e., angle around a point) such that when we sort both sets by that ordering, the matching is the one that matches the i-th point in one set to the i-th point in the other set.\n\n However, note that the entire set of points (both bases and rebels) is fixed. We can consider the convex hull of all points, but note that the problem does not require the matching to use the convex hull.\n\n But wait: we can also use the following:\n\n   Step 1: Sort all points (both bases and rebels) by their x-coordinate (or by angle from a fixed origin, but we must be cautious).\n\n   However, note: the two sets are distinct. \n\n Another approach: \n\n   We can use a recursive function that tries to assign a base to a rebel and then check if the segment drawn between them would cross any previously drawn segment. But since the matching is complete, we can use backtracking (with R, B <= 10, so 10! is 3.6 million which is acceptable? But 10! is 3628800, which is too many in worst-case for pure backtracking without good pruning).\n\n But note: we are only dealing with 10 points, so 10! is 3628800, which is acceptable in a contest if we code it in C++ but in Python might be borderline. However, we can use iterative deepening or better: we can use the fact that non-crossing condition is global.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy geometric approach.\n\n Known algorithm: \n   We can use the following: \n     1. Consider the entire set of points (both bases and rebels) and compute the convex hull. Then, the matching must be non-crossing. But note: the entire set of segments must not cross.\n\n   However, note: non-crossing matching in two sets: \n\n   There is a theorem: Two sets of n points in the plane, with no three collinear, admit a non-crossing matching if and only if there is a non-crossing perfect matching between the two sets.\n\n   How to check? \n\n   We can do:\n\n   - Sort the rebels and bases by x-coordinate (or by angle from a fixed point, say the centroid, but we need to be consistent for both sets).\n\n   But wait: the example above showed that matching by x-coordinate can lead to crossing.\n\n   However, if we sort both by the same key (say, the angle from the centroid) then the matching by index might work.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Compute the centroid (average x, average y) of all points (both sets).\n     2. For each point, compute the angle from the centroid (taking care of the case when the point is the centroid? but no, because no three points are collinear and points are distinct).\n     3. Sort the rebels by this angle, and sort the bases by the same angle.\n     4. Then match the i-th smallest angle in rebels to the i-th smallest angle in bases.\n\n   Then check if the resulting segments do not cross.\n\n   But note: the entire set of segments must not cross. The matching by angle (in a circular order) is known to produce a non-crossing matching if the two sets are interleaved appropriately. However, note that the two sets are distinct and we are matching one set to the other.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the two sets are independent. The matching by angle is actually the non-crossing matching for two sets (if we consider the points as two interleaved chains). \n\n   But wait: the classic problem of matching two sets of points (red and blue) with non-crossing segments is solved by sorting by angle and then matching in order. This is used in problems like \"Two Sets\" or \"Matching\".\n\n   However, note that the entire set of points (all rebels and bases) is fixed. The non-crossing condition is local: two segments (a-b) and (c-d) cross if and only if the points a, b, c, d are in the cyclic order a, c, b, d (or similar). \n\n   Algorithm using angle sorting:\n\n     Step 1: Check R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n     Step 2: Combine all points (both rebels and bases) and compute the centroid (cx, cy) = ( (sum_x)/(R+B), (sum_y)/(R+B) )\n     Step 3: For each set (rebels and bases) sort by the angle with respect to the centroid.\n\n        How to compute the angle? \n          For a point (x,y), the vector from centroid is (x-cx, y-cy). Then the angle = atan2(y-cy, x-cx)\n\n     Step 4: Create two lists: \n          sorted_rebels = sorted(rebels, key=lambda p: (angle for p) )  [using the computed angle]\n          sorted_bases = sorted(bases, key=lambda p: (angle for p))\n\n     Step 5: Now, for i in range(R): \n          Draw a segment from sorted_rebels[i] to sorted_bases[i]\n\n     Step 6: Check if these R segments are non-crossing.\n\n   But wait: is this matching guaranteed to be non-crossing? \n\n   Actually, no. Consider two sets that are not interleaved in the angular order. The matching by angle may not be non-crossing.\n\n   Example: \n        Rebels: [A, B] where A is at (0,0) and B is at (1,1)\n        Bases: [C, D] where C is at (2,2) and D is at (3,3)\n\n        Centroid: ( (0+1+2+3)/4, (0+1+2+3)/4 ) = (1.5, 1.5)\n\n        Angle of A: atan2(0-1.5, 0-1.5) = atan2(-1.5, -1.5) -> angle = 225 degrees (or -135)\n        Angle of B: atan2(1-1.5, 1-1.5) = atan2(-0.5, -0.5) -> angle = 225 + atan2(-0.5, -0.5) but actually the angle is the same? \n\n        Actually, atan2(dy, dx) for A: dy=-1.5, dx=-1.5 -> angle = 225 degrees.\n        For B: dy=-0.5, dx=-0.5 -> angle = 225 degrees as well? \n\n        Actually, atan2(-0.5, -0.5) is the same direction as atan2(-1.5, -1.5) (because ratio is same). \n\n        Then how to break the tie? The problem states: no three points are collinear, but note: the entire set of four points are collinear? Actually, the problem says \"no three points are on the same line\", but here we have four points: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) -> they are all on the line y=x. \n\n        But the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\" -> so this example is invalid.\n\n   So we don't have to worry about collinear points.\n\n   However, even if the points are not collinear, the matching by angle might still cross? \n\n   Actually, the correct method for non-crossing matching between two sets is to use the following:\n\n   We can use the following algorithm:\n\n     1. Sort the rebels by x-coordinate (or by angle) and the bases by x-coordinate (or by angle) and then check if the matching by index is non-crossing. But we saw that by x-coordinate alone doesn't guarantee.\n\n   Another known method: \n\n     We can use a plane sweep and check for crossings. However, we are only dealing with 10 points, so we can try to generate all perfect matchings (which is 10! possibilities) and check if there is at least one non-crossing.\n\n   Steps for brute-force:\n\n     1. If R != B, output 'No'.\n     2. Otherwise, generate all bijections (permutations of B taken from B, i.e., permutations of the bases for the rebels) and check if there is one matching that produces non-crossing segments.\n\n     3. How to check non-crossing for a given matching?\n\n        We have a list of rebels and a list of bases (of length R). We create a list of segments: for i, base = matched_base[i] to rebel[i].\n\n        Then, we must check that no two segments cross.\n\n        How to check if two segments (a,b) and (c,d) cross?\n\n          We can use the orientation test (cross product) to see if the points are interleaved.\n\n          Condition for two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) to cross (proper intersection, not at endpoints) is:\n\n            (p1, p2, p3) forms a clockwise turn and (p1, p2, p4) forms a counterclockwise turn, OR vice versa.\n\n          More precisely, two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) cross if and only if:\n\n            (p1, p2, p3) and (p1, p2, p4) have opposite orientations, and the same holds for (p3, p4, p1) and (p3, p4, p2) (but actually, we can use the following):\n\n          Standard method:\n\n            Let A = (x1,y1), B = (x2,y2), C = (x3,y3), D = (x4,y4) for the two segments AB and CD.\n\n            Then, the segments AB and CD cross if and only if:\n\n              (CCW(A, C) * CCW(B, C)) < 0 and (CCW(A, D) * CCW(B, D)) < 0   [This is not entirely correct]\n\n          Actually, the standard condition is:\n\n            The segments AB and CD cross if and only if:\n\n              (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) have different orientations (one clockwise, one counterclockwise) AND (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) have different orientations.\n\n          But wait, there is a simpler way: \n\n            We can check the orientation of the four points. \n\n            The segments AB and CD cross if and only if:\n\n              CCW(A, B, C) * CCW(A, B, D) < 0 and CCW(C, D, A) * CCW(C, D, B) < 0.\n\n          However, note: the entire set of four points must be distinct (they are) and the segments are defined by the two pairs.\n\n          But actually, we can use:\n\n            bool segments_intersect(Point A, Point B, Point C, Point D) {\n                // Check if the two segments AB and CD intersect (including endpoints? but note: endpoints are distinct and we want only proper crossing? Actually, the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\", meaning no crossing even at endpoints? Actually, the endpoints are distinct for the two segments (since each segment is between a base and a rebel, and the sets are disjoint). \n\n                // But note: the problem says \"do not intersect\", so even if they share an endpoint, that is allowed because they are connected at the base and the spaceship? Actually, the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\", and the endpoints are distinct for the two segments (because the base and rebel are distinct points). However, wait: the two segments are from base_i to rebel_j and base_k to rebel_l. The endpoints are distinct because the bases are distinct and the rebels are distinct.\n\n                // So we are only concerned with proper intersections (not at endpoints).\n\n                // But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\", meaning that the two segments should not share any interior point.\n\n                // We can use the following: \n                //   Check if the two segments intersect at a point that is not an endpoint.\n\n                // However, note: two segments that share an endpoint are allowed? The problem says \"do not intersect\", but the endpoints are the bases and the rebels, and the two segments are from base to rebel. The endpoints are distinct, so the two segments do not share an endpoint. \n\n                // Therefore, we only care about proper intersections.\n\n                // Standard algorithm for checking proper intersection:\n\n                //   o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n                //   o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n                //   o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n                //   o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n                //   if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4 and o1 * o3 != 0 and o2 * o4 != 0: then they intersect?\n\n                // Actually, the standard condition is:\n\n                //   if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0: then the segments intersect.\n\n                // But wait, the standard condition is:\n\n                //   Let o1 = orientation(A, B, C); o2 = orientation(A, B, D);\n                //   Let o3 = orientation(C, D, A); o4 = orientation(C, D, B);\n\n                //   Then the segments AB and CD intersect if and only if \n                //        o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0.\n\n                // However, note: the above condition does not account for collinearity, but the problem states no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n            }\n\n          But wait: there is a catch. The above condition checks for proper intersection (not including endpoints). \n\n          However, note: the four points are in general position (no three collinear), so the condition is safe.\n\n     4. However, we must check for every pair of segments in the matching. But note: the matching has R/2 pairs? Actually, we have R segments (each base-rebel is one segment). But wait, the matching is between R rebels and R bases, so we have R segments. And we need to check that no two of these R segments cross.\n\n     5. But note: the matching is a set of R edges (each edge connects one base and one rebel). Since R is at most 10, the total number of pairs of edges is C(R,2) = 45, which is acceptable.\n\n     6. However, we are going to iterate over all permutations (R! which is 10! = 3628800) and for each permutation we check all pairs of edges (which is O(R^2)). 3628800 * (10*9/2) = 3628800 * 45 ~ 163 million checks, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be slow. \n\n     7. But note: we can break early if we find a crossing.\n\n     8. However, worst-case we might have to check all permutations until we find one that is non-crossing. And if there is none, we have to check all.\n\n     9. But 10! is 3628800, which is acceptable in Python if we optimize the inner loop (the crossing check for one matching is O(R^2) and R=10, so 45 per matching, and 3628800 * 45 is about 163 million, which is acceptable in Pyton in many cases (if we write in C++ we would do, but in Python we hope that the constraints are small and that the input is small).\n\n     However, note: the problem says R, B from 1 to 10, so worst-case 10!.\n\n     But wait, we can use memoization or dynamic programming? The problem is small (n=10) so we can do recursion with backtracking and prune whenever a crossing is detected.\n\n     Alternate plan: \n\n        We can use recursion: \n\n          Let rebels = list of R rebels (points)\n          Let bases = list of R bases (points)\n\n          We want to assign each rebel to a base without crossing.\n\n          We can fix the rebels in a fixed order (say, by x-coordinate) and then try to assign bases one by one.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Sort the rebels by x-coordinate (or any fixed order) and then recursively assign bases to rebels.\n\n            At each step, for the current rebel, we consider the available bases and check if the segment from the current rebel to a base will cross any of the already drawn segments (from previous rebels to their bases).\n\n            We can precompute the set of forbidden bases for the current rebel: a base is forbidden if the segment from the current rebel to that base crosses any of the segments already drawn.\n\n            Then we can use backtracking.\n\n          How to check crossing between two segments? We have the new segment (current rebel to base candidate) and the existing segments (from previous rebels to their bases). \n\n          We can do:\n\n            For each existing segment (from a previous rebel to a base that is already taken), check if the new segment (current rebel to candidate base) crosses it.\n\n          Then, if there is no crossing, we mark that base as taken and proceed.\n\n          This way, we avoid generating all permutations and then checking, but we prune early.\n\n          Since the maximum depth is 10, and at each level we have at most (remaining bases) choices, the worst-case is still 10! but we hope that the pruning will help.\n\n          However, worst-case (if there are no crossings) we still have to check all.\n\n          But note: the problem asks if there exists at least one non-crossing matching.\n\n          We can implement:\n\n            def backtrack(index, taken_bases, segments):\n                # index: current rebel index (we are assigning the index-th rebel, if we fixed the order of rebels)\n                # taken_bases: set of bases already taken (or a list of booleans for each base)\n                # segments: list of segments already drawn? Actually, we don't need to store the segments, but we need to know the existing edges to check for crossing.\n\n            Alternatively, we can pass the current matching (list of assigned bases for rebels) and then check the last added segment against the entire set of existing edges.\n\n          Steps for backtracking:\n\n            Sort the rebels by x-coordinate (or any fixed order, but we must be consistent). Let rebels = sorted_list.\n\n            Then, for the i-th rebel, try every base that is not taken and check if the segment from rebels[i] to base_candidate does not cross any of the segments from rebels[j] to base_assigned[j] for j < i.\n\n            We can represent the existing matching as a list: match[i] = base_assigned[i] for i from 0 to i-1.\n\n            Then, for candidate base b for rebel i, check for every j in [0, i-1]:\n                  segment (rebels[i], b) and (rebels[j], match[j]) do not cross.\n\n            We can write a helper function: \n\n                def segments_cross(A, B, C, D):\n                    # Check if segments AB and CD intersect (properly, not at endpoints)\n                    # Using orientation test.\n\n                    def orientation(O, A, B):\n                        # Returns: 0 if colinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counterclockwise\n                        val = (A[0]-O[0])*(B[1]-O[1]) - (A[1]-O[1])*(B[0]-O[0])\n                        if val == 0: \n                            return 0\n                        elif val > 0:\n                            return 1\n                        else:\n                            return 2\n\n                    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n                    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n                    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n                    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n                    # Check if the orientations are opposite for both pairs\n                    if o1 == o2 or o3 == o4:\n                        return False\n\n                    # Also, ensure that the points are not collinear (but given no three collinear, we don't need to check for zero, but we did above)\n\n                    # Actually, the condition for crossing is that the two orientations for the first pair are opposite and for the second pair are opposite.\n\n                    return (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4)\n\n            However, wait: the standard condition is:\n\n                return (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4)\n\n            But note: the above condition is sufficient because the segments are defined by the four endpoints and the condition ensures that the two segments are intertwined.\n\n            But wait, the standard condition is:\n\n                if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n                    return True\n                else:\n                    return False\n\n            However, note: the orientation function returns 0 for collinear, but we know no three collinear, so o1,o2,o3,o4 are never 0.\n\n            Then, we can use:\n\n                if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                    return True\n                else:\n                    return False\n\n            Because if o1 and o2 are opposite (one positive, one negative) then the product is negative. Similarly for o3 and o4.\n\n            But note: our orientation function returns 1 for positive and 2 for negative? Actually, we defined:\n\n                def orientation(O, A, B):\n                    val = (A[0]-O[0])*(B[1]-O[1]) - (A[1]-O[1])*(B[0]-O[0])\n                    if val == 0: \n                        return 0\n                    elif val > 0:\n                        return 1\n                    else:\n                        return 2\n\n            Then, o1 * o2 < 0 is equivalent to (o1 != o2) and neither is 0.\n\n            But wait: if we use the product, then we require that one is 1 and the other is 2. \n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                return (o1 == 1 and o2 == 2) or (o1 == 2 and o2 == 1) and similarly for o3 and o4.\n\n            However, the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) is the same as (o1 != o2) and (o1,o2 not zero) because if one is positive and the other negative then product is negative.\n\n            But note: we are using integers: 1 and 2, then 1*2=2>0, so that condition is not negative.\n\n            We must use the product of the values? Or we can compare the signs.\n\n            Actually, let me change the orientation function to return -1 for clockwise and 1 for counterclockwise.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                def orientation(O, A, B):\n                    val = (A[0]-O[0])*(B[1]-O[1]) - (A[1]-O[1])*(B[0]-O[0])\n                    return val\n\n            Then, the condition is:\n\n                if (orientation(A, B, C) * orientation(A, B, D) < 0) and (orientation(C, D, A) * orientation(C, D, B) < 0):\n                    return True\n                else:\n                    return False\n\n            This is the standard condition.\n\n            Let me define:\n\n                def orientation(O, A, B):\n                    return (A[0]-O[0])*(B[1]-O[1]) - (A[1]-O[1])*(B[0]-O[0])\n\n            Then, segments_cross(A, B, C, D):\n\n                o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n                o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n                o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n                o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n                if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0:\n                    return True\n                else:\n                    return False\n\n            But note: the standard condition for two segments AB and CD to intersect is that the orientations for A,B,C and A,B,D are opposite, and for C,D,A and C,D,B are opposite.\n\n            However, there is a nuance: the order of points in the orientation function. The orientation function we defined returns the signed area of the parallelogram: positive if the turn from OA to OB is counterclockwise, negative if clockwise.\n\n            Then the condition is standard.\n\n     10. Implementation:\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Read input: R, B (must be equal, else output 'No')\n            Then read R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n            Then, if R != B: print 'No'\n\n            Else, sort the rebels by x-coordinate (or leave in the given order? Actually, we can fix the order arbitrarily. But note: we want to assign in order. We can sort the rebels to have a fixed order.\n\n            Then, we do:\n\n                bases = list of bases (length R)\n\n                Then, we want to assign the rebels (in the sorted order) to the bases (without repetition) and check for non-crossing.\n\n                We can use DFS/backtracking:\n\n                Let rebels = sorted list of rebels (by x, then y if needed)\n\n                Then, we have an array 'match' of length R, initially None.\n\n                Then, we call:\n\n                    dfs(0, [])   # index 0 to R-1, and an array for the matching\n\n                In the DFS:\n\n                    def dfs(i, taken):   # i is the current rebel index (0-indexed), taken is a list of booleans for bases (index j is taken if True)\n\n                    If i == R: we found a matching, output 'Yes' and exit.\n\n                    Otherwise, for each base j not in taken:\n\n                        Let candidate = bases[j]\n                        Check if the segment from rebels[i] to candidate does not cross any segment from rebels[k] to taken[k] for k from 0 to i-1.\n\n                        How to represent the existing matching? We have a list 'match' that we are building. But in the DFS we are passing 'taken' which is a list of booleans. Alternatively, we can keep a separate list for the matching.\n\n                        Actually, we can do:\n\n                            We maintain an array 'assignment' of length R (for the bases) that stores the base index assigned to each rebel.\n\n                            Then, for the current rebel i, we try base j (if not taken) and check:\n\n                                for k in range(i):   # for each rebel k (already assigned)\n                                    if assignment[k] is not None:   # but we are building assignment, so we can store the assignment for rebels 0 to i-1.\n\n                                Actually, we can store the assignment in an array and then use the list of bases that are assigned.\n\n                        Alternatively, we can store the matching as a list of base indices (of length R) and then use the list of base points.\n\n                        We'll do:\n\n                            assignment = [None]*R   # assignment[i] = base index for rebel i\n\n                            Then, in DFS(i, assignment):\n                                if i == R: return True\n                                for j in range(R):\n                                    if assignment[j] is None:   # wait, no: j is the base index? Actually, we have R bases, and we want to assign base j to rebel i.\n\n                            Actually, let me restructure:\n\n                                We have two lists: \n                                    rebels_sorted = sorted_rebels   (list of R points)\n                                    bases_list = bases (list of R points)\n\n                                We want to assign each rebel (by index) to a base (by index).\n\n                                Let's maintain an array 'match' of length R for the rebels: match[i] = base index assigned to rebel i.\n\n                                Then, we iterate i from 0 to R-1.\n\n                                Then, for the i-th rebel, we try every base index j that hasn't been used (i.e., match[k] != j for all k from 0 to i-1).\n\n                                Then, we check the segment (rebels_sorted[i], bases_list[j]) against every segment (rebels_sorted[k], bases_list[match[k]]) for k from 0 to i-1.\n\n                                Then, if no crossing, then we set match[i]=j and DFS(i+1, match).\n\n                        However, we can also use a list of booleans for base usage.\n\n                        Let's do:\n\n                            def dfs(i, used):   # i: current rebel index (0..R-1), used: list of booleans for bases (used[j] is True if base j is already assigned)\n\n                            Then, for j in range(R):\n                                if not used[j]:\n                                    # Check if the segment (rebels_sorted[i], bases_list[j]) crosses any existing segment (rebels_sorted[k], bases_list[used[k] index? ]) \n\n                                    But wait: we don't have the base index stored, but we can store the assignment for rebels? \n\n                            Alternatively, we can store the matching for rebels so far, and then the base indices used.\n\n                            Actually, we can do:\n\n                                We have two arrays: \n                                    rebels_sorted (fixed)\n                                    bases_list (fixed)\n\n                                We maintain an array 'match' (length R) for the rebels: match[i] = base index for rebel i (for i from 0 to i-1)\n\n                                Then, we can also maintain a set (or list) of used base indices.\n\n                            But note: we can update used as we assign.\n\n                        I think the DFS with state being the current rebel index and the set of used base indices is acceptable.\n\n            Steps for DFS:\n\n                def dfs(i, used): \n                    if i == R:\n                        print('Yes')\n                        exit(0)\n\n                    for j in range(R):\n                        if not used[j]:\n                            #",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between R Rebel spaceships and B bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking for a non-crossing matching in the plane, given the constraints that no three points are collinear and no two points coincide.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching (bijection) between two sets of points (spaceships and bases) such that the segments connecting them do not intersect. The key insight is that if the number of spaceships (R) does not equal the number of bases (B), no such matching exists. Otherwise, we need to check all possible matchings for non-intersecting segments.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For small input sizes (R, B ≤ 10), a brute-force approach with backtracking is feasible. We generate all possible permutations of base assignments to spaceships and check each permutation for non-intersecting segments. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Backtracking with Pruning**: We use a depth-first search (DFS) approach where we assign bases to spaceships one by one. For each assignment, we check if the new segment intersects any existing segments. If it does, we backtrack; otherwise, we proceed.\n   - **Segment Intersection Check**: The intersection check uses the orientation test (cross product) to determine if two segments cross each other. This test is efficient and leverages the fact that no three points are collinear.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(R! * R^2), where R! is the number of permutations and R^2 is the cost of checking intersections for each permutation. Given R ≤ 10, this is manageable (10! = 3,628,800 permutations).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    R = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    index = 2\n    \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n    \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print('No')\n        return\n        \n    rebels_sorted = sorted(rebels, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n    \n    def orientation(O, A, B):\n        val = (A[0] - O[0]) * (B[1] - O[1]) - (A[1] - O[1]) * (B[0] - O[0])\n        return val\n\n    def segments_cross(A, B, C, D):\n        o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n        o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n        o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n        o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n        \n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\n    used = [False] * R\n    match_assignment = [None] * R\n\n    def dfs(i):\n        if i == R:\n            print('Yes')\n            sys.exit(0)\n            \n        for j in range(R):\n            if not used[j]:\n                candidate_cross = False\n                base_point = bases[j]\n                for k in range(i):\n                    if match_assignment[k] is not None:\n                        base_k = bases[match_assignment[k]]\n                        if segments_cross(rebels_sorted[i], base_point, rebels_sorted[k], base_k):\n                            candidate_cross = True\n                            break\n                if not candidate_cross:\n                    used[j] = True\n                    match_assignment[i] = j\n                    dfs(i + 1)\n                    used[j] = False\n                    match_assignment[i] = None\n                    \n    dfs(0)\n    print('No')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Initial Check**: If the counts of spaceships and bases differ, the solution immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Sorting**: Spaceships' coordinates are sorted lexicographically to standardize the order of assignment checks.\n4. **Orientation and Cross Check**: The `orientation` function computes the cross product to determine the relative orientation of three points. The `segments_cross` function checks if two segments intersect using these orientations.\n5. **Backtracking (DFS)**: The DFS function attempts to assign each spaceship to an unused base, checking for segment intersections at each step. If a valid assignment is found (all spaceships assigned without intersections), it prints \"Yes\" and exits. If no valid assignment is found after all permutations, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible matchings while leveraging geometric properties to prune invalid paths early, ensuring correctness within feasible computational limits.",
