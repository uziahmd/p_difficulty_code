The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n Conditions: \n   The plate is w x h.\n   We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost ring). The second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, etc.\n\n Each ring i (starting at i=1) has a width of 1 cell and is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))\n\n But note: the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. However, if the inner rectangle becomes too small (less than 3 in either dimension) then we cannot draw the ring? Actually, the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), so the rings are defined until the inner rectangle still has at least 3x3 (since the outer ring requires at least 3x3).\n\n How to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n\n For a rectangle of size a x b, the border (if we consider the outer border only) would have:\n   If a == 1 or b == 1, then it's just a single row (or column) but note our condition: the inner rectangle for the first ring is (w-0) x (h-0) and must be at least 3x3.\n\n Actually, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (the border) is: \n   total_cells = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because each corner is shared by two sides, so subtract 4 corners that are counted twice]\n\n However, let's test with the example: \n   Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n        a = 3, b = 3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28.\n        a = 7, b = 9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28. Correct.\n\n   Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> output 40.\n        First ring: 28 as above.\n        Second ring: the inner rectangle is (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n        Then the border of 3x5: 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n        Total = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if the inner rectangle is 1x1? Then 2*1+2*1-4 = 0, which is correct because we don't need to gild that.\n\n However, note the condition on k: \n   k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n\n Since the reduction is 4*(k-1) for each ring, then the smallest rectangle we consider for the k-th ring is (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)).\n And since k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), then w-4*(k-1) >= 3 (similarly for h) because:\n\n   Let m = min(w, h)\n   k_max = floor((m+1)/4)\n   Then for k = k_max: \n        w - 4*(k_max-1) >= 3?\n\n   Example: m=3 -> k_max = (3+1)//4 = 4//4 = 1 -> then 3-4*0 = 3 -> valid.\n            m=4 -> k_max = (4+1)//4 = 5//4 = 1 -> then 4-0=4 -> valid for a ring? \n            But note: the formula for the border of 4x4: 2*4+2*4-4 = 12. However, the problem states that the first ring is the outer edge. \n\n   However, the problem says: the i-th ring is on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)). \n   For the second ring (i=2): the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4). So if w=5, then for i=2: 5-4=1, which is invalid.\n\n   Therefore, the condition on k is such that the inner rectangle for the last ring has at least 3x3? Actually, the condition is given as:\n        k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1) / 4)\n\n   Let me check: \n        For w=5, h=5: \n            k_max = (5+1)//4 = 6//4 = 1 (floor division). So k=1 only.\n\n        For w=6, h=6:\n            k_max = (6+1)//4 = 7//4 = 1 -> but wait, let's see: \n                First ring: 6x6 -> border: 2*6+2*6-4 = 20.\n                Second ring: inner rectangle is 6-4=2x2 -> which is too small (border requires at least 3x3). So k=2 is not allowed.\n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n            k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)\n\n        This means that the minimum side after k rings is: min_side = min(w,h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3?\n        Because the smallest valid rectangle for a ring is 3x3.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the ring i requires that the inner rectangle has dimensions at least 3x3, i.e., \n            w - 4*(i-1) >= 3 and h - 4*(i-1) >= 3.\n\n        Then the maximum k is the largest integer such that:\n            4*(k-1) <= min(w-3, h-3)   => k-1 <= (min(w-3, h-3)) / 4   => k <= floor((min(w-3, h-3))/4) + 1\n\n        But the problem states: k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)\n\n        Let me check with w=6, h=6: \n            floor((min(6,6)+1)/4) = floor(7/4)=1 -> matches.\n\n        Now, for w=7, h=9: \n            k_max = floor((min(7,9)+1)/4) = floor(8/4)=2 -> which allows two rings.\n\n        So we can safely assume that for the given k, the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3x3.\n\n Approach:\n\n   For each ring i (from 1 to k):\n        Let a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        Then the number of cells in the i-th ring is: 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4.\n\n   Then sum these up.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first ring is the edge of the plate. Then the second ring is 2 cells away, meaning we reduce by 4 (two from top and bottom, two from left and right) so yes, 4*(i-1) reduction.\n\n But wait: the example \"7 9 2\": \n        i=1: a1=7, b1=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n        i=2: a2=7-4=3, b2=9-4=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n        Total = 28+12=40.\n\n Code:\n\n   Read w, h, k from stdin.\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        # The border of a x b: 2*a + 2*b - 4\n        ring_cells = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n        total += ring_cells\n\n   Print total.\n\n But wait, what if the inner rectangle becomes too small (like 0 or negative)? The problem says k is bounded so that the inner rectangle is at least 3x3 for the k-th ring? Actually, the condition is given, so we don't have to worry about negative or zero.\n\n However, note: the condition says k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This ensures that for the k-th ring, the inner rectangle has at least:\n        w' = w - 4*(k-1) >= 3? Let's check:\n\n        Let m = min(w, h)\n        Condition: k <= (m+1)//4   (using integer floor division)\n\n        Then w' = w - 4*(k-1) >= ? \n\n        We know m >= 4*(k-1) + 1? Actually, from the condition: k <= (m+1)//4  => 4*k <= m+1  => 4*(k-1) <= m+1-4 = m-3.\n\n        So w' = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - (m-3) = ... but note w>=m, so w' >= m - (m-3) = 3.\n\n        Similarly for h.\n\n        Therefore, the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3x3.\n\n   So the code is safe.\n\n Let me test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n        w=3, h=3, k=1\n        i=1: a=3, b=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 8.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n        w=7, h=9, k=1\n        i=1: a=7, b=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n\n Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n        i=1: 28, i=2: 2*3+2*5-4=6+10-4=12 -> 40.\n\n Example 4: \"4 4 1\"\n        k_max = (4+1)//4 = 5//4 = 1 -> k=1 is allowed.\n        i=1: a=4, b=4 -> 2*4+2*4-4 = 8+8-4 = 12.\n\n Example 5: \"5 5 1\"\n        k_max = (5+1)//4 = 6//4=1 -> k=1\n        i=1: 2*5+2*5-4 = 10+10-4=16.\n\n Example 6: \"5 5 2\" -> not allowed because k_max=1, so we don't get this input.\n\n But wait, the condition says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So for 5x5, k_max=1.\n\n Therefore, we are good.\n\n However, note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. The rings are drawn as described. The above formula is standard for the border of a grid.\n\n Write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is drawn inside the previous one, starting from the outer edge and moving inward. The key observation is that each ring's dimensions are determined by the original plate's dimensions minus the cumulative reduction from previous rings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the number of cells in each concentric ring around a rectangle. The first ring is the outermost border of the rectangle. Each subsequent ring is drawn 2 cells inward from the previous one, effectively reducing both the width and height by 4 cells (2 cells from each side). The number of cells in each ring can be derived using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for overlapping corners.\n2. **Insight**: For each ring, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are `(w - 4*(i-1))` by `(h - 4*(i-1))`, where `i` is the current ring number. The number of cells in the ring is then `2*a + 2*b - 4`, where `a` and `b` are the dimensions of the inner rectangle. This formula accounts for the four corners being shared between adjacent sides.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for that ring, apply the perimeter formula, and sum the results for all rings.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where `k` is the number of rings. Given the constraints (`k` is up to about 25 for typical inputs), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2*a + 2*b - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_cells` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both width and height.\n   - If either dimension becomes non-positive, break the loop as further rings are invalid.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring using the formula `2*a + 2*b - 4`.\n   - Add the result to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output**: Print the total number of cells after processing all valid rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and iteration, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
