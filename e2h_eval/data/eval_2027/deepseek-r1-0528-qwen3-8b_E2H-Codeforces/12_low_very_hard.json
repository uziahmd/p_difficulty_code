The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers.\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) and we start at house 1, we can think of the houses as a circular array.\n\n However, note: The problem says that initially Xenia is at house 1. Then she has to complete tasks in order. For the i-th task, she must be at house a_i and also have completed all tasks before.\n\n Important: The ringroad is clockwise and one-way. So from a house i, moving clockwise: i -> i+1 (if i < n) or i->1 (if i==n).\n\n But note: There is an alternative way to go from a high number to a lower? Actually, because it's a ring, we can only go clockwise. So if we are at house x and need to go to house y, then:\n\n Option 1: Go from x to y by increasing the house number until we reach y (if y >= x). This distance is (y - x) mod n? But note: the ring has n houses, so going clockwise from x to y:\n   If y >= x: distance = y - x\n   If y < x: then we go from x to n, then wrap around from 1 to y. That distance is (n - x + y)\n\n Alternatively, we can express the distance from x to y as: \n   d = (y - x) % n   but wait, if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, so we adjust.\n\n Actually, we can compute: \n   If we are at x and want to go to y, then the clockwise distance is:\n      if y >= x: y - x\n      else: (n - x) + y\n\n But note: we might not necessarily go the entire circle. However, since the ring is circular and we are forced to move clockwise, the above formula gives the minimal steps.\n\n However, there's a catch: the problem states that we must complete the tasks in order. So we start at 1, then do the first task at a1, then from a1 we must go to a2 (but note: we don't necessarily do consecutive tasks in the same house, but we must complete tasks in increasing index order).\n\n But note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" leads to 6.\n\n Steps for the example: \n   Start at 1, then go to 3: \n        From 1 to 3: 3-1 = 2 steps? But wait, the example path: 1->2->3->4->1->2->3. \n\n Why is that? Because after completing the first task at 3, the next task is at 2. From 3 to 2 in clockwise: \n        3->4 (1 step), then 4->1 (2nd step), then 1->2 (3rd step). So total from 1 to 3: 2 steps, then from 3 to 2: 3 steps? But wait, the example says the entire sequence is 6 steps.\n\n Actually, let me break down the example:\n\n   Task 1: at house 3. We start at house 1. Then we need to go from 1 to 3: that's 2 steps (1->2, 2->3). Now we are at 3 and done first task.\n\n   Task 2: at house 2. Now from 3 to 2: we cannot go counter-clockwise. We have to go clockwise: 3->4 (step 1), 4->1 (step 2), 1->2 (step 3). So that's 3 steps.\n\n   Task 3: at house 3. Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step).\n\n   Total steps: 2 (from 1 to 3) + 3 (from 3 to 2) + 1 (from 2 to 3) = 6.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we are allowed to traverse the entire ring multiple times.\n\n Therefore, we can model the travel from the current house to the next task's house.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to return to the start. We just need to complete the tasks.\n\n We can compute the total time by iterating over the tasks and adding the clockwise distance from the previous task's house to the next.\n\n But wait: the starting point is house 1, and the first task is at a1. Then the second task is at a2, etc.\n\n However, note that the condition: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" means that we must do the tasks in order, so we start at 1, then go to a1, then from a1 to a2, etc.\n\n But note",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks, given that she starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in a specific order along a circular ring road. The ring road is one-way and clockwise, so movement is restricted to increasing house numbers or wrapping around from the highest house back to the lowest.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that Xenia can only move clockwise. Therefore, the distance between two houses can be calculated based on their positions. If the target house is ahead of the current house, the distance is simply the difference between them. If the target house is behind, the distance is the sum of moving from the current house to the end of the ring and then from the start of the ring to the target house.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We process each task in sequence, calculating the clockwise distance from the previous task's location (or the starting point for the first task) to the current task's location. Summing these distances gives the total time required.\n3. **Optimization**: By iterating through the tasks once and computing the distances incrementally, we ensure the solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This approach efficiently handles the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if current <= a:\n            distance = a - current\n        else:\n            distance = n - current + a\n        total_time += distance\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses (n), the number of tasks (m), and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: The total time is initialized to 0, and the starting position (current house) is set to 1.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n   - If the task location is ahead of the current position, the distance is the difference between the task location and the current position.\n   - If the task location is behind, the distance is calculated by moving from the current position to the end of the ring (n - current) and then from the start of the ring to the task location (a).\n4. **Updating Position and Time**: After each task, the current position is updated to the task's location, and the computed distance is added to the total time.\n5. **Output**: The total accumulated time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring road and processing each task in sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
