She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The cursor starts at `pos` and we need to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r`.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (if there are unclosed tabs in that direction) one tab per second.\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (one operation per second).\n\n After closing, the segment [a, b] is defined by the remaining tabs. Initially, a=1, b=n.\n\n However, note that we can close in two directions independently. We must close:\n  - All tabs with indices < l (left side)\n  - All tabs with indices > r (right side)\n\n We have two main strategies:\n  Option 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n    Steps:\n      a. Move the cursor from `pos` to some tab within [l, r] (or even beyond if needed? but note: we cannot move beyond the current bounds) \n         However, note: when we close the left part, we must be at a position >= l (so that the left part closes up to l-1). Similarly for the right.\n\n  But note: the problem allows closing either side independently. Also, the closing operation does not require being exactly at the boundary? \n  Actually, the operation \"close all tabs to the left\" will close from the current leftmost tab (which is the minimum index of unclosed tabs) to i-1. Similarly for right.\n\n  However, we know the target segment [l, r]. So we must ensure that after closing the left, the leftmost tab becomes l, and similarly the rightmost becomes r.\n\n  How do we think?\n  There are three cases:\n\n  Case 1: The entire segment [l, r] is already the only open tabs. Then answer = 0.\n\n  Otherwise, we have to close either the left part, or the right part, or both.\n\n  We can break the problem into two parts: left closure and right closure.\n\n  For the left closure: we must close all tabs from 1 to l-1. To do that, we must have the cursor at a position at least l (because if we are at i, then closing left will close from a to i-1, so we need i-1 >= l-1 -> i>=l). Moreover, we can do the left closure only once (when the cursor is at a position >= l). Similarly, for the right closure: we must close from r+1 to n, and we must be at a position <= r.\n\n  However, we might also consider doing multiple closures? But note: once we close one side, the boundaries change. But observe: closing the left doesn't affect the right, and vice versa. So we can do:\n\n  Possibilities:\n    1. Only close left: if l == 1, then we don't need to close left. Otherwise, we must close left. Similarly for right.\n\n  Actually, the problem is symmetric. We can consider:\n\n  Option A: Do nothing if [l, r] is the entire set.\n\n  But wait, what if we are not at the segment? We must move the cursor to the segment to perform the closure? Actually, no: we can close without moving the cursor to the boundary? Let me explain:\n\n  Example: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4 (from example).\n\n  Steps according to example:\n    Shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2 (1 second), then close all the tabs to the left (closing from a=1 to 1, so now tabs are 2,3,4,5,6? but wait, then they say: shift to tab 3, then to tab 4, and then close the right.\n\n  But note: initially, the tabs are 1..6. When we close the left from tab 2, we close [a, 1] (a is the current leftmost, which is 1) so we close [1,1]. Then the leftmost becomes 2, and the cursor is at 2. Then we move to 3 (1 sec) and then to 4 (another sec) and then close the right (closing [5,6]).\n\n  Alternatively, we could have closed the right first? \n\n  However, note that we can also close the right part from a position that is <= r. In this case, to close the right, we must be at a position <= r (so that the operation closes from i+1 to the current rightmost, which initially is 6). So we can move to r (from 3 to 4: 1 sec) and then close the right.\n\n  So the plan:\n\n  We need to cover two segments: [1, l-1] and [r+1, n]. \n\n  We can do:\n    - One closure for the left (if l > 1) and one for the right (if r < n). But we can also do one closure for the left and then the right, or the other way around, or even combine movements.\n\n  However, note that we can also use the same movement to get to a position that allows two closures? Actually, we have to consider:\n\n  Let me define:\n    left_closures = 0 if l == 1 else 1\n    right_closures = 0 if r == n else 1\n\n  But wait, we might not need to close one side if the cursor is already positioned appropriately?\n\n  Actually, we can do the following:\n\n  Step 1: If we don't need to close any side (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then answer=0.\n\n  Step 2: Consider two independent closures. But note: the closure operation doesn't require being at the boundary. For the left closure, we must be at a tab i such that i >= l (so that the closure will remove everything from the current left (which is 1) to i-1, and we want to remove up to l-1, so i must be at least l). Similarly, for the right closure, we must be at a tab i <= r.\n\n  Now, we can also consider that we might not need to move to the exact boundary if we are already in the segment. But note: if we are outside the segment, we must move in.\n\n  However, we start at `pos`. We can move left or right arbitrarily (within the current tab boundaries) and we can close at any time.\n\n  We have two types of moves: moving the cursor (each move costs 1 second) and closing (each closure costs 1 second).\n\n  We can break down the problem:\n\n  Let A = l-1   (the number of tabs to the left to close)\n  Let B = n - r (the number of tabs to the right to close)\n\n  But note: we are allowed to close only one contiguous part at a time.\n\n  Actually, the problem is small (n<=100). We can consider simulating the possibilities:\n\n  Possibility 1: Close left first, then right.\n    - To close left, we must move the cursor from `pos` to at least `l` (if we are to the right of `l`, then we don't need to move to the right for left closure, but if we are to the left, we must move right until we hit `l`). However, note: we can also close the left without necessarily being at `l`? Actually, we can close the left from any position i such that i>=l. But if we are at a position i (>=l) then the closure will remove from the current leftmost (which is 1) to i-1. But we want to remove only up to l-1. So if we are at i (>=l) then the closure will remove [1, i-1]. This removes more than necessary if i>l. However, that's okay because we are going to close the rest later? But note: we are only allowed to close one contiguous part. We cannot partially close the left. So if we close from i (where i>l) then we remove [1, i-1] which includes [1, l-1] and also [l, i-1]. But [l, i-1] is part of the desired segment. That would be bad.\n\n  Correction: The problem says: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\" meaning from the current leftmost (which is the smallest index that is still open) to i-1. Initially, the leftmost is 1. After closing the left, the new leftmost becomes the next smallest tab that was not closed, which is the smallest index that is greater than the last closed one. But wait, the operation definition: it closes the segment [a, i-1] where a is the current leftmost (minimum index of unclosed tabs). \n\n  However, note: we are allowed to close only one contiguous block at a time. But if we close the left from a position i (>=l) then we are closing from the current leftmost (which is 1) to i-1. This will close too much: we don't want to close the segment [l, i-1] (if i>l) because that is part of the desired [l, r]. \n\n  Therefore, we must be careful: we can only close the unwanted parts. So:\n\n  To close the left part (without affecting the desired segment), we must be at a tab that is exactly `l` (so that the closure removes [1, l-1] and leaves l as the new leftmost). Similarly, to close the right part without affecting the desired segment, we must be at `r` (so that the closure removes [r+1, n]).\n\n  So the correct way is:\n\n  For the left closure: we must move the cursor to `l` (if we haven't already) and then perform the closure (1 second for the closure). Similarly, for the right closure: move to `r` and then perform the closure.\n\n  But note: we might be able to combine movements. For example, if we are between `l` and `r`, then we can do:\n\n  Option 1: \n    - Move to `l` (if `pos` is to the right of `l`, then we move left; if to the left, then we must move right? Wait, if `pos` is less than `l`, then we must move right to `l` to close the left. If `pos` is greater than `r`, then we must move left to `r` to close the right. But if we are in the middle, we have two choices: close left first or right first.\n\n  Actually, let's analyze:\n\n  Case 1: The current `pos` is already in [l, r].\n    Then we can choose to close left (if needed) and then right (if needed) or vice versa.\n\n    Steps for left closure: move from `pos` to `l` (distance = |pos-l|) then close left (1 second). Then move from `l` to `r` (distance = r-l) then close right (1 second). Total = |pos-l| + 1 + (r-l) + 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can close the right first: move from `pos` to `r` (distance = |pos-r|) then close right (1 second). Then move from `r` to `l` (distance = r-l) then close left (1 second). Total = |pos-r| + 1 + (r-l) + 1.\n\n    Or, we can close both without moving the entire way? Note: we can close one side and then the other without necessarily going back to the opposite end. Actually, after closing one side, the boundaries change, but since we are only concerned with the segment [l, r], we can do:\n\n    Actually, we don't necessarily have to go from `l` to `r` again. We can stay at the same place and then move to the other end. But note: the closure operations change the boundaries, but the cursor remains at the same position.\n\n    However, the problem is that the closure operation does not change the cursor position. So after closing the left, the cursor is still at `l` (if we closed from `l`). Then to close the right, we must move from `l` to `r` (if we haven't already been there) and then close.\n\n    Similarly, if we close the right first, we are at `r`, then we must move from `r` to `l` to close the left.\n\n    So the total time is:\n\n      Option 1 (left then right): \n          Move from `pos` to `l`: |pos-l|\n          Close left: 1\n          Then move from `l` to `r`: (r-l)  [since we are at `l` and we need to get to `r` to close the right]\n          Close right: 1\n\n          Total: |pos-l| + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n\n      Option 2 (right then left):\n          Move from `pos` to `r`: |pos-r|\n          Close right: 1\n          Then move from `r` to `l`: (r-l)  [because we are at `r` and we need to get to `l` to close the left]\n          Close left: 1\n\n          Total: |pos-r| + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n\n    But wait, is (r-l) the distance from `r` to `l`? Yes, because we are moving from `r` to `l` and we are constrained by the current boundaries? Actually, after closing the right, the rightmost becomes `r`, so we can move freely from `r` to `l` (since l<=r). Similarly, after closing the left, the leftmost becomes `l`, so we can move from `l` to `r`.\n\n    However, note: we don't necessarily have to move the entire distance from `l` to `r` if we are already in the segment. But in the above, we are starting from `l` (after left closure) and then we move to `r`. But if we are already at `r` (for the right closure) then we don't need to move? Actually, we are at `l` and we want to close the right, so we must be at `r` (to avoid removing too much). Similarly, we are at `r` and we want to close the left, so we must be at `l`.\n\n    Alternatively, we might consider that we can close one side and then the other without moving the entire segment? \n\n    Actually, we can break the problem into two independent operations:\n\n    Operation for left: requires being at a position >= l (but we choose to be at l to minimize the removal). Similarly, for the right: being at a position <= r.\n\n    Since we are in [l, r] initially, we have two choices: \n        a. Close left from the current position (if the current position is >= l) and then close right from the current position (if the current position is <= r). But note: after closing left, the segment changes and the current position might become invalid for closing the right? \n\n    Let me clarify: \n        Initially, we are at `pos` (in [l, r]).\n        We can close the left from `pos` only if `pos` >= l (which it is) and then the closure will remove [1, pos-1]. But if `pos` is greater than l, then we remove [1, pos-1] which includes [1, l-1] and [l, pos-1]. But [l, pos-1] is part of the desired segment! That would be bad.\n\n    Therefore, we must close the left from exactly `l` (so that we remove only [1, l-1]). Similarly, for the right we must be at `r`.\n\n    So the above two options are forced.\n\n    However, there is a third option: maybe we don't need to close one of the sides? \n\n    Example: Input \"6 3 1 3\" -> output 1.\n\n    In this case: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n\n    We don't need to close the left because l=1 (no tabs to the left). But we need to close the right (because r=3, so we need to remove [4,6]). \n\n    Steps: \n        We are at 3. We can close the right (because 3<=3) so we just press the right closure (1 second). \n\n    Similarly, if we are not in the segment, we might have to move to the boundary.\n\n    Another example: \"5 2 1 5\" -> output 0.\n\n    But wait, what if the segment [l, r] is not contiguous with the entire set? We must close the sides.\n\n    So we must consider:\n\n      If l == 1 and r == n, then 0.\n\n      Else, we have to close at least one side.\n\n    However, there are two independent closures (left and right). We can do:\n\n      Option 1: Only close left (if l>1) and not close the right (if r==n) -> but wait, if r<n, then we must close the right as well.\n\n    Actually, we must close both sides if needed.\n\n    But note: we can also consider that we might not need to close a side if we are already at the boundary and the entire unwanted part is automatically closed? No, because the problem states that we can only close contiguous blocks from the cursor.\n\n    So the minimal steps are:\n\n      Let left_required = (l > 1)\n      Let right_required = (r < n)\n\n      If not left_required and not right_required: 0.\n\n      Otherwise, we must close at least one side.\n\n      Now, if we are in the segment [l, r]:\n\n        We have two options: \n          Option A: Go to the left boundary (l) and close the left, then go to the right boundary (r) and close the right.\n          Option B: Go to the right boundary (r) and close the right, then go to the left boundary (l) and close the left.\n\n        However, note: we don't necessarily have to go to both boundaries. We can also consider:\n\n        What if we are already at one of the boundaries? \n\n        Example: n=6, pos=1, l=1, r=3 (then we don't need to close left, but we need to close right). Then we are at 1 (which is l) so we can immediately close the right (if we are at 1, then we can close the right because 1<=3). Then we don't need to move for the right closure.\n\n        Similarly, if we are at n (and we need to close the left) then we can close the left.\n\n        Actually, the closure operations can be done from any position in the segment (as long as we are at the boundary we wish to use for closure). But note: for left closure we must be at l (to avoid closing too much) and for right closure we must be at r.\n\n        Therefore, we must move to l for left closure and to r for right closure.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          If left_required and right_required:\n            We can do:\n              Option 1: \n                Move from pos to l: |pos-l|\n                Then close left: 1\n                Then move from l to r: (r-l)  [because we are at l and we need to get to r for the right closure]\n                Then close right: 1\n                Total: |pos-l| + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n\n              Option 2:\n                Move from pos to r: |pos-r|\n                Then close right: 1\n                Then move from r to l: (r-l)  [because we are at r and we need to get to l for the left closure]\n                Then close left: 1\n                Total: |pos-r| + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n\n            But note: we might also consider a mixed strategy: move to one boundary and then the other, but we are already accounting for the entire movement.\n\n            However, is there a possibility that we can do one closure and then the other without the entire movement? \n\n            Actually, after the first closure, the boundaries change, but we are still constrained to the segment [l, r] (because we closed the left and then the right, or vice versa). The movement from l to r is necessary because we need to be at r to close the right.\n\n            But wait, what if we do:\n\n            Option 3: \n              Move to a point that allows both closures without going to both boundaries? \n\n            However, the closure operations require being at the boundary (l for left, r for right). So we must be at l to close the left and at r to close the right.\n\n          If only left_required (l>1 and r==n):\n            Then we must move to l (if we are not already at l) and then close the left.\n\n            Steps:\n              Move from pos to l: |pos-l|\n              Then close left: 1\n            Total: |pos-l| + 1\n\n          If only right_required (r<n and l==1):\n            Then we must move to r (if we are not already at r) and then close the right.\n\n            Steps:\n              Move from pos to r: |pos-r|\n              Then close right: 1\n            Total: |pos-r| + 1\n\n        However, wait: what if we are not in the segment [l, r]?\n\n        Example: n=6, pos=2, l=4, r=5.\n\n        We need to close the left (because 2<4) and the right (because 5<6). \n\n        Steps for Option 1 (left then right):\n\n          We are at 2. We need to close the left. To close the left without affecting the desired segment, we must be at l (which is 4). But wait, we are at 2, and we need to move to 4. Then we close the left (which will remove [1,3] and leave [4,6]). Then we need to close the right, so we must move from 4 to 5 (because to close the right we must be at r=5) and then close.\n\n          Total: |2-4| (2 seconds) + 1 (close left) + |4-5| (1 second) + 1 (close right) = 2+1+1+1 = 5.\n\n        But what if we close the right first? \n\n          We are at 2. To close the right, we must be at 5. So we move from 2 to 5 (3 seconds). Then close the right (removes [6,6]), leaving [1,5]. Then we need to close the left. We must move from 5 to 4 (1 second) and then close the left (which removes [1,3]). \n\n          Total: 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n        So Option 1 is better.\n\n        However, note: after closing the left, the right boundary becomes 6 (still) because we didn't close the right. But wait, initially the tabs are [1,2,...,6]. After closing the left from 4, we remove [1,3] so the remaining tabs are [4,5,6]. Then the right boundary is 6, and we need to close the right from 5 (so that we remove [6,6]). \n\n        But what if we don't have to go to 5? Actually, we must be at 5 to close the right (because if we are at 4, then the closure would remove [5,6] and that removes the desired tab 5). So we must be at 5.\n\n        Now, what if we are not in the segment? \n\n        We must first move into the segment. But note: the closure operations require being at the boundary (l or r) of the desired segment. However, we can also consider: \n\n        Another idea: maybe we can close the left from a position that is not l? \n\n        Let me re-read the problem: \"close all the tabs to the left\" closes from the current leftmost (which is the smallest index that is still open) to i-1. \n\n        In the example: n=6, pos=2, l=4, r=5.\n\n        We are at 2. The current leftmost is 1. If we close the left from 2, we remove [1,1]. Then the leftmost becomes 2. Then we have to remove [2,3] as well? But wait, we can do two separate closures? The problem doesn't say we can only do one closure per direction. Actually, the problem allows multiple closure operations. But note: the closure operation for the left will remove everything from the current leftmost to i-1. So if we are at 2, then the closure removes [1,1]. Then we can do another closure from 3 (if we move to 3) to remove [2,2] and then from 4 to remove nothing (if we move to 4) but wait, we are not allowed to close the left from 4 because that would remove [current_leftmost, 3]. But the current_leftmost is 2 (from the previous closure) and then we remove [2,3] which is acceptable because we want to leave [4,5,6]? But wait, we want to leave [4,5] (only). \n\n        However, the problem says: leave only the tabs with indices from l to r. So we must remove [1,3] and [6,6]. \n\n        But note: after the first closure (from 2: remove [1,1]), we still have [2,3,4,5,6]. Then we must remove [2,3] and [6]. \n\n        We can do:\n\n          Operation 1: Move from 2 to 3 (1 sec)\n          Operation 2: Close left from 3: removes [2,2] (current leftmost is 2) -> leaves [3,4,5,6] (not good because we lost 4 and 5? no, we still have 3,4,5,6)\n\n          Then Operation 3: Move from 3 to 4 (1 sec)\n          Operation 4: Close left from 4: removes [3,3] (current leftmost is 3) -> leaves [4,5,6] (still not [4,5] because 6 is still there)\n\n          Then Operation 5: Move from 4 to 5 (1 sec)\n          Operation 6: Close right from 5: removes [6,6] -> leaves [4,5].\n\n        Total: 6 seconds.\n\n        Alternatively, we can close the left from 3 in two steps: first from 3 we remove [2,2] and then from 4 we remove [3,3]. But that is two closure operations.\n\n        However, the problem does not restrict the number of closure operations. But note: the example solution for the first test was 5 seconds.\n\n        Why is the example solution 5? \n\n        Example: \"6 3 2 4\" -> Output 5.\n\n        Steps (from example):\n          Shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2 (1 sec)\n          Close all the tabs to the left (1 sec) -> now tabs are [2,3,4,5,6] becomes [2,3,4,5,6] without the left ones? Actually, no: from 2 we close the left: [1,1] -> now tabs [2,3,4,5,6]. Then shift to 3 (1 sec) and then to 4 (1 sec) and then close the right (1 sec). Total 5.\n\n        But wait, in the example, the desired segment is [2,4]. After the first closure, we have [2,3,4,5,6] which is not [2,4] because 5,6 are still open.\n\n        Actually, the example says: \"leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive\", so we must close everything outside [2,4]. \n\n        So after the first closure (closing left from 2) we have [2,3,4,5,6]. Then we must close the right. To close the right, we must be at 4 (so that we remove [5,6]). \n\n        Then the steps:\n\n          Start at 3 (initial cursor).\n          Move to 2: 1 sec (now cursor at 2)\n          Close left: 1 sec -> now tabs [2,3,4,5,6]\n          Move to 4: 2 more seconds (from 2->3->4) -> 2 seconds so far (total 3 seconds)\n          Close right: 1 sec -> now tabs [2,3,4]\n\n        Total 5 seconds.\n\n        But note: we moved from 3 to 2 (1 sec) and then from 2 to 4 (2 sec) so total movement 3, plus 2 closure operations.\n\n        So the key is: we must be at the boundary (l for left closure, r for right closure) to perform the closure without affecting the desired segment.\n\n        Now, if the cursor is not in the segment [l, r], then we must first move it into the segment to the nearest boundary (l or r) and then perform the closure operations.\n\n        Therefore, we can generalize:\n\n        We must close the left if l>1 and the right if r<n.\n\n        The minimal time is the minimum over:\n\n          Option 1: Close left first, then right.\n            Steps:\n              Move from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` is to the left of `l`, then we move right; if to the right, then we move left? Actually, we can move arbitrarily until we hit `l`). But wait, if `pos` is to the left of `l`, then we must move right to `l`. If `pos` is to the right of `l`, then we move left to `l` (unless we are already at `l` or beyond, but beyond is not allowed because we are only allowed to move within the current boundaries, but initially we have the entire set, so we can move to `l` from any position).\n\n            However, note: if `pos` is to the right of `r`, then we are not in [l, r] and we must move left to `l` (for left closure) or to `r` (for right closure). But if we are to the right of `r`, then we can also consider moving to `r` first and then to `l`? \n\n        Actually, we can break the problem into two cases:\n\n          Case 1: The current `pos` is in [l, r].\n          Case 2: The current `pos` is not in [l, r].\n\n        But note: even if `pos` is in [l, r], we might have to move to one of the boundaries (l or r) to perform the closure.\n\n        However, the above analysis for the case when `pos` is in [l, r] already considered the two options (left then right, or right then left) and we computed the cost as:\n\n          Option A: |pos-l| + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n          Option B: |pos-r| + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n\n        But wait, the (r-l) is the distance from the boundary we are at (after the first closure) to the opposite boundary. However, if we are in [l, r], we don't have to traverse the entire segment? \n\n        Actually, we must move from l to r (if we did left first) and from r to l (if we did right first) because we are at the boundary and we need to get to the other boundary to perform the second closure.\n\n        But what if we do:\n\n          Option C: Maybe we can do the two closures without moving the entire segment? \n\n        Example: if we are at a position in the middle, say l=2, r=5, and pos=3.\n\n          Option A: \n            Move from 3 to 2: 1 sec\n            Close left: 1 sec -> now we are at 2, and the segment is [2,5] (we haven't closed the right yet). Then we need to close the right. We must move from 2 to 5: 3 sec, then close right: 1 sec. Total: 1+1+3+1 = 6.\n\n          Option B:\n            Move from 3 to 5: 2 sec\n            Close right: 1 sec -> then move from 5 to 2: 3 sec, then close left: 1 sec. Total: 2+1+3+1 = 7.\n\n        But wait, we don't actually have to move the entire segment from one boundary to the other if we can do the second closure from the same boundary? \n\n        Actually, no: the second closure requires being at the opposite boundary.\n\n        However, we might consider: after the first closure, the boundaries change. But note: the closure operation doesn't change the boundaries in a way that affects the opposite closure? \n\n        For example, if we close the left, then the leftmost becomes l (which is 2) and the rightmost is still n (unless we close the right). Then to close the right, we must be at r (which is 5). \n\n        So the movement from the first boundary (l) to the second boundary (r) is necessary.\n\n        But note: we can also consider that we might not need to close both sides if one side is already closed by accident? \n\n        Actually, we must close exactly the two sides (if needed). \n\n        Now, what if the cursor is outside [l, r]? \n\n        Example: pos < l\n\n          Then we must move to l (to close the left) and then to r (to close the right). But wait, we can also close the right first? \n\n          Steps for Option 1 (left then right) when pos < l:\n            Move from pos to l: (l - pos) seconds.\n            Close left: 1 second.\n            Then move from l to r: (r - l) seconds.\n            Close right: 1 second.\n            Total: (l-pos) + 1 + (r-l) + 1 = (l-pos + r-l) + 2 = (r-pos) + 2.\n\n          Steps for Option 2 (right then left) when pos < l:\n            We must first close the right, but to close the right we must be at r. But we are at pos (which is < l <= r). So we can move to r: (r-pos) seconds.\n            Close right: 1 second.\n            Then we must close the left: so we must move from r to l: (r-l) seconds? But wait, we are at r and we need to be at l (which is <= r) so we move left from r to l: (r-l) seconds.\n            Close left: 1 second.\n            Total: (r-pos) + 1 + (r-l) + 1 = (r-pos + r-l) + 2.\n\n          Which is worse because r-pos + r-l >= r-pos + (r-l) and (r-l) is positive.\n\n          So Option 1 is better.\n\n        Similarly, if pos > r:\n\n          Option 1 (left then right):\n            Move from pos to l: (pos-l) seconds.\n            Close left: 1 second.\n            Then move from l to r: (r-l) seconds.\n            Close right: 1 second.\n            Total: (pos-l) + 1 + (r-l) + 1 = (pos-l + r-l) + 2.\n\n          Option 2 (right then left):\n            Move from pos to r: (pos-r) seconds.\n            Close right: 1 second.\n            Then move from r to l: (r-l) seconds.\n            Close left: 1 second.\n            Total: (pos-r) + 1 + (r-l) + 1 = (pos-r + r-l) + 2.\n\n          Now compare (pos-l + r-l) and (pos-r + r-l): \n            (pos-l + r-l) = (pos + r - 2*l)\n            (pos-r + r-l) = (pos - l)\n\n          Since l<=r and pos>r, then (pos-l) is positive and (pos+r-2*l) = (pos-l) + (r-l) which is larger than (pos-l). So Option 2 is better.\n\n        And if the cursor is in [l, r]?\n\n          Option 1: |pos-l| + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n          Option 2: |pos-r| + 1 + (r-l) + 1\n\n          But note: (r-l) is fixed. So we choose the minimum of |pos-l| and |pos-r|.\n\n        However, wait: in the example \"6 3 1 3\", we are at 3 (which is in [1,3]), and we only need to close the right (because l==1). Then we don't need to close the left. So we must consider the condition: we only do the closure for the side that is required.\n\n        Therefore, we must break down:\n\n          Let left_req = (l > 1)\n          Let right_req = (r < n)\n\n          Then:\n\n          if not left_req",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to leave only the tabs within the segment [l, r] open in her browser. The solution involves analyzing the initial position of the cursor and the required segment to decide the optimal sequence of operations (moving the cursor or closing tabs) to achieve the desired state.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Luba starts with `n` tabs, the cursor at position `pos`, and needs to leave tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive.\n   - Operations include moving the cursor left or right (costs 1 second per move) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (costs 1 second per operation).\n   - The key observation is that to close all tabs outside [l, r], the cursor must be positioned at `l` to close the left part and at `r` to close the right part without affecting the desired segment.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - If the entire segment [l, r] is already the only open tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed.\n   - Otherwise, we need to close either the left part (if `l > 1`), the right part (if `r < n`), or both.\n   - The minimal time is determined by considering the distance from the initial cursor position to the nearest boundary (`l` or `r`) and the subsequent movements required to perform the necessary closures.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - For each test case, check if no closures are needed.\n   - If only one side needs closure, calculate the time as the distance from `pos` to the boundary plus one second for the closure.\n   - If both sides need closure, compute the time for two strategies: moving to `l` first or moving to `r` first, and choose the minimal time between them.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1) per test case, suitable for the given constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    pos = int(data[1])\n    l_val = int(data[2])\n    r_val = int(data[3])\n    \n    if l_val == 1 and r_val == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_req = (l_val > 1)\n    right_req = (r_val < n)\n    \n    if not left_req and not right_req:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_req and not right_req:\n        dist_to_l = abs(pos - l_val)\n        print(dist_to_l + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if right_req and not left_req:\n        dist_to_r = abs(pos - r_val)\n        print(dist_to_r + 1)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = abs(pos - l_val) + 1 + (r_val - l_val) + 1\n    option2 = abs(pos - r_val) + 1 + (r_val - l_val) + 1\n    \n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), the answer is 0 since no operations are needed.\n- **Single Closure Check**: If only one side (left or right) needs closure, the answer is the distance from the initial cursor position to the respective boundary plus one second for the closure operation.\n- **Double Closure Handling**: If both sides need closure, the solution calculates the time for two strategies:\n  - Moving to `l` first, then to `r`.\n  - Moving to `r` first, then to `l`.\n- The minimal time between these two strategies is chosen as the answer, ensuring optimal performance. \n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures the minimal number of operations by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional logic.",
