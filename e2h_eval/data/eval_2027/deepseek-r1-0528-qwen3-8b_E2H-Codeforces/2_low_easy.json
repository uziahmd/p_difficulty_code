Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter must be different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the diagonals might have two different letters? Actually, the problem says:\n   - The diagonals must be the same letter? Actually, the condition is: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n     But note: the example input includes:\n        Input: 3\n                wsw\n                sws\n                wsw\n\n        Output: YES\n\n        In this example, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] -> not all same? Actually wait: \n        Let me check the example: \n          Row0: 'w','s','w'\n          Row1: 's','w','s'\n          Row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n        The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right): [ (0,0):'w', (1,1):'w', (2,2):'w' ] -> all 'w'\n        The anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left): [ (0,2):'w', (1,1):'w', (2,0):'w' ] -> all 'w'\n\n        But wait, in the example, the center is included in both diagonals. So we must consider that the center is common.\n\n        However, the example input also includes:\n          Input: 5\n                  xooox\n                  oxoxo\n                  soxoo\n                  oxoxo\n                  xooox\n\n        Output: NO\n\n        Why? Because the diagonals should be the same letter, but let's see:\n\n        Main diagonal: \n          [ (0,0)='x', (1,1)='o', (2,2)='s', (3,3)='o', (4,4)='x' ] -> not all same.\n\n        So actually, the condition is that the entire main diagonal must be the same letter and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter, but they can be different?\n\n        Wait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't say the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n        However, the example output for the third sample is \"NO\", and the third sample is:\n\n          3\n          xpx\n          pxp\n          xpe\n\n        Let's break down:\n\n        Condition 1: Diagonals must be same.\n\n        Main diagonal: [ (0,0)='x', (1,1)='p', (2,2)='e' ] -> not same -> fails.\n\n        But wait, the example input has:\n          ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        And the expected outputs are: ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n        So the first sample: \n          n=5, and the diagonals are not the same letter (main diagonal: ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> not same; anti-diagonal: ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> not same) -> fails.\n\n        Second sample: \n          n=3, and both diagonals are ['w','w','w'] and ['w','w','w'] -> same on each diagonal.\n\n        Third sample: \n          n=3, main diagonal: ['x','p','e'] -> not same -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for the diagonals is that each diagonal individually must have the same letter, but the two diagonals can be different.\n\n        Then condition 2: All non-diagonal squares must contain the same letter, which is different from the two diagonal letters (if the two diagonals have different letters, then the non-diagonal letter must be different from both? Actually, note: the problem says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\".\n\n        But what if the two diagonals have different letters? Then the non-diagonal letter must be different from both? Or just from the diagonals? \n\n        The problem says: \"different from the letters on the diagonals\". Since the diagonals have two distinct letters, then the non-diagonal letter must be different from both.\n\n        However, note: the non-diagonal squares must be the same letter and also different from the diagonals. So if the diagonals are made of two different letters, then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms an \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: Letters from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: Letters from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n   Each diagonal must consist of the same letter, though the two diagonals can have different letters.\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Letters**:\n   - All letters not on either diagonal must be the same.\n   - This common letter must differ from the letters on both diagonals.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure the grid size is odd (as given) and handle cases where the diagonals or non-diagonals do not meet the conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag1_letter = None\n    diag2_letter = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                if diag1_letter is None:\n                    diag1_letter = grid[i][j]\n                elif grid[i][j] != diag1_letter:\n                    diag1_letter = None\n                    break\n            if i + j == n - 1:\n                if diag2_letter is None:\n                    diag2_letter = grid[i][j]\n                elif grid[i][j] != diag2_letter:\n                    diag2_letter = None\n                    break\n        if diag1_letter is None or diag2_letter is None:\n            break\n            \n    if diag1_letter is None or diag2_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            elif grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                non_diag_letter = None\n                break\n        if non_diag_letter is None:\n            break\n            \n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if non_diag_letter == diag1_letter or non_diag_letter == diag2_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the grid size `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Checking Diagonals**: It checks each element on both the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`). If any element on these diagonals differs from the first encountered element, it sets the corresponding diagonal letter to `None`.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: After verifying both diagonals are uniform, it checks all other elements to ensure they are the same letter. If any element differs, it sets the non-diagonal letter to `None`.\n4. **Final Validation**: The non-diagonal letter must differ from both diagonal letters. If all conditions are met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms an \"X\" as specified.",
