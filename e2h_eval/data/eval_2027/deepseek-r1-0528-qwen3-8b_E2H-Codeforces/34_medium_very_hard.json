And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, the average is the sum of the k consecutive days divided by k.\n But note: the problem says \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks\", meaning we have to compute the average for each week and then what? Actually, wait.\n\n Let's read the example: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> Output: '9.0000000000'\n\n How?\n   There are two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7].\n   The average for the first week: (3+4)/2 = 3.5\n   The average for the second week: (4+7)/2 = 5.5\n   Then what? The example output is 9.0.\n\n But note: the example in the problem statement says:\n   \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n However, looking at the provided example outputs:\n\n Example 1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> Output: '9.0000000000'\n Example 2: \"1 1\\n10\" -> Output: '10.0000000000'\n Example 3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" -> Output: '28964.2857142857'\n\n Let me recalc example 1:\n\n   They are considering the average of the averages? That doesn't make sense because:\n\n   (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 9/2 = 4.5, which is not 9.\n\n Alternatively, note that the example output is 9.0.\n\n What if we do: total_sleep = (3+4+7) * something?\n\n Another interpretation: the problem says \"the average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks\".\n\n But note: there are two weeks. The total sleep over the two weeks is (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18.\n Then the average per week is 18 / (number of weeks) but wait: no, because each week has k days.\n\n Actually, the problem might be asking for the average of the averages? Or the overall average?\n\n Let me re-read: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\".\n\n However, note that the example output for the first case is 9.0.\n\n Another possibility: they are calculating the overall average of the sleep time per day, but over the entire period, but weighted by the fact that each day is part of multiple weeks? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"consider k consecutive days as a week\" and then \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\".\n\n So the average per week is defined as (sum of the week) / k.\n\n Now, the problem asks for the average sleeping time over all weeks. This could be interpreted as:\n\n   (average_week1 + average_week2 + ... + average_week_{n-k+1}) / (n-k+1)\n\n But then example1: (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 4.5, which is not 9.0.\n\n Alternatively, maybe they want the average of the sleep time when considering each day's sleep time equally? \n\n Let's think: we have n days, and we are going to consider each day's sleep time in multiple weeks. The total sleep time over all weeks is:\n\n   For day i, it appears in (k - |i - j| for j from i-k+1 to i?) Actually, day i appears in (n - i + 1) and (i) days? \n\n Actually, the total sleep time summed over all weeks is:\n\n   total = a1*(min(k, n)) + a2*(min(k, n-1)) ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a sliding window:\n\n   Let S be the total sleep time for the entire period, but note: the same day is repeated in multiple windows.\n\n   Specifically, the first day is only in the first window, the second day is in the first and second, ... until the k-th day is in the first window, then the next day is in two windows? Actually:\n\n   For day i (0-indexed), it appears in min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) ? \n\n Actually, the number of weeks that include day i is:\n   If i < k: then the day i is included in the first (i+1) weeks? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, the day i is included in the windows starting from max(0, i-k+1) to i (if i < n). But note, the window starts from index 0 to n-k.\n\n   Alternatively, the day i is included in the windows that start from j such that j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n   So the number of windows including day i is: min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k+1) ? \n\n   Actually, the condition is: j must satisfy j <= i and j+k-1 >= i, and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n   => j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and j>=0, j<=n-k.\n\n   So the number of j is: min(i+1, n-i, k) ? \n\n   Actually, the valid j are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). Therefore, count = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n   But note: we can also think of the total sleep time as:\n\n        total_sleep_all_weeks = sum_{j=0}^{n-k} (sum_{i=j}^{j+k-1} a_i)\n\n   And then the average per week is the total_sleep_all_weeks divided by (n-k+1) ? \n\n   But wait, that would be the average of the weekly totals, not the average of the weekly averages.\n\n   However, note that the example output is 9.0 for the first example.\n\n   In the first example, total_sleep_all_weeks = (3+4) + (4+7) = 18, and the number of weeks is 2, so 18/2 = 9.0.\n\n   So the problem is: calculate the total sleep time over all weeks and then divide by the number of weeks.\n\n   But wait, let's check with example 2: n=1, k=1, one week: [10]. Then total_sleep_all_weeks = 10, and number of weeks = 1, so 10/1 = 10.0 -> matches.\n\n   Example 3: n=8, k=2, so 7 weeks.\n\n        Week1: [1,2] -> 3\n        Week2: [2,4] -> 6\n        Week3: [4,100000] -> 100004\n        Week4: [100000,123] -> 100123\n        Week5: [123,456] -> 579\n        Week6: [456,789] -> 1245\n        Week7: [789,1] -> 790\n\n        Total = 3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = ?\n\n        Then divide by 7.\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n          3+6 = 9\n          9+100004 = 100013\n          100013+100123 = 200136\n          200136+579 = 200715\n          200715+1245 = 201960\n          201960+790 = 202750\n\n        Then 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        Which matches the third example.\n\n   Therefore, the problem is: \n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sleep = sum_{start=0}^{n-k} (sum_{i=start}^{start+k-1} a[i])\n\n        Then answer = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   But note: the naive way would be O(n*k) which is too slow for n,k up to 200000.\n\n   We need to compute the total_sleep efficiently.\n\n   We can precompute a prefix sum array for the list a.\n\n   Let prefix[0] = 0, and prefix[i] = a0+a1+...+a_{i-1}\n\n   Then the sum for a window starting at i is: prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n   Then total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n   But note: this is the same as:\n\n        = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n] - prefix[n-k])\n\n   And we can rearrange:\n\n        = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n   So we can compute two prefix sums: one for the prefix array (which we already have) and then the sums of two parts.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that the entire array is covered multiple times. But note: the above formula is straightforward.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read n, k and the list a.\n        Precompute prefix: \n            prefix[0] = 0\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n        Then, total_sleep = 0\n        for i from 0 to n-k:\n            total_sleep += (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   However, note that the above loop runs (n-k+1) times, which is acceptable if n is 200000? But wait, 200000 iterations is acceptable, but we can avoid the loop by using prefix sums.\n\n   Alternatively, we can express total_sleep as:\n\n        total_sleep = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n   But note: we can compute the sum of a segment of the prefix array by having a second prefix (or by using a Fenwick tree or segment tree) but since our prefix array is just an array, we can precompute a prefix-sum of the prefix array? \n\n   However, we can also note:\n\n        total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} prefix[i+k] - sum_{i=0}^{n-k} prefix[i]\n\n        = [prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]] - [prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k]]\n\n   We can compute these two parts by having another prefix array for the prefix array? Or we can use a simple for loop for the two segments, but that would be O(n) anyway.\n\n   Since n is 200000, we can do:\n\n        part1 = sum(prefix[k: n+1])   # from index k to n (inclusive)\n        part2 = sum(prefix[0: n-k+1])  # from index 0 to n-k (inclusive)\n\n        total_sleep = part1 - part2\n\n   But note: the prefix array has length n+1, so indices from 0 to n.\n\n   Example with n=3, k=2:\n\n        a = [3,4,7]\n        prefix = [0,3,7,14]\n\n        part1 = prefix[2] + prefix[3] = 7 + 14 = 21\n        part2 = prefix[0] + prefix[1] = 0+3 = 3\n        total_sleep = 21 - 3 = 18\n\n        total_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n        average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n   So that works.\n\n   However, we can also compute the two parts without building a new array for the entire prefix array's prefix? \n\n   But we already built the prefix array, so we can use slicing and sum.\n\n   But note: n and k can be up to 200000, and slicing and summing a list of 200000 elements is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n   However, we can do better by using a prefix-sum for the prefix array? Actually, we don't need to because we are already storing the prefix array.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        part1 = prefix_sum_of_prefix_array from index k to n.\n\n        But we can compute the sum of the prefix array from L to R by:\n\n            total = prefix_total[R+1] - prefix_total[L]\n\n        But we don't have a prefix_total array. We can build one for the prefix array? \n\n        Actually, we can precompute the entire prefix array, and then use:\n\n            total_sum_prefix_from_0_to_m = prefix_total[m+1] (if we define prefix_total[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i-1} prefix[j])\n\n        But we don't have that. \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            total_sleep = (sum(prefix[k:]) - sum(prefix[:n-k+1]))\n\n        But note: the prefix array has length n+1.\n\n        We can compute the entire sum of the prefix array from 0 to n as:\n\n            total_prefix_sum = sum(prefix)\n\n        But then we need the sum from k to n, and from 0 to n-k.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            part1 = total_prefix_sum - sum(prefix[0:k])\n            part2 = sum(prefix[0:n-k+1])\n\n        However, that doesn't match because the indices for part1 are from k to n (inclusive) and the prefix array has n+1 elements.\n\n        Let me define:\n\n            prefix = [p0, p1, p2, ..., pn] (length n+1)\n\n        Then:\n\n            part1 = p_k + p_{k+1} + ... + p_n\n\n            part2 = p_0 + p_1 + ... + p_{n-k}\n\n        We can compute part1 as: total_prefix_sum - (p0 + p1 + ... + p_{k-1})\n        We can compute part2 as: (p0 + p1 + ... + p_{n-k})\n\n        So:\n\n            total_sleep = part1 - part2 = (total_prefix_sum - sum(prefix[0:k])) - sum(prefix[0:n-k+1])\n\n        But wait, is that correct?\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, prefix=[0,3,7,14]\n\n        total_prefix_sum = 0+3+7+14 = 24\n        part1 = 24 - (0+3) = 21\n        part2 = sum(prefix[0:3]) = 0+3+7 = 10\n        total_sleep = 21 - 10 = 11 -> which is not 18.\n\n        Why? Because part2 should be from index0 to index (n-k) inclusive, which is index0 to index1 (since n-k=1) -> [0,3] -> 0+3=3.\n\n        So we must take the slice correctly.\n\n        Actually, note that the prefix array has indices from 0 to n (so n+1 elements). \n\n        We want:\n\n            part1: from index k (which is index2) to index n (index3): so [7,14] -> 21.\n\n            part2: from index0 to index (n-k) (which is 1): [0,3] -> 3.\n\n        How to compute part1: \n            part1 = sum(prefix[k:])   # from index k to the end (index n)\n\n        How to compute part2:\n            part2 = sum(prefix[0:n-k+1])   # from index0 to index (n-k) (inclusive)\n\n        Then total_sleep = part1 - part2.\n\n        But note: the prefix array is of length n+1, so:\n\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k: n+1])   because the last element is at index n (which is the (n)-th element, and there are n+1 elements).\n\n        However, in Python, prefix[n] is the last element. So:\n\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k: n+1])\n\n        But we can use:\n\n            part1 = sum(prefix) - sum(prefix[0:k])\n\n        Because the entire prefix array has n+1 elements, and we want to remove the first k elements.\n\n        Similarly, part2 is the first (n-k+1) elements.\n\n        But wait, the entire prefix array is from index0 to index n (n+1 elements). \n\n        Then:\n\n            part1 = total_sum - sum(prefix[0:k])   [because the entire array has n+1 elements, and we remove the first k elements, leaving from k to n]\n\n        And part2 = sum(prefix[0: n-k+1])\n\n        Then total_sleep = part1 - part2.\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, prefix=[0,3,7,14]\n\n        total_sum = 0+3+7+14 = 24\n        part1 = 24 - (0+3) = 21\n        part2 = 0+3+7 = 10?  -> wait, n-k+1 = 3-2+1 = 2, so we take prefix[0:2] -> [0,3] -> 3.\n\n        So why did I get 10? Because I took n-k+1 = 2, then the slice prefix[0:2] is [0,3] and the sum is 3.\n\n        But note: the example part2 was 3, so then total_sleep = 21 - 3 = 18.\n\n        But wait, how did I get 10 above? I mistakenly thought n-k+1 was 3? Actually, n=3, k=2, so n-k+1=2.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Build prefix array of length n+1\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_sum = sum(prefix)   # This is the entire prefix array (n+1 numbers)\n\n            part1 = total_sum - sum(prefix[:k])\n            part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n\n            total_sleep = part1 - part2\n\n        However, note: the prefix array has n+1 elements, and we are taking the first k elements for part1 removal.\n\n        But wait, is part1 the same as the entire prefix array minus the first k? \n\n            Entire prefix array: [0, p1, p2, ..., pn]\n            Removing the first k: [pk, pk+1, ..., pn] -> which is what we want.\n\n        But then part2 is the first (n-k+1) elements: [0, p1, ..., p_{n-k}].\n\n        Then total_sleep = (pk + pk+1 + ... + pn) - (0 + p1 + ... + p_{n-k})\n\n        This matches our previous calculation.\n\n        However, note: the two methods (using slicing and summing) for part1 and part2 are both O(n) and we are already building the prefix array in O(n). But the entire operation is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the total_sum is O(n) and then sum(prefix[:k]) is O(k) and sum(prefix[:n-k+1]) is O(n). \n\n        Since k and n-k+1 can be large, but we are doing two slices and two sums, the total operations are about O(n). \n\n        However, we can do without building the entire prefix array for the entire array? Actually, we built the prefix array for the original a, which is necessary.\n\n        But note: we can compute the entire prefix array and then use the built-in sum function. \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the total_sleep without building the entire prefix array for the entire array? \n\n        Actually, we can use a single pass for the prefix array and then use two more passes for the two parts? \n\n        But we already built the prefix array, so let's stick with that.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say n up to 200000, and the entire array has 200000+1 elements, so the sum of the prefix array (which is the cumulative sums) might be very large. But that's okay because we are just doing integer arithmetic.\n\n        But wait: the numbers a[i] are up to 10^5, and n up to 200000, so the maximum prefix value is about 10^5 * 200000 = 2e10, which is within the range of Python integers.\n\n        However, we are summing the prefix array (which has 200001 elements) of integers up to 2e10, so the total_sum might be around 2e10 * 200000? Actually, no: the prefix array is the cumulative sum, so the last element is 2e10, and the others are increasing. The total_sum of the prefix array would be the sum of the cumulative sums. \n\n        Actually, the cumulative sum array is non-decreasing and the last element is S = (sum of a) which is at most 200000 * 10^5 = 2e10.\n\n        The entire prefix array has n+1 = 200001 elements, and the values are increasing from 0 to 2e10. The average value is about (0+2e10)/2 = 1e10, so the total_sum is about 200001 * 1e10 = 2e15, which is acceptable in Python (integers can be arbitrarily large, but 2e15 is not a problem for performance).\n\n        However, we can avoid building the entire prefix array and then summing the entire prefix array by using the two parts we need.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            total_sleep = 0\n            for i in range(n-k+1):\n                total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        But this is O(n) and we are already building the prefix array. However, the above method is simpler and also O(n). \n\n        But note: the above method does a loop of n-k+1, which is about 200000, and each iteration is O(1). \n\n        We can do either.\n\n        However, the method with two slices and two sums is also O(n) but with two additional passes (one for the entire prefix and then two for the slices). \n\n        Actually, the two-slice method:\n\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n            part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n\n        These two lines each do a pass of about n elements (each). So the total work is O(n) for building the prefix array and then O(n) for the two slices.\n\n        The alternative (without building the entire prefix array for the entire array) is not needed because we need the prefix array to compute the window sums.\n\n        Let me choose the direct loop for total_sleep, because it is straightforward and we are already building the prefix array.\n\n        Code:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Build prefix array of length n+1\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_weeks = n - k + 1\n            total_sleep = 0\n            for i in range(total_weeks):\n                # Each week starts at index i, and goes to i+k-1\n                # The sum for the week is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n                total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        But wait, is the total_sleep computed correctly?\n\n            For the first week: i=0 -> prefix[k] - prefix[0]\n            For the second week: i=1 -> prefix[k+1] - prefix[1]\n\n            Then total_sleep = (prefix[k]-prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1]-prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n]-prefix[total_weeks-1])\n\n            But note: the last week starts at index n-k (because i goes from 0 to n-k) and then uses prefix[n] - prefix[n-k]\n\n            This is correct.\n\n        However, we can use the fact that the total_sleep is the same as the two-slice method.\n\n        But note: the above loop runs total_weeks (which is n-k+1) times, and n-k+1 can be up to 200000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But is there a way to do it without a loop? \n\n        We can use:\n\n            total_sleep = sum(prefix[i+k] for i in range(total_weeks)) - sum(prefix[i] for i in range(total_weeks))\n\n        But that's essentially the same as the two-slice method.\n\n        However, the two-slice method is:\n\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k: k+total_weeks])   -> wait, no, because the indices for the first element of each window's end is from k to n (inclusive). \n\n        Actually, the ends are from k to n (both inclusive). The starts are from 0 to n-k (inclusive). \n\n        So:\n\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k: n+1])\n            part2 = sum(prefix[0: n-k+1])\n\n        And then total_sleep = part1 - part2.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n            part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n\n        But note: the prefix array has n+1 elements, so prefix[k:] is from index k to n (inclusive) and prefix[:n-k+1] is from 0 to n-k (inclusive).\n\n        Then:\n\n            total_sleep = part1 - part2\n\n        This is equivalent to the loop.\n\n        Which one is faster?\n\n        The two-slice method does two slices and two sums, each of which is O(n). \n\n        The loop method does a loop of n-k+1 steps, each step a constant-time operation.\n\n        Since n-k+1 can be large, but we are doing a simple addition, and the two-slice method is also O(n), we can choose either.\n\n        However, the two-slice method might be faster because it's two built-in sum calls on slices that are precomputed, and the underlying C code might be faster than a Python for-loop.\n\n        But note: the two-slice method requires building the entire prefix array, and then two slices. The memory is the same.\n\n        Let me write the two-slice method:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_weeks = n - k + 1\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k:])        # from index k to the end\n            part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])    # from index 0 to index n-k\n\n            total_sleep = part1 - part2\n\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2 -> part1 = prefix[2:4] = [7,14] -> 21; part2 = prefix[0:2] = [0,3] -> 3; total_sleep=18.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the two-slice method is more efficient in terms of code length and clarity, and the performance is acceptable.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the two-slice method creates two slices, which are views, and then the sum function iterates over them. The total number of elements is (n+1 - k) + (n-k+1) = 2*n - 2*k + 2, which is about 2*n, so O(n).\n\n        The loop method also does O(n) operations.\n\n        But the two-slice method might be faster because it uses built-in C code for the sum and slicing.\n\n        However, let me test with n=200000. We'll generate a large array and time both methods.\n\n        But since the problem constraints are 200000, and both are O(n), we can choose either.\n\n        I'll choose the two-slice method for clarity.\n\n        But wait: what if k==0? The problem states k>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Also, what if k==n? Then total_weeks=1, and part1 = sum(prefix[n:]) = prefix[n] (since n is the last index, so prefix[n:] is [prefix[n]]), and part2 = sum(prefix[:1]) = prefix[0] (which is 0). Then total_sleep = prefix[n] - 0 = prefix[n] = sum(a). Then average = prefix[n] / 1 = prefix[n]. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_weeks = n - k + 1\n            # Calculate the sum of the prefix array from index k to the end (inclusive)\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n            # Calculate the sum of the prefix array from index 0 to index (n-k) (inclusive)\n            part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n            total_sleep = part1 - part2\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        Then format the average to have 10 decimal places.\n\n        However, the problem says: output the average with at least 6 digits after the decimal point, but the example outputs have 10 digits.\n\n        We can use formatting.\n\n        Example: print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n        But note: the average might be integer, so we want trailing zeros.\n\n        Example: 9.0 -> 9.0000000000\n\n        Using formatting with 'f' and 10 digits will give that.\n\n        However, we must be cautious for floating point precision. But the numbers are integers and the division is by an integer (n-k+1) which is at most 200000, so the floating point representation should be exact for integers and fractions that are representable.\n\n        But note: the total_sleep is an integer (because it's the sum of integers) and the division by an integer (total_weeks) might not be exact? \n\n        Example: 18/2=9.0, but 202750/7 is not an integer. But the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n        However, we are doing integer division and then converting to float? Actually, in Python, when we do integer division by float, we get a float.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6\".\n\n        We can use:\n\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks   # this is a float\n\n        Then format it.\n\n        Let me test with the examples.\n\n        Example1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> total_sleep=18, total_weeks=2 -> average=9.0 -> format to '9.0000000000'\n\n        Example2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> total_sleep=10, total_weeks=1 -> 10.0 -> '10.0000000000'\n\n        Example3: n=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] -> total_sleep=202750, total_weeks=7 -> 202750/7 = 28964.285714285714... -> format to '28964.2857142857'\n\n        We have to output 10 digits.\n\n        But note: the example output is '28964.2857142857'\n\n        However, when we format, we get:\n\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(28964.285714285714))\n\n        This will round to 10 decimal places.\n\n        But the example output has 10 digits: 28964.2857142857\n\n        The actual value is 28964.2857142857142857..., so rounding to 10 decimal places is 28964.2857142857.\n\n        However, let me check:\n\n            x = 28964.2857142857142857\n            formatted = \"{:.10f}\".format(x)\n\n        But note: the formatting rounds to the nearest value with 10 decimal places.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the total_sleep is an integer, but the division by total_weeks (an integer) might not be exact. But the problem allows an error of 1e-6, so even if we use floating point, as long as we round appropriately, it should be fine.\n\n        But note: the total_sleep and total_weeks are integers, so the division is exact in real numbers, but in floating point it might have rounding errors for large numbers? \n\n        However, the numbers are up to 2e10 (for total_sleep) and total_weeks up to 200000, so the quotient is about 1e5, which is within the range where floating point has more than enough precision (about 15 decimal digits).\n\n        So we can safely use float.\n\n        But note: we are dealing with integers, and the division is exact in base 10? Not necessarily, but the problem requires 1e-6 error.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks   # as float\n\n        Then format to 10 decimal places.\n\n        Let me code accordingly.\n\n        However, there is an edge: if the total_sleep is zero, but the constraints say ai>=1, so no.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Build the prefix array\n            prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_weeks = n - k + 1\n            part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n            part2 = sum(prefix[:n-k+1])\n            total_sleep = part1 - part2\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n        But wait, let me test with the examples.\n\n        Example1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7] -> \n            prefix = [0,3,7,14]\n            part1 = sum(prefix[2:]) = 7+14 = 21\n            part2 = sum(prefix[0:2]) = 0+3 = 3\n            total_sleep = 21-3=18\n            average = 18/2 = 9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n        Example2: n=1, k=1, a=[10] -> \n            prefix = [0,10]\n            part1 = sum(prefix[1:])",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks to consider. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for all weeks and then finding the average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires processing each window of `k` consecutive days in the given list of `n` days, summing the sleep times for each window, and then averaging these sums over all windows. Directly computing each window's sum would be inefficient for large `n` (up to 200,000), leading to an O(n*k) solution which is not feasible.\n\n2. **Intuition**: We can leverage prefix sums to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. By precomputing a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the original array, we can quickly calculate the sum of any subarray from index `i` to `j` as `prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in O(1) time.\n   - **Total Sleep Calculation**: For all windows of size `k`, the total sleep time is the sum of all elements in these windows. Using the prefix array, this can be derived by summing specific segments of the prefix array and subtracting them appropriately.\n   - **Average Calculation**: The average is simply the total sleep time divided by the number of windows (`n - k + 1`).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for building the prefix array and O(n) for summing the relevant segments, resulting in an overall linear time complexity, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the prefix array, which is necessary to achieve the linear time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    part1 = sum(prefix[k:])\n    part2 = sum(prefix[:total_weeks])\n    total_sleep = part1 - part2\n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the length of a week `k`, and the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Array Construction**: The prefix array is built such that each element `prefix[i]` contains the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows efficient range sum queries.\n3. **Total Sleep Calculation**: The total sleep time over all windows is computed by summing the relevant segments of the prefix array. Specifically, `part1` is the sum of the prefix array from index `k` to the end, and `part2` is the sum from the start to index `n - k`. The difference between these sums gives the total sleep time across all windows.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time per week is obtained by dividing the total sleep time by the number of windows (`n - k + 1`). The result is formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n5. **Output**: The computed average is printed with the required formatting.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging prefix sums to reduce the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes.",
