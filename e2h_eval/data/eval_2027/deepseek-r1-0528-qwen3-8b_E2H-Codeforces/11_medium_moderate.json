A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink available: k * l milliliters.\n    - Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend? Actually, note: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n      But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    However, note that the group has n friends and they are making toasts such that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n    The key: \n      Total drink needed for T toasts (for the whole group) is T * n * nl? \n      But wait, let's read again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So for T toasts, one friend needs T * nl milliliters.\n      Then the whole group of n friends needs n * T * nl milliliters.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think in terms of the entire group:\n\n    However, the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n    Here: n=3 (friends), k=4, l=5 (so total drink = 20 ml)\n          Each toast: 3 ml per friend -> so for 3 friends, one toast requires 3*3 = 9 ml? \n          But wait, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\".\n\n    Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So for one toast, the entire group uses n * nl milliliters.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of toasts (for the entire group) is limited by:\n        Drink: (k * l) / (n * nl)   [because each toast requires n * nl milliliters for the whole group?]\n\n    But wait, actually: if we have T toasts, then the drink used is T * (n * nl) because each toast requires n * nl ml for the entire group?\n    However, note: the problem states that each friend needs nl milliliters for one toast. So one toast for the entire group (with n friends) requires n * nl ml.\n\n    Similarly, for limes: one toast requires one slice per friend? Actually, the problem says \"a slice of lime\", but note the context: \n        They have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total slices = c * d.\n\n    And for salt: each toast requires np grams per friend? No, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... np grams of salt\" for one toast? \n        Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n    So for one toast, the entire group uses:\n        Drink: n * nl ml\n        Lime slices: n slices (since each friend gets one slice per toast)\n        Salt: n * np grams\n\n    Therefore, the limiting factors are:\n        Total toasts by drink: T_drink = (k * l) / (n * nl)\n        Total toasts by lime: T_lime = (c * d) / n   [because each toast uses n slices, so total slices must be at least n*T]\n        Total toasts by salt: T_salt = p / (n * np)   [because each toast uses n*np grams]\n\n    However, wait: the example says:\n        Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\n        Then:\n            Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> T_drink = 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor? But note: we can't use fractions of toasts.\n\n    But the example output is 2. So we are to compute the maximum T (number of toasts per friend? or total toasts?) \n\n    Actually, note: the problem asks for \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\n    However, the example calculation: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n    Let me break down the example:\n\n        They have 3 friends.\n\n        For drink: \n            Total drink = 20 ml.\n            Each toast for one friend requires 3 ml -> so for the entire group, one toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml.\n            Then the total number of toasts for the entire group is floor(20 / 9) = 2 (if we use integer division) but wait, 20/9 is 2.22 -> but the example says 6 toasts?\n\n    Wait, I think there is a misunderstanding.\n\n    Let me read the example explanation again:\n\n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n    Why 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml per friend? But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast.\n\n    However, note: the entire group is making toasts together. The example says: \"each friend needs 3 milliliters\" for one toast.\n\n    But then how does the example get 6 toasts? \n\n    Explanation from the example: \n        They are making toasts and each toast must be consumed by all friends? Or is it that each friend makes their own toast independently?\n\n    The problem says: \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n    And the condition: each toast requires for each friend: nl ml, one slice, and np grams.\n\n    So if we consider that a toast is an event where every friend drinks one toast, then the entire group must have enough for one toast per friend.\n\n    Therefore, for T toasts (meaning each friend makes T toasts), the requirements are:\n\n        Drink: T * n * nl\n        Lime slices: T * n   (since each toast for each friend requires one slice)\n        Salt: T * n * np\n\n    Then the maximum T is the minimum of:\n\n        T_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [but note: we cannot use partial toasts, so integer division? However, the example does not use integer division for the drink: 20/ (n*nl)=20/9≈2.22 -> so we can only have 2 full sets for the entire group?]\n\n    But wait, the example says: \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\".\n\n    How did they get 6 from the drink?\n\n    The example says: \"20 / 3 = 6\". Here 3 is nl (which is 1 in the example? Wait, no: the example input has nl=3 and np=1).\n\n    Actually, the example input: \n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n    The example says: \n        Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml per friend. But wait, if we think of it as: \n            One toast (for the entire group) requires 3 ml * 3 friends = 9 ml.\n\n    However, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\".\n\n    This implies that the example is considering that one toast is defined per friend, not per entire group.\n\n    Let me reexamine the problem statement: \n\n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    This means: each friend, to make one toast, needs nl ml, one lime slice, and np grams.\n\n    Now, if they are making toasts, and they all drink the same amount, then they are going to have a certain number of toasts per friend.\n\n    But note: the problem asks for \"the number of toasts can each friend make?\".\n\n    So we are to find T (toasts per friend). Then the entire group will have a total of T * n toasts? \n\n    Actually, no: if each friend makes T toasts, then the entire group consumes:\n\n        Drink: T * n * nl   (because each of the n friends makes T toasts, and each toast for one friend requires nl ml)\n        Lime slices: T * n   (each friend makes T toasts, so each friend uses T slices; total slices = n*T)\n        Salt: T * n * np\n\n    Now, the example: \n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        Then for T toasts per friend:\n\n        Drink: T * 3 * 3 = 9T <= 20  -> T <= 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so T_max_drink = 2 (if we take floor)\n\n        Lime slices: T * 3 <= 10*8 = 80 -> T <= 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> so T_max_lime = 26 (if we take floor)\n\n        Salt: T * 3 * 1 = 3T <= 100 -> T <= 100/3 ≈ 33.33 -> T_max_salt = 33\n\n        Then the limiting factor is the drink, so T_max = 2.\n\n        This matches the example output.\n\n    But wait, the example explanation said: \n        \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n    How did they get 6? \n\n    Let me try to see from their perspective:\n\n        They have 20 ml of drink. Each toast (per friend) requires 3 ml. So if we consider the drink as being used per toast (without grouping by friend) then:\n\n            Total toasts (across all friends) = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.66 -> floor 6.\n\n        Then they divide by the number of friends (3) to get 2 toasts per friend.\n\n    So the alternative interpretation:\n\n        Instead of calculating the entire group's requirement for T toasts per friend, they calculated the total toasts that can be made from the drink (regardless of who) and then divided by the number of friends.\n\n    But note: if we have 6 total toasts (each toast is for one friend) then we can distribute them equally? \n\n    However, the problem requires that they all drink the same amount. So if we have 6 toasts and 3 friends, then each friend gets 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n    But wait, is that valid? \n\n        In this interpretation, the entire group's drink usage is 6 * 3 = 18 ml (which is <=20) and lime slices: 6 slices (each toast uses one slice) and since we have 80 slices, and salt: 6 * 1 = 6 grams (<=100). \n\n    This matches.\n\n    However, we must ensure that the constraints are satisfied for the entire group. \n\n    But note: if we do it this way, we are effectively:\n\n        Total toasts (not per friend) that can be made from the resources is:\n\n            T_total_drink = (k * l) // nl   [since each toast (for one friend) uses nl ml, so total toasts from drink is floor(total_ml / nl)]\n            T_total_lime = (c * d)   [each toast uses one slice, and we have c*d slices] -> so T_total_lime = c*d\n            T_total_salt = p // np   [each toast uses np grams, so floor(p/np)]\n\n        Then the maximum total toasts is T_total = min(T_total_drink, T_total_lime, T_total_salt)\n\n        Then the number of toasts per friend is T_total // n   (because we need to divide the total toasts by the number of friends, and we require an integer number of toasts per friend).\n\n    But wait, is that correct?\n\n        Example: \n            T_total_drink = 20 // 3 = 6 (if we use floor division)\n            T_total_lime = 80\n            T_total_salt = 100 // 1 = 100\n\n            Then T_total = 6, and T_per_friend = 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n        However, note that the drink constraint is: we have 20 ml, and each toast (for one friend) uses 3 ml. So we can make 6 toasts (each for one friend). Then we distribute these 6 toasts to 3 friends: 2 per friend.\n\n        But what if we have 7 toasts? Then we would use 21 ml which is more than 20. So 6 is the maximum total toasts.\n\n        However, what if the resources are not exactly divisible by the per-toast requirements? \n\n        We must use integer arithmetic because we can't use fractions of toasts.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", and they must all drink the same amount.\n\n        We can also consider: maybe we don't have to use the entire resource if it doesn't allow an equal distribution.\n\n        However, the above method (using total toasts) seems to work.\n\n    But wait, let me test with the second example:\n\n        Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n        Breakdown: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        Calculate total toasts:\n\n            Drink: (100*10) // 4 = 1000//4 = 250\n            Lime: (1*19) = 19\n            Salt: 90 // 3 = 30\n\n        Then T_total = min(250, 19, 30) = 19\n\n        Then toasts per friend = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 19 divided by 5 is 3 with remainder 4, but we cannot give fractional toasts, and they must drink the same amount)\n\n        However, note: if we give 3 toasts per friend, then the total toasts is 5*3 = 15, which is less than 19.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n        So we are not forced to use all the resources. We can only use up to the limiting resource, but also we must have an integer number of toasts per friend.\n\n        However, the above method (using total toasts) is:\n\n            Step 1: Compute the maximum total toasts (across all friends) that the resources can support without considering the per-friend equality.\n\n            Step 2: Then we divide the total toasts by n (using floor division) to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\n        But is that the same as requiring that each friend makes the same number of toasts? \n\n            Yes, because if we let T be the number of toasts per friend, then the total toasts is n*T.\n\n            Then the constraints become:\n\n                Drink: n*T * nl <= k*l   => T <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n                Lime: n*T <= c*d          => T <= (c*d) / n\n                Salt: n*T * np <= p       => T <= p / (n*np)\n\n            Then T_max = min( (k*l) // (n*nl) , (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )   [using integer floor division for each resource]\n\n        However, wait: for the drink, we have (k*l) / (n*nl) might not be an integer. We can only have whole toasts.\n\n        But note: the total toasts (n*T) must be an integer and T must be an integer.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            T_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl)   [this gives the maximum T such that n*T*nl <= k*l? Actually, no: because (k*l) // (n*nl) is the maximum T for the entire group's drink? \n\n        Actually, the entire group's drink for T toasts per friend is n*T*nl. We require n*T*nl <= k*l.\n\n        Then T <= (k*l) / (n*nl). Since T must be an integer, T_max_drink = floor((k*l) / (n*nl))\n\n        Similarly, T_max_lime = floor((c*d) / n)   [because we need n*T slices, so T <= (c*d)/n]\n        T_max_salt = floor(p / (n*np))\n\n        Then the answer is T = min(T_max_drink, T_max_lime, T_max_salt)\n\n        Now, let's test with the second example:\n\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n            T_drink = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n            T_lime = (1*19) // 5 = 19 // 5 = 3 (floor division: 3)\n            T_salt = 90 // (5*3) = 90 // 15 = 6\n\n            Then T = min(50, 3, 6) = 3\n\n        This matches the expected output.\n\n        Now, the third example:\n\n            Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n            T_drink = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n            T_lime = (25*23) // 10 = 575 // 10 = 57\n            T_salt = 1 // (10*1) = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n            Then T = 0.\n\n        Expected output: 0.\n\n        But wait, the example input was: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" and the output is 0.\n\n        However, the example provided in the problem is:\n\n            Input: ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n            Output: ['2', '3', '0']\n\n        So both methods (the total toasts and then dividing by n vs. the per-friend constraints) yield the same result.\n\n        But note: in the first method (total toasts) we did:\n\n            T_total_drink = (k*l) // nl   [without multiplying by n] -> 20//3 = 6\n            Then T_per_friend = 6 // n = 2\n\n        However, in the second method (per-friend constraints) we did:\n\n            T_drink = (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20 // (3*3) = 2\n\n        So actually, the two methods are different. \n\n        Which one is correct?\n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n        Method 1 (total toasts):\n\n            We calculate the maximum number of toasts (each toast being for one friend) that the entire set of resources can support (without regard to the number of friends). Then we divide by the number of friends (using floor division) to get the number per friend.\n\n            This is equivalent to:\n\n                T_total = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n                T_per_friend = T_total // n\n\n        Method 2 (per-friend constraints):\n\n            We calculate the maximum T (toasts per friend) from each resource:\n\n                From drink: T_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n                From lime: T_lime = (c*d) // n\n                From salt: T_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n            Then T = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\n        Are these two methods equivalent?\n\n        Consider:\n\n            In Method 1: \n                T_total = min( floor(k*l / nl), c*d, floor(p / np) )\n                Then T_per_friend = floor(T_total / n)\n\n            In Method 2:\n                T_drink = floor( (k*l) / (n*nl) )\n                T_lime = floor( (c*d) / n )\n                T_salt = floor( p / (n*np) )\n                T = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\n        Now, is floor(a/b) * b <= a? \n            Let a = k*l, b = n*nl.\n            Then T_drink = floor(a/(n*nl)) -> then n*nl * T_drink <= a.\n\n        Similarly, in Method 1: T_total_drink = floor(a / nl) -> then nl * T_total_drink <= a.\n\n        But note: the entire group's drink usage in Method 1 for T_total toasts is T_total * nl (because each toast uses nl ml, and T_total is the total number of toasts). \n        Then the drink condition in Method 1 is: T_total * nl <= a.\n\n        However, in Method 2, the entire group's drink usage for T toasts per friend is n * T * nl. And we require n*T*nl <= a.\n\n        But note: T_total = T_per_friend * n (in Method 1) is not necessarily true because T_total = min(floor(a/nl), ...) and then T_per_friend = floor(T_total/n). \n\n        Actually, the two methods are not the same. \n\n        Example: \n            n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3.\n\n            Method 1: \n                T_total_drink = floor(20/3)=6 -> then T_per_friend = 6//3=2.\n\n            Method 2:\n                T_drink = floor(20/(3*3))=floor(20/9)=2.\n\n        But wait, in Method 1 we are using the total toasts (6) and then dividing by n (3) to get 2. This is the same as Method 2.\n\n        Why? \n\n            In Method 1, the total toasts is 6. Then the entire group's drink usage is 6 * nl = 6*3 = 18, which is <=20.\n\n            In Method 2, the entire group's drink usage for 2 toasts per friend is 3*2*3 = 18, which is <=20.\n\n        However, the conditions are:\n\n            Method 1: \n                Drink: T_total * nl <= k*l   -> 6*3 <= 20 -> 18<=20 (true)\n\n            Method 2:\n                Drink: n*T*nl <= k*l   -> 3*2*3=18<=20 (true)\n\n        But note: the condition in Method 1 for drink is independent of the other resources. \n\n        The catch: the two methods are consistent because the total toasts (Method 1) is the maximum number of toasts (each for one friend) that the entire resources can support. Then we distribute these toasts equally. However, we must ensure that the toasts are distributed equally and that we don't exceed the per-resource limits.\n\n        But wait: what if the resources are limiting and the distribution is not even? \n\n        Example: \n            Suppose we have two friends (n=2) and two resources: \n                Drink: 5 ml, nl=2 -> so each toast (per friend) uses 2 ml.\n                Lime: 3 slices, so total slices=3 -> each toast uses 1 slice.\n\n            Method 1:\n                T_total_drink = 5 // 2 = 2\n                T_total_lime = 3   (since each toast uses 1 slice, and we have 3 slices)\n                T_total = min(2,3) = 2\n                T_per_friend = 2 // 2 = 1.\n\n            Now, check: \n                With 1 toast per friend, the entire group uses 2*1*2=4 ml (<=5) and 2 slices (<=3). That works.\n\n            But what if we try to make 1 toast per friend: that's 2 toasts. The drink condition: 2 * 2 = 4 <=5, okay. Lime: 2 slices <=3, okay.\n\n            Now, can we make 2 toasts per friend? Then total toasts=4, but then drink: 4*2=8>5 -> not allowed. So 1 is the maximum.\n\n            Now, Method 2:\n\n                T_drink = (5) // (2*2) = 5//4 = 1\n                T_lime = 3 // 2 = 1   (because we need 2 slices for 1 toast per friend: 2*1=2 <=3, but wait: for T=1, we need 2 slices. So 3>=2 -> okay, but our calculation for T_lime is floor(3/2)=1, which is correct.\n\n                Then T = min(1,1) = 1.\n\n            Both methods give 1.\n\n        Now, consider a case where the two methods might differ:\n\n            n=2, k=5, l=1, nl=2, c=3, d=1, p=5, np=1.\n\n            The resources:\n                Drink: 5 ml\n                Lime: 3 * 1 = 3 slices\n                Salt: 5 grams\n\n            Each toast (per friend) requires: \n                Drink: 2 ml\n                Lime: 1 slice\n                Salt: 1 gram\n\n            Method 1:\n                T_total_drink = 5 // 2 = 2\n                T_total_lime = 3   (each toast uses 1 slice, so 3 toasts)\n                T_total_salt = 5 // 1 = 5\n                T_total = min(2,3,5) = 2\n                T_per_friend = 2 // 2 = 1.\n\n            Now, check: \n                With 1 toast per friend, the entire group uses 2*2=4 ml (<=5), 2 slices (<=3), 2 grams (<=5) -> okay.\n\n            Method 2:\n                T_drink = 5 // (2*2) = 5//4 = 1\n                T_lime = 3 // 2 = 1   (because 2*1=2 <=3)\n                T_salt = 5 // (2*1) = 5//2 = 2\n\n                Then T = min(1,1,2) = 1.\n\n            Same result.\n\n        Why did I think they were different? \n\n            Actually, note:\n\n                In Method 1, the condition for drink is: T_total * nl <= k*l   [T_total is the total toasts, each toast uses nl ml]\n\n                In Method 2, the condition for drink is: n*T*nl <= k*l   [T is the toasts per friend, and the entire group uses n*T toasts, so n*T*nl <= k*l]\n\n                But note: T_total = n*T, so the condition becomes: n*T * nl <= k*l, which is the same.\n\n            Similarly, for lime: \n                Method 1: T_total <= c*d   [because each toast uses one slice, so total slices required is T_total]\n                Method 2: n*T <= c*d   [because each toast per friend uses one slice, so for T toasts per friend, the entire group uses n*T slices]\n\n                And T_total = n*T, so T_total <= c*d.\n\n            For salt:\n                Method 1: T_total * np <= p   [each toast uses np grams]\n                Method 2: n*T*np <= p   [entire group uses n*T*np grams]\n\n                And T_total = n*T, so T_total*np <= p.\n\n            Therefore, the two methods are equivalent.\n\n        However, note: in Method 1, we are taking floor division for each resource independently and then taking the minimum of the three. Then we divide by n (using floor) to get the per-friend toasts.\n\n        But wait, in Method 1 we are doing:\n\n            T_total = min( floor(k*l / nl), c*d, floor(p / np) )\n\n            Then T = T_total // n\n\n        But note: the condition for the drink in Method 1 is: T_total * nl <= k*l. But T_total = min(floor(k*l/nl), ...), so floor(k*l/nl) is the maximum T_total from drink. \n\n        However, the condition for the entire group is:\n\n            n*T*nl <= k*l   -> T <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n        In Method 1, we are setting T_total = floor(k*l/nl). Then T = T_total // n.\n\n        But note: T_total is the total toasts (each for one friend) and T is the toasts per friend. Then T_total = n*T.\n\n        So the condition from Method 1 for drink is:\n\n            n*T * nl <= k*l   -> T <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n        And in Method 1, we set T_total = floor(k*l/nl) and then T = T_total // n.\n\n        But note: T_total = n*T, so:\n\n            n*T <= floor(k*l/nl)   [because T_total = n*T = floor(k*l/nl) ? Not necessarily, because floor(k*l/nl) might not be divisible by n]\n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            Condition from drink: n*T <= floor(k*l/nl)   ??? \n\n        Let me write:\n\n            In Method 1, we are not directly using the drink condition for the entire group. We are using the drink condition for a single toast (per friend) to set the total toasts.\n\n        But note: the drink condition for one toast (per friend) is nl ml. Then the entire group's drink for T toasts per friend is n*T*nl. \n\n        However, in Method 1, we computed the maximum total toasts (across friends) from drink as floor(k*l / nl). Then we divided by n to get T.\n\n        This is valid because:\n\n            The entire group's drink usage is T_total * nl = (n*T)*nl.\n\n            And we require (n*T)*nl <= k*l.\n\n            Also, T_total = n*T <= floor(k*l / nl)   [because floor(k*l / nl) is the maximum number of toasts (each using nl ml) that the drink can support]\n\n        But note: floor(k*l / nl) is the maximum number of toasts (each for one friend) that the drink can support.\n\n        However, the entire group's drink usage for T_total toasts is T_total * nl, which must be <= k*l. \n\n        And T_total = n*T.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\n        But wait, is it possible that by using Method 1 we are overusing a resource? \n\n            Example: \n                n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3, c=10, d=8, p=100, np=1.\n\n            In Method 1:\n\n                T_total_drink = floor(20/3)=6 -> so we use 6*3=18 ml (which is <=20, okay)\n                T_total_lime = 10*8=80 -> so we use 6 slices (from 80, okay)\n                T_total_salt = floor(100/1)=100 -> we use 6 grams (from 100, okay)\n\n            Now, if we use Method 2:\n\n                T_drink = floor(20/(3*3))=floor(20/9)=2 -> uses 2*3*3=18 ml (same)\n                T_lime = floor(80/3)=26 -> but wait, we are only using 2 per friend, so 3*2=6 slices (which is <=80, so 2 is within the lime limit) -> okay.\n                T_salt = floor(100/(3*1))=floor(100/3)=33 -> okay.\n\n            So both methods use the same amount of resources.\n\n        Therefore, we can implement either method. \n\n        However, note: the problem says the friends must drink the same amount. \n\n        Method 1: \n            We compute the maximum total toasts (across all friends) that the resources can support (without regard to the per-friend constraint) and then divide by the number of friends (using floor division). \n\n            But wait, is that valid? \n\n            Example: \n                n=2, k=5, l=1, nl=2, c=3, d=1, p=5, np=1.\n\n                Method 1: \n                    T_total_drink = 5//2=2\n                    T_total_lime = 3\n                    T_total_salt = 5//1=5\n                    T_total = 2\n                    T_per_friend = 2//2=1.\n\n                This is correct.\n\n            Another example: \n                n=2, k=5, l=1, nl=2, c=3, d=1, p=5, np=1, but now change p=4.\n\n                Method 1:\n                    T_total_drink = 5//2=2\n                    T_total_lime = 3\n                    T_total_salt = 4//1=4\n                    T_total = 2\n                    T_per_friend = 1.\n\n                Check: \n                    Drink: 2*2=4 ml (<=5)\n                    Lime: 2 slices (<=3)\n                    Salt: 1*1*1? Wait, no: the entire group's salt usage is 2 toasts * 1 gram per toast (but wait, each toast (per friend) uses np=1 gram, so for one friend: 1 gram, for two friends: 2 grams. So 2<=4 -> okay.\n\n            But now, what if we try to make 1 toast per friend, and we have enough resources? \n\n            What if the resources are sufficient for more than 2 toasts (total)? \n\n            Example: \n                n=2, k=10, l=1, nl=2, c=10, d=1, p=10, np=1.\n\n                Method 1:\n                    T_total_drink = 10//2=5\n                    T_total_lime = 10\n                    T_total_salt = 10//1=10\n                    T_total = 5\n                    T_per_friend = 5//2=2 (floor division)\n\n                Check: \n                    Each friend gets 2 toasts -> total toasts=4.\n                    Drink: 4*2=8 ml (<=10)\n                    Lime: 4 slices (<=10)\n                    Salt: 4 grams (<=10)\n\n                But wait, we could actually make 5 toasts in total? \n\n                However, 5 toasts total would be 5/2 = 2.5 per friend, but we cannot have a fraction. \n\n                So the maximum per-friend toasts is 2, because 2*2=4 toasts (total) is the maximum we can do with the same amount per friend.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to not use all the resources. The problem says \"as many toasts as they can\", meaning we want to maximize the number of toasts per friend (which is an integer) and they must be the same for all.\n\n            So the answer is 2.\n\n        Conclusion: we can use Method 1 or Method 2. \n\n        However, note: the problem says the input integers are positive and between 1 and 1000.\n\n        We'll implement Method 2 because it is straightforward:\n\n            T_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [if (n*nl) is 0, but n>=1, nl>=1 so no problem]\n            T_lime = (c * d) // n\n            T_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n            Then answer = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\n        But wait, what",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to ensure that all friends drink the same amount, and the constraints of the available drink, lime slices, and salt are respected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink per friend, one lime slice per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves determining the limiting factor among these resources.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution requires checking three main constraints:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available (k * l) must be divided by the drink required per toast per friend (n * nl). This gives the maximum number of toasts per friend based on drink availability.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available (c * d) must be divided by the number of friends (n), as each friend needs one slice per toast. This gives the maximum number of toasts per friend based on lime availability.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available (p) must be divided by the salt required per toast per friend (n * np). This gives the maximum number of toasts per friend based on salt availability.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves computing the minimum value among the three constraints mentioned above. This ensures that all resources are sufficient for the calculated number of toasts per friend.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, which are constant time operations O(1). Thus, the solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    T_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    T_lime = (c * d) // n\n    T_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **T_drink**: The maximum number of toasts per friend based on the available drink. Computed as `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **T_lime**: The maximum number of toasts per friend based on the available lime slices. Computed as `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **T_salt**: The maximum number of toasts per friend based on the available salt. Computed as `p // (n * np)`.\n3. **Determining Result**: The result is the minimum value among the three constraints, ensuring all resources are sufficient for the calculated number of toasts per friend.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make under the given constraints.",
