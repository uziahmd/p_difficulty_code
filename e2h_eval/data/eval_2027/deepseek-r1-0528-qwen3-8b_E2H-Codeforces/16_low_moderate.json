Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation: \n Moving from one block to another is allowed if they share a common border of nonzero length. This is essentially crossing a road.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that crossing a single road (i.e., going from one side to the other) counts as one step. But note: if two blocks are separated by multiple roads, then we might need to cross multiple roads.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the roads divide the plane into blocks, and we start in one block and want to get to another. Each time we cross a road (from one block to an adjacent one) we take one step. However, note that the movement is defined by steps that change the block, and we can cross multiple roads in one step only if the two blocks share a border (which is a segment of a road). \n\n However, note that the example input:\n   Input 1: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n   Output 1: 2\n\n Explanation: \n   Home at (1,1), University at (-1,-1), and two roads: \n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y = 0 (the x-axis)\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x = 0 (the y-axis)\n\n   These two roads divide the plane into 4 quadrants. The home is in the first quadrant (above x-axis and right of y-axis) and the university is in the third (below x-axis and left of y-axis).\n\n   To go from home to university, we must cross two roads: first the x-axis and then the y-axis? Or maybe we can cross two at once? But note: the movement is defined as moving from one block to another with a nonzero common border. Crossing two roads at an intersection would require two steps because after the first step you are in the second quadrant and then you cross the y-axis to the third.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not allow moving from one block to another without a nonzero common border. The two blocks that meet at the origin (the intersection) do not have a nonzero common border? Actually, the two blocks that are adjacent via the x-axis (say first and fourth quadrants) share the entire x-axis? But wait, the common border between two adjacent blocks is a segment of one road. The two blocks that meet at the origin are actually four blocks meeting at the origin. The adjacent blocks (sharing a ray) are connected by the entire line? Actually, no: the two blocks that are separated by the x-axis (one above and one below) share the entire x-axis (which is infinite). Similarly for the y-axis.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n   We can think of each road as a line that divides the plane. We can assign a sign to each point with respect to a road: \n        For a road ax+by+c=0, we can consider the value ax+by+c. \n        Since the point is not on the road, we can define:\n            side = sign(ax+by+c)\n\n   Then, the home and the university will have a particular set of signs for each road.\n\n   Now, note: to go from home to university, we must cross a road if the signs for that road are different.\n\n   However, we are allowed to cross multiple roads in one step only if the two blocks we are moving between share a common border (which is a segment of one road). But note: the problem says that we move from one block to another in one step if they share a nonzero common border. This implies that we can only cross one road per step (because if we cross two at the same time, then the two blocks are separated by two roads and the common border would be the intersection point, which is a single point, not a nonzero length). \n\n   Therefore, each step must cross exactly one road.\n\n   But wait: what if we cross two roads at their intersection? Then we are leaving one block and entering a third block? Actually, no: when you are at an intersection, you are on two roads. The movement is defined by blocks (regions). The block containing the home is defined by being on the positive side (or negative) of each road. When you cross one road, you flip the sign for that road. Then you are in a new block.\n\n   So the minimal number of steps is the minimum number of roads that we must cross so that the home and the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university, given that each step involves crossing a single road (line) in the Crazy Town setup. The roads divide the plane into connected regions (blocks), and movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a common border of nonzero length, which corresponds to crossing exactly one road per step.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in specific half-planes relative to each road. The minimal number of steps required to reach the university from home is determined by the number of roads that separate their respective half-plane configurations.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. If they lie on opposite sides, crossing that road is necessary. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps needed, as each crossing (step) must be counted separately.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the linear equation (ax + by + c) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, it means the two points are on opposite sides of the road, and thus crossing this road is mandatory. The sum of such roads across all lines gives the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        home_val = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        uni_val = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        \n        if (home_val > 0 and uni_val < 0) or (home_val < 0 and uni_val > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road defined by the equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), the code checks the sign of the expression \\(ax + by + c\\) for both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Counting Necessary Crossings**: If the signs of the expression for the home and university differ, it indicates that the two points are separated by this road. Hence, crossing this road is necessary, and the count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads gives the minimal number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each crossing of a road constitutes one step.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging the geometric properties of the roads and the positions of the points, ensuring optimal performance with a linear pass through the list of roads.",
