Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n The idea is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges (from 0 to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to l).\n\n How to approach:\n - The entire street must be covered. The coverage of a lantern at position a with radius d is [a-d, a+d].\n - The problem reduces to ensuring that the union of these intervals covers [0, l].\n\n We can break the problem into:\n a) The left edge: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover from 0 to its own position. So we need a d such that the first lantern's left coverage (at least) reaches 0. The required d for the left edge is at least the distance from the first lantern to 0, i.e., a0 - 0. But note: if the first lantern is already at 0, then no left gap.\n\n However, note that the lanterns can be in any order and may have duplicates.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n   Let the sorted lanterns be: a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The leftmost point 0 must be covered. The leftmost lantern (a0) must extend at least from 0 to a0. So one candidate is d >= a0 / 2? Not exactly.\n\n But note: the entire street must be lit. We can think of the following:\n\n - The gap at the beginning: from 0 to a0. The first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The coverage of the first lantern is [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0. However, wait: if d is set to a0, then the first lantern will cover from 0 to 2*a0. But maybe we don't need to cover beyond the next lantern? \n\n However, note: we have multiple lanterns. We need to cover the entire street.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the entire street is covered if:\n   - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern is covered by the first lantern (or by the combination, but the first lantern is the one that can cover the left side). Actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the next lantern's coverage? \n\n Actually, we can think greedily:\n\n 1. The first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the next segment? Let's consider:\n\n   Condition 1: The left end: d must be at least (a0 - 0) / 1? Actually, the first lantern must cover 0. The distance from a0 to 0 is a0. So we require d >= a0. But wait, if there is another lantern at the beginning, then we might not need as much? Actually, we can use the maximum of the gaps.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to set one d for all lanterns.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If there are no lanterns, then we need d to cover the entire street: from 0 to l, so d must be at least l/2. But n>=1 per input constraints.\n\n 2. Sort the lanterns.\n\n 3. Consider the gaps:\n\n    - Gap at the beginning: from 0 to a0. The first lantern must cover this gap. The amount of coverage needed from the first lantern to the left is a0 (to get to 0). So the required d for the beginning is a0 (if we only rely on the first lantern). But wait, actually we can use multiple lanterns? However, the condition is that the entire street is lit. We are free to choose one d for all. So we must cover from 0 to a0 by the first lantern: so d must be at least (a0 - 0)/2? No, because the first lantern's coverage is [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0. But that would be too much? Because if we set d = a0, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*a0]. Then we have to check the rest.\n\n However, let me reexamine: the entire street must be lit. The condition for the beginning is that the first lantern must cover 0. So d must be at least a0 (if we set d = a0, then the first lantern's left boundary is 0). But what about the middle? \n\n Example: n=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\n   Without the first lantern: the street from 0 to 2 is not covered by the first lantern if d < 2. But wait, the second lantern is at 5, which doesn't help for the beginning.\n\n   Actually, the entire street is from 0 to 5. With two lanterns at 2 and 5, we require:\n\n   For the first lantern at 2: to cover from 0 to 5, we need d >= 2 (so that 2-d <=0 -> d>=2) and also the second lantern must cover from 2 to 5. The second lantern at 5: 5-d <= 2? Actually, the second lantern must cover from 2 to 5. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, so the second lantern must cover from 2 to 5: (5-d) <= 2 -> d>=3? Or wait, the second lantern covers [5-d, 5+d]. Since we are only concerned up to 5, we require 5-d <= 5 (always true) and we require that the left part of the second lantern (5-d) must meet the right part of the first lantern (which is 2+d). But actually, we require that the entire street is connected.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the gaps between lanterns:\n\n   After sorting, we have points a0, a1, ... a_{n-1}.\n\n   The entire street is covered if:\n\n     - The first lantern covers from 0 to a0 + d (but we require at least to the next lantern or beyond).\n     - Between two consecutive lanterns, the gap must be covered by the two adjacent lanterns.\n\n   Conditions:\n\n     Condition 1: The leftmost point 0 must be within the first lantern's coverage: d >= a0.\n\n     Condition 2: For each consecutive pair (a_i, a_{i+1}), the coverage must meet or overlap. The gap between a_i and a_{i+1} is (a_{i+1} - a_i). The two lanterns together must cover the entire gap. The coverage from the left lantern extends to a_i + d, and the coverage from the right lantern starts at a_{i+1} - d. So we require: a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d  => 2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\n     Condition 3: The last lantern must cover the rightmost point l: so we require that the last lantern's coverage (a_{n-1} + d) must be at least l. Therefore, d >= l - a_{n-1}.\n\n   Then the answer is the minimum d that satisfies:\n\n        d >= a0\n        for every i from 0 to n-2: d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2\n        d >= l - a_{n-1}\n\n   And then we take the maximum of these lower bounds.\n\n   Why?\n\n   - For the beginning: d must be at least a0 (to cover the gap from 0 to the first lantern).\n   - For the gaps between lanterns: the gap (a_{i+1}-a_i) must be covered by the two adjacent lanterns. Each lantern can cover half the gap? Actually, if we set d to be at least (gap)/2, then the two lanterns will meet in the middle. But note: if we set d to (gap)/2, then the left lantern covers up to a_i + (gap)/2, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - (gap)/2. Since the gap is (a_{i+1}-a_i), then:\n\n        a_i + (gap)/2 = a_i + (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2 = (a_i+a_{i+1})/2\n\n        a_{i+1} - (gap)/2 = a_{i+1} - (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2 = (a_i+a_{i+1})/2\n\n        So they meet exactly at the midpoint.\n\n   - Similarly, for the end: d must be at least (l - a_{n-1}) to cover from the last lantern to l.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n        a0, \n        (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 for each i from 0 to n-2,\n        (l - a_{n-1})\n\n   However, note: the condition for the beginning is d >= a0, but wait: if the first lantern is at a0, then to cover 0 we need d >= a0. Similarly, the last lantern requires d >= (l - a_{n-1}).\n\n   But consider: what if the first lantern is very close to 0 and the last lantern is very close to l? Then the gaps in the middle might be large.\n\n   Example: n=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\n        Condition for the beginning: d >= 2.\n        Condition for the gap between 2 and 5: (5-2)/2 = 1.5.\n        Condition for the end: d >= 5-5 = 0.\n\n        Then the maximum is max(2, 1.5, 0) = 2.0.\n\n   Example 2: Input \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n        Sort the lanterns: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n        Condition 1: d >= 0 (beginning: from 0 to 0 -> 0, but wait, the first lantern is at 0, so we don't need to cover beyond 0 from the left? Actually, the condition for the beginning is the distance from 0 to the first lantern: 0-0=0 -> so condition is d>=0.\n\n        Condition 2: gaps:\n            3-0 -> 3/2 = 1.5\n            5-3 -> 2/2 = 1.0\n            7-5 -> 2/2 = 1.0\n            9-7 -> 2/2 = 1.0\n            14-9 -> 5/2 = 2.5\n            15-14 -> 1/2 = 0.5\n\n        Condition 3: d >= 15-15 = 0.\n\n        Then the maximum is 2.5.\n\n        Output: 2.5000000000\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   But wait: in the example input, the output is 2.5000000000.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the beginning is not just the first lantern's position. What if the first lantern is not at 0? Then the gap is from 0 to the first lantern. In our example, the first lantern is at 0, so the gap is 0. But if the first lantern was at 1, then we would require d >= 1.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        Read n, l\n        Read list a of n integers\n        Sort a\n\n        Let d0 = a[0]   # from the left edge: we need d >= a[0] (the distance from the first lantern to 0)\n\n        Let d_end = l - a[-1]   # from the right edge: we need d >= (l - last lantern)\n\n        Let d_gap = 0\n        For i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap / 2.0\n            candidate = gap / 2.0\n            if candidate > d_gap:\n                d_gap = candidate\n\n        Then answer = max(d0, d_end, d_gap)\n\n        However, wait: the condition for the beginning and the end are independent. We must cover both the beginning and the end, so we take the maximum over these three.\n\n   But note: the condition for the beginning is actually the same as the gap from 0 to the first lantern? Yes, because the first lantern must cover from 0 to itself. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0]. So we require d >= a[0] to cover 0.\n\n   Similarly, the last lantern must cover from itself to l: distance is l - a[-1], so d >= l - a[-1].\n\n   However, what if we have multiple lanterns? The condition for the beginning is still that the first lantern must cover 0. Similarly, the last lantern must cover l.\n\n   But note: the middle gaps are covered by adjacent lanterns. The entire street is covered if:\n\n        [0, a0+d] must cover [0, a0+d] and then the next lantern starts at a1, so we require a0+d >= a1 - d, which is the same as d >= (a1 - a0)/2.\n\n   However, note that the condition for the beginning and the first gap might be satisfied by the same d. Our method of taking the maximum of the three conditions is correct.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        n=2, l=5, lanterns=[2,5]\n        d0 = 2\n        d_end = 5-5 = 0\n        gaps: (5-2)=3 -> 3/2 = 1.5\n        Then answer = max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        d0 = 0\n        d_end = 0\n        gaps: [3-0=3 -> 1.5, 5-3=2 -> 1.0, 7-5=2 -> 1.0, 9-7=2 -> 1.0, 14-9=5 -> 2.5, 15-14=1 -> 0.5]\n        Then answer = max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n   But wait: why do we consider the beginning as d>=a0 and the end as d>=l-a_{n-1}? \n\n        The entire street is [0, l]. The first lantern is at a0. The leftmost point 0 must be in [a0-d, a0+d] -> a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0.\n\n        Similarly, the last point l must be in [a_{n-1}-d, a_{n-1}+d] -> a_{n-1}+d >= l -> d>= l - a_{n-1}.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there is only one lantern, then we need to cover from 0 to l, so the required d is the maximum of the distances from the single lantern to the two ends, divided appropriately?\n        # Actually, the single lantern must cover [0, l]. Then d must be at least (max(a[0], l - a[0]))? \n        # But note: the lantern is at a0. We require:\n        #   a0 - d <= 0  => d >= a0\n        #   a0 + d >= l  => d >= l - a0\n        # So the required d is max(a0, l - a0). However, in our method above, we break the problem into three parts. For a single lantern (n=1):\n\n        #   d0 = a0\n        #   d_end = l - a0\n        #   d_gap = 0 (no gaps between lanterns)\n        #   Then answer = max(a0, l - a0, 0) = max(a0, l - a0)\n\n        # Which is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the beginning and the condition for the end are independent. But what if the lantern is in the middle? Then we have to cover both sides.\n\n   Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 5.\n        d0 = 5, d_end = 5, so d=5. Then the coverage is [0,10] -> correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the lantern is at 0? Then d_end = 10, and d0=0, so d=10. Then the coverage is [0-10, 0+10] = [-10,10] which covers [0,10] (since 10 is included). But note, the condition for the end is that the lantern must reach 10, so d must be at least 10-0=10. Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        d_candidate1 = a[0]  # for the left edge\n        d_candidate2 = l - a[-1]  # for the right edge\n        d_candidate3 = 0.0\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap / 2.0\n            d_candidate3 = max(d_candidate3, gap / 2.0)\n\n        answer = max(d_candidate1, d_candidate2, d_candidate3)\n\n   However, note: the condition for the gaps is that the two adjacent lanterns must cover the gap. But if we have a lantern at the beginning, then the gap from 0 to the first lantern is taken care of by d_candidate1 (which is the first lantern's requirement). Similarly, the gap from the last lantern to l is taken care of by d_candidate2.\n\n   But what if we have multiple lanterns? The gaps between the lanterns are independent and the condition for the gap is that the two adjacent lanterns must have d at least half the gap. And the entire street is covered if we satisfy:\n\n        [0, l] is contained in the union of [a_i - d, a_i + d] for all i.\n\n   This is equivalent to:\n\n        d >= a0 (to cover 0)\n        d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2 for every gap (to cover the gap between consecutive lanterns)\n        d >= l - a_{n-1} (to cover l)\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the maximum of these values.\n\n   However, note: sometimes the gap condition might be more restrictive than the edge conditions. For example, if the street is long and the lanterns are spaced far apart, the gap condition might require a larger d.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Edge conditions\n        left_gap = a[0]  # distance from 0 to the first lantern\n        right_gap = l - a[-1]  # distance from the last lantern to l\n\n        # Middle gaps\n        gaps = []\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gaps.append(a[i+1] - a[i])\n\n        mid_gap = 0.0\n        if gaps:\n            mid_gap = max(gaps) / 2.0\n        else:\n            mid_gap = 0.0   # if there are no gaps (only one lantern) then the middle gap condition is 0\n\n        # But note: the condition for the edges is independent. We must cover the edges and the gaps.\n\n        d_required = max(left_gap, right_gap, mid_gap)\n\n        # However, wait: is mid_gap the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns divided by 2? Yes.\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_required))\n\n   But wait, the above code does not account for the fact that the edges and the gaps are independent, and the same d must satisfy all conditions. However, we are taking the maximum of the three.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the condition for the left edge is that the first lantern must cover the left edge, which is a[0] (so d>=a[0]). Similarly, the condition for the right edge is d>=l-a[-1]. The condition for a gap between two lanterns is d>= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   Therefore, we are correct.\n\n   Let me test with a sample: n=1, l=10, a=[5] -> left_gap=5, right_gap=5, mid_gap=0 -> d_required=5.\n\n   Another sample: n=1, l=10, a=[0] -> left_gap=0, right_gap=10, mid_gap=0 -> d_required=10.\n\n   Another sample: n=1, l=10, a=[10] -> left_gap=10, right_gap=0, mid_gap=0 -> d_required=10.\n\n   Another sample: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10] -> left_gap=0, right_gap=0, gap between is 10 -> mid_gap=5 -> d_required=5.\n\n   Now, check: with d=5, the first lantern covers [0-5,0+5]=[-5,5] and the second lantern covers [10-5,10+5]=[5,15]. The entire street [0,10] is covered? From 0 to 5 by the first, and from 5 to 10 by the second. Actually, the point 5 is covered by both. But note: the entire street [0,10] is [0,10]. The first lantern covers [0,5] and the second covers [5,10]. So yes, it is covered.\n\n   However, wait: the condition for the gap between the two lanterns is (10-0)=10, so mid_gap=5. Then d_required=5.\n\n   Another sample: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10] -> left_gap=0, right_gap=0, gaps: [5,5] -> mid_gap=5/2=2.5 -> d_required=5? Wait, let me check:\n\n        Condition for left edge: d>=0 -> okay.\n        Condition for right edge: d>=0 -> okay.\n        Condition for gaps: \n            gap1: 5-0=5 -> d>=2.5\n            gap2: 10-5=5 -> d>=2.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 5? But wait, if d=5, then the first lantern covers [0-5,0+5]=[-5,5], the second [0,10], the third [5,15]. So the entire [0,10] is covered. However, can we use a smaller d?\n\n        According to our conditions, we require d>=2.5 for the gaps. But note: the condition for the gaps is that the two adjacent lanterns must meet. For the first gap (0 to 5): the first lantern must cover up to 5-d and the second lantern must start at 5-d. We require 5-d <= 5 (which is always true) but the meeting condition is: the first lantern's right end (0+d) must meet the second lantern's left end (5-d). So we require 0+d >= 5-d -> 2*d>=5 -> d>=2.5.\n\n        Similarly, the second gap (5 to 10): the second lantern's right end (5+d) must meet the third lantern's left end (10-d) -> 5+d >= 10-d -> 2*d>=5 -> d>=2.5.\n\n        However, the edges: the left edge: first lantern must cover 0: 0+d>=0 -> d>=0. The right edge: third lantern must cover 10: 10-d<=10 -> always, but wait: the condition for the right edge is that the last lantern must extend to l: 10+d>=10 -> always, but actually the condition for the right edge is that the last lantern must cover from 10 to l? The street ends at 10, so the condition is 10+d>=10 -> true for any d>=0. But wait, the condition we used for the right edge was d>= (l - last_lantern) = 10-10=0. So the right edge condition is trivially satisfied.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal d is 2.5.\n\n        However, our code above for n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10] gives:\n\n            left_gap = 0\n            right_gap = 0\n            gaps = [5,5] -> mid_gap = 5/2 = 2.5\n            d_required = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, what if we have n=0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, the above code uses:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   Then if n==0, the list a will be empty. But the problem says n>=1.\n\n   Therefore, the final code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Edge conditions\n        left_gap = a[0]  # distance from 0 to the first lantern\n        right_gap = l - a[-1]  # distance from the last lantern to l\n\n        # Middle gaps\n        mid_gap = 0.0\n        if n > 1:\n            gaps = []\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gaps.append(a[i+1] - a[i])\n            mid_gap = max(gaps) / 2.0\n        else:\n            # if there's only one lantern, then no gaps, but we still need to cover the edges.\n            mid_gap = 0.0\n\n        d_required = max(left_gap, right_gap, mid_gap)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d_required))\n\n   However, wait: the condition for the gaps is that we must cover the gaps between lanterns. But the above mid_gap is computed from the maximum gap. However, the condition for a particular gap is that d must be at least (gap)/2. But we are taking the maximum gap and dividing by 2. That is correct because if the largest gap requires d to be at least (max_gap)/2, then the other gaps (which are smaller) will automatically be satisfied by that d.\n\n   Therefore, we are good.\n\n   But note: the problem says the answer must be accurate to 10^-9.\n\n   We are using floating point and formatting to 10 decimal places.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> outputs 2.0000000000\n\n   Example 2: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" -> outputs 2.5000000000\n\n   However, wait: the example input has two lines: the first line is \"7 15\", the second line is \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\". Our code reads:\n\n        n, l = 7, 15\n        a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] -> then sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n   Then:\n\n        left_gap = 0\n        right_gap = 15-15 = 0\n        gaps = [3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1] -> max(gaps)=5 -> mid_gap=5/2=2.5\n\n        d_required = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the maximum gap is not the one that requires the largest d? Actually, the condition for each gap is independent and we require d to be at least half the gap. The worst-case gap is the largest one, so the maximum of the gaps divided by two is the minimal d that covers all gaps.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the edges is independent and we must cover the entire street from 0 to l. The above conditions are necessary and sufficient.\n\n   One more edge: if the street is already fully covered by the lanterns without needing to extend beyond the lanterns? \n\n   Example: n=3, l=10, a=[1,2,9]\n\n        Conditions:\n          left_gap = 1 (so d>=1)\n          right_gap = 1 (so d>=1)\n          gaps: [2-1=1, 9-2=7] -> mid_gap = 7/2=3.5\n\n        Then d_required = 3.5\n\n        Check: with d=3.5, the first lantern covers [1-3.5, 1+3.5] = [-2.5,4.5] -> covers 0 to 4.5.\n               second lantern: [2-3.5,2+3.5]=[-1.5,5.5] -> covers 0 to 5.5.\n               third lantern: [9-3.5,9+3.5]=[5.5,12.5] -> covers from 5.5 to 10.\n\n        The entire street [0,10] is covered? \n          0 to 5.5: covered by the second lantern (which goes to 5.5) and the third lantern starts at 5.5, so yes.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the condition for the left edge is d>=1, but the gap between the first two lanterns requires d>=0.5 (for the first gap) and the gap between the second and third requires d>=3.5. Then the overall d is 3.5, which is greater than 1, so the left edge is satisfied.\n\n   So we don't need to check the edges separately because the gaps and the edges are independent and the maximum d will naturally cover the edges.\n\n   But wait, is that always true?\n\n        Consider: the left edge condition is d>=a0. But if we set d to the maximum of (a0, l-a_{n-1}, max_gap/2) then:\n\n        - The left edge: d>=a0 is satisfied because we are taking the maximum including a0.\n\n        Similarly, the right edge: d>=l-a_{n-1} is satisfied.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left edge is d>=a0, but if a0 is negative? The problem states that lanterns are at positions between 0 and l, inclusive. So a0>=0.\n\n   Similarly, the last lantern is at most l, so l - a[-1] >=0.\n\n   Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n   But wait: what if the lanterns are not covering the entire street even with a very large d? Actually, the problem states that the lanterns are located at points ai (0<=ai<=l). We are computing the minimal d to cover the entire street.\n\n   The above conditions are necessary and sufficient.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Compute the three types of requirements\n        req_left = a[0]  # d must be at least this to cover from 0 to the first lantern\n        req_right = l - a[-1]  # d must be at least this to cover from the last lantern to l\n        req_mid = 0.0\n        if n == 1:\n            # Only one lantern, then the gaps are zero, but we have two edges.\n            # We already have req_left and req_right, so the answer is max(req_left, req_right)\n            # But note: we don't need to compute gaps because there are none.\n            # We can handle n==1 separately, but our current code for gaps uses n>1, so we can do:\n            #   if n==1: then skip the gap calculation.\n            # Alternatively, we can do the gap calculation only if n>1.\n            pass\n        else:\n            max_gap = 0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                if gap > max_gap:\n                    max_gap = gap\n            req_mid = max_gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(req_left, req_right, req_mid)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But wait, the above code for the gaps is inefficient? We can compute the maximum gap in one pass.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Edge conditions\n        req_left = a[0]\n        req_right = l - a[-1]\n\n        # Middle gaps\n        req_mid = 0.0\n        if n > 1:\n            max_gap = 0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                if gap > max_gap:\n                    max_gap = gap\n            req_mid = max_gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(req_left, req_right, req_mid)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   This is acceptable since n<=1000.\n\n   However, we can also use:\n\n        req_mid = 0.0\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            req_mid = max(req_mid, gap/2.0)\n\n   This is also O(n) and the same.\n\n   I'll choose the latter for clarity.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        req_left = a[0] if n > 0 else l/2.0   # but n>=1, so we don't need the else\n        req_right = l - a[-1] if n > 0 else l/2.0\n\n        req_mid = 0.0\n        if n > 1:\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                req_mid = max(req_mid, gap/2.0)\n        else:\n            # if n==1, then no gaps, so req_mid remains 0.0\n            pass\n\n        ans = max(req_left, req_right, req_mid)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But note: if n==0, the problem says n>=1, so we can assume n>=1.\n\n   Therefore, we can simplify:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        req_left = a[0]\n        req_right = l - a[-1]\n        req_mid = 0.0\n\n        if n > 1:\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                if gap/2.0 > req_mid:\n                    req_mid = gap/2.0\n\n        ans = max(req_left, req_right, req_mid)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But wait, the condition for the left edge is that d must be at least req_left (a[0]) and similarly for the right. However, note: if the first lantern is at 0, then req_left=0. Similarly, if the last lantern is at l, then req_right=0.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, there is an alternative way: we can consider the entire street is covered by the union of intervals. The minimal d must be at least half the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns (including the edges). Actually, we can consider the entire street as having segments:\n\n        Segment0: from 0 to a0 -> length a0\n        Segment1: from a0 to a1 -> length (a1 - a0)\n        ...\n        Segment_{n}: from a_{n-1} to l -> length (l - a_{n-1])\n\n   But note: the condition for the edges is that the first lantern must cover the segment from 0 to a0, so the required d for that edge is a0 (because the first lantern",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at specific points along the street, and each lantern lights up all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` that ensures the entire street is covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is represented as a line segment from 0 to `l`. The lanterns are positioned at points `a_i` (0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `l`). The challenge is to compute the minimal `d` such that every point on the street is within `d` units of at least one lantern.\n2. **Key Insight**: The entire street must be covered by the union of intervals `[a_i - d, a_i + d]` for all lantern positions `a_i`. The minimal `d` must satisfy three conditions:\n   - **Left Edge Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the segment from 0 to its position. Thus, `d` must be at least the distance from the first lantern to 0 (`a[0]`).\n   - **Right Edge Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the segment from its position to `l`. Thus, `d` must be at least the distance from the last lantern to `l` (`l - a[-1]`).\n   - **Middle Gaps Coverage**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by the combined coverage of the two adjacent lanterns. The required `d` here is half the distance between the two closest lanterns in the sorted list.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the lantern positions to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - Calculate the three candidate values for `d`: the left edge requirement, the right edge requirement, and the maximum of half the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - The minimal `d` is the maximum of these three candidates, ensuring all segments of the street are covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\nreq_left = a[0]\nreq_right = l - a[-1]\nreq_mid = 0.0\n\nif n > 1:\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        if gap / 2.0 > req_mid:\n            req_mid = gap / 2.0\n\nans = max(req_left, req_right, req_mid)\n\nprint(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order.\n3. **Edge Conditions**: \n   - `req_left` is the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern.\n   - `req_right` is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n4. **Middle Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the code checks if the gap between them requires a larger `d` (specifically, half the gap). The largest such value is stored in `req_mid`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal `d` is the maximum value among `req_left`, `req_right`, and `req_mid`, ensuring all parts of the street are covered. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places. \n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal `d` by breaking down the problem into manageable segments and ensuring all edge cases are covered. The sorting step ensures optimal processing of lantern positions, and the subsequent checks guarantee comprehensive coverage of the entire street.",
