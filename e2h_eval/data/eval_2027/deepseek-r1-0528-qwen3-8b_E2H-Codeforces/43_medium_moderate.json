He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string only contains 'a', 'b', 'c'\n Steps:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends 'c' so there might be no 'c'? Actually, the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (or both). However, note that the process:\n   - A gives a string of some 'a's.\n   - B appends some 'b's (at least one).\n   - C appends some 'c's (the number of 'c' is either the total 'a' in the original or the total 'b' (which includes the ones from B) OR both.\n\n But note: the entire string is built as:\n   [some 'a's] [some 'b's] [some 'c's]\n\n Conditions on the order:\n   - The string must have all the 'a's first, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's? Not necessarily? Let's read the problem:\n\n   However, note the example: \n        Input: 'bbacc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\n   Why? Because the example input \"bbacc\" has two 'b's, then an 'a'? That breaks the order.\n\n   So the conditions on the string are:\n     - The string must be divided into three contiguous segments: \n           [all 'a's] [all 'b's] [all 'c's]\n     - There is at least one 'a', at least one 'b', and the number of 'c' must be either the total number of 'a' or the total number of 'b' (or both).\n\n   But wait: what if there are no 'c's? Then the condition for C is that he appends some number of 'c' (so at least one) so the string must have at least one 'c'? Actually, the problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", meaning at least one? Or could it be zero? \n\n   Let me check the problem statement: \n        \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string\"\n\n   In English, \"some\" usually means at least one. However, the problem also says: \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.\"\n\n   But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b'. \n\n   However, the problem states that after C appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B). But note: the initial string by A and B already has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends, so the total number of 'a' remains the same (only from A) and the total number of 'b' is the one from B. Then the condition for C is that the appended 'c's should be either the total count of 'a' or the total count of 'b' (note: the total count of 'a' is fixed, the total count of 'b' is fixed, but note: the entire string might have more than just the initial part? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        A: string of some number of 'a'\n        B: appends some number of 'b' (so the string becomes: all a's then all b's)\n        C: appends some number of 'c' such that the count of c = count(a) OR count(b)\n\n   But note: the entire string is given. We are to check if it is possible that we split the string into three contiguous parts: [a's], [b's], [c's] and the condition on the counts holds.\n\n   However, note: the example \"aabc\" is \"YES\". Let's break down \"aabc\":\n        It has two 'a's, one 'b', and one 'c'. The condition for C: the number of 'c' (which is 1) must be equal to the number of 'a' (2) or the number of 'b' (1). It is equal to the number of 'b'. So condition holds.\n\n   But note the order: \n        The string \"aabc\": \n            starts with 'a', then 'a', then 'b', then 'c'. \n        This is: [two 'a's] [one 'b'] [one 'c'] -> valid.\n\n   Now, what if the string is \"aaccc\"? \n        Count of 'a': 2, 'b':0 -> wait, but the problem says after B appends, there must be at least one 'b'. So if we see no 'b' then it's invalid.\n\n   Therefore, the steps:\n\n   1. Check that the string is composed of three contiguous blocks: first block is 'a's, second block is 'b's, third block is 'c's. There should be no other characters.\n\n   2. The entire string must contain at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. (Because A and B each put at least one.)\n\n   3. The number of 'c' must be either the total number of 'a' (in the entire string) OR the total number of 'b' (in the entire string). \n\n   However, note: the total number of 'a' and 'b' in the entire string is fixed because the 'c' part is appended. But wait: the counts for 'a' and 'b' do not change with the appending of 'c'. \n\n   But wait: the entire string is built from A's 'a's, B's 'b's, and C's 'c's. The counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed from the initial two steps.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not say that the entire string must be split exactly as three contiguous blocks. What if we have a string like \"aaabbbccc\", then that is valid. But what if we have \"aabbbc\"?\n        Count of 'a':2, 'b':3, 'c':1 -> then the condition for C: number of 'c' (1) must equal either 2 or 3 -> no. So invalid.\n\n   But what about the order? The problem states the process: \n        A gives a string of a's -> so the beginning must be a's.\n        Then B appends b's -> so after the a's, we get b's.\n        Then C appends c's -> so after the b's, we get c's.\n\n   Therefore, the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: no 'a' after a non-'a', no 'b' after a non-'b', etc.\n\n   So the string must be in the form: \n        S = ('a'*x) + ('b'*y) + ('c'*z)\n\n   And the conditions:\n        x >= 1, y >= 1, z >= 1 (because C appends at least one 'c')? Actually, wait: the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. The word \"some\" typically implies at least one. So z>=1.\n\n   However, let's reread: \n        \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\"\n\n   The problem does not explicitly say \"at least one\", but note: the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. If we allow zero, then the condition would require that either the number of 'a' is zero or the number of 'b' is zero, but we know from the problem that after A and B there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So if we have zero 'c', then the condition fails (because we require the appended 'c' to be either the count of 'a' (which is positive) or the count of 'b' (positive)). So zero is not allowed. Therefore, we require at least one 'c'.\n\n   But wait, what if the problem allows zero? Then the condition for C would be: the number of 'c' (0) must be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. Since the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', then 0 != x and 0 != y, so condition fails. So even if the problem allowed zero, the condition would fail. Therefore, we can assume that the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n   However, the example outputs: \n        Example 1: 'aaabccc' -> YES (has 3 a's, 3 b's, 3 c's? Actually: a:3, b:1, c:3 -> wait, no: the example says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. So 3 == 3 -> valid. But note: the example says the number of 'c' is 3, which equals the number of 'a' (which is 3). But wait, the example input is 'aaabccc': \n            a:3, b:1, c:3 -> then the condition holds because 3==3 (for a) and 3!=1 (for b). \n\n        Example 2: 'bbacc' -> NO. \n            This string: \n                'b','b','a','c','c'\n            It is not in the form of a's then b's then c's because we have an 'a' in the middle.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n   Step 1: Check the entire string is in the form: [a's][b's][c's]. We can do:\n\n        Traverse the string and check that:\n          - Once we leave 'a', we don't see 'a' again.\n          - Once we leave 'b', we don't see 'b' again.\n          - Similarly for 'c'.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check: \n          - The string should not have any 'b' before the first 'c' or any 'a' after the first 'b' or any 'a' after the first 'c', etc.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        Let n = len(S)\n\n        We can traverse until we find a character that is not 'a', then from that point on, we can only see 'b' and then 'c', and similarly for the others.\n\n        More specifically:\n\n        Let i=0\n        While i < n and S[i]=='a': i++\n        Then while i < n and S[i]=='b': i++\n        Then while i < n and S[i]=='c': i++\n        If i < n, then the string is invalid.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aaa\"? Then we don't have any 'b' or 'c'. According to the problem, we must have at least one 'b' (from B) and at least one 'c' (from C). So we require that the entire string is broken down into three parts: non-empty a's, non-empty b's, non-empty c's.\n\n        So we require:\n          - The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n        Step 2: Count the total number of 'a', 'b', 'c' in the entire string.\n\n        Step 3: Check that the number of 'c' is either the total number of 'a' or the total number of 'b'.\n\n   However, note: the entire string is built from the three parts. The counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed from the initial two steps, and the 'c' is appended. But the problem says the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' (the total in the entire string) OR the number of 'b' (the total in the entire string).\n\n   But wait: the entire string's count of 'a' is the same as the one from A (since B and C don't add 'a'). Similarly, the entire string's count of 'b' is the same as the one from B (since C doesn't add 'b').\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        Condition1: count('c') == count('a')\n        Condition2: count('c') == count('b')\n\n        Then if Condition1 or Condition2 is true, and the string is in the correct order and has at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c', then output \"YES\".\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (with two a's, two b's, two c's)? \n        Condition1: 2 == 2 -> true, so YES.\n\n   However, let's consider an example that fails the order: \"abcabc\" -> this is not in the form of three contiguous blocks. Our traversal method would fail because after the first 'a' we see a 'b' and then a 'c', but then we see another 'a'? Actually, our traversal:\n\n        Start: \n            i=0: 'a' -> continue\n            i=1: 'b' -> now we are in the b part\n            i=2: 'c' -> now we are in the c part\n            i=3: 'a' -> this is not allowed.\n\n        So our traversal would stop at i=3 and we see that we haven't traversed the whole string. So we return invalid.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Read S\n\n        Step 1: Check the entire string is in the form of [a...]*[b...]*[c...]*\n\n        Step 2: Count the frequency of 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n        Step 3: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. (But note: Step1 requires the string to have a's, then b's, then c's, so if we break the order, we already say NO. Also, the counts from Step2 will naturally be non-zero for each if the entire string is processed and we have three parts.)\n\n        However, note: what if the string is \"abc\"? \n            Order: \n                Start: \n                    i0: 'a' -> ok\n                    i1: 'b' -> ok\n                    i2: 'c' -> ok\n                Then i becomes 3, so we have processed the whole string.\n\n            Counts: a:1, b:1, c:1 -> condition: c==a -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n        But wait: the problem says that C appends the number of 'c' to be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. In this case, the entire string has:\n            Original from A: one 'a'\n            Then B appends one 'b'\n            Then C appends one 'c'. \n            The condition: the number of 'c' (1) must equal the number of 'a' (1) OR the number of 'b' (1). It is both. So valid.\n\n        Another example: \"abbccc\" (a:1, b:2, c:3): \n            Condition: 3 == 1? No. 3==2? No. -> NO.\n\n        But wait, how did we get 3? The process: \n            A gives one 'a'\n            B appends two 'b's -> so the string becomes \"abb\"\n            Then C appends three 'c's. But the condition for C: the number of 'c' must be the number of 'a' (which is 1) or the number of 'b' (which is 2). 3 is neither. So NO.\n\n        However, note: the entire string has 3 c's. The condition is based on the entire string's counts of 'a' and 'b'. The entire string's 'a' is still 1 and 'b' is still 2.\n\n        So the condition is independent of the breakdown? Yes, because the counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed from the first two steps.\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"aabbbccc\"? \n            a:2, b:3, c:3 -> condition: 3==2 -> no; 3==3 -> yes. So YES.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that C appends the number of 'c' to be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. In this case, the entire string has 2 a's and 3 b's. Then C appends 3 c's. The condition is met because 3==3 (the number of b's). \n\n        But note: the entire string's count of 'b' is 3, which is the same as the appended 'c's. This matches.\n\n        However, the problem says that the string must be built by:\n            A: gives 2 a's -> \"aa\"\n            B: appends 3 b's -> \"aa\" + \"bbb\" -> \"aabbb\"\n            C: appends 3 c's -> \"aabbbccc\"\n\n        So the condition is met.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll do:\n\n        def main():\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            # Step 1: Check the order\n            n = len(s)\n            i = 0\n            # Skip all 'a'\n            while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n            # Then skip all 'b'\n            while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n                i += 1\n            # Then skip all 'c'\n            while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n                i += 1\n\n            # If we haven't traversed the entire string, then the order is broken.\n            if i != n:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n            # Now, we must have at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'. But note: our while loops broke when we encountered a new character, but we might have skipped parts. However, if the string is empty, we don't need to worry because |S|>=1.\n\n            # But note: what if the string is \"aaa\"? Then the first while loop ends at i=n, but then we didn't enter the second and third. So the condition for having at least one 'b' and one 'c' fails. However, our Step1 above already requires the entire string to be broken down into three contiguous parts. But we only checked that after the a's we have b's and then c's. In \"aaa\", we didn't have any b or c, so the entire string is just a's. Then the condition i==n is satisfied, but the problem requires at least one b and one c.\n\n            # Therefore, we must also check that we actually encountered at least one 'b' and one 'c'. How?\n\n            # We can count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\n            count_a = s.count('a')\n            count_b = s.count('b')\n            count_c = s.count('c')\n\n            # The problem requires at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' (from the process). \n            if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n            # Now, check the condition for C: \n            if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (which we saw earlier)? \n        count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2 -> condition: 2==2 or 2==2 -> true -> YES.\n\n   However, consider the string \"aaabbbccc\": \n        count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=3 -> condition: 3==3 -> true -> YES.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" and we break it down as:\n        A: 3 a's\n        B: 3 b's\n        C: 3 c's\n        Condition: the number of c's (3) equals the number of a's (3) -> YES.\n\n   Another example: \"aabbccc\" (a:2, b:2, c:3) -> condition: 3==2? no; 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"aabbcccccc\": \n        a:2, b:2, c:6 -> 6==2? no; 6==2? no -> NO.\n\n   However, note: the condition is that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. In this case, 6 is not 2 and 6 is not 2 -> NO.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (a:2, b:2, c:2) -> YES.\n\n   However, what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" (a:3, b:3, c:3) -> YES.\n\n   But consider the example \"aaabccc\" (from the problem): \n        a:3, b:1, c:3 -> condition: 3==3 (true) -> YES.\n\n   Now, what about the example \"bbacc\" (from the problem)? \n        We already rejected it because of order. But let's run through our code:\n\n        Step 1: \n            Start: \n                i=0: 'b' -> not 'a', so we break the first while. Then we try to skip 'b's: \n                    i=0: 'b' -> enter the second while: \n                    i=1: 'b' -> then i=2: 'a' -> break the second while.\n                Then we try to skip 'c's: \n                    i=2: 'a' -> not 'c', so the third while does nothing.\n                Then i=2, and we haven't traversed the whole string (n=5, i=2) -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n   So that matches.\n\n   However, there is a catch: what if the string has no 'b'? Then the second while loop would not run, and then the third while loop would run until the end, but then we don't have a 'b' part. \n\n   Example: \"aacc\" -> \n        First while: skip all 'a' -> i becomes 2 (if the string is \"aacc\", then after first while i=2 because the first char is 'a', then next is 'a'? Actually, the string \"aacc\": \n            s[0]='a' -> skip until not 'a': so we skip the two 'a's? Actually, we skip until we hit non-'a'. \n\n        Correction: the first while loop skips consecutive 'a's. In \"aacc\": \n            i=0: 'a' -> i becomes 1\n            i=1: 'a' -> i becomes 2\n            i=2: 'c' -> break.\n\n        Then the second while: at i=2, character 'c' -> not 'b', so skip (do nothing).\n        Then the third while: from i=2 to the end: 'c','c' -> i becomes 4.\n\n        Then i==4, so we pass the order check.\n\n        Now, we check counts: \n            count_a=2, count_b=0, count_c=2.\n\n        Then we check: if count_b==0 -> then we print \"NO\".\n\n        This is correct because the problem requires at least one 'b' from B.\n\n   Similarly, if there's no 'a'? \n        Example: \"bbccc\" -> \n            First while: i=0, s[0]=='b' -> so we break the first while immediately.\n            Then second while: skip 'b's -> i goes to 3 (if there are three 'b's, then i=3).\n            Then third while: skip 'c's -> i becomes 6 (if the string length is 6) -> then we check: count_a=0 -> print \"NO\".\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # Traverse the string in three phases: a, then b, then c.\n        i = 0\n        # Phase 1: 'a'\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n        # Phase 2: 'b'\n        while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n        # Phase 3: 'c'\n        while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n\n        # Now, count the total number of each character\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        # Check that we have at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'\n        if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n\n        # Check condition for C: the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: is it possible that the string has a mix of the characters but still passes the order check? \n\n   The order check is very strict: we require that after an 'a' we can only have 'a', then after that non-'a' we can only have 'b', then after that non-'b' we can only have 'c'. \n\n   But note: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\"? It works.\n\n   But what if the string is \"aabbcc\"? It works.\n\n   But what if the string is \"aabbccc\"? \n        Order: \n            a's: \"aa\", then \"bb\", then \"ccc\" -> valid.\n\n   Another edge: the string might be just one letter? But the problem says the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c' (from the process). So the minimal string is \"abc\", which has length 3.\n\n   However, the input constraint: |S|>=1.\n\n   But note: the example \"aabc\" (from the problem) is \"YES\". Our code for \"aabc\":\n\n        Step1: \n            i=0: 'a' -> i=1\n            i=1: 'a' -> i=2\n            i=2: 'b' -> enter second while: i=3\n            i=3: 'c' -> enter third while: i=4 -> done.\n\n        Counts: \n            count_a = 2, count_b=1, count_c=1 -> condition: 1==2? no; 1==1? yes -> YES.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"abac\"?\n        Order check: \n            i=0: 'a' -> i=1\n            i=1: 'b' -> enter second while: i=2\n            i=2: 'a' -> break the second while (because we are now at 'a', which is not 'b'), then we try to skip 'c': i=2 is 'a', so third while does nothing -> i=2, which is less than 4 -> NO.\n\n   So that is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the entire string is built by the process. The process does not allow mixing. So the order must be strictly increasing in the sense of the alphabet? Actually, the process: \n        A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's.\n\n   Therefore, the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: no going back to a lower letter.\n\n   But note: the string must be in the order: all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n   One more edge: what if the string is \"acb\"? \n        Step1: \n            i=0: 'a' -> i=1\n            i=1: 'c' -> break first while, then second while (s[i]=='c' not 'b') -> so second while does nothing, then third while: s[1]=='c' -> i becomes 2, then s[2]=='b' -> not 'c', so third while stops. Then i=2, but n=3 -> not traversed -> NO.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"aba\"? \n        Step1: \n            i=0: 'a' -> i=1\n            i=1: 'b' -> enter second while: i=2\n            i=2: 'a' -> not 'b', so break second while. Then third while: s[2]=='a' -> not 'c', so nothing. i=2, n=3 -> NO.\n\n   However, note: the string \"aba\" has an 'a' after a 'b', which is not allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the code seems to work.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. We already check that the entire string is broken into three contiguous parts (so if there's no 'b' or no 'c', we catch it). But note: the counts are taken over the entire string. \n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"a\" (length 1)? \n        Then Step1: \n            i=0: 'a' -> i becomes 1 -> then the rest: nothing -> i==1, so we pass the order check?\n        Then we check counts: \n            count_a=1, count_b=0, count_c=0 -> then we print \"NO\".\n\n   Similarly, \"b\" -> NO, \"c\"-> NO.\n\n   But what if the string is \"aab\"? \n        Order: \n            i=0: 'a' -> i=1\n            i=1: 'a' -> i=2\n            i=2: 'b' -> enter second while: i=3 -> done.\n        Then counts: a=2, b=1, c=0 -> then we print \"NO\" because c=0.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that after B appends, there is at least one 'b', and after C appends, there is at least one 'c'. So we must have at least one 'b' and one 'c'. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'b' and one 'c'.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        i = 0\n        # Traverse the a's\n        while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n            i += 1\n        # Traverse the b's\n        while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n            i += 1\n        # Traverse the c's\n        while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the entire string is broken into three contiguous parts, but the process produces three contiguous parts. The problem says:\n\n        A gives a string of 'a's.\n        B appends 'b's (so they are at the end).\n        C appends 'c's (so they are at the end).\n\n   Therefore, the string must be in the form of three contiguous parts. We are checking that.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\"? \n        We break it down: \n            a's: 4, b's: 3, c's:3 -> condition: 3==4? no; 3==3? yes -> YES.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the entire string (at the time of C appending). But note: at the time of C appending, the entire string (without the 'c's) has:\n        a: count_a (same as now)\n        b: count_b (same as now)\n\n   So the condition is the same.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   But wait: what if the string has multiple runs? For example, \"aabbcc\" is okay, but what if the string is \"aabbcccd\"? \n        Step1: \n            Traverse a's: i=2\n            Traverse b's: i=4\n            Traverse c's: i=7 (if the string length is 8, then we have 'd' at index 7? Actually, the string is \"aabbcccd\", so the last character is 'd'. \n\n        Then i=7, but n=8 -> i != n -> NO.\n\n   Correct, because the string must not have any other characters.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the string only consists of 'a','b','c'. So we don't have to worry about other characters. The input guarantee: \"It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\" \n\n   Therefore, we don't have to check for other characters.\n\n   However, note: our order check relies on the fact that the string only contains 'a','b','c'. Because we break when we see a non-'a', then non-'b', then non-'c'. But if there is a 'd', then we break and say NO. But the input doesn't have 'd'. So we are safe.\n\n   Let me test with the example from the problem: \n        Example Input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n        For 'aaabccc': \n            Order: \n                a's: \"aaa\" -> i=3\n                b's: \"b\" -> i=4\n                c's: \"ccc\" -> i=7 -> done.\n            Counts: a=3, b=1, c=3 -> condition: 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        For 'bbacc': \n            Order: \n                a's: none -> i=0\n                b's: \"bb\" -> i=2\n                then we see 'a' at index2 -> break the b's, then try to skip c's: from index2, we have 'a' -> so c's skipped 0 -> i=2, n=5 -> NO.\n\n        For 'aabc':\n            Order: \n                a's: \"aa\" -> i=2\n                b's: \"b\" -> i=3\n                c's: \"c\" -> i=4 -> done.\n            Counts: a=2, b=1, c=1 -> condition: 1==2? no; 1==1? yes -> YES.\n\n   All examples passed.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"abc\" (minimal example)? \n        Order: \n            a's: \"a\" -> i=1\n            b's: \"b\" -> i=2\n            c's: \"c\" -> i=3 -> done.\n        Counts: a=1, b=1, c=1 -> condition: 1==1 -> YES.\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that C appends the number of 'c' to be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. In the minimal example, the entire string has 1 'a' and 1 'b'. The condition is met because the number of 'c' is 1, which is equal to the number of 'a' and the number of 'b'.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must use exit(0) or return? Since this is the main function, we can structure it as a function.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        i = 0\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n        while i < n and s[i]=='b':\n            i += 1\n        while i < n and s[i]=='c':\n            i += 1\n\n        if i != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            count_a = s.count('a')\n            count_b = s.count('b')\n            count_c = s.count('c')\n            if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"abc\" and we break the order? Actually, we don't break the order. \n\n   However, note: the above code prints \"NO\" for any string that doesn't traverse the entire string. \n\n   But consider the example \"aaa\": \n        We traverse the entire string (i becomes 3, n=3) -> then we check counts: a=3, b=0, c=0 -> so we print \"NO\".\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"a\" (one 'a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three friends: A, B, and C. Friend A starts with a string of 'a's, friend B appends some 'b's, and friend C appends some 'c's such that the number of 'c's equals either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the resulting string before appending. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Structure**: The string must be composed of three contiguous segments: one or more 'a's followed by one or more 'b's followed by one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the structure, count the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c').\n3. **Validate Conditions**: Ensure there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    i = 0\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n        \n    if i != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Structure Check**: The code first checks if the string follows the required order by traversing through segments of 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's. If the entire string is not processed during this traversal, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Count Validation**: The code then counts the occurrences of each character. If any of the characters ('a', 'b', or 'c') are missing, the string is invalid.\n3. **Condition Check for 'c's**: Finally, the code checks if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If this condition is satisfied, the string is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies both the structural and numerical conditions required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
