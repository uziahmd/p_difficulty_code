On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNS) in the resulting sequence.\n\n Observation:\n Since the array only contains 1 and 2, a non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a contiguous (in terms of values) sequence of 1's followed by 2's. However, note that the entire sequence is just 1's and 2's, so the LNS can be:\n\n Option 1: All the 1's (if there are no 2's, then the whole sequence is 1's)\n Option 2: All the 2's\n Option 3: A mix of 1's and 2's, but note that if we have a 2 after a 1, then we can combine the two.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to reverse an interval. The goal is to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Let total_ones = total count of 1's, total_twos = total count of 2's.\n\n Without any reversal, the LNS is max(total_ones, total_twos) if the entire array is not already non-decreasing? Actually, without reversal, we can have a non-decreasing subsequence that is all the 1's and then as many 2's as possible that come after the last 1? But wait, without reversal, the entire sequence might have some 2's before 1's, so the non-decreasing subsequence can take at most:\n\n   - The entire set of 1's (if they are contiguous, but actually non-decreasing doesn't require contiguous indices) OR\n   - The entire set of 2's OR\n   - Some 1's and then some 2's that occur after the last taken 1.\n\n Actually, in the original array, the longest non-decreasing subsequence can be computed by standard method, but note the array is only 1 and 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: \n   Without reversal, the LNS is the maximum between:\n      (a) the total number of 1's (because we can always pick all 1's)\n      (b) the total number of 2's\n      (c) the number of 1's that are at the beginning (until the first 2) plus the number of 2's from the first 2 onward? Actually, no: the non-decreasing subsequence can jump arbitrarily. However, because the array is binary, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if all 1's come before 2's. Otherwise, we can have:\n\n   Example: [1, 1, 2, 1] -> the longest non-decreasing subsequence is [1,1,2] (length 3) or [1,1,2] (same) but also [1,1,2] is the best.\n\n Actually, for binary arrays, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire set of 1's (if we can get them) and then the entire set of 2's that are after the last 1 we took? But wait, we don't need to take contiguous ones. Actually, we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that appear anywhere after the last 1? Not exactly: the condition is that the indices must be increasing. So we can take all the 1's and then any 2 that comes after any of the 1's? Actually, we can take the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break it down.\n\n However, note: the problem allows us to reverse one contiguous interval. So we are allowed to do one reversal to try to maximize the LNS.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Original array: a\n\n After reversing an interval [l, r], the new array is:\n   a[0:l-1] + reversed(a[l-1:r]) + a[r:]\n\n What is the effect of reversing?\n   It can change the order of 1's and 2's in that segment.\n\n Note: The reversal operation does not change the counts of 1's and 2's.\n\n We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since n <= 2000, we can consider an O(n^2) solution.\n\n Idea: try every possible reversal (every [l, r]) and then compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNS) of the resulting array. Then take the maximum.\n\n However, computing the LNS for an array of size up to 2000 using O(n^2) method (like the classical O(n^2) for longest increasing subsequence) would be O(n^2) per reversal, and there are O(n^2) revers",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary array after reversing any one contiguous interval. The array consists only of 1s and 2s, which simplifies the problem as the LNDS will either be all the 1s, all the 2s, or a combination of 1s followed by 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that reversing any interval can potentially merge some 1s and 2s into a longer non-decreasing sequence. The optimal solution involves either:\n   - Keeping the entire array as is, if it's already non-decreasing.\n   - Reversing an interval such that the resulting array has the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary array of 1s and 2s is determined by the total count of 1s and 2s, but also by their arrangement. The best possible LNDS is the maximum between the total number of 1s, the total number of 2s, or the sum of 1s followed by 2s in a specific configuration.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Counts**: Calculate the number of 1s from the start up to each index and the number of 2s from each index to the end. This helps in quickly determining how many 1s and 2s are present in any subarray.\n   - **Evaluate All Possible Reversals**: For each possible reversal interval [l, r], compute the new counts of 1s and 2s in the modified array. The LNDS after reversal is the maximum of:\n     - The total number of 1s.\n     - The total number of 2s.\n     - The sum of 1s before the reversal interval plus the 2s after the reversal interval (or vice versa, depending on which part has more 1s or 2s).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n^2) time because for each possible reversal interval (O(n^2) intervals), we compute the LNDS in constant time using precomputed prefix and suffix sums. The space complexity is O(n) for storing prefix and suffix arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(arr)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if i <= n else 0)\n    \n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_lnds = max(total_ones, total_twos)\n    \n    for l in range(1, n + 1):\n        ones_left = prefix_ones[l]\n        twos_right = suffix_twos[l]\n        ones_in_between = prefix_ones[n] - prefix_ones[l] - (suffix_twos[l] if l < n else 0)\n        twos_in_between = n - ones_in_between - (ones_left + twos_right)\n        \n        candidate = ones_left + twos_right + max(ones_in_between, twos_in_between)\n        if candidate > max_lnds:\n            max_lnds = candidate\n            \n    for l in range(1, n + 1):\n        ones_left = prefix_ones[l]\n        twos_right = suffix_twos[l]\n        ones_in_between = prefix_ones[n] - prefix_ones[l] - (suffix_twos[l] if l < n else 0)\n        twos_in_between = n - ones_in_between - (ones_left + twos_right)\n        \n        candidate = ones_left + twos_right + max(ones_in_between, twos_in_between)\n        if candidate > max_lnds:\n            max_lnds = candidate\n            \n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: The `prefix_ones` array stores the cumulative count of 1s up to each index, while the `suffix_twos` array stores the cumulative count of 2s from each index to the end. These arrays help in quickly accessing the counts of 1s and 2s in any segment of the array.\n2. **Initial Maximum Calculation**: The initial maximum LNDS is set to the larger of the total number of 1s or 2s in the array.\n3. **Reversal Evaluation**: For each possible reversal interval, the algorithm calculates the number of 1s and 2s in the left, middle, and right segments. The potential LNDS after reversal is the sum of 1s from the left segment, 2s from the right segment, and the maximum of the 1s or 2s in the middle segment.\n4. **Result Update**: The maximum value obtained from all possible reversals is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the array after a single reversal and determines the optimal solution by leveraging precomputed prefix and suffix sums.",
