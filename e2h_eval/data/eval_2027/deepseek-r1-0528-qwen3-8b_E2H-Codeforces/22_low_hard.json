After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has n and m, then n lines with m characters (each row is a string of m digits)\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines (each line is a string of m digits) and store them in a list.\n\n For each subject j (column), we can find the best mark (which is the maximum mark for that subject). However, note: there might be multiple students with the same best mark, and they are all considered best for that subject.\n\n But the problem says: a student is successful if there exists at least one subject for which he is the best.\n\n Approach:\n For each student i, check if there is at least one subject j for which:\n   grade[i][j] is equal to the maximum mark in column j.\n\n However, note: if two or more students have the same maximum mark in a subject, then they are all the best in that subject.\n\n So, we can precompute for each subject (each column) the maximum mark and also note that we need to know if a student has that maximum mark in at least one subject.\n\n Alternate approach:\n For each student, we want to know if there's at least one subject where he is the best (i.e., his mark in that subject is the maximum for that subject).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, m and the list of strings (each string is a row of m characters).\n 2. For each column j (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum value (as an integer or character, but we can use string comparison too since '9'>'1').\n 3. For each student i, check for any subject j: \n        grade[i][j] == max_mark[j]\n\n But note: the input is given as strings. We can compare the characters directly because the marks are from '1' to '9'.\n\n However, what if there are multiple columns? We need to check for each student.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      3 3\n      223\n      232\n      112\n\n   For subject0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n   For subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n   For subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Then for student0 (index0): \n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful\n        subject1: '2' == '3' -> False\n        subject2: '3' == '3' -> True -> already found one, so successful.\n\n   But wait, actually the example output is 2. The example says:\n        student 1 (the first one) is best at subjects 1 and 3 -> wait, let me clarify indexing.\n\n   The problem indexes students from 1. In our code, we index from 0.\n\n   Actually, the example input:\n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Student0: \"223\"\n   Student1: \"232\"\n   Student2: \"112\"\n\n   According to the example: \n        Student number 1 (which is the first one, index0) is best at subjects 1 and 3.\n\n   But note: the example counts the subjects by their order. So:\n\n        Subject1 (first subject) has marks: [2,2,1] -> max=2, so both student0 and student1 are best in subject1.\n        Subject2 (second subject) has marks: [2,3,1] -> max=3, so only student1 is best.\n        Subject3 (third subject) has marks: [3,2,2] -> max=3, so only student0 is best.\n\n   Therefore, student0 is best in subject1 and subject3 -> successful.\n          student1 is best in subject2 -> successful.\n          student2 is not best in any -> not successful.\n\n   So we output 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the n lines.\n\n   Step 3: For each column j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum character in that column.\n\n   Step 4: For each student i (from 0 to n-1), check if for any j (0 to m-1) the character at [i][j] equals the max of column j.\n\n   However, note: we can break early for a student once we find one subject where the student is best.\n\n   Example code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grades.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Precompute the maximum for each",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of a student in each subject.\n2. **Column-wise Maximum Calculation**: For each subject (column), compute the highest mark achieved by any student. This helps in identifying the best marks in each subject.\n3. **Success Check for Each Student**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are marked as successful.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: The total number of students who meet the success criterion is then counted and printed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grades = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grades.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    max_marks = [max(grades[j][i] for j in range(n)) for i in range(m)]\n    \n    successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if any(grades[i][j] == max_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n            successful += 1\n            \n    print(successful)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads all input lines at once. The first line contains the dimensions (n, m), and subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Column-wise Maximum Calculation**: Using a list comprehension, the code computes the maximum mark for each subject (column) across all students. This is stored in the `max_marks` list.\n3. **Success Check**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance against the highest marks in each subject, ensuring accurate identification of successful students. The solution handles edge cases such as all students having the same marks or no students being successful.",
