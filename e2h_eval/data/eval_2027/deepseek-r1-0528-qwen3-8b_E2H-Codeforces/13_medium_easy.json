For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the musical scale is cyclic, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute the distances in semitones.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map the note names to numbers (0 to 11). Let's define a list of notes in order.\n    Note: The problem states that the notes are repeated cyclically and the starting note is C (then C# etc. until H, and then back to C).\n\n    We have: \n        C -> 0\n        C# -> 1\n        D -> 2\n        D# -> 3\n        E -> 4\n        F -> 5\n        F# -> 6\n        G -> 7\n        G# -> 8\n        A -> 9\n        B -> 10\n        H -> 11\n\n    But note: the example says \"after H goes C\", so H is the last and then wraps around to C (which is 0). However, in our mapping, H is 11, and the next would be 0 (which is C). \n\n 2. Given three notes, we will have three numbers. Then we can consider all cyclic permutations. Since the chord is an unordered set, we need to check if there exists an ordering such that:\n    - For major: either (a, b, c) such that (b - a) % 12 = 4 and (c - b) % 12 = 3 (so the total from a to c is 7) OR\n      but wait, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily? Actually, we are looking for an ordering where the first two form a 4-semitone interval and the next two (in the same ordering) form a 3-semitone interval.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: the three intervals between the three notes must be 3, 4, 5? Actually, no. In a major triad, the entire set of intervals (if we arrange the notes in ascending order) should be 4 and 3 (so the third note is 7 above the first). Similarly, minor: 3 and 4 (so the third note is 7 above the first as well, but the pattern is different).\n\n    Actually, note: In a major triad, the root to third is 4 semitones, root to fifth is 7 semitones. In minor, root to third is 3 semitones, root to fifth is 7 semitones.\n\n    But wait: the problem says: \n      Major: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n          distance(X, Y) = 4\n          distance(Y, Z) = 3\n      Minor: There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n          distance(X, Y) = 3\n          distance(Y, Z) = 4\n\n    However, note that the chord has three notes and the total span from X to Z is 7 semitones in both cases (since 4+3=7). So the three notes must be 0, 4, 7 (for major) or 0, 3, 7 (for minor) modulo 12? Actually, let's check:\n\n    For major: \n        Let X = 0, then Y = 4, then Z = (0 + 4 + 3) % 12 = 7.\n        Then the set is {0, 4, 7}. \n\n    For minor:\n        Let X = 0, then Y = 3, then Z = (0 + 3 + 4) % 12 = 7.\n        Then the set is {0, 3, 7}.\n\n    So the two chords are uniquely determined by the set of intervals from the root: 4 and 3 (in order) for major, and 3 and 4 (in order) for minor.\n\n    But note: the problem does not fix the root. We can start from any note. So we have to check for every permutation.\n\n    However, note: the condition is on consecutive intervals. The chord is defined by the entire set of three notes. We can also consider that the three notes must form two intervals of 3 and 4 (or 4 and 3) that add up to 7, and then the remaining interval must be 5 (because 12 - 7 = 5). But wait: the intervals are computed modulo 12, but we are considering the smallest circle. Actually, the condition is that the entire set of three notes must be such that when sorted, the two intervals (from low to high) are 3 and 4 (minor) or 4 and 3 (major) but note: the entire circle is 12, so we might have to consider wrapping.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n    Step 1: Map the three input notes to numbers.\n    Step 2: Sort the three numbers (so we have a, b, c with a <= b <= c). Then we can also consider the circular arrangement: [a, b, c, a+12] to account for wrap-around.\n\n    But note: the problem says the scale is cyclic. So we can also have the case where the chord wraps around. For example, the note set {11, 0, 3} (which is {H, C, D})?\n\n    However, let's compute the intervals without wrap: \n        Without wrap: the distances from a to b, b to c, and c to a (via wrap) might be needed.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (because E is 4, then F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), C(12) which is 8). So we can calculate the distance between two notes x and y as (y - x) % 12, but then if negative we adjust? Actually, we want the smallest positive distance, but note: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't necessarily take the minimal circular distance, but the actual ascending distance? \n\n    However, the example: E to C is 8 because we go E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C (that's 8 steps). But wait, the example says \"between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n\n    So the distance is defined as: \n        Let x and y be two notes (as numbers). Then the distance from x to y (ascending) is (y - x) mod 12, but if y < x, then we do (y + 12 - x) mod 12? Actually, no: the example E to C: E is 4, C is 0. Then (0 - 4) is negative, so we do (0 + 12 - 4) = 8.\n\n    Therefore, the distance from x to y (ascending) is (y - x) % 12, but if negative, we add 12 and then mod 12? Actually, we can define:\n\n        def distance(x, y):\n            d = (y - x) % 12\n            # But wait, (y-x) might be negative, so we do: (y - x + 12) % 12? \n            # However, the example: E to C: (0-4) = -4, (-4 + 12) % 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\n    But note: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. However, when we are given two notes, we are to compute the ascending distance from the lower one to the higher one? Actually, no: the example says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" meaning from E to C (which is going up from E to C? That doesn't make sense because E is higher than C in the natural order? Actually, no: the musical scale is cyclic, but the notes are arranged as C, C#, ... H. So E is at 4 and C is at 0, but 0 is lower than 4? Actually, the problem says the scale is cyclic and the notes are repeated. The distance from E to C is the distance from E to the next C, which is 8 semitones. But from C to E is 4 semitones.\n\n    Therefore, the distance function should be defined as:\n\n        dist(x, y) = (y - x) % 12   if y >= x? Not exactly.\n\n        Actually, we want the ascending distance from note x to note y, which is the smallest nonnegative distance in the circle, but the example says from E to C is 8, which is the long way. However, wait: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we don't go backwards? So from E to C: we go from E (which is 4) to the next C (which is 12, because 12 is the next octave C). So the distance is 12 - 4? No, wait: from E (4) to the next C (12) is 8 semitones? Because 12-4=8.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: the distance from x to y is (y - x) % 12, but if negative, we add 12 and then mod 12? But then (0-4)%12 = -4 %12 = 8 (since -4 + 12 = 8). \n\n    However, note: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the uppest. In the example, from E to C, the lowest is E? Actually, no: the example says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" and also says \"between C and E is 4 semitones\". So the distance is directional: from the lower note to the higher note. But wait, E is higher than C? In the linear representation, yes. But in the cyclic representation, the note C is the beginning and then we go up. Actually, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we always take the absolute ascending path? But then from E to C, we cannot go from E down to C, we have to go up from E to the next C.\n\n    So the rule: the distance from note x to note y is the smallest nonnegative number of semitones to go from x to y in the upward direction, possibly wrapping around.\n\n    But wait: the example says from C to E is 4, and from E to C is 8. So from E to C: we have two ways: \n        Option 1: E -> F -> F# -> G -> G# -> A -> B -> H -> C (8 steps)\n        Option 2: E -> D -> C (but that is downward, and the problem says from the lowest to the uppest, so we don't use downward).\n\n    So we only consider upward (clockwise) movement.\n\n    Therefore, we define:\n        distance(x, y) = (y - x) % 12   if we are moving forward, but if y < x, then we do (y + 12 - x) % 12, but actually (y - x) % 12 is the same as (y - x + 12) % 12, because if negative, adding 12 makes it positive.\n\n    Example: \n        C to E: (4 - 0) % 12 = 4 %12 = 4 -> correct.\n        E to C: (0 - 4) % 12 = -4 %12 = 8 (in Python, negative modulo gives a positive result) -> correct.\n\n    So we can use: \n        def dist(x, y):\n            return (y - x) % 12\n\n    However, wait: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n        -4 % 12 = 8, because 12 * (-1) + 8 = -12 + 8 = -4, and the remainder is non-negative and less than 12.\n\n    So yes, we can use: d = (y - x) % 12\n\n 3. Now, given three notes: n1, n2, n3 (as numbers), we want to check if there exists an ordering (a, b, c) such that:\n        (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3   (for major)\n    OR\n        (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4   (for minor)\n\n    But note: the three notes are unordered. We can try all 6 permutations? However, the problem says the chord is an unordered set.\n\n    Alternatively, we can sort the three numbers and then consider the circular arrangement. But note: the distance is defined modulo 12 and the set is cyclic.\n\n    However, we can also note that the entire set of three notes must have two intervals of 3 and 4 (for minor) or 4 and 3 (for major) and the remaining interval is 5 (because 12 - (3+4) = 5, but wait: the entire circle is 12, and the three notes break the circle into three arcs. The sum of the three arcs is 12. The two given intervals (from the root to the third and third to fifth) are 4 and 3 (for major) so the arc from the fifth back to the root is 5. Similarly, for minor: the two intervals are 3 and 4, so the remaining arc is 5.\n\n    But wait, the condition is about consecutive notes in the chord. The chord is defined by three distinct notes. The intervals we are checking are consecutive in the ordering we choose.\n\n    Approach:\n\n    Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers). We can consider the three possible roots:\n\n    Possibility 1: Start with a, then the next note is the one that is 4 semitones away, then the next is 3 semitones away from the second.\n\n    But we don't know the root. We can do:\n\n    Let S = sorted([a, b, c])\n    Then we consider the circle: [a, b, c, a+12] (to handle wrap) and then consider the three consecutive intervals.\n\n    However, an easier method is to generate all six permutations and check the condition.\n\n    Steps for a given set of three numbers [x, y, z]:\n        For each permutation p = [i, j, k] (each being one of the three notes) we check:\n            condition1 = ((j - i) % 12 == 4 and (k - j) % 12 == 3)\n            condition2 = ((j - i) % 12 == 3 and (k - j) % 12 == 4)\n\n        If condition1 holds for any permutation, then it's major.\n        Else if condition2 holds for any permutation, then it's minor.\n\n    But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set, and the teacher gave three distinct notes.\n\n    However, we must be cautious: the condition requires that the three notes are distinct.\n\n    Example: \"C E G\": \n        Notes: [0, 4, 7]\n        Check permutation [0,4,7]: \n            (4-0)%12=4, (7-4)%12=3 -> major -> return major.\n\n    Example: \"C# B F\": \n        Notes: [1, 10, 5] (C#=1, B=10, F=5)\n        We need to find an ordering that satisfies the minor condition.\n\n        Let's try ordering [10,1,5]:\n            (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3 -> matches 3, then (5-1)%12=4 -> matches 4. So minor.\n\n        But wait, the example says \"C# B F\" is minor. However, note: the example says \"if we order the notes as B C# F\", so that's [10,1,5]. \n\n    But wait: 1 is C#, and the distance from B (10) to C# (1) is (1-10)%12= (1-10+12)=3, and from C# (1) to F (5) is (5-1)=4.\n\n    However, note: the example input is given as \"C# B F\", but we mapped to [1,10,5]. The example ordering is [10,1,5]. \n\n    But what if we get the notes in a different order? We must consider all permutations.\n\n    However, generating all permutations (6) is acceptable.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n        Read the input string, split to get three note names.\n\n        Convert each note name to its number.\n\n        Let nums = [n1, n2, n3]\n\n        Generate all permutations of nums (6 possibilities)\n\n        For each permutation (a,b,c):\n            Check if (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3 -> then print \"major\" and break.\n            Check if (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4 -> then print \"minor\" and break.\n\n        If neither condition is met in any permutation, print \"strange\"\n\n    But wait: are there any other conditions? The problem says the chord is exactly three notes.\n\n    However, note: the condition requires three distinct notes. Our mapping and permutation generation assume distinct notes. The problem states that the input is three space-separated notes.\n\n    But what if the input has duplicate notes? The problem says \"a chord is an unordered set\", so duplicates are not allowed. And the example input does not have duplicates.\n\n    According to the problem: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous.\" and the input is three space-separated notes.\n\n    Let's test with the example \"A B H\": \n        Notes: A->9, B->10, H->11\n        Check permutations:\n            [9,10,11]: \n                (10-9)%12=1 -> no.\n                (11-10)%12=1 -> no.\n            [9,11,10]:\n                (11-9)%12=2 -> no.\n                (10-11)%12= (10-11+12)%12=11 -> no.\n            [10,9,11]:\n                (9-10)%12= (9-10+12)%12=11 -> no.\n                (11-9)%12=2 -> no.\n            [10,11,9]:\n                (11-10)%12=1 -> no.\n                (9-11)%12= (9-11+12)%12=10 -> no.\n            [11,9,10]:\n                (9-11)%12= (9-11+12)%12=10 -> no.\n                (10-9)%12=1 -> no.\n            [11,10,9]:\n                (10-11)%12= (10-11+12)%12=11 -> no.\n                (9-10)%12= (9-10+12)%12=11 -> no.\n\n        So it's strange.\n\n    This matches the example output.\n\n    However, we must consider: is there a possibility that the chord is major/minor even with the same set of intervals but in a different arrangement? \n\n    Actually, note: the condition requires consecutive intervals. So the entire set of three notes must be arranged such that the two consecutive intervals (in the chosen ordering) are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n    But note: the entire set of three notes must be equally spaced? Not necessarily. They just have to form two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) in the circle.\n\n    However, in our example [0,4,7] for major: \n        We have intervals: \n            From 0 to 4: 4\n            From 4 to 7: 3\n            From 7 to 0: (0-7+12)%12=5\n\n        The set of intervals is {3,4,5}. \n\n    Similarly, minor [0,3,7]:\n        Intervals: \n            0 to 3: 3\n            3 to 7: 4\n            7 to 0: 5\n\n    So the set of intervals is the same. But the condition is not about the set of intervals but the consecutive ones.\n\n    However, note: the condition requires that the entire chord is built by two consecutive intervals of 4 and 3 (without the wrap-around being used in the middle). \n\n    So we are only concerned with the consecutive ordering that we choose.\n\n    But wait: what if we have a chord that is major but we don't choose the root as the first note? \n\n    Example: major chord [0,4,7] can also be arranged as [4,7,0] or [7,0,4]? \n\n    Let's check [4,7,0]:\n        (7-4)%12=3 -> not 4 or 3 (for the first condition: major requires 4 then 3, so 3 is the second part, but the first part is 3, which is not 4 -> so not major by this ordering)\n        (0-7)%12= (0-7+12)%12=5 -> doesn't match.\n\n    Then [7,0,4]:\n        (0-7)%12=5 -> no.\n\n    But wait, we must remember that the ordering is arbitrary. The definition says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\".\n\n    In [0,4,7] we have that ordering. In [4,7,0] we are effectively starting from the third note and then going to the fifth and then the root (which is the next octave). But the root to the third is 4 semitones (from 4 to 0? no, from 4 to 0 is 8 semitones if we go up? Actually, from 4 (E) to 0 (C) is 8 semitones (as we saw). So the condition for [4,7,0] is:\n        First interval: from 4 to 7: 3 -> not 4.\n        Second interval: from 7 to 0: 5 -> not 3.\n\n    But note: the condition does not require that the entire chord is contained in one octave. However, the definition says \"the distance along the musical scale\", and the musical scale is cyclic. \n\n    However, the example ordering [4,7,0] is not the same as the root position. The root position is the first note. \n\n    But wait, the problem does not specify that the root is the first note. It says \"an ordering\". So we are allowed to choose any starting note.\n\n    However, the condition is defined in terms of consecutive notes in the chosen ordering. \n\n    But note: the example [0,4,7] is the root position major. What if we choose a different root? \n\n    Actually, the condition is: \n        There exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3.\n\n    In the set {0,4,7}, we can only have the ordering [0,4,7] that satisfies the major condition (because the other orderings don't have two consecutive intervals of 4 and then 3). \n\n    Similarly, for minor: the set {0,3,7} must be ordered as [0,3,7] to get 3 and then 4. \n\n    But wait, what if we have the set {0,4,7} and we try to see if it is minor? \n        Condition for minor: 3 and then 4.\n        [0,4,7]: first interval 4, second 3 -> no.\n        [0,7,4]: (7-0)=7, (4-7)= -3 -> 9 (mod12) -> no.\n        [4,0,7]: (0-4)=8, (7-0)=7 -> no.\n        [4,7,0]: (7-4)=3, (0-7)=5 -> no.\n        [7,0,4]: (0-7)=5, (4-0)=4 -> no.\n        [7,4,0]: (4-7)=9, (0-4)=8 -> no.\n\n    So the set {0,4,7} is only major.\n\n    Similarly, {0,3,7} is only minor.\n\n    Therefore, we can rely on the permutation method.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so no chord is both.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n        mapping = {\n            'C': 0,\n            'C#': 1, \n            'D': 2,\n            'D#': 3,\n            'E': 4,\n            'F': 5,\n            'F#': 6,\n            'G': 7,\n            'G#': 8,\n            'A': 9,\n            'B': 10,\n            'H': 11\n        }\n\n        s = input().split()\n        notes = [mapping[note] for note in s]\n\n        from itertools import permutations\n        found_major = False\n        found_minor = False\n\n        for perm in permutations(notes):\n            a, b, c = perm\n            # Condition for major: (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3\n            if (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3:\n                found_major = True\n            # Condition for minor: (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4\n            elif (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4:\n                found_minor = True\n\n        if found_major:\n            print('major')\n        elif found_minor:\n            print('minor')\n        else:\n            print('strange')\n\n    But wait: what if a permutation satisfies both? The problem says it's unambiguous, so we don't expect that. But let's check: \n        Conditions:\n            (b-a)%12==4 and (c-b)%12==3 -> then the set is {a, a+4, a+7}\n            (b-a)%12==3 and (c-b)%12==4 -> then the set is {a, a+3, a+7}\n\n        These two sets are different unless 4==3 and 3==4, which is impossible.\n\n    So we are safe.\n\n    However, note: the modulus operation: (b - a) % 12 is equivalent to (b - a + 12) % 12, so we are covering the circularity.\n\n    Let me test with the example \"C E G\" and \"C# B F\".\n\n    Example \"C E G\": [0,4,7] -> permutation [0,4,7] gives (4-0)%12=4, (7-4)%12=3 -> found_major.\n\n    Example \"C# B F\": [1,10,5] -> we need to find an ordering that gives 3 and then 4.\n\n        We found [10,1,5]: \n            a=10, b=1, c=5.\n            (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3 -> matches the minor condition's first part.\n            (5-1)%12 = 4 -> matches the minor condition's second part.\n\n    So it works.\n\n    But wait: the example input was \"C# B F\", and we mapped C# to 1, B to 10, F to 5. Then the permutation [10,1,5] is the same as [B, C#, F]. \n\n    However, the input order is \"C# B F\", but we are permuting, so we consider all orders.\n\n    One more example: \"D F A\" -> D=2, F=5, A=9.\n\n        Check for major: \n            [2,5,9]: (5-2)%12=3 -> not 4, (9-5)%12=4 -> not 3.\n            [2,9,5]: (9-2)%12=7, (5-9)%12=(5-9+12)%12=8 -> no.\n            [5,2,9]: (2-5)%12=(2-5+12)%12=9, (9-2)%12=7 -> no.\n            [5,9,2]: (9-5)%12=4, (2-9)%12=(2-9+12)%12=5 -> no.\n            [9,2,5]: (2-9)%12=(2-9+12)%12=5, (5-2)%12=3 -> no.\n            [9,5,2]: (5-9)%12= (5-9+12)%12=8, (2-5)%12=9 -> no.\n\n        So \"D F A\" is strange.\n\n    But wait, let's check: \n        D to F: 3 semitones (D->D#->E->F -> wait, no: from D (2) to F (5): 5-2=3 -> so 3 semitones.\n        Then from F to A: 9-5=4 -> 4 semitones.\n        So the set {2,5,9} is actually a minor chord (if we order as D, F, A: then 3 and 4). \n\n        Why didn't we get that?\n\n        We did: [5,9,2] -> (9-5)=4, (2-9)= (2-9+12)=5 -> no.\n        [9,2,5]: (2-9)= (2-9+12)=5, (5-2)=3 -> no.\n\n        But wait: the condition for minor is (b-a)%12==3 and (c-b)%12==4.\n\n        We need an ordering [a,b,c] such that (b-a)%12==3 and (c-b)%12==4.\n\n        In the set {2,5,9}: \n            We can try [2,5,9]: (5-2)=3, (9-5)=4 -> yes! So why did I skip [2,5,9]?\n\n        I did: \n            [2,5,9]: (5-2)%12=3, (9-5)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n        So I must have made a mistake in my manual calculation above.\n\n        Correction: \n            [2,5,9] is the first permutation I checked: \n                (5-2)%12=3 -> matches the first part of minor, and (9-5)%12=4 -> matches the second part.\n\n        Therefore, the code would have found minor.\n\n    So the code is:\n\n        mapping = {\n            'C': 0,\n            'C#': 1, \n            'D': 2,\n            'D#': 3,\n            'E': 4,\n            'F': 5,\n            'F#': 6,\n            'G': 7,\n            'G#': 8,\n            'A': 9,\n            'B': 10,\n            'H': 11\n        }\n\n        s = input().split()\n        notes = [mapping[note] for note in s]\n\n        from itertools import permutations\n        found_major = False\n        found_minor = False\n\n        for a, b, c in permutations(notes):\n            # Condition for major: (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3\n            if (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3:\n                found_major = True\n            # Condition for minor: (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4\n            elif (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4:\n                found_minor = True\n\n        if found_major:\n            print('major')\n        elif found_minor:\n            print('minor')\n        else:\n            print('strange')\n\n    Let me run the example \"D F A\": [2,5,9] -> found_minor becomes True.\n\n    But wait: the example \"D F A\" is indeed a minor chord.\n\n    However, the example \"C E G\" is major, and \"C# B F\" is minor.\n\n    But wait: the example \"C# B F\": \n        [1,10,5] -> we found [10,1,5] is minor.\n\n    But note: [10,1,5] is the same as [B, C#, F] and the input was \"C# B F\", but we are permuting so we consider [10,1,5] as a permutation.\n\n    This code should work.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the input is three space-separated notes. We assume they are distinct and valid.\n\n    Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: Input \"C E G\" -> Output \"major\"\n    Example 2: Input \"C# B F\" -> Output \"minor\"\n    Example 3: Input \"A B H\" -> Output \"strange\"\n\n    It passes.\n\n    But wait: what if the input has sharps and flats? The problem says the notes are from the given set. So we don't have to worry.\n\n    However, note: the example includes 'H' and the note names are as given.\n\n    We have defined the mapping for the 12 notes. The input will be one of these.\n\n    Let me run the code with the examples.\n\n    Example: \"C E G\"\n        notes = [0,4,7]\n        permutations: \n            (0,4,7): (4-0)%12=4, (7-4)%12=3 -> found_major=True -> prints \"major\"\n\n    Example: \"C# B F\"\n        notes = [1,10,5]\n        We need to check all 6 permutations until we find one that matches minor.\n\n        One of them is (10,1,5): \n            (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3 -> matches minor's first condition.\n            (5-1)%12=4 -> matches minor's second condition -> found_minor=True -> prints \"minor\"\n\n    Example: \"A B H\"\n        notes = [9,10,11]\n        As we checked earlier, no permutation matches.\n\n    So it works.\n\n    However, note: the example \"C# B F\" is given as input. Our mapping for B is 10, which is correct.\n\n    One more: \"D F A\" -> [2,5,9] -> found_minor.\n\n    But wait: the problem example says the chord \"C# B F\" is minor. Our code returns minor for that.\n\n    However, there is a potential issue: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest. But note: our condition is independent of the actual pitch class (we are just using modulo 12). \n\n    But the example \"C# B F\": \n        The notes are B (10), C# (1), F (5). When we arrange as [10,1,5], we are effectively arranging from B to C# to F. \n\n        The distance from B to C# is 3 (correct). The distance",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval conditions for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a corresponding number (0 to 11) based on its position in the musical scale (C=0, C#=1, ..., B=10, H=11).\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if the intervals between consecutive notes match the conditions for a major or minor chord.\n3. **Major Chord Condition**: The intervals must be 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones.\n4. **Minor Chord Condition**: The intervals must be 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n5. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the major condition, output \"major\". If any permutation meets the minor condition, output \"minor\". If neither condition is met, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmapping = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1, \n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().split()\n    notes = [mapping[note] for note in s]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n\n    if found_major:\n        print('major')\n    elif found_minor:\n        print('minor')\n    else:\n        print('strange')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique number from 0 to 11, representing their positions in the cyclic musical scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their corresponding numbers using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: The code generates all possible orderings of the three input notes. For each ordering, it checks the intervals between consecutive notes.\n4. **Interval Check**: For each permutation, the code calculates the intervals between the first-second and second-third notes. If these intervals match the major chord condition (4 and 3 semitones) or the minor chord condition (3 and 4 semitones), the respective flag is set to `True`.\n5. **Result Output**: Based on the flags, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if no valid chord type is found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
