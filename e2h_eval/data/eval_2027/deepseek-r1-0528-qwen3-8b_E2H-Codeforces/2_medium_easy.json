Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter must be different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the diagonals might have two different letters? Actually, the problem says:\n   - The diagonals must be the same letter? Or each diagonal is the same but both diagonals can have different letters? \n But reading the problem statement: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This implies that the main diagonal has one letter and the anti-diagonal has the same letter? Not necessarily the same letter for both diagonals?\n Let me check the example: \n   Example 1: \n        Input: 5xooox, oxoxo, soxoo, oxoxo, xooox -> Output: NO\n\n   Why NO? Because in the center we have 's' (in the third row, third character) and the diagonals are supposed to be the same letter?\n   But wait: \n        The diagonals: \n          main diagonal: ['x', 'o', 's', 'o', 'x'] -> not the same! \n          anti-diagonal: ['x', 'o', 's', 'o', 'x'] -> same as main? \n\n   Actually, the example input is:\n\n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n   The main diagonal: \n        row0: index0 -> 'x'\n        row1: index1 -> 'o'\n        row2: index2 -> 's'\n        row3: index3 -> 'o'\n        row4: index4 -> 'x'\n\n   So the main diagonal is not uniform. Similarly, the anti-diagonal:\n        row0: index4 -> 'x'\n        row1: index3 -> 'o'\n        row2: index2 -> 's'\n        row3: index1 -> 'o'\n        row4: index0 -> 'x'\n\n   Therefore, the condition fails because the diagonals must be all the same. In this example, the main diagonal has 'x','o','s','o','x' which is not all same.\n\n   Example 2: \n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   Main diagonal: ['w','s','w'] -> not the same? Wait, but the example output is YES.\n\n   Let me re-read the problem: \n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n   But in the second example, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] which is not the same. However, note that the example is:\n\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n   The main diagonal: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> wait, actually the second row is \"sws\", so [1][1] is 'w'. Then the main diagonal is indeed 'w','w','w'. And the anti-diagonal: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w'. So both diagonals are all 'w'.\n\n   So in the second example, the diagonals are uniform and the same letter (both 'w'). The rest of the squares (non-diagonal) are 's'. \n\n   Condition 2: all other squares (non-diagonals) must be the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n   The non-diagonal squares: \n        (0,1): 's', (1,0): 's', (1,2): 's', (2,1): 's' -> all 's' and different from 'w'. So condition holds.\n\n   But wait, how about the example 3:\n\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n   The diagonals: \n        main diagonal: ['x','p','e'] -> not uniform -> fails condition 1. So it's NO.\n\n   However, the example output for the third example is 'NO'.\n\n   Therefore, we need to do:\n    Step 1: Check that the main diagonal is composed of the same letter, say `d1`.\n    Step 2: Check that the anti-diagonal is composed of the same letter, say `d2`.\n\n    But note: the problem does not require that `d1` and `d2` be the same? It only requires that on the main diagonal all letters are the same, and on the anti-diagonal all letters are the same. \n    However, what if the two diagonals have different letters? \n\n    Example: \n        Consider a 3x3 grid:\n            a b c\n            d e f\n            g h i\n\n        Main diagonal: a, e, i -> must be same, say 'x'\n        Anti-diagonal: c, e, g -> must be same, say 'y'\n\n        Then at the center (e) we have two conditions: it must be 'x' and also 'y'. So if the two diagonals are different, then unless `x == y`, we have a contradiction.\n\n    Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter. Why?\n        Because they intersect at the center. So the center element must be the same for both diagonals.\n\n    So the conditions are:\n        - The main diagonal must be composed of a single letter, say `x`.\n        - The anti-diagonal must be composed of the same letter `x` (because the center is common).\n\n    Then, every cell that is not on either diagonal must be composed of a single letter, say `y`, and `y != x`.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not explicitly say the two diagonals must be the same letter, but by the fact that they share the center, if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the center must be the same for both. Therefore, if the main diagonal is 'a' and the anti-diagonal is 'b', then we require that the center (which is part of both) is both 'a' and 'b', so we must have a==b.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        Let center = n//2 (0-indexed: center_index = (n-1)//2)\n\n        Step 1: Traverse the main diagonal (i from 0 to n-1, j = i) and check that all characters are the same. Also, remember the letter at the center is included here.\n\n        Step 2: Traverse the anti-diagonal (i from 0 to n-1, j = n-1-i) and check that all characters are the same. \n\n        But if the main diagonal has letter `d` and the anti-diagonal has letter `e`, then at the center we must have `grid[center][center] == d` and `grid[center][center] == e`. So if `d != e`, then we break.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check the entire grid for the pattern.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Let n = number of rows.\n\n        For the main diagonal:\n            d1 = grid[i][i] for all i. They should be the same.\n\n        For the anti-diagonal:\n            d2 = grid[i][n-1-i] for all i. They should be the same.\n\n        Now, if d1 != d2, then we return \"NO\".\n\n        Then, for the non-diagonal cells, we need to check two things:\n            a) All non-diagonal cells have the same letter, say `fill_char`.\n            b) `fill_char` is different from `d1` (and hence from `d2`).\n\n        However, note: we don't know which letter is the diagonal one until we know the main and anti-diagonal are the same.\n\n        Alternatively, we can:\n\n            Step 1: Check that the entire main diagonal is one letter, and the entire anti-diagonal is the same letter (which must equal the main diagonal's letter). If not, \"NO\".\n\n            Step 2: Let `center_letter = d1` (which equals d2).\n\n            Step 3: Check that for every cell (i, j) that is not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal, the letter is the same and different from `center_letter`.\n\n        How to check if a cell (i, j) is on the main diagonal? i == j or i+j == n-1 (for 0-indexed, the anti-diagonal condition is i+j == n-1).\n\n        But note: the anti-diagonal condition in 0-indexed: \n            row0: j = n-1, so index (0, n-1) -> i+j = 0 + (n-1) = n-1.\n            row1: j = n-2, so 1 + (n-2) = n-1.\n            row2: j = n-3, so 2 + (n-3) = n-1.\n\n        So yes, the anti-diagonal is all cells (i, j) such that i+j = n-1.\n\n        Therefore, we can mark a cell as being on a diagonal if i == j or i+j == n-1.\n\n        Then, for all cells not marked, we check that they are the same and different from `center_letter`.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the center cell is counted twice (it is on both diagonals). But we don't care about the center cell in the non-diagonal part.\n\n        So:\n\n            Read the grid.\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            grid = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                line = input().strip()\n                grid.append(line)\n\n            # Check the two diagonals\n            diag1_letter = None\n            diag2_letter = None\n\n            valid = True\n            for i in range(n):\n                # Check main diagonal: i, i\n                if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n                    diag1_letter = grid[0][0]\n                    # But wait, we are going to check the entire diagonal. Let's set diag1_letter and then break if inconsistent?\n                    # Instead, we can check the entire diagonal first.\n\n            Actually, better:\n\n            # Get the main diagonal letters and verify they are all the same.\n            center_index = (n-1)//2\n            d1 = grid[0][0]\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][i] != d1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            d2 = grid[0][n-1]   # start with the top-right of anti-diagonal, but we'll check the entire anti-diagonal.\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != d2:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Now, we have two diagonals: main diagonal is d1, anti-diagonal is d2.\n            # But the center must be the same for both, so if d1 != d2, then invalid.\n            if d1 != d2:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Now, we know the diagonal letter is d1 (which equals d2).\n\n            # Now, check the non-diagonal cells: they must be the same letter and different from d1.\n\n            fill_char = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        # Skip diagonal and anti-diagonal\n                        continue\n                    if fill_char is None:\n                        fill_char = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != fill_char:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                if not valid:\n                    break\n\n            if not valid:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Additionally, we must check that fill_char is different from d1.\n            if fill_char == d1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n        However, there's an issue: what if there are no non-diagonal cells? When n=1, but n>=3, so we have at least 3x3. Then the non-diagonal part will have cells.\n\n        But wait: what if the entire grid is the same letter? Then the non-diagonal part would be that same letter, but then the diagonals are also that same letter. Then condition 1 holds (diagonals same) but condition 2 requires the non-diagonals to be the same and different from the diagonal. So if the entire grid is the same, then the non-diagonals are the same but not different -> fails.\n\n        Example: n=3, all letters 'a'. Then:\n            Diagonals: main and anti-diagonal are all 'a'. Then the non-diagonal cells are also 'a'. Condition 2 requires that the non-diagonal cells are the same and different from the diagonal. But they are the same as the diagonal -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, we must check that the non-diagonal letter is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n        But note: the example 3x3 with all 'a' would be:\n\n            aaa\n            aaa\n            aaa\n\n        Then our code:\n\n            Diagonals: \n                main: [0][0]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][2]='a' -> valid, d1='a'\n                anti: [0][2]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][0]='a' -> valid, d2='a' -> then d1==d2.\n\n            Then we check non-diagonal cells: \n                (0,1): 'a' -> set fill_char = 'a'\n                (1,0): 'a' -> matches\n                (1,2): 'a' -> matches\n                (2,1): 'a' -> matches\n\n            Then we check if fill_char == d1 -> yes, so we print \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        Another example: \n            Input: \n                3\n                www\n                www\n                www\n\n            Output: NO.\n\n        But wait, the example input 3 was:\n\n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n            Here, the diagonals are not uniform (main: ['x','p','e'] -> not same) so we break at the main diagonal check and output NO.\n\n        However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \n                5\n                xooox\n                oxoxo\n                soxoo\n                oxoxo\n                xooox\n\n            Main diagonal: \n                row0: 'x' -> set d1 = 'x'\n                row1: grid[1][1] is 'o' -> not 'x' -> invalid, so we break and print \"NO\". This matches.\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \n                3\n                wsw\n                sws\n                wsw\n\n            Main diagonal: \n                row0: 'w'\n                row1: grid[1][1] is 'w' -> ok\n                row2: grid[2][2] is 'w' -> ok -> d1='w'\n\n            Anti-diagonal:\n                row0: grid[0][2] is 'w'\n                row1: grid[1][1] is 'w' -> ok\n                row2: grid[2][0] is 'w' -> ok -> d2='w'\n\n            Then check non-diagonal cells:\n                (0,1): 's' -> set fill_char='s'\n                (1,0): 's' -> ok\n                (1,2): 's' -> ok\n                (2,1): 's' -> ok\n\n            Then check if 's' != 'w' -> yes -> output \"YES\"\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input: \n                3\n                xpx\n                pxp\n                xpe\n\n            Main diagonal: \n                row0: 'x'\n                row1: grid[1][1] is 'p' -> not 'x' -> invalid -> output \"NO\"\n\n        So the code above should work.\n\n        However, note: the anti-diagonal check starts with the top-right element. But what if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform with a different letter? \n        Example: \n            3x3:\n                a b c\n                d e f\n                g h i\n\n            Suppose we have:\n                a a a\n                a a a\n                a a a\n\n            Then both diagonals are 'a', so d1='a', d2='a' -> then non-diagonal is also 'a', so we output NO.\n\n        Another example with different diagonals:\n\n            a b c\n            d e f\n            g h i\n\n            Main diagonal: a, e, i -> must be same, say 'x'\n            Anti-diagonal: c, e, g -> must be same, say 'y'\n\n            Then if x != y, we output NO.\n\n        But note: the center is e, which must be both x and y. So if x != y, then the center cannot be both. Therefore, we must have x==y.\n\n        Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n        However, we can optimize by not having two separate loops for the diagonals and then checking the entire grid for non-diagonals.\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n            Step 1: Check the two diagonals: \n                d1 = set(grid[i][i] for i in range(n))\n                d2 = set(grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n))\n\n            Then, if len(d1) != 1 or len(d2) != 1, then NO.\n\n            Then, if the common letter (the one in the center) is not the same for both, then NO. But note: the center is the same element in both sets, so if d1 and d2 are sets, then they must both be {letter}. And if the diagonals are uniform, then d1 and d2 must be the same set? \n\n            Actually, the center is in both, so the set d1 must equal d2. Because if the main diagonal is uniform with letter x, and the anti-diagonal is uniform with letter y, then the center must be x and y, so x=y. Therefore, if d1 != d2, then we break.\n\n            But note: we already checked that each diagonal is uniform, so d1 is a set of one element and d2 is a set of one element, and if these two sets are different then we output NO.\n\n            Then, we can do:\n\n                diag_letters = set()\n                for i in range(n):\n                    # Check main diagonal\n                    if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    diag_letters.add(grid[i][i])\n                else:\n                    # Check anti-diagonal\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        if grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][n-1]:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    else:\n                        # Now check that the two diagonals have the same letter (we know each is uniform)\n                        if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]:\n                            valid = False\n                        else:\n                            # Now check non-diagonal cells\n                            # We know the diagonal letter is grid[0][0]\n                            diag_letter = grid[0][0]\n                            fill_char = None\n                            for i in range(n):\n                                for j in range(n):\n                                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                                        continue\n                                    if fill_char is None:\n                                        fill_char = grid[i][j]\n                                    else:\n                                        if grid[i][j] != fill_char:\n                                            valid = False\n                                            break\n                                if not valid:\n                                    break\n                            if valid:\n                                if fill_char == diag_letter:\n                                    valid = False\n\n            But this is similar to the previous.\n\n        However, note: the anti-diagonal we started with grid[0][n-1]. But if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the center must be the same. So we can just compare the two starting points? Actually, no: the entire diagonal must be the same, so even if the top of the anti-diagonal is the same as the center, we need to check the entire anti-diagonal.\n\n        But wait: the main diagonal is uniform, so the center is the same as the top (grid[0][0]). The anti-diagonal must be uniform, so the center must be the same as the top of the anti-diagonal (grid[0][n-1]) and also the center is the same as the bottom of the anti-diagonal (grid[n-1][0]). However, we don't know if grid[0][n-1] is the same as grid[0][0] until we check the entire anti-diagonal? Actually, no: we are checking the entire anti-diagonal for uniformity.\n\n        But the above code breaks the diagonal checks into two separate loops. We can do:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n            # Check main diagonal\n            d1 = grid[0][0]\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][i] != d1:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            # Check anti-diagonal\n            d2 = grid[0][n-1]\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != d2:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            # Now, if the two diagonals are uniform, then the center must be the same for both, so d1 must equal d2.\n            if d1 != d2:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Now, the diagonal letter is d1 (or d2, same)\n\n            # Check non-diagonal cells\n            diag_letter = d1\n            # We'll collect the non-diagonal cells and check they are the same and different from diag_letter.\n\n            # But note: there might be multiple letters in non-diagonal? We want to check they are all the same.\n\n            # We can traverse and skip the diagonals, and if we find any cell not diag_letter, then if we haven't set fill_char, set it; otherwise, if it doesn't match, break.\n\n            fill_char = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if fill_char is None:\n                        fill_char = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != fill_char:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n\n            # Now, if we didn't break, then we have a candidate for fill_char.\n\n            if fill_char == diag_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n        However, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Actually, when n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells. But if n==1, then no non-diagonal? But n>=3.\n\n        But what if the grid has only one non-diagonal letter? Then we set fill_char and then compare.\n\n        But wait, what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are empty? Actually, in 3x3, the diagonals are 3 cells (each) and they share the center, so total diagonal cells = 3+3-1 = 5. Then non-diagonal cells = 9-5 = 4. So there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n        However, consider a grid where the non-diagonal part is empty? Only when n=1, but n>=3.\n\n        One more corner: what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are not all the same?\n\n        Example: \n            w s w\n            s w s\n            w s w\n\n        The non-diagonal cells are the four corners? Actually, in 3x3:\n\n            (0,0): diagonal\n            (0,1): non-diagonal\n            (0,2): diagonal\n\n            (1,0): non-diagonal\n            (1,1): diagonal\n            (1,2): non-diagonal\n\n            (2,0): diagonal\n            (2,1): non-diagonal\n            (2,2): diagonal\n\n        So the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). In the example, they are all 's'. \n\n        But what if we have:\n\n            w s w\n            s w s\n            w s w   -> already done.\n\n        What if:\n\n            a b c\n            d e f\n            g h i\n\n        and we set: \n            main diagonal: a,e,i -> uniform, say 'x'\n            anti-diagonal: c,e,g -> uniform, say 'x'\n\n            Then the non-diagonal cells: b, d, f, h.\n\n            If we set:\n                b = 'y', d='y', f='y', h='y' -> then YES.\n\n            If we set:\n                b='y', d='y', f='y', h='z' -> then we break in the inner loop when we see h is not 'y'.\n\n        So the code is robust.\n\n        However, we must consider performance: n<300, so maximum grid size is 299x299, which is about 89001 cells. Two passes for the diagonals (each diagonal is n, so 2*n) and then a full grid pass (n*n). Since n is up to 299, 299*299 is about 89000, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        Note: We must use exit(0) or return? Since we are in a script, we can use exit(0) or simply break and then use a flag.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a function.\n\n        I'll structure it without a function for simplicity.\n\n        Code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            grid = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                grid.append(input().strip())\n\n            # Check main diagonal\n            d1 = grid[0][0]\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][i] != d1:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            # Check anti-diagonal\n            d2 = grid[0][n-1]\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][n-1-i] != d2:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            if d1 != d2:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Now, check non-diagonal cells\n            diag_letter = d1\n            fill_char = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                for j in range(n):\n                    if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                        continue\n                    if fill_char is None:\n                        fill_char = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != fill_char:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n\n            if fill_char == diag_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n        Let me test with the examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            n=5, grid as given -> main diagonal fails at row1 (index1) because grid[1][1] is 'o' and d1='x' -> so print \"NO\"\n\n        Example 2: \n            n=3, grid: \n                ['wsw','sws','wsw']\n            d1 = 'w'\n            Check main diagonal: \n                i=0: 'w' -> ok\n                i=1: grid[1][1] is 'w' -> ok\n                i=2: grid[2][2] is 'w' -> ok\n\n            d2 = grid[0][2] = 'w'\n            Check anti-diagonal:\n                i=0: grid[0][2]=='w' -> ok\n                i=1: grid[1][1]=='w' -> ok\n                i=2: grid[2][0]=='w' -> ok\n\n            d1==d2 -> True.\n\n            Then non-diagonal: \n                (0,1): 's' -> set fill_char='s'\n                (1,0): 's' -> ok\n                (1,2): 's' -> ok\n                (2,1): 's' -> ok\n\n            Then check if 's'=='w'?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters in the grid must be the same as each other but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Main Diagonal**: Verify that all characters along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are identical.\n2. **Check Anti-Diagonal**: Ensure all characters along the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are identical.\n3. **Check Center Consistency**: The center character of the grid must be the same for both diagonals since they intersect at the center.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: All cells not on either diagonal must contain the same character, which must differ from the diagonal character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nd1 = grid[0][0]\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\nd2 = grid[0][n-1]\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][n-1-i] != d2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\nif d1 != d2:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\ndiag_letter = d1\nfill_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if fill_char is None:\n            fill_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != fill_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\nif fill_char == diag_letter:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid size `n` is read first, followed by the grid itself, where each row is a string of `n` characters.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: The code checks if all characters along the main diagonal (positions `(i, i)` for each `i`) are the same. If any character differs, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, the code verifies that all characters along the anti-diagonal (positions `(i, n-1-i)` for each `i`) are identical. A discrepancy here also results in \"NO\".\n4. **Center Consistency**: The center character must match both diagonals' characters. If they differ, the output is \"NO\".\n5. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code ensures all non-diagonal cells contain the same character, which must differ from the diagonal character. If any non-diagonal cell violates this, it outputs \"NO\".
