Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers.\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer between -x and x (inclusive) to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n Then we need to find a set of k cards (each card's absolute value <= x) such that the sum of these k cards is -S.\n\n We want the minimum k (nonnegative integer) for which there exists k numbers (each in [-x, x]) that add up to -S.\n\n Note: The problem allows infinitely many cards of each integer from -x to x.\n\n Observation:\n 1. If S == 0, then we don't need any additional cards -> answer 0.\n 2. Otherwise, we are allowed to choose k cards. The maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k*x (if all are x).\n    Similarly, the minimum negative sum is -k*x.\n\n But note: we need to achieve exactly -S.\n\n Therefore, we must have:\n   -k*x <= -S <= k*x\n\n However, note that we can also use negative and positive numbers arbitrarily. Actually, the condition is that the absolute value of the required sum (-S) must be <= k*x.\n\n But wait: what if we don't require the same sign? Actually, we can mix. The necessary condition is |total| = |S| <= k*x.\n\n However, is that sufficient? Not quite. Consider: \n   We need to form the sum T = -S with k cards, each card in [-x, x]. \n\n   The maximum absolute value we can cover is k*x, but we also have the constraint that the individual card values are bounded by x.\n\n   However, note: we can use both positive and negative. The key is that we can adjust the sum by any integer amount as long as the total absolute value is at most k*x and the parity? Actually, no parity because we can use any integers.\n\n   But wait: the problem does not restrict to nonnegative steps. However, there's a catch: we must represent T = -S.\n\n   Actually, the condition is that T must lie in the interval [-k*x, k*x] and also note that we are allowed to use any integers in between. Since the set of integers from -x to x includes all integers in that range, we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k*x? \n\n   Not exactly. For example, if k=1, then we can only form T if |T| <= x. But if k=2, then we can form any T from -2*x to 2*x? Actually, no: for example, if x=1 and k=2, then the possible sums are from -2 to 2, but we can form every integer in between? \n      Cards: [-1,0,1] -> \n        two cards: \n          min: -1-1 = -2, max: 1+1=2.\n          Can we get -2? yes, two -1.\n          -1: one -1 and one 0, or two -0.5? Wait, but note: the card numbers are integers. So we cannot use 0.5. But wait, the problem says integers from -x to x. So the set is discrete.\n\n   Actually, the set of achievable sums with k cards (each in [-x,x]) is the set of integers T such that:\n        T_min = -k*x, T_max = k*x, and T must be congruent modulo 1? Actually, since we are using integers, T must be an integer. And the step is 1 (because we can change by 1). So actually, we can form every integer between -k*x and k*x.\n\n   However, let me check: \n        k=1: [-x, x] -> every integer from -x to x.\n        k=2: from -2*x to 2*x. But note: we can use two numbers, say a and b, each from [-x, x]. The sum can be any integer between -2*x and 2*x. Why? Because the smallest step is 1 (since we can change one card by 1). \n\n   Actually, it is known that with k cards, the set of achievable sums is the set of integers in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n   Therefore, the condition is: we need to find the minimum k (nonnegative integer) such that |S| <= k*x.\n\n   But wait: consider the sample input: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        Here, n=3, x=2, and the cards are [-1,1,2]. The current sum S = -1+1+2 = 2.\n        Then we need to form T = -2.\n\n        Condition: |T| = 2 <= k*x = 2*k.\n\n        Then k>= ceil(|T|/x) = ceil(2/2)=1.\n\n        So k=1 is enough. And indeed, we can use one card: -2.\n\n        Another sample: \n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> S=-4.\n            We need to form T=4.\n\n            Condition: 4 <= k*3 -> k >= ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2.\n\n            So k=2.\n\n        But wait, what if we use two cards: each card can be at most 3. So maximum positive is 3+3=6. We need 4, so we can do 3+1? But wait, 1 is allowed because x=3. However, note the problem says the card numbers are integers from -x to x, so 1 is allowed.\n\n        However, note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. So 1 is allowed. Then why is the answer 2? \n\n        Actually, the above condition (|T|<=k*x) is necessary and sufficient. So k=2 should work. But the example output is 2.\n\n        However, wait: the example input is \"2 3\\n-2 -2\", so we have two cards and the current sum is -4. We need to add two cards so that the total sum is 0. The two added cards must sum to 4.\n\n        We can use two cards: [2,2] -> 2+2=4. Or [3,1] -> 3+1=4. Both are valid.\n\n        But wait, the example says the answer is 2.\n\n        However, let me see: why did the example say \"He can't find a single card with the required number\"? Because for k=1, we would need a card with value 4, but the maximum absolute value is 3, so 4 is not allowed. So k=1 fails because 4 > 3 (the maximum absolute value of a card is 3). \n\n        But wait, the condition I stated was |T|<=k*x. For k=1, we require |4|<=1*3 -> 4<=3 -> false. So k=1 is invalid.\n\n        So the condition is: we require k to be at least ceil(|T| / x) but note: actually, we can break the total into k cards. The maximum absolute value per card is x, so the maximum absolute value we can get is k*x. Therefore, k must satisfy k*x >= |T|.\n\n        Then k_min = ceil(|T| / x) ?\n\n        Let T = |S| (the absolute value we need to cancel).\n\n        Then k_min = ceil(T / x)\n\n        But note: T might not be divisible by x. \n\n        Example: T=5, x=2 -> ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n        However, with k=3, the maximum absolute value we can achieve is 3*2=6, which is >=5 -> valid.\n\n        But is k_min always ceil(|T| / x)? \n\n        However, note: we are allowed to use negative and positive. The condition is that the total absolute value of the k cards must be at least |T|, but note: we can use negative cards to offset positive ones. Actually, the condition is that the sum of the absolute values of the k cards must be at least |T|? \n\n        Actually, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the absolute value of the total we need to achieve (which is |T|) is at most k*x (because even if we use all positive or all negative, the maximum absolute value we can get is k*x). \n\n        But wait, we can also use a mix. However, note that the maximum absolute value of the entire set of k cards is k*x, but the sign of the total can be chosen arbitrarily (by flipping the signs appropriately). Actually, the condition is symmetric.\n\n        However, let me think: if we are trying to achieve a total of T (which could be negative or positive), then the necessary condition is that the maximum absolute value we can achieve is k*x. But note: the total T must be in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. \n\n        So the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n        But note: k is an integer. Then k_min = ceil(|T| / x) if |T| is not zero.\n\n        However, what if |T| is zero? Then k_min=0.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum S is zero? Then we don't need any cards.\n\n        However, there's another twist: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. But note: we are allowed to use zeros as well. However, zeros don't help in achieving a nonzero T.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Let T = abs(S)   [where S is the current sum]\n\n          If T == 0:\n             print(0)\n          Else:\n             k = ceil(T / x)\n\n        However, wait: what if T is not an integer? Actually, T is an integer because S is the sum of integers.\n\n        But wait: the sample input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\": S=2, T=2, x=2 -> ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n\n        Another: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\": S=-4, T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, let me test with T=3, x=2: ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Then 2*2=4 >=3 -> valid.\n\n        However, is k=2 the minimal? Yes, because with k=1: 1*2=2 <3 -> insufficient.\n\n        But wait, is there a possibility that we can use fewer than ceil(|T|/x) cards? \n\n        Example: T=3, x=2: we need to achieve 3. With two cards: we can use [2,1] (but 1 is allowed because 1<=2). So two cards are needed. One card: maximum is 2, which is less than 3 -> so indeed two.\n\n        However, consider T=4, x=3: ceil(4/3)=2. Then 2*3=6>=4 -> valid. But can we do with two cards? Yes, because we can use two cards: [3,1] or [2,2] or [3,1] etc.\n\n        But wait, what about T=5, x=3: ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. Then 2*3=6>=5 -> valid. But can we form 5 with two cards? \n            We can use two cards: maximum is 3+3=6, so 5 is in the range. How? 3+2=5. But note: 2 is allowed because 2<=3. So yes.\n\n        However, consider T=6, x=3: ceil(6/3)=ceil(2)=2. Then 2*3=6>=6 -> valid. We use two cards: [3,3].\n\n        Now, what if T=7, x=3: ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. Then 3*3=9>=7 -> valid. But can we form 7 with three cards? \n            We can use: 3+3+1=7. So yes.\n\n        However, wait: is it always true that if k*x >= T, then we can form T?\n\n        Actually, yes: because we can use as many positive cards as needed (up to k) and the rest zeros. But wait: we can also use negative? Actually, we are trying to achieve a positive T. We can use positive and negative arbitrarily, but note: we can also use zeros.\n\n        However, the condition is that the total must be T (positive). We can use up to k cards. We can use a combination of positive and negative, but note: we are allowed to use any integers in [-x, x]. \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the additional cards to be positive. But if we are trying to achieve a positive T, then we can use positive cards and negative cards to adjust? \n\n        Let me clarify: we are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. So to form T (positive) we can use positive cards and negative cards, but the total must be T.\n\n        However, we can also use zeros. But zeros don't change the sum.\n\n        The key is: we need to form T (which is positive) with k cards. We can use at most k*x (if we use all positive) and as low as -k*x. But we require T. \n\n        We can think greedily: we want to use as few cards as possible. But the condition we have is necessary and sufficient: we can form T if and only if T <= k*x and T >= -k*x. But since T is positive, we only require T <= k*x.\n\n        However, note: we can also use negative cards to reduce the total? Actually, if we use negative cards, then we are subtracting. But we are trying to achieve a positive T. \n\n        Actually, we can use negative cards to our advantage? No, because negative cards will decrease the total. So to get a positive total, we want to minimize the use of negative cards.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reframe: we need to form T (positive) with k cards. The maximum we can get is k*x (all positive). The minimum we can get is -k*x. But we are only concerned with the positive T.\n\n        However, note: we can also use negative cards to adjust the total if we overshoot? Actually, no: because we are free to choose any integers from -x to x. \n\n        Actually, the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers in the interval [-k*x, k*x]. This is because:\n          - The smallest sum is -k*x (each card -x).\n          - The largest sum is k*x (each card x).\n          - And we can get every integer in between because we can adjust one card by 1 and then the next by 1, etc.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: k*x >= T (for positive T) and similarly for negative T, we require k*x >= |T|.\n\n        So the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\n        However, wait: what if T is negative? Then we need to achieve -T (which is positive) so the condition is the same: k*x >= |T|.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is: \n            k = ceil(|T| / x)   if T != 0, and 0 if T==0.\n\n        But wait: what if T is 0? Then we don't need any cards.\n\n        However, note: the problem statement says: \"Vanya wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero\". He already has n cards. We are allowed to add as many as we want.\n\n        But what if the current sum is zero? Then we don't need to add any.\n\n        Therefore, code:\n\n            Read n, x\n            Read list of n integers\n\n            S = sum(list)\n            T = abs(S)\n\n            if T == 0:\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                # Compute k = ceil(T / x)\n                # Since T and x are positive integers, we can do:\n                k = (T + x - 1) // x   # This is ceiling division for positive integers: ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b when a,b positive?\n                # But note: if T % x == 0, then (T+x-1)//x = (T//x) + (x-1)//x? Actually, let me check:\n\n                # Example: T=2, x=2: (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n                # Example: T=3, x=2: (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n                # Alternatively, we can use: \n                #   k = (T - 1) // x + 1   # because if T is divisible by x, then (T-1)//x gives (T/x - 1) and then +1 -> T/x.\n\n                # But note: \n                #   (T-1)//x + 1: \n                #       T=2, x=2: (1)//2 + 1 = 0+1 = 1 -> correct.\n                #       T=3, x=2: (2)//2 + 1 = 1+1 = 2 -> correct.\n\n                # However, the first method: (T+x-1)//x is standard for ceiling division.\n\n                # But wait: what if T=0? Then we don't use this branch.\n\n                print(k)\n\n        However, wait: is that always the case? \n\n        Let me test with the examples:\n\n          Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> T=2, x=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 (in integer floor division) -> 1, correct.\n\n          Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> T=4, x=3 -> k=(4+3-1)//3 = 6//3 = 2, correct.\n\n        But wait, there is a catch: the problem says the current set of cards is given, and we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x for the additional cards. However, note that the problem does not require the additional cards to be distinct. We can use duplicates.\n\n        However, the above reasoning holds.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n        However, consider: what if the current sum is non-zero and we can achieve the target by adding one card, but that one card is not present in the original set? That's okay because we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is simply the ceiling of |S| / x.\n\n        But wait, there is a sample in the problem that matches.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\". We are assuming that we can form any integer T (with |T|<=k*x) with k cards. \n\n        But note: the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers from -k*x to k*x. So the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          total_sum = sum(cards)\n          abs_total = abs(total_sum)\n\n          if abs_total == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # Ceiling division: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b\n              k = (abs_total + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is negative? Then abs_total is positive, so we take absolute value.\n\n        But wait: let me test with a negative current sum.\n\n          Example: n=1, x=10, cards=[-5] -> total_sum=-5, abs_total=5 -> k=(5+10-1)//10 = 14//10=1 -> correct: we can use one card with 5.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the absolute value of the card doesn't exceed x. 5<=10 -> valid.\n\n        However, note: what if the current sum is very large? \n\n        Example: n=1000, x=1, and the cards are all 1. Then total_sum=1000, abs_total=1000, k=(1000+1-1)//1 = 1000//1=1000. \n\n        But wait: we need to form -1000. The minimal k is 1000 because each card can only be 1 (or -1) and to get -1000 we need 1000 cards of -1.\n\n        So that's correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n        But wait: there's an alternative: sometimes we can use negative and positive to cancel without having to use a lot of cards? \n\n        Actually, note: we are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. The above reasoning holds.\n\n        However, wait: consider the following: \n\n          What if the current sum is S, and we are allowed to use negative and positive arbitrarily. But note: the minimal k is determined by the absolute value of S and the bound x.\n\n        But wait, there's a catch: what if the current sum is very small, but we can use a mix of positive and negative to cancel more efficiently? \n\n        Actually, no: the condition is that the total we need to cancel is |S|. The additional cards must sum to -S. The minimal number of cards required is determined by the fact that each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards the cancellation.\n\n        However, wait: consider if we have a current sum of 1, and x=1. Then we need one card: -1. Correct.\n\n        Consider current sum=2, x=1. Then we need two cards: -1 and -1. Correct.\n\n        Consider current sum=3, x=1: three cards.\n\n        But wait, what if current sum=0? Then we need 0.\n\n        Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is 1 and x=2? Then k = ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1. Correct: we can use a card of -1.\n\n        What if current sum=2 and x=2? ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\n        What if current sum=3 and x=2? ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the absolute value of the card doesn't exceed x. So for x=2, we can have cards from -2 to 2.\n\n        How do we form 3 with two cards? \n            We need two cards that sum to -3. The two cards must be in [-2,2]. The minimal sum we can get with two cards is -4, but we can also form -3: \n                Option1: -2 and -1 -> -3.\n\n        So the condition holds.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          if s == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # We need to cancel s, so we need to form -s, and the absolute value is |s|\n              # The minimal k is ceil(|s| / x)\n              # Ceiling division for positive integers: (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n              k = (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is negative? Then |s| is positive and the calculation is the same.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is 0? Then we don't need to do anything.\n\n        However, note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. So zeros are allowed. But if the current sum is 0, we don't need to add any.\n\n        This solution passes the provided examples.\n\n        But wait, let me look again at the problem statement: \n          \"The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.\"\n\n        And we are forming the total with the found cards and the additional cards.\n\n        However, there is one more thing: the problem does not require that the additional cards must be distinct from the found ones. So we can use any integer from -x to x arbitrarily.\n\n        Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n        But wait: the sample input format: the first line contains two integers: n and x. The second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\n        Example: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, and the list is [-1,1,2]. The sum is 2, then we output 1.\n\n        Another: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, list=[-2,-2], sum=-4, then we output 2.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is positive and we need to cancel with negative cards? Then the minimal k is the same.\n\n        But wait, what if we have multiple ways to cancel? For example, if the current sum is 4 and x=3, then we need k=ceil(4/3)=2. But can we use two cards? Yes, because 3+1=4 (but wait, we are canceling: we need to form -4. So the two cards must sum to -4. The maximum negative is -6 (two cards of -3). So -4 is in the range. How? -3 and -1: -3-1=-4. So yes.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\". Is there a scenario where we can cancel with fewer than ceil(|S|/x) cards? \n\n        Consider: we have S (current sum) and we want to cancel it to 0. We need to add a set of cards that sum to -S. The minimal number of cards required is the smallest k such that there exists k integers (each in [-x, x]) that sum to -S.\n\n        The necessary condition is that the absolute value of the sum of the k cards is at most k*x (and the sum must be -S). \n\n        The minimal k is ceil(|S| / x). \n\n        Why? Because if we use k cards, the maximum absolute value we can assign to the entire set is k*x. So we require k*x >= |S|. The minimal k is the smallest integer satisfying that.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          if s == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              k = (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        But wait: there's an issue with integer division. \n\n        Let me test with s=5, x=3: \n          abs(s)=5, then (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 (since 7//3 is 2 in integer floor division). But ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the formula for ceiling division for positive integers is: ceil(a/b) = (a-1)//b + 1, or (a+b-1)//b.\n\n        Both work. But (a+b-1)//b is more common.\n\n        Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n        But wait, what if the current sum is 0, but we are forced to use at least one card? No, the problem says we can assume he had infinitely many cards, but we can choose to use 0.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n          Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            Output: 1\n\n          Example 2:\n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            Output: 2\n\n        The code produces the expected outputs.\n\n        However, wait: there is a known issue: what if the current sum is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n        But what if the current sum is 0, but we are allowed to add more cards? The problem asks for the minimum number of cards to add.\n\n        So 0 is the minimum.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          if s == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              k = (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. But the additional cards can be any integer from -x to x.\n\n        We are good.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x.\".\n\n        Therefore, we can use any integer in [-x, x] arbitrarily.\n\n        Final code.\n\n        However, wait: there is an alternative approach: sometimes we can use negative and positive to cancel in a way that uses fewer cards? \n\n        Actually, no. The condition is based on the absolute value. The minimal k is determined by the absolute value of the total sum.\n\n        But wait, consider: what if the current sum is 3 and x=2? Then k=ceil(3/2)=2. But can we use two cards to get -3? \n            Two cards: each from [-2,2]. The minimal sum is -4, and we can get -3: by -2 and -1. So yes.\n\n        What if the current sum is 4 and x=3? Then k=ceil(4/3)=2. We need to form -4. The minimal two-card sum is -6, so -4 is achievable.\n\n        But wait, what if the current sum is 5 and x=3? Then k=ceil(5/3)=2. The two-card minimal sum is -6, but the maximal negative sum is -6, and we can form any integer from -6 to 6. So -5 is in the range. But wait, we need to form -5, which is within [-6,6]. \n\n        However, the problem is: we need to form -5 (if the current sum is 5). But note: we are allowed to use any integers from -3 to 3. \n\n        How do we form -5 with two cards? \n            We can use: -3 and -2 -> -5.\n\n        So yes.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is 7 and x=3? Then k=ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. Then we need three cards. The minimal three-card sum is -9, so -7 is achievable. How? \n            -3, -3, and 1? -> -3-3+1 = -5, not -7.\n            Actually, we need -7: \n                -3, -3, -1 -> -3-3-1 = -7.\n\n        So yes.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is 8 and x=3? Then k=ceil(8/3)=ceil(2.66)=3. Then 3*3=9>=8, so we can form -8? \n            -3, -3, -2 -> -8.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n\n        However, wait: there is a special case: what if the current sum is negative? \n\n          Example: current sum = -5, x=3 -> we need to form 5. Then k = ceil(5/3)=2. Then we can form 5? \n            Two cards: maximum positive is 3+3=6, so 5 is in the range. We can use 3 and 2 -> 5.\n\n        So the absolute value is the same.\n\n        Therefore, we take the absolute value.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          if s == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              k = (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is very large? \n\n        Example: n=1000, x=1, and all cards are 1 -> s=1000, then k=1000.\n\n        Example: n=1000, x=1, and the cards are all -1 -> s=-1000, then k=1000.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is 0? Then we output 0.\n\n        But wait, what if the current sum is 0, but the problem requires at least one card? No, the problem says \"minimum number of cards\".\n\n        Therefore, 0 is correct.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"he only found n of them\", and then we are allowed to find more. The problem asks for the minimum number of cards he needs to find to make the sum zero.\n\n        If the sum is already zero, then 0.\n\n        So we are done.\n\n        However, wait: the problem statement says: \"Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?\"\n\n        So if the sum is already zero, then 0.\n\n        But wait, what if the problem intended that we must use at least one card? The problem says \"minimum number of cards\", so 0 is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But wait, let me check the example: \n            Input: \"0 1\\n\"   -> but the input format: first line two integers n and x, then n integers.\n\n            If n=0, then the second line is empty. But the problem says the first line contains two integers: n (1<=n<=1000) and x (1<=x<=1000). So n>=1.\n\n        So we don't have to worry about n=0.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          if s == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              k = (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            s = -1+1+2 = 2 -> k = (2+2-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1 -> output 1.\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            s = -2-2 = -4 -> k = (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2 -> output 2.\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as a string in the example: \n            ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n        However, the code reads from stdin.\n\n        We are ready.\n\n        However, wait: there is an alternative solution that uses math.ceil, but since we are dealing with integers, we can do:\n\n          import math\n          k = math.ceil(abs(s) / x)\n\n        But the problem says n and x are integers, and s is an integer. However, the division might be float. But note: the numbers are integers and x is integer, so abs(s)/x is a rational number.\n\n        But the problem constraints say x from 1 to 1000, and s can be up to 1000*1000 (because n<=1000 and each card up to 1000 in absolute value) so s can be up to 1000000.\n\n        Using math.ceil might be acceptable, but the problem says easy, and we don't need to use floating point.\n\n        But note: the ceiling division formula (abs(s)+x-1)//x works for positive integers.\n\n        However, what if abs(s) is 0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (if x>=1). But we already handled s==0.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But wait: what if s is negative? Then abs(s) is positive.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his found cards equals zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the additional cards must exactly cancel out the current sum of the found cards. The minimal number of cards required to achieve this is determined by the absolute value of the current sum divided by the maximum absolute value of a card (x). Specifically, if the current sum is S, then the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of |S| / x. This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards canceling the sum.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards. If this sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the ceiling of the absolute value of the sum divided by x to determine the minimal number of cards required.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves reading the input values and computing the sum of the list, which takes O(n) time, where n is the number of found cards. The subsequent calculations are constant time operations, making the overall complexity linear in the size of the input.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(arr)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line contains the list of integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the numbers on the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the output is 0 since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Ceiling Division**: If the sum is non-zero, the minimal number of additional cards required is calculated using ceiling division. The formula `(abs(s) + x - 1) // x` effectively computes the ceiling of the division without using floating-point arithmetic, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.\n4. **Output Result**: The result, which is the minimal number of cards needed, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance with minimal computational overhead.",
