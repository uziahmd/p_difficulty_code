    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. So we can have a subsegment that is almost strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We cannot try every subsegment (n^2) because n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Idea: \n We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n 1. Precompute arrays for strictly increasing sequences without any changes and with one change.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to change one number anywhere in the subsegment.\n\n Let's define:\n   left[i]: The length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (with no changes so far) \n   right[i]: The length of the strictly increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (with no changes so far)\n\n Then, if we are allowed to change one element, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Without changing any element, the entire segment might already be strictly increasing.\n\n   Option 2: With one change, we can fix a problem. The problem occurs when there is an inversion (a[i] >= a[i+1]).\n        We can think: if we have an inversion at position i (i.e., a[i] >= a[i+1]), then by changing a[i+1] (or a[i]) we can fix this inversion.\n\n But note: we are allowed to change only one number in the entire subsegment.\n\n We can consider merging two increasing segments with one change.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute two arrays:\n      left[i] = length of increasing sequence ending at i (without any changes)\n        left[0] = 1\n        for i from 1 to n-1:\n            if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            else:\n                left[i] = 1\n\n      right[i] = length of increasing sequence starting at i (without any changes)\n        right[n-1] = 1\n        for i from n-2 down to 0:\n            if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n                right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            else:\n                right[i] = 1\n\n   Step 2: Now, we can consider:\n\n      Case 1: Entire segment is already strictly increasing -> then answer is n.\n\n      Case 2: With one change, we can merge two increasing segments that are separated by an inversion.\n\n        Consider an inversion at index i (meaning a[i] >= a[i+1]). Then we can consider:\n\n          Option A: Change a[i+1] to be greater than a[i]. Then the combined segment from [start of left segment] to [end of right segment] would be increasing?\n          But note: we might have more than one inversion? However, we are only allowed one change.\n\n        Actually, we can consider a candidate segment that includes:\n\n          - The segment from i-left[i]+1 to i (which is increasing of length left[i])\n          - Then we skip the element at i+1 (if we change it) and then the next increasing segment starting at i+2 (if exists) of length right[i+2]\n\n        But wait, we might not skip i+1, we can also consider changing an element in the middle that is part of two consecutive decreasing steps.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          For each index i (from 1 to n-1), if we have a[i] >= a[i+1], then we can consider:\n\n            candidate = left[i] + right[i+1]   [But note: after fixing the inversion, we must have a[i] < changed_value < a[i+2] (if exists) but actually we don't care about the exact value, we set it arbitrarily to satisfy the condition.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to change only one element. The inversion we fix is at the boundary between i and i+1. But what if we change an element that is not at the boundary? \n\n        Another idea: We can also consider changing an element that is not at the inversion. However, the inversion is the problem. But sometimes we might have a longer segment if we change an element that breaks two inversions? Actually no, because we are only allowed one change.\n\n        Actually, the change can be anywhere. But the typical issue is when we have two consecutive elements that break the increasing condition.\n\n        We can consider two cases:\n\n          Case A: The subsegment has one element that is causing the failure. Then we can fix that one and merge the two sides.\n\n        How about:\n\n          Let L = left[i] (the increasing sequence ending at i)\n          Let R = right[i+1] (the increasing sequence starting at i+1)\n\n          Then if we fix the element at i+1 (by setting it to something between a[i] and the next value, or even beyond) then we can merge the two increasing segments.\n\n          But wait, we must check the entire segment from (i - L + 1) to (i+1 + R - 1) is increasing? Actually, we are only fixing one element, so we require:\n\n            Condition: The element we fix must be such that:\n              a[i] < fixed_value < a[i+2]   (if i+2 exists) OR if we fix the last element then we don't need the next condition.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to set to any integer. So we can set the element at i+1 to be anything. The only constraints are:\n\n            If we fix the element at i+1, then we require:\n              a[i] < fixed_value (if we are going to keep the left part) and if there is a next element (at i+2) then fixed_value < a[i+2] must hold.\n\n          But wait, we are not required to use the entire adjacent increasing sequences? Actually, we are considering the entire segment from the start of the left part to the end of the right part, but we must ensure that the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n          However, note: the left part (ending at i) is strictly increasing, and the right part (starting at i+1) is strictly increasing. After fixing the element at i+1, we must have:\n\n            a[i] < fixed_value and fixed_value < a[i+2] (if we have a[i+2])\n\n          But if we don't have a[i+2] (i.e., the right part starts at i+1 and ends at i+1) then we just require a[i] < fixed_value.\n\n          Similarly, if we fix an element that is not at the inversion? Actually, we can fix an element that is not at the inversion and the inversion might still exist? \n\n        Actually, the problem is: we are allowed to change at most one number. So we can fix one element arbitrarily. We are trying to find the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.\n\n        Alternate approach: Consider that the entire subsegment must be strictly increasing except for possibly one violation (which we fix by changing one element). There are two possibilities:\n\n          Possibility 1: The subsegment does not contain any violation. Then we can take an increasing segment (without change) of length L.\n\n          Possibility 2: The subsegment contains exactly one violation. Then we fix that one element.\n\n        How to check for one violation?\n\n          We can traverse the subsegment and count the violations (adjacent pairs (i, i+1) such that a[i] >= a[i+1]). We allow at most one.\n\n        But doing that for every subsegment is too expensive.\n\n        We can use dynamic programming or sliding window? However, n=10^5.\n\n        Insight: The subsegment must be almost increasing (with at most one violation). We can use two pointers and a queue of violations? \n\n        However, note: the problem does not require contiguous increasing without change, but we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily.\n\n        Another idea:\n\n          We can consider the following:\n\n          candidate = max( \n            # Without change: the entire increasing segment\n            max_length_increasing,\n\n            # With one change: consider each inversion as the one to fix, and then combine the left and right increasing runs, but we must ensure that the entire merged segment is increasing.\n\n          )\n\n        But note: the change might not necessarily be at the inversion? Actually, if we have two consecutive decreasing, we must fix one of them? Or maybe we fix an element that is not the one breaking the condition.\n\n        Example: [1, 3, 2, 4] \n          We have an inversion at index 1 (3>=2). We can change 2 to 3 (but then we get [1,3,3,4] which is not strictly increasing). Alternatively, we can change 3 to 2 (then [1,2,2,4] -> not strictly increasing). So we must change the element at index 1 to a value between 1 and 2? Actually, we can change the 3 to 2.5, then [1,2.5,2,4] -> now 2.5>2? Then 2.5>=2 is okay, but 2<4 is okay. However, wait: the condition is strictly increasing: so we require 2.5 < 2? No, that doesn't hold. \n\n        Actually, let me re-read: strictly increasing means a[i] < a[i+1] for all i.\n\n        In [1, 2.5, 2, 4]: \n          1 < 2.5 -> yes\n          2.5 < 2 -> no.\n\n        So that doesn't work. Alternatively, change the 2 to 3.5: [1,3,3.5,4] -> 1<3, 3<3.5, 3.5<4 -> yes.\n\n        So we can fix the element at the second position (index 2) to a value between 3 and 4? Actually, we must have 3 < x < 4, then the entire segment becomes [1,3,x,4] and 3<x and x<4. Then we can do that.\n\n        But note: the left part (from the beginning) is [1,3] (length 2) and the right part (from the fixed element) is [x,4] (length 2). Then the total length is 4.\n\n        However, we could also consider a longer segment? \n\n        But wait, the example input: ['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6'] -> output 5.\n\n        How do we handle that?\n\n        Let me try with [7,2,3,1,5,6]:\n\n        We are told the answer is 5. The subsegment is [2,3,1,5,6] (changing the 1 to 4). Then the segment becomes [2,3,4,5,6].\n\n        How to capture that?\n\n        We can consider:\n\n          We are allowed to change one element. The idea is to look for two overlapping increasing sequences that are separated by one element (which we fix).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We precomputed left and right arrays.\n\n          Then, we can consider:\n\n            For each index i (from 0 to n-2) we can consider:\n\n              candidate1 = left[i] + right[i+2]   [if we fix the element at i+1, then we require that the left part (ending at i) and the right part (starting at i+2) can be merged, but we must check that the last element of the left part (a[i]) is less than the first element of the right part (a[i+2])]\n\n            However, wait: what if we fix an element that is not at the inversion? Actually, we can fix any element. But the inversion is the one that is breaking the condition. The inversion is at i and i+1, but we can also fix an element that is not adjacent to the inversion? \n\n        Actually, the problem might be more complicated. \n\n        Alternate known solution for similar problems (like CodeForces problems) is:\n\n          Let dp0[i] = the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with no changes.\n          Let dp1[i] = the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending at i with at most one change (and that change is used at some point in the segment).\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n          dp0[0] = 1\n          dp1[0] = 1\n          dp0[i] = 1 if a[i] <= a[i-1] else dp0[i-1] + 1\n          dp1[i] = 1 if a[i] <= a[i-1] then we consider: we can fix the previous part? Actually, we can fix the current element or the previous one.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to change only one element in the entire subsegment.\n\n        We can define:\n\n          dp0[i] = the longest increasing run ending at i without any change.\n\n          dp1[i] = the longest increasing run ending at i with exactly one change (which may have been done at any position in the segment up to i).\n\n        Then:\n\n          dp0[i] = \n            if a[i] > a[i-1]: dp0[i-1] + 1\n            else: 1\n\n          For dp1[i]:\n\n            Option 1: We change the current element a[i] to some value. Then we require that the previous segment (without the change) is increasing and we choose a value for a[i] that is greater than the previous element (a[i-1]). Then we can attach the previous segment (which is of length dp0[i-1] or dp1[i-1]?) \n\n            Actually, we can use the change at the current element. Then we can consider:\n\n              candidate1: if we change a[i], then we can attach the previous segment (which must be increasing) and set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1]. Then the length is (dp0[i-1] or dp1[i-1]) + 1? But wait, we are only allowed one change in the entire segment. If we already used a change in the previous segment (dp1[i-1]), then we cannot use another change at i. So:\n\n            We have two ways to use the change:\n\n              Way1: We change an element in the past (before i). Then at i we don't change, so the condition is that the previous part (with no change at i) must be increasing and we must have a[i] > a[i-1]. Then we can set dp1[i] = dp0[i] + (dp1[i-1] if we didn't use the change at i, but wait: we are not counting the change in the past separately)\n\n            Actually, we can define:\n\n              dp1[i] = \n                 Option A: We fix the current element: then we require that the previous segment (without change) is increasing and we set a[i] to a value greater than a[i-1]. But note: we are allowed to change the current element arbitrarily, so we can set it to anything. Then we can always set it to a value between a[i-1] and ...? Actually, we require only a[i] > a[i-1]. But then the entire segment ending at i-1 must be increasing (with at most one change, which we haven't used at i, so the entire segment up to i-1 must be valid with at most one change). \n\n                 Then: candidate1 = (if we fix at i, then we can have the entire segment ending at i-1 (with at most one change) and then set a[i] to something > a[i-1]. Then the length is (dp1[i-1] or dp0[i-1]) + 1? Actually, we don't know if the change was used in the past or not. We have two states: dp0[i] (no change) and dp1[i] (one change).\n\n            Known similar problem: \"Increasing Array\" with one change.\n\n            Here is a known solution for a similar problem (from CodeForces):\n\n              Let dp0[i] = the length of the increasing sequence ending at i without any changes.\n              Let dp1[i] = the length of the increasing sequence ending at i with exactly one change.\n\n              Then:\n                dp0[i] = 1\n                if i > 0 and a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                    dp0[i] = dp0[i-1] + 1\n\n                dp1[i] = 1\n                if i > 0:\n                    # Option 1: fix the current element, then we require the previous segment (without the change) must be increasing and we set a[i] to a value > a[i-1]. Then we can take the entire segment ending at i-1 (with any state, because we are going to fix the current element) and then add 1.\n                    # But wait: we are allowed only one change. So if we fix the current element, then the previous segment must be increasing (with no change) because if the previous segment already used the change then we cannot use another change.\n\n                    # Actually, we have two ways:\n\n                    # Way 1: We fix the current element. Then we can have the previous segment (without any change) and then set a[i] to a value greater than a[i-1]. Then the entire segment ending at i is the previous segment (which is dp0[i-1]) plus 1.\n\n                    # Way 2: We fix an element in the previous segment. Then we require that the previous segment (with one change) is increasing and we don't change the current element. Then we require a[i] > a[i-1] (because the last element of the previous segment is a[i-1] (if we fixed an element in the previous segment, then the last element is still a[i-1] because we didn't change it? Actually, no: we might have fixed an element in the middle. \n\n                    # This becomes messy.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n              Let dp1[i] = maximum length of a subsegment ending at i that is strictly increasing and uses at most one change.\n\n              Then:\n\n                dp0[i] = 1 if i==0 else (dp0[i-1]+1 if a[i] > a[i-1] else 1)\n\n                For dp1[i]:\n\n                  We have three possibilities:\n\n                    1. We fix the current element: then we set a[i] to any value greater than a[i-1] (if we are going to use the current element). Then the previous part must be increasing (with no change) because we are using the change at i. Then the length would be (dp0[i-1] or dp1[i-1]? Actually, we can also have fixed an element in the previous segment, but then we are not using the change at i. So:\n\n                    Actually, we have two possibilities for dp1[i]:\n\n                      a) We did not use the change at i: then the entire segment ending at i must be increasing (so we require a[i] > a[i-1]) and the segment ending at i-1 must be increasing (with at most one change). Then dp1[i] = dp1[i-1] + 1 (if a[i] > a[i-1]) OR if we use the change at i-1 then we can have a[i] > a[i-1] and then we can set dp1[i] = dp1[i-1] + 1.\n\n                    But wait, if we did not use the change at i, then the entire segment ending at i must be increasing. So we require a[i] > a[i-1] and then the length is the same as the increasing segment ending at i-1 (which is dp0[i-1] or dp1[i-1]) plus one? \n\n                    Actually, we can combine:\n\n                      dp1[i] = max(\n                          dp0[i-1] + 1,   # we fix the current element: then we can use the entire increasing segment ending at i-1 (without change) and set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1]\n                          dp1[i-1] + 1    # we fix an element in the previous segment (so the entire previous segment is already increasing with one change) and we set the current element to be greater than a[i-1] (so we don't change the current element, but we require the condition a[i] > a[i-1] to hold naturally). However, wait: if we fix an element in the previous segment, then the last element of the previous segment is a[i-1] (unless we fixed an element at i-1, then the last element is the fixed value). \n\n                    This is getting very complex.\n\n        Known solution from CodeForces for \"DZY Loves Sequences\" (problem code: DZYLOVES) is:\n\n          #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n          using namespace std;\n          int main() {\n            int n; cin >> n;\n            vector<int> a(n);\n            for(int i=0; i<n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n            vector<int> left(n,1), right(n,1);\n            for(int i=1; i<n; i++)\n                if(a[i-1] < a[i]) left[i] = left[i-1]+1;\n            for(int i=n-2; i>=0; i--)\n                if(a[i] < a[i+1]) right[i] = right[i+1]+1;\n\n            int ans = *max_element(left.begin(), left.end());\n            for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++)\n                if(a[i] >= a[i+1]) {\n                    int len = left[i] + right[i+1];\n                    // But we must ensure that the entire merged segment is increasing?

Then the condition for the entire segment is that the left part (ending at i) must be increasing, the right part (starting at i+2) must be increasing, and we require that the left part's last element (a[i]) is less than the fixed value (which we set arbitrarily) and the fixed value is less than the next element (a[i+2]) if exists. But we can set the fixed value arbitrarily, so we can set it to a value between a[i] and a[i+2] (if a[i] < a[i+2]) or to a value greater than a[i] (if there is no a[i+2]).\n\n                    // But note: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. The left part is strictly increasing, the right part is strictly increasing, and we fix one element (at i+1) to a value that is greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if exists). So the condition is that if the right part exists (i.e., i+2 exists) then a[i] < a[i+2] must hold, because we can set a[i+1] to any integer between a[i] and a[i+2]. \n\n                    // However, if there is no a[i+2] (i.e., i is the last element) then we only require a[i] < (new value). Then we can always set it.\n\n                    // Therefore, if i+2 < n, then we require a[i] < a[i+2] (so that we can set a[i+1] to a value in between). But what if a[i] >= a[i+2]? Then we cannot set a[i+1] to a value that is both greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if a[i] >= a[i+2]). Then we cannot fix the inversion by changing a[i+1]?\n\n                    // Actually, we might fix an element that is not a[i+1]. For example, we might fix a[i] to a value that is less than a[i+1] (if a[i] >= a[i+1] and a[i] >= a[i+2] then we can fix a[i] to be less than a[i+1] and then the inversion at (i, i+1) is fixed, but what about the inversion between i+1 and i+2? Actually, we are only allowed one change.\n\n                    // So the inversion we are considering is at (i, i+1). But the segment we are considering is from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+right[i+1]). The entire segment must be strictly increasing. The inversion at (i, i+1) is the only one we can fix. But there might be other inversions? \n\n                    // Actually, the segment we are considering is composed of two increasing parts (left and right) and one inversion at (i, i+1). We are fixing that one inversion. However, the entire segment must be strictly increasing. The inversion is the only problem. \n\n                    // But note: the left part is strictly increasing and the right part is strictly increasing. The only problem is the gap between the left part and the right part (because we removed a[i+1]). So we require that the last element of the left part (a[i]) is less than the first element of the right part (a[i+2]). \n\n                    // Therefore, the condition for the candidate is: if (i+2 < n) then a[i] < a[i+2] (so we can fix a[i+1] to a value between a[i] and a[i+2]). If i+2 == n, then we don't have a[i+2] so we can fix arbitrarily (as long as we set a[i+1] > a[i]).\n\n                    // But wait: what if we fix an element that is not a[i+1]? For example, we fix an element in the left part or the right part? Actually, we are only allowed one change. The inversion at (i, i+1) is the one that breaks the increasing condition. We must fix that inversion. \n\n                    // However, note: the inversion is at (i, i+1). The left part ends at i, and the right part starts at i+1 (but we are going to skip i+1 because we change it, and then the next element is i+2). So the entire segment is from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+right[i+1]) (which is from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+1+right[i+1]-1)). The only problem is the jump from a[i] to a[i+1] (which we fix). \n\n                    // But there might be an inversion in the left part? No, because left[i] is defined as the increasing segment ending at i. Similarly, the right part is increasing.\n\n                    // However, note: we are allowed to change one element anywhere in the segment. We don't necessarily have to change the element at i+1. We could change an element elsewhere. But the inversion is at (i, i+1). To fix that inversion, we have two options:\n\n                    Option 1: Change a[i] to a value less than a[i+1].\n                    Option 2: Change a[i+1] to a value greater than a[i].\n\n                    But wait, we are allowed only one change. And we want to fix the entire segment to be strictly increasing.\n\n                    However, if we change a[i] (to a value less than a[i+1]), then we must also ensure that the rest of the left part remains increasing. Similarly, if we change a[i+1] (to a value greater than a[i]), then we must ensure that the next part (if exists) is still increasing.\n\n                    But note: we are only allowed one change. So we can only fix one element. The inversion at (i, i+1) is broken. But if we change a[i], then we might break the previous part (if the left part was built on a[i] being too high). Similarly, if we change a[i+1], then we might break the next part (if the right part requires a[i+1] to be low).\n\n                    Therefore, the candidate length is left[i] + right[i+1] (if we fix the element at i+1) but only if a[i] < a[i+2] (if i+2 exists) OR if we fix the element at i (then the condition is that the left part without the last element must be increasing and the next element a[i+1] is greater than the new a[i]). \n\n                    Actually, we can consider two ways to fix the inversion:\n\n                      Candidate 1: Fix a[i+1] -> then the condition is that the left part (ending at i) and the right part (starting at i+2) must satisfy a[i] < a[i+2] (if i+2 exists). Then the entire segment is [left part] + [fixed a[i+1]] + [right part]. The length is left[i] + right[i+1] (because we skip the fixed element? Actually, we are including the fixed element. The entire segment is from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+1+right[i+1]). The fixed element is at i+1, so the length is left[i] (which goes from i-left[i]+1 to i) then the fixed element at i+1, then the right part (from i+2 to i+1+right[i+1]-1). So the length is left[i] + 1 + right[i+1] (but wait, the left[i] is the count of the increasing segment ending at i, and the right[i+1] is the count of the increasing segment starting at i+1. But we are not using the original a[i+1] because we change it. However, the length of the segment is (i - (i-left[i]+1) + 1) + 1 + (right[i+1]) = left[i] + 1 + right[i+1]?\n\n                    Actually, the entire segment has:\n\n                      Start index: i - left[i] + 1\n                      End index: i + right[i+1]   (because the right part starting at i+1 has length right[i+1], so the last element is at index i+1+right[i+1]-1 = i+right[i+1])\n\n                    So the length is (i+right[i+1]) - (i-left[i]+1) + 1 = left[i] + right[i+1] + 1.\n\n                    But wait, that includes the fixed element (which is at position i+1) and the entire left and right. However, the left[i] is the length of the increasing sequence ending at i, so the segment from (i-left[i]+1) to i is of length left[i]. Similarly, the right[i+1] is the length of the increasing sequence starting at i+1, but we are skipping the element at i+1 (we change it) and then taking the next right[i+1] elements. But note: the right[i+1] is defined as the increasing sequence starting at i+1 (the original element). When we change a[i+1], the increasing sequence starting at i+1 is broken. However, we are allowed to change only one element, and we are changing a[i+1], so the increasing sequence that starts at i+1 (after the change) is just the fixed element and then the next part (if any) must be increasing. But wait, the right array was computed without changes. \n\n                    Actually, the candidate segment is:\n\n                      [a_{i-left[i]+1}, ..., a_i, (changed a[i+1]), a_{i+2}, ..., a_{i+1+right[i+1]-1}]\n\n                    And the condition is that the entire segment is strictly increasing. The left part is strictly increasing (by definition of left[i]), the right part is strictly increasing (by definition of right[i+1]), and we set the fixed element to be between a[i] and a[i+2] (if i+2 exists). \n\n                    Therefore, the candidate length is left[i] + 1 + right[i+1].\n\n                    Similarly, if we fix a[i] (to a value less than a[i+1]), then the condition is that the left part without the last element is increasing (so the left part without the last element is the increasing segment ending at i-1, which is left[i-1]) and then we set a[i] to a value less than a[i+1]. Then the entire segment is:\n\n                      [a_{i-left[i]+1} ... a_{i-1}, (fixed a[i]), a_{i+1}, ... until the next violation]\n\n                    But wait, we are only allowed one change. And we are fixing a[i]. Then the inversion at (i, i+1) is fixed. However, the left part originally ended at i, and now we break the left part at i because we change a[i]. The increasing sequence ending at i-1 is left[i-1]. Then we set a[i] to a value less than a[i+1] (but we don't care about the value as long as it's less than a[i+1]). Then the next part (from i+1) must be increasing (which it is, because the original right[i+1] is defined). But the entire segment from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+1+right[i+1]-1) is:\n\n                      Length = left[i] (original left part) but we are changing the last element. Actually, the left part originally included a[i]. Now we break that. We can consider the segment from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+right[i+1]) (including the fixed element at i). But the increasing condition from (i-1) to i: we require a[i-1] < fixed_value. And from i to i+1: fixed_value < a[i+1]. \n\n                    The length is left[i] + right[i+1] (because the left part originally had length left[i] and we are including the entire left part and then the entire right part) but wait, the left part originally included a[i] and we are changing a[i]. However, the left part without a[i] is left[i-1] (if i>0) and then we add the fixed element and the right part. But note: we are allowed to change one element, so we can also extend the left part by one element (the fixed element) if the condition holds.\n\n                    Actually, we can define two candidates for each inversion (i, i+1):\n\n                      Candidate A: Fix a[i+1] -> then the entire segment is from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+right[i+1]) (because the fixed element is at i+1, and the right part starts at i+2) and the length is left[i] + 1 + right[i+1] (if the condition a[i] < a[i+2] holds when i+2 exists, or always if i+2 doesn't exist).\n\n                      Candidate B: Fix a[i] -> then the entire segment is from (i-left[i]+1) to (i+right[i+1]) (because we are including the fixed element at i and then the entire right part) and the length is left[i] (which originally included a[i]) but we break the left part at i. Actually, we can consider:\n\n                         The left part without a[i] is left[i-1] (if i>0) and then we add the fixed element and the right part. But wait, we are allowed to extend the left part by one element (the fixed element) if the condition holds.\n\n                    Actually, it's symmetric. We can fix either the left element or the right element. But note: we are only allowed one change.\n\n                    However, we can also fix an element that is not adjacent to the inversion? That would not fix the inversion. So the inversion must be fixed by changing one of the two elements.\n\n                    Therefore, for an inversion at (i, i+1) (i.e., a[i] >= a[i+1]), we consider:\n\n                      candidate1 = left[i] + 1 + right[i+1]   [fixing a[i+1]], but only if (i+2 >= n OR a[i] < a[i+2])\n                      candidate2 = left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]   [fixing a[i]], but only if (i-1 >= 0) and (the condition for fixing a[i] is that the left part without a[i] is increasing and then we set a[i] to a value less than a[i+1]). However, the condition for fixing a[i] is automatically satisfied if we set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of a sequence where we can change at most one number to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking possible subsegments by leveraging precomputed arrays that track the lengths of strictly increasing sequences ending and starting at each position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (left[i])**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at each index `i` without any changes.\n   - **Right Array (right[i])**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at each index `i` without any changes.\n\n2. **Initial Check**:\n   - The maximum value in the `left` array gives the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n\n3. **Handling Inversions**:\n   - For each inversion (where `a[i] >= a[i+1]`), consider two scenarios:\n     - **Fixing the Next Element (a[i+1])**: The candidate length is `left[i] + 1 + right[i+1]`, provided that if `i+2` exists, `a[i] < a[i+2]` (to ensure the merged segment can be strictly increasing).\n     - **Fixing the Current Element (a[i])**: The candidate length is `left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]`, provided that `i-1` exists and the conditions for merging are met.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**:\n   - The answer is the maximum value obtained from the initial check and all valid inversion scenarios.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(max(left), max(right))\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        if a[i] >= a[i+1]:\n            if i+1 == n-1:\n                candidate1 = left[i] + 1\n                if candidate1 > ans:\n                    ans = candidate1\n            else:\n                if a[i] < a[i+2]:\n                    candidate1 = left[i] + 1 + right[i+1]\n                    if candidate1 > ans:\n                        ans = candidate1\n            if i == 0:\n                candidate2 = 0\n            else:\n                candidate2 = left[i-1] + 1 + right[i+1]\n                if candidate2 > ans:\n                    ans = candidate2\n                    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length `n` and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially 1.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: These arrays are computed to store the lengths of strictly increasing subsegments ending and starting at each index, respectively.\n4. **Initial Maximum**: The initial answer is set to the maximum value in the `left` array, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n5. **Inversion Handling**: For each inversion (where `a[i] >= a[i+1]`), the solution checks two scenarios:\n   - **Fixing a[i+1]**: The candidate length is calculated if merging the left and right segments around `i+1` is feasible.\n   - **Fixing a[i]**: The candidate length is calculated if merging the left and right segments around `i` is feasible.\n6. **Output**: The maximum value from all checks is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking specific segments around inversions, leveraging precomputed data to avoid redundant calculations and ensure optimal performance.",
