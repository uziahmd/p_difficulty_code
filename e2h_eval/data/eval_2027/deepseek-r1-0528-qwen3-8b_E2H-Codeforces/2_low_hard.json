Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter must be different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the diagonals might have two different letters? But the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\", meaning each diagonal has one letter, but the two diagonals can have different letters? Actually, reading the problem again: \n \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\" — meaning the main diagonal has the same letter, and the anti-diagonal has the same letter, but these two letters might be different.\n\n Then condition 2: all non-diagonal squares must be the same letter and that letter is different from the two diagonal ones? Actually, the problem says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n But note: the diagonals have two distinct letters? Or can they be the same? Let's consider:\n\n Example: \n   Input: 3\n           wsw\n           sws\n           wsw\n\n This is the example that outputs \"YES\".\n\n In this example, the main diagonal: [0][0] = 'w', [1][1] = 's', [2][2] = 'w' -> wait, not the same! \n\n Wait, let me re-read the example input: \n   Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n The example input for n=3 is:\n   wsw\n   sws\n   wsw\n\n Now, the diagonals in a 3x3:\n   Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) -> 'w', 's', 'w' — not the same.\n\n But wait, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n Let me check the example again: \n   The example input for n=3 is: \n        line1: 'wsw'\n        line2: 'sws'\n        line3: 'wsw'\n\n The main diagonal: \n        [0][0] = 'w', [1][1] = 'w'? Actually, wait: \n        The second row: 'sws' -> so [1][0] = 's', [1][1] = 'w', [1][2] = 's'\n\n So the main diagonal is: \n        row0: index0 -> 'w'\n        row1: index1 -> 'w'\n        row2: index2 -> 'w'\n\n Similarly, the anti-diagonal: \n        row0: index2 -> 'w'\n        row1: index1 -> 'w'\n        row2: index0 -> 'w'\n\n But wait, let me write the grid:\n\n        row0: ['w','s','w']\n        row1: ['s','w','s']\n        row2: ['w','s','w']\n\n Now the main diagonal: \n        (0,0): 'w'\n        (1,1): 'w'\n        (2,2): 'w'\n\n The anti-diagonal:\n        (0,2): 'w'\n        (1,1): 'w'   -> wait, (1,1) is already included in the main diagonal? But note: the anti-diagonal for a 3x3 is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). \n\n So the center cell (1,1) is common to both diagonals. \n\n Therefore, the condition is:\n   For the main diagonal: all cells (i,i) must be the same letter, say 'x'.\n   For the anti-diagonal: all cells (i, n-1-i) must be the same letter, say 'y'.\n\n However, in the example, both diagonals have the letter 'w'. \n\n So the diagonals must have the same letter? Actually, no: the problem says \"on both diagonals\" meaning each diagonal independently has the same letter, but they could be different. \n\n But wait, what if the two diagonals have different letters? Then the center cell would have to be two letters at once? That is impossible. \n\n Actually, the center cell is part of both diagonals. Therefore, the two diagonals must share the center cell. So the letter on the main diagonal must be the same as the letter on the anti-diagonal at the center. But the rest of the anti-diagonal must be the same as the center, and the rest of the main",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: All elements from the top-left to the bottom-right must be the same letter.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: All elements from the top-right to the bottom-left must be the same letter. Note that the center element is common to both diagonals, so it must satisfy both conditions.\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**:\n   - All elements not on either diagonal must be the same letter and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Verify that all diagonal elements are consistent (both diagonals have the same letter, but they can be different from each other as long as the non-diagonal elements meet their condition).\n   - Ensure all non-diagonal elements are identical and distinct from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    diag_letter1 = None\n    diag_letter2 = None\n    non_diag_letter = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        j = i\n        k = n - 1 - i\n        if grid[i][j] != grid[i][k]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n        if diag_letter1 is None:\n            diag_letter1 = grid[i][j]\n            diag_letter2 = grid[i][k]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_letter1 or grid[i][k] != diag_letter2:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n                \n        if grid[i][j] != diag_letter1 or grid[i][k] != diag_letter2:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if non_diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if non_diag_letter == diag_letter1 or non_diag_letter == diag_letter2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The code checks each element on both diagonals to ensure all elements on the main diagonal are the same (`diag_letter1`) and all elements on the anti-diagonal are the same (`diag_letter2`). If any inconsistency is found, it immediately prints \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: After verifying the diagonals, the code checks all other elements (non-diagonal) to ensure they are the same (`non_diag_letter`) and different from the diagonal letters.\n4. **Final Validation**: If all checks pass, the code confirms the grid forms an \"X\" by printing \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all conditions required for the grid to be recognized as forming the letter \"X\".",
