Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation: \n Moving from one block to another is allowed if they share a common border of nonzero length. This is essentially crossing a road.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n But note: the entire plane is divided by the n infinite lines. We can think of each road as a line that separates two half-planes. The blocks are the connected regions (which are like the cells in an arrangement of lines). \n\n Now, note that the problem does not require us to traverse the graph of blocks, because the number of blocks can be very large (exponential in n). However, we can use the following idea:\n\n Since the roads divide the plane, the home and the university are in two different blocks. The minimal steps required is the minimal number of roads we must cross to get from home to university.\n\n However, wait: the movement is defined by crossing roads. Each step crosses one road? Actually, note that when you cross one road, you go from one block to an adjacent block. Then, to get from home to university, we need to cross the set of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But note: the problem says that you can only move to a block if they share a nonzero common border. This means that you can cross one road at a time.\n\n However, consider: if we cross a road, we change the side of that road. The entire journey can be seen as going from the home side to the university side for each road.\n\n The crucial point: two points (home and university) are separated by a road if the two points lie on opposite sides of that road. And to get from one block to the other, we must cross every road that separates them.\n\n But note: the problem does not require crossing roads one by one independently. However, observe that the minimal number of steps is actually the number of roads that separate the two points? \n\n Why? Because if there are k roads that separate the two points, then we must cross each of these k roads at least once. However, we might be able to cross multiple roads in one step? \n\n Let's read the problem again: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n The common border between two blocks is part of one or more roads? Actually, the borders between two adjacent blocks are exactly one road (because two blocks are separated by one road). So in one step, you cross exactly one road.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. But wait: what if the same road is crossed multiple times? However, we want the minimal steps. We can plan a route that crosses a separating road only once (and we have to cross all the separating roads). However, note that the blocks are arranged such that if two points are separated by k roads, then we must cross at least k roads, and since each step crosses one road, the minimal steps is k.\n\n But note: we cannot cross the same road twice because once we are on the correct side, we don't need to cross it again. However, the problem does not explicitly forbid crossing a road twice, but minimal steps would avoid that.\n\n However, consider: the arrangement of lines might force us to cross a road more than once? Actually, no. Because the minimal path (in terms of crossings) is just the set of roads that separate the two points. \n\n How do we check if a road separates the two points?\n For a road defined by a*x + b*y + c = 0, the sign of (a*x+b*y+c) for the home and the university should be opposite.\n\n But note: the equation might be multiplied by -1, so we have to be cautious. However, we can define:\n\n   f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c\n\n Then, the home and university are on the same side of the road if f(x1,y1) and f(x2,y2) have the same sign (or both zero, but the problem states they are not on the road). \n\n Steps = number of roads i for which f_i(home) * f_i(university) < 0.\n\n However, wait: the example input and output.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      2\n      0 1 0\n      1 0 0\n\n   The two roads are:\n        Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0\n        Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0\n\n   Home (1,1): \n        Road1: 1 -> positive\n        Road2: 1 -> positive\n\n   University (-1,-1):\n        Road1: -1 -> negative\n        Road2: -1 -> negative\n\n   So for Road1: 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0 -> separates.\n   For Road2: 1 * (-1) = -1 < 0 -> separates.\n\n   Then steps = 2. Output is 2. Matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   The roads:\n        Road1: x = 0\n        Road2: y = 0\n        Road3: x+y-3=0\n\n   Home (1,1):\n        Road1: 1 -> positive\n        Road2: 1 -> positive\n        Road3: 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative\n\n   University (-1,-1):\n        Road1: -1 -> negative\n        Road2: -1 -> negative\n        Road3: -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative\n\n   Now, separate roads are those where the signs differ.\n\n        Road1: 1 * (-1) = -1 -> separate.\n        Road2: 1 * (-1) = -1 -> separate.\n        Road3: (-1) * (-5) = 5 -> same side.\n\n   So steps = 2. Output is 2. Matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads that separate home and university.\n\n However, wait: what about the fact that the problem says that we are moving in steps that cross one road at a time? And we must cross every separating road exactly once? \n\n But note: the example above: the minimal steps is indeed 2, and we must cross two roads.\n\n But consider: what if two roads are parallel? Then they don't intersect, but still they can separate the two points independently. However, the above method still holds.\n\n However, there is a catch: what if the two points are separated by a road, but the road is such that the home and university are on opposite sides? Then we must cross that road.\n\n But what if the road is not separating them? Then we don't need to cross.\n\n Therefore, the answer is simply the count of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n But wait: is that always the minimal steps? \n\n Let me think: In the arrangement of lines, the blocks are labeled by the sign vector (each component being + or - for each road). The home is in a block with a sign vector S (each component s_i = sign(f_i(home))) and the university is in a block with sign vector T. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of road crossings (i.e., flipping the sign for a road) to go from S to T. But note: we can flip one road at a time. However, we are allowed to flip any set of roads arbitrarily? \n\n Actually, the graph of blocks is such that two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Then the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors? \n\n But note: the sign vector has n components. The Hamming distance is the number of positions where S and T differ. And that is exactly the number of roads that separate the two points (since for a road i, if S_i != T_i then the points are on opposite sides).\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\n However, note: the sign function: we need to define a consistent sign. Since the equation can be multiplied by -1, we have to be careful. But note: if we define the sign by the value of (a*x+b*y+c) then the sign is fixed by the equation as given.\n\n But note: the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple. However, the sign of (a*x+b*y+c) is independent of the scalar multiple (if we multiply by a positive constant, the sign remains; if negative, it flips). However, we are comparing the two points. So for a given road, if we define:\n   s1 = sign(a*x1+b*y1+c)\n   s2 = sign(a*x2+b*y2+c)\n\n Then the product s1*s2 is either positive (same side) or negative (opposite side). But note: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the signs flip, but the product becomes the same: \n   Original: (a*x+b*y+c) for home is positive, for university negative -> product negative.\n   After multiplying by -1: the equation becomes -a*x -b*y -c = 0, then the value for home is negative and for university positive -> product negative.\n\n So the separation condition is independent of the scaling of the equation.\n\n However, we must be cautious with zeros. But the problem states that the points are not on any road.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read x1, y1, x2, y2.\n   Read n.\n   For each road (a, b, c):\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        If val1 * val2 < 0, then this road separates the two points.\n\n   Count the number of such roads.\n\n   Print the count.\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Road1: (0,1,0) -> x=0 is not the equation, wait: the equation is 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0.\n        For (1,1): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0.\n        For (-1,-1): 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 < 0.\n        Product: 1 * (-1) = -1 -> count.\n\n   Road2: (1,0,0) -> x=0 equation: 1*x+0*y+0=0 -> x=0.\n        (1,1): 1>0, (-1,-1): -1<0 -> product negative -> count.\n\n   Count=2.\n\n Example 2: \n   Road1: (1,0,0): \n        (1,1): 1>0, (-1,-1): -1<0 -> product negative -> count.\n   Road2: (0,1,0): \n        (1,1): 1>0, (-1,-1): -1<0 -> product negative -> count.\n   Road3: (1,1,-3): \n        (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative, (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative -> product positive -> skip.\n\n   Count=2.\n\n Therefore, code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the multiplication of two large numbers (like 10^6) might lead to overflow? But the constraints say that coordinates and coefficients are between -10^6 and 10^6. Then:\n\n   a*x1: maximum absolute value is 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e12, and we have three terms (if a,b,c are all 10^6, then |a*x1+b*y1+c| <= 3e12, which is within Python int (which is arbitrary precision, but we are only doing comparisons). However, we don't need the exact value for the product (val1*val2) if we are only checking the sign? \n\n But wait: we are using the product to check for zero? Actually, we are checking for negative. However, we must be cautious because if the value is zero then the point is on the road, but the problem states that neither home nor university is on the road. So we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n However, we can avoid the large product by checking the sign of val1 and val2 separately.\n\n   if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n\n But then we have to compute two values, and then compare.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   if (val1 < 0) == (val2 < 0): # then same side\n   else: different side\n\n But note: if we are concerned about performance, we can break down the computation.\n\n However, the problem says n<=300, so 300 roads is nothing.\n\n But also, the values can be as large as 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e12, and then we are storing integers that big. But 300 of them is acceptable.\n\n However, we can also avoid the full multiplication by using the sign without computing the entire product? \n\n But let's stick to the simpler way.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check if the two values have opposite signs\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: what if one of val1 or val2 is zero? The problem says the points are not on the road, so they won't be zero. So we don't have to worry.\n\n However, note: the equation might be defined with negative a, b, or c, but that doesn't matter.\n\n Let me test with a negative coefficient:\n\n   Road: (-1, 0, 0) -> equation: -x = 0, so x=0. But then:\n        (1,1): -1 -> negative, (-1,-1): 1 -> positive -> opposite signs -> count.\n\n   Same as (1,0,0) because we are only interested in the sign.\n\n But wait: the product method (val1*val2) is equivalent to the condition above, but we are avoiding the product. \n\n However, note: if one of them is negative and the other positive, then the condition (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) is true.\n\n But what if the equation is defined with a negative? The sign is correctly captured.\n\n However, note: the equation is defined as a*x+b*y+c=0. The sign is determined by the linear expression.\n\n But wait: the product method (val1 * val2) is negative if and only if the signs are opposite. Our condition is the same.\n\n But what if the equation is defined with negative a, but we are evaluating the same expression? The sign is the same as if we had multiplied the entire equation by -1. However, the condition for opposite signs is independent.\n\n Example: \n   Equation: -x = 0. Then for (1,0): -1 -> negative, for (-1,0): 1 -> positive -> opposite.\n\n   Equation: x = 0 (the standard form). Then (1,0): 1 -> positive, (-1,0): -1 -> negative -> opposite.\n\n   So both equations count the same road.\n\n Therefore, the above code should work.\n\n However, wait: what if the value is very close to zero? But the problem says the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry about floating point inaccuracies. We are using integers, so no floating point.\n\n But wait: the inputs are integers, so we are safe.\n\n One more test case: \n\n   Home (0,0) and University (0,0) ? But the problem states that home and university are two distinct points? Actually, the problem says: \"Your home is located in one of the blocks\" and \"get to the University\", so they are distinct. But the input may have same coordinates? \n\n   The problem says: \"the third line contains an integer n\", and then n roads. And the home and university are given. \n\n   The problem does not explicitly say that home and university are distinct, but note: if they are the same, then the minimal steps is 0. However, the problem states that the university is located in some block, and home is in a block, and the blocks are separated by roads. But if they are the same point, then they are in the same block (unless there is a road passing through the point, but the problem says they are not on the road). So if they are the same, then we don't need to cross any road.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", but they could be the same point.\n\n   According to the problem statement, the home and university are given by two lines. It does not say they are distinct.\n\n   But note: the example input: first line is home, second line is university. They could be the same.\n\n   So we should account for that.\n\n   If home and university are the same, then we never need to cross any road. So steps = 0.\n\n   However, our method would compute for each road: \n        val1 = a*x1+b*y1+c\n        val2 = a*x1+b*y1+c   (same as val1)\n        Then the condition (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) is false.\n\n   So we return 0, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the two points are the same, then we don't need to cross any road, so 0 steps.\n\n   So the code already handles that.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the two points are given, and the roads. The problem does not guarantee distinct home and university.\n\n   We are good.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are distinct but the same side of every road? Then we don't need to cross any road? \n\n   Example: two points in the same block. Then we don't need to cross any road. Steps=0.\n\n   Our code: for every road, the condition fails (same side) -> count=0 -> output 0.\n\n   Correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data: \n            continue\n        a, b, c = map(int, data)\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        # Check for opposite signs\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: there is a possibility of integer overflow? The numbers are as large as 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e12, which is within the range of Python integers (which are arbitrary precision, but the operations are efficient for numbers this size). But we have only 300 roads, so it's acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem constraints say that the coefficients and coordinates can be up to 10^6 in absolute value, so the maximum absolute value for a term is 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, and then we have three terms (so worst-case absolute value 3e12). This is a 13-digit number, which is still an integer in Python.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   Output: 2\n\n Example 2: \n   Input:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   Output: 2\n\n But wait, the example input format in the problem is given as a list of strings. However, the problem says:\n\n   The first line: two integers for home.\n   The second line: two integers for university.\n   The third line: integer n.\n   Then n lines, each with three integers.\n\n So we are reading correctly.\n\n However, note: the example input was given as:\n\n   ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n But in the actual input, we will have separate lines.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as a string. The problem says:\n\n   Input:\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', ... ]\n\n   But that is just an example representation. In reality, the input is standard input.\n\n   We are reading from stdin.\n\n   We assume the input is given as:\n\n        line1: \"1 1\"\n        line2: \"-1 -1\"\n        line3: \"2\"\n        line4: \"0 1 0\"\n        line5: \"1 0 0\"\n\n   So we read five lines.\n\n   But wait, the example input representation has two elements in the list. Actually, the example input is given as two separate examples.\n\n   The problem says:\n\n        Example Input\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   This is just a way to show two examples. The input for the program is one of these examples.\n\n   We are to read from stdin.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # compute and count\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          0 1 0\n          1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   It works.\n\n   But wait: there's a potential issue. What if a road is defined with a negative leading coefficient? We tested with (-1,0,0) and it worked.\n\n   However, note: the condition for opposite signs is symmetric. \n\n   Another test: two roads, one separating and one not.\n\n        Home: (1,0)\n        University: (0,1)\n        Road1: x - y = 0 -> (1,0): 1, (0,1): -1 -> separate -> count=1.\n        Road2: x + y - 1 = 0 -> (1,0): 0 -> wait, but the point is (1,0) and (0,1). \n            (1,0): 1+0-1=0 -> but wait, the problem states the points are not on the road. So this example is invalid.\n\n        Let me choose a road that doesn't separate: Road2: x+y-2=0.\n            (1,0): 1+0-2=-1 -> negative\n            (0,1): 0+1-2=-1 -> negative -> same side.\n\n        So total count=1.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal steps is 1.\n\n   The code returns 1.\n\n   Another test: two roads, both separating.\n\n        Home: (1,0)\n        University: (-1,0)\n        Road1: x=0 -> (1,0):1, (-1,0):-1 -> separate.\n        Road2: y=0 -> (1,0):0? Wait, (1,0) is on the road? That's not allowed. So let's choose a road that doesn't pass through (1,0) or (-1,0). \n\n        Road2: x+y=0 -> (1,0):1, (-1,0):-1 -> separate.\n\n        Count=2.\n\n   Therefore, output 2.\n\n   It seems correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if the two points are on the same side for all roads, but the roads are many? Then the answer is 0.\n\n   Example: two points in the same half-plane for every road.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   But wait: the problem statement says that the roads divide the plane into connected regions (blocks). The minimal steps is the minimal number of road crossings. And each road crossing is one step.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n   However, note: sometimes you might cross a road more than once? But the minimal path does not. We are counting the necessary crossings.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n   This means that we can only move to an adjacent block (sharing a border). But the minimal path might require crossing a road multiple times? \n\n   Consider: the graph of blocks is such that two blocks are adjacent if they share a border (one road). Then the entire graph is bipartite? Actually, the arrangement of lines divides the plane into regions that are labeled by sign vectors. Two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one coordinate. Then the graph is a hypercube? \n\n   But note: the graph of sign vectors is a hypercube of dimension n. The minimal steps is the Hamming distance. And that is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n   Therefore, the above reasoning is correct.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   Read the two points, then n, then the n lines.\n\n   For each line, compute the two values and check for opposite signs.\n\n   Count and output.\n\n   However, wait: there's a catch. What if the two points are separated by a road, but the road is defined with a different normalization? \n\n   Example: two roads that are the same line but with opposite signs. But the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same\". So we don't have duplicate roads.\n\n   But note: two roads that are the same line but with opposite signs are considered the same road? Actually, the problem says \"no two roads are the same\", so if we have two identical equations (even if normalized differently) they are considered the same? Actually, no: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same\".\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   However, note: the equation is defined by (a, b, c) and the problem says they are not the same. So we don't have duplicates.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   But wait: what if a road is defined with a=0 and b=0? The problem states: \"ai and bi are not both equal to zero\", so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # Calculate the value for home and university\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # Check if the signs are opposite\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me submit.\n\n However, wait: the example input was given as a string. But in the problem, the input format is as described.\n\n But note: the example input has two examples. We are only reading one.\n\n   Example input 1:\n\n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n   We read:\n        First line: \"1 1\" -> x1=1, y1=1\n        Second line: \"-1 -1\" -> x2=-1, y2=-1\n        Third line: \"2\" -> n=2\n        Then two lines: \"0 1 0\" and \"1 0 0\"\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: the second example input is:\n\n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   We read:\n        First line: \"1 1\"\n        Second line: \"-1 -1\"\n        Third line: \"3\"\n        Then three lines: \"1 0 0\", \"0 1 0\", \"1 1 -3\"\n\n   Correct.\n\n   I think we are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the coordinates and coefficients can be negative. We are handling that.\n\n   One more test: negative coordinates and negative coefficients.\n\n   Example: \n        Home: (-1, -1)\n        University: (1, 1)\n        Road: (-1, -1, 1) -> equation: -x -y + 1 = 0 -> x+y=1\n\n        For home (-1,-1): -(-1) -(-1) + 1 = 1+1+1 = 3 -> positive\n        For university (1,1): -1-1+1 = -1 -> negative -> separate.\n\n   Condition: (positive and negative) -> count.\n\n   So the code counts it.\n\n   But wait: the equation is -x-y+1=0, and we computed for (-1,-1): \n        (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + 1 = 1+1+1 = 3 -> wait, no, the equation is a*x+b*y+c, so:\n        a=-1, b=-1, c=1\n        (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 -> positive.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is robust.\n\n   We output the count.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement says \"Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.\"\n\n   And we are returning the count, which is the minimal steps.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   Let me run the code on the sample inputs.\n\n   Sample Input 1: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   Sample Output 1: 2\n\n   Sample Input 2:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   Sample Output 2: 2\n\n   We get 2 for both.\n\n   I'll write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the input can have negative numbers, and the equations can have negative coefficients, and the points can be negative. Our code handles that.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the condition (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) is equivalent to (val1 * val2 < 0). But we are avoiding the multiplication because the numbers can be very large (though we are in integers and the problem allows it) but also because the product might be negative without the condition on magnitude? \n\n   But the condition is the same.\n\n   Alternatively, we could do:\n\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   But the product might be too large? The maximum absolute value of the product is (3e12) * (3e12) = 9e24, which is a very big integer, but Python can handle it. However, the problem constraints say that the numbers are up to 10^6, so the product is up to (10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6) * (same) -> but wait, we are multiplying two expressions that are each up to 3e12 in absolute value, so the product is up to 9e24, which is a big integer but still manageable in Python for 300 iterations.\n\n   But the problem says the coefficients and coordinates are integers, so we are safe.\n\n   However, the condition (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) is more efficient because we don't compute the product (which is a big integer) and we only compare two integers (each up to 3e12) which is cheaper than multiplying two big integers.\n\n   So we keep the condition.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        v1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        v2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if (v1 < 0 and v2 > 0) or (v1 > 0 and v2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n   We'll run the code.\n\n   But wait: what if one of the values is zero? The problem states the points are not on the road, so v1 and v2 are nonzero. So we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, note: the equation might be defined with a,b,c such that the expression is zero for one point? The problem says \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so v1 !=0 and v2 !=0.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   We output the code.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement says the roads are defined by aix+biy+ci=0, and we are using the expression as given. \n\n   There is one more thing: the equation might be defined with a negative leading coefficient, but the condition (v1 < 0 and v2 > 0) or (v1 > 0 and v2 < 0) is independent of the magnitude, only the sign.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   It matches.\n\n   But wait: the problem statement example outputs are ['2','2'].\n\n   We are printing integers. The problem expects an integer.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input can be up to 300 roads, and we are reading each road. We assume the input is given as described.\n\n   We submit.\n\n   But wait: what if the input has spaces at the beginning or end? We use split(), which by default splits by whitespace and ignores leading/trailing spaces.\n\n   The problem says the input is space-separated integers.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data: \n            # Skip empty lines? But the problem says there are n roads, so we should have n non-empty lines.\n            continue\n        a, b, c = map(int, data)\n        # Compute the two values\n        val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road (an infinite line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation here is that each road that separates the home and university blocks must be crossed exactly once in the minimal path. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads in Crazy Town are infinite lines defined by equations \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). These lines divide the plane into connected regions (blocks). The home and university are located in two different blocks, and the goal is to find the minimal number of road crossings needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n2. **Insight**: Two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides of a road if the sign of the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) differs for the two points. Each such road must be crossed exactly once in the minimal path.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides by evaluating the sign of the equation at both points. If they do, increment the count of separating roads. The total count of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads \\(n\\).\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are read. The equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: If the evaluations of the equation at the two points have opposite signs, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed. The count of such roads is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of roads that separate the home and university is printed, which represents the minimal steps needed to reach the university from home.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal with linear time complexity relative to the number of roads.",
