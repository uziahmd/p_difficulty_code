Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We need to assign each digit in A (from left to right) to either Homer (H) or Marge (M) for exactly n moves per player.\n The goal is to maximize the total prize: S1 (Homer's number) + S2 (Marge's number).\n\n Note: The process is that on each turn, the leftmost digit of A is taken by the current player and appended to their own number.\n\n However, note that the entire sequence is predetermined: we are going to output a string of 2n characters, each either 'H' or 'M'.\n\n Since each player makes exactly n moves, we have exactly n 'H' and n 'M' in the output string.\n\n How does the assignment work?\n   Let the original number A be represented as d0 d1 d2 ... d_{2n-1}.\n   The first move: assign d0 to either H or M. Then the next move uses the remaining string (without d0).\n\n But note: the value of S1 and S2 are numbers. For example, if we assign the digits in order:\n\n   Assignment: H, then M, then H, then M for A = \"1234\" (n=2)\n   Then:\n     Step 1: H takes '1' -> S1 = \"1\", S2 = \"\" and A becomes \"234\"\n     Step 2: M takes '2' -> S1 = \"1\", S2 = \"2\", A becomes \"34\"\n     Step 3: H takes '3' -> S1 = \"13\", S2 = \"2\", A becomes \"4\"\n     Step 4: M takes '4' -> S1 = \"13\", S2 = \"24\"\n\n   Total prize = 13 + 24 = 37.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are empty.\" and then each move appends the digit to their own number.\n\n Important: The number formed by the digits in order, so the first digit assigned to a player becomes the most significant digit.\n\n Therefore, the value of S1 is the number formed by the digits assigned to H in the order they were assigned (first move digit is the most significant).\n Similarly for S2.\n\n Since the assignment must be done for the entire 2n-digit string, and we have to assign exactly n to H and n to M, we can think of the entire assignment as:\n\n   We are going to split the 2n-digit string into two subsequences (each of length n): one for H and one for M, and the relative order in the subsequence must be the same as in A.\n\n But note: the moves happen from left to right, so the first time a player picks a digit, that digit becomes the most significant for that player, then the next time they pick, it becomes the next digit (so the second most significant, etc).\n\n However, the catch: we cannot change the order of the digits. The digits are taken from left to right, but each time we choose which player takes the digit.\n\n So, we are effectively partitioning the digits (in order) into two sequences (for H and M). Then:\n\n   S1 = digit1_H * (10^(n-1)) + digit2_H * (10^(n-2)) + ... \n   S2 = digit1_M * (10^(n-1)) + digit2_M * (10^(n-2)) + ...\n\n But note: the assignment is interleaved. The first digit goes to either H or M, then the second to the other or same, etc.\n\n However, we are free to choose the assignment arbitrarily (any interleaving) as long as we use exactly n for H and n for M.\n\n But note: the problem asks for a sequence of 2n characters (each 'H' or 'M') that gives maximum total prize.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since n is at most 18, the total digits are at most 36. We cannot iterate over all C(36,18) possibilities (which is about 9e9) without a smart way.\n\n Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming. But note: the total prize is the sum of two numbers, each of n digits.\n\n However, note: the value of the number for H is not independent of the order: the first digit assigned to H will be multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n Similarly for M.\n\n So, if we let:\n   Let i be the current index (from 0 to 2n-1) and we have used h H's and m M's so far (h+m = i+1, and we require h<=n, m<=n).\n\n Then the contribution of the digits we have assigned to H so far is:\n   value_H = (digit0_H if it was assigned at step 0? Actually, we don't know the exact power because the assignment order matters for the position.)\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the final number for H is built by taking the digits assigned to H in the order they were taken, and then interpreting that as a base-10 number.\n\n But note: the first digit assigned to H becomes the most significant, then the next becomes the next, etc.\n\n Similarly for M.\n\n The total prize is the numerical value of the H's digits (as if they were written in the order they were taken) plus the numerical value of the M's digits.\n\n We can use DP with state (i, h, m) where i is the current index (from 0 to 2n) and h is the count of H's so far, m is the count of M's so far (h+m=i). Then the remaining digits are from i to 2n-1.\n\n However, the problem is that the value of the number depends on the entire sequence of assignments, and the digits are fixed in order.\n\n Alternatively, we can reverse the thinking: \n\n We want to assign each digit to either H or M, and the assignment must be in the order of the string.\n\n The total value is:\n   S1 = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit_{j_k} * 10^{n-1-k})   [where j_0, j_1, ... are the indices of the digits assigned to H, in increasing order (i.e., the order of appearance)]\n   S2 = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit_{l_k} * 10^{n-1-k})\n\n But note: the assignment is by the order in A. So the first digit (index0) is the first one to assign, then index1, etc.\n\n We can also consider that the k-th digit assigned to H (counting from the first assigned) will be multiplied by 10^(n - (position in H))? \n\n Actually, if we assign the digits in the order they appear, then the first time we assign a digit to H, that digit will be the most significant (so multiplied by 10^(n-1)), then the next time we assign to H, it will be multiplied by 10^(n-2)), etc.\n\n Therefore, if we let:\n   Let x_i be the digit at position i (0-indexed from the original string A).\n   Then, if we denote by p_j the j-th time we assign to H, then the digit at that assignment (say x_i) is placed at the (n - j)-th power? Actually, the first assignment (j=0) is the most significant (power n-1), then j=1 is power n-2, etc.\n\n Similarly for M.\n\n Now, the total prize is:\n\n   Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} [ (digit at the j-th H assignment) * (10^(n-1-j)) ] +\n   Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} [ (digit at the j-th M assignment) * (10^(n-1-j)) ]\n\n But note: the assignment order is fixed by the string A. So the j-th H assignment is the j-th time we chose H, and similarly for M.\n\n We can also note that the exponent for a digit depends on how many digits are assigned to the same player after it. Specifically, if a digit is assigned to H and there are k more digits assigned to H later, then this digit will be multiplied by 10^(n-1-k) (because those k digits will form the lower k digits). Similarly, for M.\n\n Alternatively, we can think greedily: we want to assign the larger digits to the more significant positions.\n\n But note: the assignment is constrained by the fact that we have to take the digits in order. We cannot assign a later digit to a player before an earlier one.\n\n Therefore, we can use dynamic programming that considers:\n\n   dp[i][h][k] = maximum total prize we can get from the prefix A[0:i] (i digits processed) with h H's and m = i-h M's, and then we have to account for the fact that the remaining digits (if any) will be assigned to the players and will have fixed multipliers.\n\n However, the total prize is the sum of two numbers, and the multipliers for the digits depend on the entire assignment (how many more digits will be assigned to the same player).\n\n Another idea: since the entire assignment is fixed (we are going to assign each digit to either H or M) and the value of a digit assigned at a particular step depends on how many times the same player will be assigned in the future (to determine the power of 10).\n\n Specifically, for a digit at position i (0-indexed) that is assigned to H, its contribution is: digit * (10^(number of H's that will be assigned from i+1 to the end))\n\n Why? Because if we assign a digit to H, then the subsequent digits assigned to H will be placed to the right (lower significance). So the multiplier for the current digit is 10 raised to the number of H's that come after it (until the last H).\n\n Similarly, for M: digit * (10^(number of M's that come after it))\n\n Then the total prize is the sum over all digits of the above.\n\n However, note: the assignment must be such that we take the digits in order, and we have exactly n H's and n M's.\n\n Then we can write:\n\n   Let f(i, h, m) be the maximum total prize from the rest of the digits (from index i to 2n-1) given that we have already assigned h H's and m M's (so h+m = i, actually we start at i=0 and go to i=2n). But wait, we have processed i digits, so we have h H's and m M's.\n\n   Then, for the remaining part, we know that we will assign (n - h) H's and (n - m) M's.\n\n   But the multiplier for a digit at position i (if we assign it to H) is 10^( (n - h - 1) ) ? Not exactly: because the assignment of the remaining digits: if we assign the current digit to H, then the remaining (n-h-1) H's and (n-m) M's will be placed to the right, so the current digit is multiplied by 10^(remaining_H + remaining_M) ??? \n\n Actually, no: the entire number for H has n digits. If we assign a digit now to H, then the remaining n-h-1 digits for H (which will be assigned in the future) will be the next n-h-1 digits (from the rest of the string) that are assigned to H, and they will be placed to the right. Therefore, the current digit is multiplied by 10^(total_remaining_digits_in_H_after_this) = 10^(n-h-1) for the H part? \n\n But wait, the entire number for H is built by the digits assigned to H in the order of the string. The first digit assigned to H gets 10^(n-1), the second 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the contribution of each digit based on the entire assignment.\n\n However, note: the problem is that the assignment is fixed by the entire sequence. We can use backward DP: from the last digit to the first.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   dp[i][h][m] = the maximum total prize we can get from the substring starting at index i (so from i to the end) given that we have already assigned h H's and m M's (so we are going to assign n-h H's and n-m M's in the remaining part).\n\n But then the state would be (i, h, m) with i from 0 to 2n, h from 0 to n, m from 0 to n. The total states are 2n * (n+1) * (n+1) which is about 36*19*19 ~ 13000 states, which is acceptable for n<=18 (since 2n<=36, and n<=18, but note: n is the half, so 18, then 36*19*19 = 13000, and each state we do 2 transitions. So total operations about 26000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, the challenge is: how to compute the contribution of the current digit?\n\n Let's assume we are at position i (0-indexed, and we have processed i digits). Then we have:\n\n   remaining_H = n - h   (to be assigned in the future)\n   remaining_M = n - m\n\n Now, if we assign the current digit (A[i]) to H, then:\n\n   This digit will be the next H (so the (h+1)-th H). Therefore, its multiplier is 10^(remaining_H - 1) [because there will be (remaining_H - 1) more H's in the future, so it will be the most significant of the remaining_H digits]?\n\n Actually, the entire H number will have n digits. The digit we are assigning now will be placed at the (h+1)-th position (meaning it will be the (n - (h+1))-th most significant? Actually, no: the H number is built by the order of assignment. The first H is the first digit (most significant) and the last H is the least significant.\n\n The current H will be the (h+1)-th H. Then in the final H number, this digit will be at the (h+1)-th position (from the left). The total number of digits is n, so the power of 10 for this digit is 10^(n - (h+1)).\n\n Similarly, if we assign to M, then the digit will be placed at the (m+1)-th position of M, so its power is 10^(n - (m+1)).\n\n But wait, what about the rest of the digits? We haven't considered the entire future assignment. However, note that the rest of the digits (both for H and M) will be assigned arbitrarily, and they don't affect the current digit's multiplier? Actually, no: the current digit's multiplier is fixed by the fact that we know the total number of H's (n) and the fact that we are going to assign (h+1) H's so far (including this one). The rest of the H's (remaining_H-1) will be assigned in the future, so they are less significant.\n\n However, the above reasoning is correct for the current digit's contribution.\n\n But then, the total prize is the sum of the contributions from all digits. And the rest of the digits (future) will be handled by the DP.\n\n So, the recurrence:\n\n   dp[i][h][m] = maximum over:\n        Option1: assign A[i] to H -> then the contribution is: int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (h+1))) + dp[i+1][h+1][m]\n        Option2: assign A[i] to M -> then the contribution is: int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (m+1))) + dp[i+1][h][m+1]\n\n Base case:\n   When i == 2*n, we have processed all digits, then if h==n and m==n, then dp[2*n][n][n] = 0, otherwise it's invalid.\n\n However, note: we must assign exactly n H's and n M's. So when i=2*n, we must have h==n and m==n.\n\n But wait: the state (i, h, m) must satisfy h+m = i, because we are processing one digit at a time.\n\n Then we can also use h+m = i as a constraint. So we can drop one dimension: we can let state (i, h) and then m = i - h, and we require h <= n and i-h <= n (so h>= i-n and h<=n, and i-h>=0 and <=n).\n\n Then the state is (i, h) where i from 0 to 2n, h from max(0, i-n) to min(i, n).\n\n Then:\n\n   dp[i][h] = maximum total prize from the substring [i:2n] given that we have already assigned h H's (and m = i - h M's) in the first i digits.\n\n   Then, if we assign A[i] to H (if h < n):\n        new_h = h+1, then the contribution of this digit is: int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (h+1)))\n        Then dp[i][h] = max(dp[i][h], int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (h+1))) + dp[i+1][h+1])\n\n   Similarly, if we assign A[i] to M (if i-h < n, i.e., m < n):\n        contribution = int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (i-h)))   [because m+1 = (i-h)+1, and the exponent is n - (m+1) = n - (i-h+1)]\n        Then dp[i][h] = max(dp[i][h], int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (i-h+1))) + dp[i+1][h])\n\n   Base: when i == 2*n, then if h == n and i-h == n (which is 2n - h == n => h=n) then dp[2*n][n] = 0, else -infinity (or not defined).\n\n But note: the exponent for the current digit if we assign to M is n - (m+1) = n - ( (i-h) + 1 ). But note: the entire M number has n digits, so the first M (when m=0) is multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n However, wait: the multiplier for a digit assigned to M at the current step (which is the (m+1)-th M) is 10^(n - (m+1)), and m here is the current count of M's (before this assignment). But in our state, we have already assigned m = i-h M's (from the first i digits). Then if we assign this one (the (m+1)-th M) then the multiplier is 10^(n - (m+1)).\n\n But note: the state (i, h) implies m = i-h. So we can compute the multiplier for M as: 10**(n - ( (i-h) + 1 ))\n\n However, we must be cautious: the exponent is the number of digits that will be assigned to M after this one? Actually, no: the entire M number has n digits. The (m+1)-th M (so the one we are about to assign) is the (m+1)-th digit of M. Then the remaining M's (n - (m+1)) will be placed to the right, so the multiplier for the current M is 10^(n - (m+1)).\n\n But note: if we have already assigned m M's, then the current assignment (if we assign to M) becomes the (m+1)-th M, so the multiplier is 10^(n - (m+1)).\n\n Similarly for H: we have already assigned h H's, so the current assignment (if we assign to H) becomes the (h+1)-th H, so multiplier 10^(n - (h+1)).\n\n However, note: the entire H number has n digits. The (h+1)-th H is the (h+1)-th most significant digit. The power is then 10^(n - (h+1)).\n\n This matches.\n\n But wait: what if we assign the first digit to H? Then h=0, so multiplier is 10^(n-1). Correct.\n\n Example: n=2, A=\"1234\". Let's say we assign the first two digits to H and the last two to M.\n\n   Then H's digits: '1','2' -> number 12 (which is 1*10^1 + 2*10^0) -> correct.\n   Then M's digits: '3','4' -> number 34 (which is 3*10^1 + 4*10^0) -> correct.\n\n But according to our formula for the first digit (H): multiplier for '1' is 10^(2-1)=10, then for the second digit (H): multiplier is 10^(2-2)=1.\n\n Now, for the third digit (assigned to M): multiplier is 10^(2- (0+1)) because at the time of the third digit, the count of M's so far (from the first two digits) is 0, so for the first M (third digit) we use 10^(2-1)=10. Then the fourth digit (M): multiplier is 10^(2-2)=1.\n\n So the M number is 3*10 + 4 = 34.\n\n Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n   dp[i][h] = maximum total prize from the rest of the digits (from i to 2n-1) given that we have already assigned h H's (and i-h M's)\n\n   Then for the current digit (at index i) we have two choices:\n\n      if h < n:\n          option1 = int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (h+1))) + dp[i+1][h+1]\n      else:\n          skip\n\n      if (i-h) < n:   # because we cannot assign more than n M's\n          option2 = int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (i-h))) + dp[i+1][h]   # note: here we are using the current count of M's (which is i-h) to compute the multiplier for M: the next M (the (i-h+1)-th) will be at power 10^(n - (i-h+1))? Wait, no: the multiplier for M is 10^(n - (current_M_count+1)) = 10^(n - (i-h+1))\n\n   Then dp[i][h] = max(option1, option2) if both are available, otherwise the one that is available.\n\n But wait, in the M branch, the current state has h (and m = i-h). Then the next M will be the (m+1)-th, so the multiplier is 10^(n - (m+1)) = 10^(n - (i-h+1)).\n\n However, note: the state for the next step (i+1, h) has not changed the count of H's, but the count of M's is still i-h (because we are about to assign one more M). Actually, in the state definition, we are storing the total H's so far (h) and the rest (i-h) are M's. Then the next state for the M branch is (i+1, h) [same h] and the M count becomes i-h+1.\n\n But we don't store the M count explicitly, so we have to compute the multiplier for the M as 10^(n - ( (i-h) + 1 )).\n\n However, note: in the state (i, h), the total M's so far is i-h. Then if we assign to M, then the next state (i+1, h) has M's = i-h+1 (but we don't store that). But the multiplier for the current digit (if we choose M) is computed based on the current state: the next M (the (m+1)-th) is being assigned now, so multiplier = 10^(n - (m+1)) = 10^(n - (i-h+1)).\n\n But wait, the next state (i+1, h) will have the same h (so the same H count) and the M count increased by one. Then in the next state, the M count is i-h+1. However, we don't use the state's h to compute the M multiplier, we use the current state's m (which is i-h) to compute the multiplier for the current assignment.\n\n Then the recurrence is:\n\n   dp[i][h] = max(\n        (if h < n: int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (h+1))) + dp[i+1][h+1]),\n        (if i-h < n: int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (i-h+1))) + dp[i+1][h])\n   )\n\n But note: the state (i, h) requires that the M count (i-h) is at most n. Also, h must be at least 0 and at most n, and i-h must be at least 0 and at most n.\n\n We must iterate i from 2n-1 down to 0.\n\n However, the exponents: 10**(n - (h+1)): note that n can be up to 18, so the exponents can be as large as 10^18, which is a very big number. But the digits are only 2n (max 36) so the numbers S1 and S2 are up to 10^n - 1, and n<=18, so the maximum value is 10^18-1, which is a 19-digit number. In Python, integers can handle that.\n\n But wait: the entire prize is the sum of two numbers, each up to 10^n-1, so the total prize is up to 2*(10^n-1). For n=18, that is about 2e18, which is within the range of Python integers (since Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the exponentiation might be heavy?).\n\n However, we are doing 2n * (n+1) states, and each state we do two exponentiations (with exponents from 0 to n). The exponentiation 10**x for x from 0 to 18 is cheap because x is small.\n\n But note: we are computing the same exponents repeatedly. We can precompute a list of powers: pow10[k] = 10**k for k from 0 to n (actually we need exponents from 0 to n, but note: n is the maximum, and we use exponents from 1 to n (actually from 0 to n-1 for the most significant? Let me check: the first digit is multiplied by 10^(n-1). So the exponent we need is from 0 to n-1.\n\n Actually, for the first digit (if assigned to H) we use exponent n-1, then n-2, etc.\n\n So we need exponents from 0 to n-1.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n   Let power[x] = 10**x for x in range(0, n)   # but note: for the first digit we use exponent n-1, so we need exponents from 0 to n-1.\n\n But wait, in the recurrence for H: the exponent is n - (h+1). Since h can be from 0 to n-1, then the exponent ranges from n-1 (when h=0) to 0 (when h = n-1). Similarly for M: the exponent is n - (i-h+1). i-h is the current M count (from 0 to n-1) so the exponent for M is from n-1 (when i-h=0) to 0 (when i-h = n-1).\n\n Therefore, we need exponents from 0 to n-1.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Precompute a list `p` such that p[k] = 10**k for k in range(0, n)   [so k from 0 to n-1]\n\n   Then, for a state (i, h) for H: exponent = n - (h+1) must be in [0, n-1]. Since h from 0 to n-1, then n-(h+1) from n-1 down to 0.\n\n   Similarly for M: exponent = n - (i-h+1). Note: i-h is the current M count (from 0 to n-1). Then the exponent is from n-1 (if i-h=0) to 0 (if i-h=n-1).\n\n   But note: we must ensure that the exponent is nonnegative. Since h>=0, then n-(h+1) >= n-n = 0? Actually, when h=n-1, then exponent = n - (n) = 0. Similarly, for M: when i-h = n-1, then exponent = n - (n) = 0.\n\n   Also, we must check that the exponent is at most n-1. Indeed, when h=0, exponent = n-1, which is the maximum.\n\n   However, note: the exponent for H: n - (h+1) is between 0 and n-1, inclusive.\n\n   Similarly for M: n - (i-h+1) is between 0 and n-1.\n\n   But wait: i-h is the current M count (so from 0 to n-1). Then i-h+1 is from 1 to n, so n - (i-h+1) is from n-n=0 to n-1.\n\n   So we can use the precomputed `p` for these exponents.\n\n   Actually, we can map the exponent value to the power:\n\n        For H: exponent_index = n - (h+1)   -> then use p[exponent_index]?\n        But wait, we defined p[k] = 10**k for k in [0, n-1]. Then if exponent_index is 0, then p[0]=1, if exponent_index is 1, then 10, etc.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute an array for the multipliers for H and M at each state.\n\n   But note: the exponent for H is n - (h+1) = (n-1) - h, so we can have:\n\n        multiplier_H = 10**(n-1-h)   [if we use the exponent as (n-1-h)]\n\n   Similarly, for M: multiplier_M = 10**(n-1 - (i-h))   [because exponent_index = n - (i-h+1) = n-1 - (i-h)].\n\n   Then we can precompute:\n\n        For each h in [0, n]:\n            power_H[h] = 10**(n-1-h)   [if h < n, else 0? but h<n]\n\n        For each i, h (so m = i-h) we can compute:\n            power_M = 10**(n-1 - (i-h))   [if i-h < n, else 0]\n\n   But note: we are iterating i from 0 to 2n-1, and h from 0 to n, and we require that i-h <= n (so m<=n) and h<=n.\n\n   However, we can precompute:\n\n        p = [10**k for k in range(0, n)]   # p[0] = 1, p[1]=10, ... p[n-1]=10**(n-1)\n\n        Then for a state (i, h) for H: exponent_index = n-1-h, so multiplier_H = p[n-1-h]   (if h < n)\n\n        For M: exponent_index = n-1 - (i-h)   [because the exponent is n-1 - (i-h)].\n\n        Then multiplier_M = p[n-1 - (i-h)]\n\n   But wait, for M: the exponent is n - (i-h+1) = n-1 - (i-h). So yes.\n\n   Then the recurrence:\n\n        dp[i][h] = max(\n            (if h < n: int(A[i]) * p[n-1-h] + dp[i+1][h+1]),\n            (if i-h < n: int(A[i]) * p[n-1 - (i-h)] + dp[i+1][h])\n        )\n\n   However, note: the index for p: we have p[k] for k from 0 to n-1. Then n-1-h is in the range [0, n-1] (because h from 0 to n-1). Similarly, n-1 - (i-h) must be in [0, n-1]. But i-h is the current M count (from 0 to n-1) so n-1 - (i-h) is from 0 to n-1.\n\n   But note: we must ensure that i-h <= n-1, because if i-h==n, then we cannot assign M (since we already have n M's). However, in the condition for M we check i-h < n (so i-h from 0 to n-1).\n\n   Then the exponent for M: n-1 - (i-h) is from n-1 (if i-h=0) to 0 (if i-h=n-1). So it's valid.\n\n   Now, the DP table:\n\n        dp[i][h] for i in [0, 2n] and h in [0, n] (with h<=i and i-h<=n, and h<=n)\n\n        We'll iterate i from 2n-1 down to 0.\n\n        Base: dp[2*n][n] = 0, and for other states at i=2*n, we don't use.\n\n        Then for i from 2n-1 down to 0, and for h from max(0, i-n) to min(i, n):\n\n            Let m = i - h   (must be <= n, so h>=i-n)\n\n            Then, if h < n: candidate1 = int(A[i]) * p[n-1-h] + dp[i+1][h+1]\n            Then, if m < n (i.e., h > i-n): candidate2 = int(A[i]) * p[n-1 - m] + dp[i+1][h]\n\n            Then dp[i][h] = max(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n        Then the answer is dp[0][0].\n\n   However, we must output the sequence of moves (a string of 2n characters). We did the DP that computes the maximum total prize, but we don't record the moves.\n\n   So we need to reconstruct the moves.\n\n   We can use backtracking: from state (0,0) we choose the move (H or M) that led to the maximum total prize.\n\n   Then, we store not only the dp[i][h] value, but also the choice (whether we chose H or M) and the next state.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        dp[i][h] = (value, choice, next_state) but we don't need the entire next_state, we just need to remember the move.\n\n   Steps for reconstruction:\n\n        Start at i=0, h=0.\n\n        Then, if dp[0][0] came from candidate1 (H), then we output 'H' and then go to state (i=1, h=1). Otherwise, if from candidate2 (M), output 'M' and go to (i=1, h=0).\n\n        Then at each step, we know the current digit (A[i]) and the state (i, h) and we know the next state.\n\n   We can store:\n\n        dp[i][h] = (max_value, move)   where move is either 'H' or 'M'\n\n        But then we also need to know the next state's dp value, but we already computed the dp table.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store a separate table `choice[i][h]` which records the move chosen at state (i, h).\n\n   Then:\n\n        for i from 2n-1 down to 0, for h from max(0, i-n) to min(i, n):\n\n            candidate1 = -1 (invalid) and candidate2 = -1 (invalid)\n\n            if h < n:\n                candidate1 = int(A[i]) * p[n-1-h] + dp[i+1][h+1]\n            if (i-h) < n:\n                candidate2 = int(A[i]) * p[n-1 - (i-h)] + dp[i+1][h]\n\n            if candidate1 > candidate2 (if both exist) then dp[i][h] = candidate1 and choice[i][h] = 'H'\n            else if candidate2 > candidate1 then dp[i][h] = candidate2 and choice[i][h] = 'M'\n            But if one is invalid, then take the other",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from a given 2n-digit number. The first player picks the leftmost digit and appends it to their number, and this process repeats until all digits are picked. Each player must pick exactly n digits. The goal is to determine the sequence of moves (comprising 'H' and 'M') that maximizes the sum of the numerical values of both players' numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i][h]` represents the maximum total prize achievable from the substring starting at index `i` to the end, having already assigned `h` digits to Homer (and thus `i - h` digits to Marge). The state transitions consider whether the current digit should be assigned to Homer or Marge, updating the count of digits assigned accordingly.\n\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since the value of each digit depends on its position in the final number (more significant digits contribute more), we precompute powers of 10 up to \\(10^{n-1}\\) to efficiently calculate the contribution of each digit based on how many digits remain to be assigned to the same player.\n\n3. **State Transitions**: For each digit at position `i`, if assigning it to Homer is possible (i.e., Homer hasn't reached `n` digits yet), the digit's contribution is calculated as its value multiplied by \\(10^{(n-1-h)}\\), where `h` is the current count of Homer's digits. Similarly, if assigning to Marge is possible, the contribution is the digit's value multiplied by \\(10^{(n-1-(i-h))}\\).\n\n4. **Backtracking for Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the initial state `(0, 0)` to reconstruct the sequence of moves (either 'H' or 'M') that leads to the maximum total prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n_val = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    n = n_val\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n\n    p = [10**k for k in range(n)]\n    \n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(total_digits + 1)]\n    choice = [[''] * (n + 1) for _ in range(total_digits + 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(total_digits - 1, -1, -1):\n        for h in range(max(0, i - n), min(i + 1, n + 1)):\n            m = i - h\n            candidate1 = -1\n            candidate2 = -1\n            \n            if h < n:\n                exp_index = n - 1 - h\n                multiplier_H = p[exp_index]\n                num_digit = int(A_str[i])\n                candidate1 = num_digit * multiplier_H + dp[i+1][h+1]\n                \n            if m < n:\n                exp_index = n - 1 - m\n                multiplier_M = p[exp_index]\n                num_digit = int(A_str[i])\n                candidate2 = num_digit * multiplier_M + dp[i+1][h]\n            \n            if candidate1 == -1 and candidate2 == -1:\n                dp[i][h] = 0\n                continue\n                \n            if candidate1 > candidate2:\n                dp[i][h] = candidate1\n                choice[i][h] = 'H'\n            else:\n                dp[i][h] = candidate2\n                choice[i][h] = 'M'\n                \n    seq = []\n    i_pos = 0\n    h_count = 0\n    while i_pos < total_digits:\n        move_char = choice[i_pos][h_count]\n        seq.append(move_char)\n        if move_char == 'H':\n            h_count += 1\n        i_pos += 1\n        \n    result_str = ''.join(seq)\n    print(result_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (half the number of digits) and a string `A_str` of exactly `2n` digits.\n2. **Precompute Powers**: The array `p` stores \\(10^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to `n-1`, used to quickly compute the positional value of digits.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized to store the maximum prize from each state `(i, h)`, and `choice` records the optimal move ('H' or 'M') at each state.\n4. **Filling DP Table**: Starting from the end of the string, for each digit and possible count of Homer's digits (`h`), the algorithm calculates the best move (either assigning the digit to Homer or Marge) based on the precomputed powers and future states.\n5. **Reconstructing Moves**: Using backtracking from `(0, 0)`, the algorithm builds the sequence of moves by following the optimal choices stored in the `choice` table.\n6. **Output**: The resulting sequence of 'H' and 'M' characters is printed, representing the optimal moves for Homer and Marge to maximize their combined prize.",
