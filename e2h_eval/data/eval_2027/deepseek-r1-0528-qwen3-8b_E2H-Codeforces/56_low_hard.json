Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (each between 1 and 10) so we can use combinatorial methods.\n\n The problem is to check if there exists a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between R rebels (spaceships) and B bases such that:\n   - Each base gets one spaceship and each spaceship gets one base.\n   - The straight lines connecting the base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect (except at endpoints) in the plane.\n\n Note: It's guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three points are colinear.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since R and B are at most 10, we can consider generating all permutations of assignments? But note: we have R bases and B spaceships? Actually, wait:\n\n The input format: \n   First line: R, B\n   Then R lines for rebels (spaceships)\n   Then B lines for bases\n\n Conditions: \n   We need a perfect matching: so we require R == B? Actually, the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", meaning that we require a bijection. Therefore, we must have R == B.\n\n However, the example input: \n   Example 1: '3 3 ...' -> Yes\n   Example 2: '2 1 ...' -> No (because 2 != 1)\n\n So first, if R != B, then output 'No'.\n\n But note: the problem states that we have R spaceships and B bases. And the assignment requires that every base has one and every spaceship has one. This is only possible if R = B.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read R and B. If they are not equal, output 'No'.\n 2. Read the next R lines for the spaceships, and the next B lines for the bases.\n\n However, wait: the example input is given as a string that includes both examples. But the problem says:\n\n   Input: \n      The first line contains two integers R, B.\n\n   Then R+1 lines: the first R+1 lines? Actually, the example input is:\n\n        \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n\n   But note: the first line is \"3 3\", then 3 lines for rebels, then 3 lines for bases.\n\n   So the total number of points is R + B.\n\n 3. Since R and B are small (at most 10), we can try to generate all permutations of the bases (if R==B) and assign them to the rebels.\n\n However, note: we have R rebels and R bases (if R==B). Then we are looking for a permutation p of [0, ..., R-1] such that when we connect the i-th rebel to the p(i)-th base, the segments do not intersect.\n\n But how to check non-intersection of segments?\n\n Condition: any two segments (from a base to its rebel) do not intersect (except at endpoints).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect\". This means that if we draw all the segments, they should not cross.\n\n Important: In graph drawing, non-intersecting edges in a matching is a well-known problem. \n\n Observation: We have a set of 2R points (R rebels and R bases). We are to form R segments (each connecting one rebel to one base) such that no two segments share an endpoint (because it's a matching) and the segments do not cross.\n\n How can we check for crossing?\n\n We can consider: Two segments (A-B) and (C-D) (with A,C being rebels and B,D being bases) do not cross if the four points are in convex position and the segments are non-crossing. But note: the entire set of points might be in any configuration.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n   For a set of points, we can consider the planar graph of the matching. The condition is that the matching forms a non-crossing straight-line embedding.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the entire graph to be planar, but just that the edges (the segments) do not cross.\n\n There is a known fact: For a set of 2n points (n rebels and n bases) we can test for the existence of a non-crossing matching by trying all perfect matchings? But 10! is about 3.6 million, which is acceptable for n=10 (since 10! = 3628800) but wait, actually we have two sets: rebels and bases. We are matching rebels to bases, so we are considering a bipartite matching.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the matching to be bipartite in",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between R Rebel spaceships and B bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect in the plane. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the spaceships and bases to see if any permutation results in non-intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching (bijection) between R spaceships and B bases where R must equal B for a solution to exist. If R ≠ B, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n2. **Input Handling**: Read the coordinates of the spaceships and bases from the input.\n3. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of base indices (when R = B), check if the segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base in the permutation do not intersect with any other segments.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: Two segments AB and CD intersect if the points A, B, C, D are in convex position and the segments cross each other. This can be checked using the orientation method (cross product) to determine the relative positions of the points.\n5. **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting segments, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - B[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - B[0])\n\ndef do_segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    \n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n    \n    if o1 == 0 or o2 == 0 or o3 == 0 or o4 == 0:\n        return False\n        \n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    if not first_line:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        R = int(first_line[0])\n        B = int(first_line[1])\n    except:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    points = []\n    rebels = []\n    bases = []\n    \n    index = 1\n    for i in range(R):\n        coords = data[index].split()\n        index += 1\n        if len(coords) < 2:\n            continue\n        x = int(coords[0])\n        y = int(coords[1])\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    for i in range(B):\n        coords = data[index].split()\n        index += 1\n        if len(coords) < 2:\n            continue\n        x = int(coords[0])\n        y = int(coords[1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    if R == 0:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        return\n        \n    all_points = rebels + bases\n\n    def is_valid_permutation(perm):\n        used_bases = [False] * B\n        for i in range(R):\n            j = perm[i]\n            if used_bases[j]:\n                return False\n            used_bases[j] = True\n            \n        for i in range(R):\n            for k in range(i+1, R):\n                base_i = bases[perm[i]]\n                base_k = bases[perm[k]]\n                rebel_i = rebels[i]\n                rebel_k = rebels[k]\n                \n                if do_segments_intersect(rebel_i, base_i, rebel_k, base_k):\n                    return False\n                    \n        return True\n\n    permutations = list(itertools.permutations(range(B)))\n    \n    found = False\n    for perm in permutations:\n        if is_valid_permutation(perm):\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, parsing the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R ≠ B, the solution immediately outputs \"No\".\n2. **Handling Coordinates**: The coordinates of the spaceships and bases are stored in separate lists.\n3. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of base indices, the code checks if assigning each spaceship to a base in the permutation results in non-intersecting segments.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `do_segments_intersect` function uses the orientation method (cross product) to determine if two segments intersect. If any segment pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n5. **Result Output**: If any valid permutation is found, the code outputs \"Yes\"; otherwise, it outputs \"No\". This approach efficiently checks all possible matchings due to the small constraint (R and B ≤ 10).",
