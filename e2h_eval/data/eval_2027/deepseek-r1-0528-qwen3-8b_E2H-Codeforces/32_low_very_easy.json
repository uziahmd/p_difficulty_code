Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing an element from the array will remove either the minimum or the maximum (or both) from the current min and max.\n\n However, note that the instability is defined as (max - min). If we remove one element, the new min or max might change.\n\n Approach:\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. The idea is that we can consider removing one of the elements at the ends (the smallest or the largest) and then compute the instability of the remaining array.\n\n But note: sometimes the instability might not require removing an end? Actually, if we remove an element that is not the min or max, then the min and max of the array remain the same. Therefore, we only need to consider removals at the ends.\n\n However, what if there are duplicates? Example: [1, 3, 3, 7] -> if we remove a 3 in the middle, the min and max remain 1 and 7, so instability remains 6. But if we remove the first 1, then the array becomes [3,3,7] -> instability 4; if we remove the last 7, then [1,3,3] -> instability 2; if we remove a middle 3, then [1,3,7] -> instability 6. So indeed, we must consider the effect of removing the first or last element.\n\n However, note: the array is sorted. The minimum is the first element and the maximum is the last.\n\n Let's denote:\n   sorted_a = sorted(a)\n\n Then, we can consider two types of removals:\n   Type 1: Remove the smallest element (at index0). Then the new array is from index1 to end. The instability is sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1].\n   Type 2: Remove the largest element (at index n-1). Then the new array is from index0 to index n-2. The instability is sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0].\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is the smallest but not the only one? Then the next smallest might be the same? Actually, the above Type 1 still holds because the new min is the second smallest (which is at index1). Similarly for Type 2.\n\n However, consider an array with more than two distinct numbers. We must consider that sometimes the best removal is one of the ends, but also note that the array might have multiple copies of the min and max. \n\n Actually, the above two cases are sufficient because:\n\n   Case 1: Removing the global minimum (if there are multiple min, then removing one of them might leave the same min, unless we remove all? But we only remove one. So if there are multiple min, then the new min is the next distinct value? Not necessarily: the array after removal might still have the same min if there's another copy of the min.\n\n   However, observe: \n     In Type 1: we remove the first occurrence of the minimum. Then the new array has the next smallest element (which could be the same as the old min if duplicates exist). But note: the instability is defined as max - min. The min of the new array is the smallest element that is left. Since we removed one occurrence of the min, if there was more than one min, then the min remains the same. So actually, the instability after removal of a min element is:\n        If there are duplicates of the min, then the min doesn't change, and the max might change if we remove the max? No, we are only removing one element. So if we remove a min that has duplicates, the min remains the same and the max remains the same -> instability same as before? But wait, we are allowed to remove one element arbitrarily. \n\n   However, note: we are trying to minimize the instability. Removing an element that is the min but not the only min might not help. Actually, let's break down:\n\n   We have two candidate removals: remove an element from the left end (which is the min) or from the right end (which is the max). But note: the array might have multiple mins and multiple maxes.\n\n   Actually, the above two cases (removing the first element or the last element) are the two extremes. But note: we don't necessarily have to remove the very first occurrence of the min? We can remove any occurrence. However, if we remove a min that is not the first, then the first element (min) remains, and the new min is the same as before. Similarly, if we remove a max that is not the last, the last element (max) remains.\n\n   Therefore, to minimize the instability, we should consider the possibility that by removing an element we might reduce the range. The range is determined by the overall min and max. The only way to reduce the range is to remove either the current min",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in easily identifying the current minimum and maximum elements.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: After sorting, the first element is the smallest, and the last element is the largest. Removing either of these can potentially reduce the instability.\n3. **Calculate Instability for Each Case**: \n   - **Removing the Minimum Element**: The new minimum becomes the second element in the sorted array, and the maximum remains the last element. The instability is then calculated as the difference between the last and second elements.\n   - **Removing the Maximum Element**: The new maximum becomes the second last element, and the minimum remains the first element. The instability here is the difference between the second last and first elements.\n4. **Choose the Minimum Instability**: Compare the instabilities from both cases and select the smaller value, which will be the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)\n    candidate1 = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[1]\n    candidate2 = sorted_arr[-2] - sorted_arr[0]\n    \n    result = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only two elements, removing either will result in a single-element array with zero instability.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n4. **Instability Calculation**: Two scenarios are considered:\n   - **Removing the Smallest Element**: The instability is the difference between the largest element and the next smallest element (second element in the sorted array).\n   - **Removing the Largest Element**: The instability is the difference between the next largest element (second last element) and the smallest element.\n5. **Result Selection**: The minimum value between the two calculated instabilities is chosen and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to considering only the most impactful removals (either the smallest or the largest element), leveraging sorting to simplify the identification of these elements and their effects on the overall instability. The solution handles all edge cases, including arrays with duplicate values, by focusing on the extremes of the sorted array.",
