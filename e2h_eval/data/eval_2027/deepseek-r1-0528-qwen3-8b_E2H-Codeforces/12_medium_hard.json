The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are moving in a circular ring road (clockwise) with n houses.\n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each requiring to be at house a_i (with the condition that we must complete tasks in order).\n\n Since the ringroad is circular and one-way (clockwise), moving from house i to house j:\n   If j >= i: then the distance is (j - i)\n   If j < i: then we can go clockwise: (n - i + j)\n\n However, note that we might do multiple consecutive tasks in the same house, so we don't need to move if two consecutive tasks are at the same house.\n\n But the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" for the i-th task. This means we process the tasks in order.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We start at house 1.\n 2. Then we go to the first task's house (a0). The time to get there is the clockwise distance from 1 to a0.\n 3. Then from a0, we go to the next task's house (a1). The time to get there is the clockwise distance from a0 to a1.\n\n However, note: the ring is circular, so sometimes going backwards is equivalent to going forward via the circle.\n\n Example: n=4, tasks [3, 2, 3]\n\n Steps:\n   Start at 1 -> 3: \n        Since 3>=1: distance = 3-1 = 2\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        Now, 2<3 so we can either go backward (which is allowed because of circularity) or forward? \n        But note: the movement is only clockwise. So from 3, to go to 2 we must go: 3->4->1->2. That is 3 steps?\n        Alternatively, we can break the journey: \n            Option1: from 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (1 step) and then 1 to 2 (1 step) -> total 3 steps.\n        But wait, the example output says total time is 6.\n\n        Let's break down the example:\n\n        The example says: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3.\n\n        Actually, the example does not go from 1 to 3 directly. Why?\n\n        Note: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\", and then she has tasks.\n\n        The example input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n        Steps according to the example: \n          1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3\n\n        But wait, why not 1->3 (which is two steps)? \n\n        However, note the problem says: the ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order, and traffic is one-way (clockwise). \n\n        But also note: the example output is 6. \n\n        Let me recalculate:\n\n        The example sequence of moves: \n          1 to 2: 1 step\n          2 to 3: 1 step\n          3 to 4: 1 step\n          4 to 1: 1 step (because the ring is circular: from 4 you can go to 1 by the next clockwise, which is 1)\n          1 to 2: 1 step\n          2 to 3: 1 step\n\n        Total steps: 6.\n\n        So what is the rule? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require to take the shortest path. The movement is only allowed clockwise. Therefore, from house i to house j:\n\n        If j >= i: then we move (j - i) steps.\n        If j < i: then we move (n - i + j) steps.\n\n        For example, from 3 to 2: since 2<3, we move (4-3+2)= 3 steps.\n\n        But wait, the example sequence doesn't use the direct way from 3 to 2? Why did they use 3->4->1->2?\n\n        That is exactly the long way because we cannot go counterclockwise. So the rule is: only clockwise moves.\n\n        So the distance from 3 to 2 is 3 (steps): 3->4 (step1), 4->1 (step2), 1->2 (step3). Then from 2 to 3: 3-2=1 step.\n\n        However, note the example input has three tasks: [3,2,3]. So the movements:\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Task1: go to 3 -> 2 steps (1->2->3).\n        Then from 3 to 2: 3 steps (3->4->1->2).\n        Then from 2 to 3: 1 step (2->3).\n\n        Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n        Another example: Input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n        How?\n\n        Tasks: [2,3,3]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 2 -> distance: 2-1 = 1 step.\n        Second task: 3 -> from 2: 3-2 = 1 step.\n        Third task: 3 -> no move (since same as previous).\n\n        Total: 1+1 = 2.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n        We start at position = 1.\n        total_time = 0\n\n        For each task location a_i (for i from 0 to m-1):\n          Let current = position (initially 1)\n          Let target = a_i\n\n          Compute the clockwise distance from current to target:\n\n          if target >= current:\n              distance = target - current\n          else:\n              distance = n - current + target\n\n          Then update total_time += distance\n          Then update current = target (because after completing the task, we are at that house)\n\n        However, note: the problem states that we must complete tasks in order, but consecutive tasks might be the same. \n\n        Example: [2, 2] -> from 1 to 2: 1 step, then from 2 to 2: 0 steps.\n\n        But wait: the example input may have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n        But the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" for the i-th task. This implies that we do tasks in increasing index order, and we are allowed to have same house repeated.\n\n        However, the above algorithm would work because when the next target equals the current, the distance is 0.\n\n        But let's test the first example with the algorithm:\n\n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n        current = 1\n        task1: 3 -> since 3>=1 -> distance = 3-1 = 2; current becomes 3; total_time=2.\n        task2: 2 -> since 2<3 -> distance = 4-3+2 = 3; current becomes 2; total_time=5.\n        task3: 3 -> since 3>2 -> distance = 3-2=1; current becomes 3; total_time=6.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, consider if we have a different order: [3,4,2] for n=4.\n\n        Start at 1.\n        task1: 3 -> 3-1=2 -> total_time=2, current=3.\n        task2: 4 -> 4>=3 -> 4-3=1 -> total_time=3, current=4.\n        task3: 2 -> 2<4 -> distance = 4-4+2 = 2? Actually, wait: the formula for target < current is (n - current + target). \n                Here, current=4, target=2: (4-4+2)=2. But actually, from 4 to 2: we go 4->1 (1 step) then 1->2 (another step) -> 2 steps. Correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can also think of it as: from 4, we have to go 4->1 (1) and then 1->2 (1) -> total 2.\n\n        But note: the problem says we can only move clockwise. So from 4, the next house is 1 (because the ringroad is circular). Then 1 to 2.\n\n        However, the example [3,4,2] gives 2+1+2 = 5.\n\n        Let me simulate the entire movement:\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Move to 3: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n        Then to 4: 3->4 (1 step)\n        Then to 2: 4->1->2 (2 steps)\n\n        Total: 2+1+2 = 5.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives 2. So our algorithm is:\n\n        Read n, m.\n        Read list a of m integers.\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for each task in a:\n            if task >= current:\n                distance = task - current\n            else:\n                distance = n - current + task   # But wait, is this correct?\n\n        Let me check the case when current=4, task=2, n=4: \n            distance = 4 - 4 + 2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if current is 4 and task=1? \n            task=1 < current=4 -> distance = 4-4+1 = 1. \n            Indeed, from 4 to 1: 4->1 (1 step) -> correct.\n\n        What if current=2, task=4, n=5?\n            task>=current -> 4>=2 -> distance=2 -> correct.\n\n        What if current=5, task=3, n=5?\n            task=3 < current=5 -> distance=5-5+3=3. \n            Path: 5->1 (1 step), 1->2 (2nd step), 2->3 (3rd step) -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the ringroad has n houses. The houses are 1,2,...,n. And the movement is clockwise.\n\n        But wait, there's another way to compute the distance: \n            We can also compute the distance as (task - current) % n, but modulo might give negative.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            distance = (task - current) % n   # but then if (task - current) is negative, modulo n will give a positive, but wait:\n\n            Example: current=3, task=2, n=4: \n                (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> but wait, 3 is the same as our calculation above (n-3+2=3). \n\n            But wait, (task - current) % n is not the same as our formula for the clockwise distance. Actually, the clockwise distance from current to task is:\n\n            If we define: \n                distance = (task - current) % n   -> but that gives the minimal nonnegative residue modulo n, but note that the minimal residue is not the clockwise distance if we are forced to go only clockwise.\n\n            Actually, the clockwise distance from current to task is:\n\n                if task >= current: (task - current)\n                else: (n - current + task)\n\n            Alternatively, we can write: (task - current + n) % n, but wait:\n\n            Example: current=3, task=2, n=4: (2-3+4) %4 = 3 %4 = 3 -> correct.\n\n            Example: current=1, task=3, n=4: (3-1+4)%4 = 6%4=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example: current=4, task=1, n=4: (1-4+4)%4 = 1%4=1 -> correct.\n\n            Example: current=2, task=4, n=5: (4-2+5)%5 = 7%5=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example: current=5, task=3, n=5: (3-5+5)%5 = 3%5=3 -> correct.\n\n            But wait, what if the distance is more than n? Actually, the modulo operation ensures we get a value between 0 and n-1, but note: we are moving in a circle, so the minimal clockwise distance is indeed (task - current) mod n, but wait: \n\n            In modular arithmetic, the clockwise distance from current to task is defined as (task - current) mod n, but with the understanding that if the result is negative we add n until positive. However, note:\n\n            The standard formula for clockwise distance (if we are on a circle of n nodes, and we can only move clockwise) is:\n\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                if d == 0: then 0\n                else: d   # but wait, if task==current, then d=0, which is correct.\n\n            But wait: in the example above, (task - current) % n gives the minimal positive equivalent. However, the clockwise distance should be the smallest nonnegative integer such that (current + d) mod n = task mod n, and we are constrained to move only clockwise.\n\n            However, note: the movement is only clockwise, so we cannot jump over the houses. The above formula (task - current) % n does not necessarily give the clockwise distance if we are forced to move without wrapping around? Actually, no: because the modulus operation doesn't account for the fact that we can wrap around.\n\n            But wait, the modulus operation in this context is defined as:\n\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                However, if task < current, then (task - current) is negative, and (task - current) % n is n + (task - current) (if we use the mathematical definition of modulus for negative numbers) but in Python, the modulus is nonnegative and less than n.\n\n            Actually, in Python, (a % n) is always in [0, n-1]. \n\n            Let me compute:\n\n            (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3 (in Python) -> which is the same as our formula.\n\n            So we can simply do:\n\n            distance = (task - current) % n\n\n            But wait: if task==current, then (0 % n)=0 -> correct.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation might give 0 even if we don't move, which is correct.\n\n            But is that always the clockwise distance?\n\n            Consider: current=3, task=5, n=4: \n                (5-3) %4 = 2 %4 = 2 -> correct (clockwise from 3: 3->4->1->2->3->4->5? Wait, no: n=4, so houses are 1,2,3,4. There is no house 5. \n\n            So the input task is between 1 and n. Therefore, we don't have to worry about numbers beyond n.\n\n            However, wait: the modulus approach: \n\n            We want the clockwise distance from current to task. In a circle of n houses, the clockwise distance from current to task is:\n\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                but if the result is 0, then we are at the same house, so 0.\n                However, if the result is positive, that is the distance.\n\n            But wait, in the example: current=3, task=5, n=4 -> wait, task must be between 1 and n, so task=5 is invalid for n=4. \n\n            The problem states: \"1 ≤ ai ≤ n\". So we are safe.\n\n            However, let's try with n=4, current=3, task=1: \n                (1-3) %4 = (-2)%4 = 2. \n                But wait, from 3 to 1: clockwise: 3->4->1 -> 2 steps. Correct.\n\n            Another: current=3, task=2: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> 3 steps: 3->4->1->2. Correct.\n\n            But wait: is there a better way? \n\n            The modulus method is giving the same result as the if-else method.\n\n            However, note: the modulus method is simpler. \n\n            But wait, what if we have current=1, task=1: 0, correct.\n\n            So we can write:\n\n            distance = (task - current) % n\n            But wait: if task==current, then 0. But also, if task>current, then (task-current) % n = task-current (if task-current < n) which is correct.\n\n            However, note: (task - current) might be negative. The modulus handles that.\n\n            But wait, the modulus operation for negative in Python: \n                a % n = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n            Example: (2-3)%4: floor(-1/4) is -1 (because floor rounds towards -infinity) so -1 %4 = -1 -4*(-1) = -1+4=3.\n\n            So yes, it works.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation might be slower than an if-else? But m and n up to 10^5, so modulus is O(1). But we have m steps, so 10^5 modulus operations is acceptable.\n\n            But wait: there's a catch. The modulus operation in the way we did:\n\n            We want the clockwise distance, which is the same as (task - current) mod n, but note: if (task - current) is negative, we add n until positive? Actually, the modulus does that.\n\n            However, the problem is: the modulus operation gives a value in [0, n-1]. But note that the distance from current to task in the clockwise direction should be the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) mod n = task mod n. \n\n            But wait, in our circular numbering, the houses are 1-indexed. The modulus operation is defined on the integers, but our houses are 1..n. \n\n            However, note: the movement is defined on the circle. The circle has n houses. The clockwise distance from current to task is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) mod n = task mod n, but note that we are not using 0-indexed.\n\n            Actually, we can map the houses to 0-indexed to make modulus easier? \n\n            Alternatively, we can note that the distance is:\n\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                if d == 0 and task != current: ... but wait, task is in [1, n] and current is in [1, n] (and we update current to be a task, so also in [1, n]), and if task==current then d=0.\n\n            However, wait: (task - current) % n might be 0 even when task != current? \n\n            Example: n=4, current=1, task=5 -> but task=5 is invalid (n=4, so task<=4). \n\n            So we are safe.\n\n            But wait: what if n=4, current=2, task=6? Again, task must be in [1,4]. So no.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation is defined for any integers. But our task and current are in [1, n]. \n\n            But wait, what if n=4, current=1, task=5? It's invalid because task=5 is not in [1,4]. \n\n            Therefore, we can use:\n\n            distance = (task - current) % n\n\n            However, wait: what if task - current is negative and the modulus gives a positive, but is that the clockwise distance?\n\n            Yes, because in a circle, the clockwise distance from current to task is the same as the modulus result.\n\n            But wait: consider n=5, current=5, task=3.\n\n            (3-5)%5 = (-2)%5 = 3 (in Python). \n            Clockwise from 5: 5->1->2->3 (3 steps). Correct.\n\n            Another: n=5, current=3, task=5.\n            (5-3)%5 = 2 -> 3->4->5 (2 steps). Correct.\n\n            So we can use modulus.\n\n            However, wait: the modulus operation gives the same result as the if-else? \n\n            We can verify with the first example: [3,2,3] for n=4.\n\n            Step1: current=1, task=3 -> (3-1)%4=2 -> 2 steps.\n            Step2: current=3, task=2 -> (2-3)%4= (-1)%4=3 -> 3 steps.\n            Step3: current=2, task=3 -> (3-2)%4=1 -> 1 step.\n\n            Total=6.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n\n            for task in a:\n                # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to task\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                # But wait, if d==0, then we are already at the task? \n                # However, if current==task, then (task - current)=0, then d=0, which is correct.\n\n                total_time += d\n                current = task\n\n            However, wait: is d the clockwise distance? \n\n            In our examples, yes. \n\n            But wait: what if we have n=4, current=4, task=1: \n                d = (1-4)%4 = (-3)%4 = 1 (because -3 + 4 = 1) -> so 1 step. Correct.\n\n            But wait, let me reexamine: from 4 to 1, we move 1 step (clockwise: 4->1). Correct.\n\n            However, note: the modulus operation in the way we did is the same as:\n\n                d = (task - current) % n\n\n            But wait, in modular arithmetic, the clockwise distance in a circle of n houses (with houses labeled 1..n) is not exactly the modulus of (task - current) by n? \n\n            Actually, we have to note that the modulus operation we are doing is on the linear difference, but the circle is of size n. \n\n            But the problem: the ringroad has n houses. The distance from current to task is:\n\n                d = (task - current) if task>=current, else (task - current + n)\n\n            Which is the same as (task - current) % n if we define the modulus for negative appropriately? \n\n            Actually, the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n\n                (a % n) = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n            But note: the clockwise distance should be the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) ≡ task (mod n) and d is in [0, n-1]. \n\n            However, the modulus operation gives exactly that: the smallest nonnegative residue.\n\n            But wait, what if we use 0-indexed? \n\n            Let me map the houses: subtract 1 so that houses become 0 to n-1.\n\n            Then the clockwise distance from current (0-indexed) to task (0-indexed) is:\n\n                d = (task - current) % n   [but now the modulus is for the circle of n nodes, and the distance is the same]\n\n            However, we don't need to change the indexing because the modulus operation in Python for integers is defined as above.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation in the 1-indexed system is the same as in the 0-indexed system? \n\n            Example: current=1 (which is 0-indexed 0), task=3 (0-indexed 2): \n                d = (3-1) %4 = 2 %4=2 -> in 0-indexed, we are at 0 and want to go to 2: clockwise: 0->1->2, so 2 steps. Correct.\n\n            Example: current=3 (0-indexed 2), task=2 (0-indexed 1): \n                d = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> in 0-indexed: from 2 to 1: clockwise: 2->3->0->1 (3 steps). Correct.\n\n            Example: current=4 (0-indexed 3), task=1 (0-indexed 0): \n                d = (1-4)%4 = (-3)%4=1 -> in 0-indexed: from 3 to 0: clockwise: 3->0 (1 step). Correct.\n\n            So the modulus method works.\n\n            However, wait: the modulus method gives the same result as the if-else method.\n\n            But note: the modulus method does not require an if-else, so the code becomes:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total = 0\n\n            for task in a:\n                # Compute the clockwise distance from current to task\n                # Using modulus: d = (task - current) % n\n                # But wait: what if (task - current) is negative? modulus handles it.\n\n                d = (task - current) % n\n                # However, note: if task - current is negative, then (task - current) % n = n + (task - current) (if we think in terms of making it positive) but that is the same as our else branch.\n\n                total += d\n                current = task\n\n            print(total)\n\n            But wait, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n            Example1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n                n=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\n                Start: current=1, total=0\n                task=3: d=(3-1)%4=2 -> total=2, current=3\n                task=2: d=(2-3)%4= (-1)%4=3 -> total=5, current=2\n                task=3: d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total=6, current=3\n\n                Output 6 -> correct.\n\n            Example2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n                n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]\n\n                Start: current=1, total=0\n                task=2: d=(2-1)%4=1 -> total=1, current=2\n                task=3: d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total=2, current=3\n                task=3: d=(3-3)%4=0 -> total=2, current=3\n\n                Output 2 -> correct.\n\n            But wait: what if we have a task that is the same as the current? Then d=0, which is correct.\n\n            However, wait: the modulus operation: (task - current) % n, when task==current, gives 0. Correct.\n\n            But wait: is there a case where the modulus operation gives 0 but the distance is not 0? \n\n            Only if (task - current) is divisible by n, but since |task - current| < n (because both are in [1, n]), the only way (task - current) % n ==0 is when task==current.\n\n            So the modulus method is safe.\n\n            However, wait: what if n=1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n            But wait: the modulus operation might be more expensive? But for 10^5 operations, modulus is O(1) and fast enough.\n\n            Let me run a worst-case scenario: 10^5 tasks, and each modulus operation is O(1). This is acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, we can use the modulus method.\n\n            However, wait: there is a caveat. The modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is well-defined, but note:\n\n            The formula: (task - current) % n\n\n            But note: if task - current is negative, then (task - current) % n = n + (task - current) only if the absolute value of (task - current) is less than n? Actually, no: the modulus operation in Python is defined for any integer, and the result is in [0, n-1]. \n\n            However, we know that the absolute difference between task and current is at most n-1 (because they are in [1, n]). \n\n            So (task - current) is in the range [-(n-1), n-1]. Therefore, (task - current) % n is in [0, n-1].\n\n            But wait: if (task - current) is negative, then (task - current) % n = n + (task - current) (if we consider the mathematical definition for positive modulus). \n\n            Example: task=1, current=2, n=4: (1-2)=-1, then (-1)%4=3, which is n + (task - current) = 4 + (-1)=3. Correct.\n\n            So the modulus method is the same as our original if-else.\n\n            Therefore, we can use modulus.\n\n            But wait: let me test with the example [3,4,2] for n=4.\n\n            Start: current=1, total=0\n            task=3: (3-1)%4=2 -> total=2, current=3\n            task=4: (4-3)%4=1 -> total=3, current=4\n            task=2: (2-4)%4= (-2)%4=2 -> total=5, current=2\n\n            Output 5, which matches our earlier simulation.\n\n            However, note: the example input was given as two examples: \n                Input1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> Output1: 6\n                Input2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> Output2: 2\n\n            So the code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            cur = 1\n            ans = 0\n            for x in arr:\n                # Compute the distance from cur to x in a circle of n houses (clockwise only)\n                diff = x - cur\n                if diff < 0:\n                    diff += n   # Now diff becomes positive, but note: we can also use modulus. But modulus does the same.\n\n                # Actually, we can avoid the if by using modulus, but modulus is one line.\n\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n                #   d = (x - cur) % n\n                # But wait, modulus does the same.\n\n                # However, note: if x>=cur, then (x-cur) is positive and (x-cur)%n = x-cur (if x-cur < n, which it is because x<=n and cur>=1, so x-cur <= n-1).\n                # But wait, if x-cur is exactly n? Then (x-cur)%n==0, but x-cur cannot be n because x<=n and cur>=1, so maximum x-cur is n-1.\n\n                # Therefore, we can use modulus safely.\n\n                # But wait, what if x=5 and n=4? Then x>n, but the input guarantees x in [1, n]. So we are safe.\n\n                # So we can use modulus.\n\n                # However, note: the modulus operation is a bit more general and handles negative, so we stick with modulus.\n\n                d = (x - cur) % n\n                ans += d\n                cur = x\n\n            print(ans)\n\n            But wait: what if we have the same house consecutively? \n\n            Example: [1,1,1] for n=4.\n\n            Start at 1.\n            task1: (1-1)%4=0 -> total=0, current=1.\n            task2: (1-1)%4=0 -> total=0, current=1.\n            task3: 0 -> total=0.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            But wait: what if we have [4,1,2] for n=4?\n\n            Start: current=1\n            task4: (4-1)%4=3 -> total=3, current=4.\n            task1: (1-4)%4=(-3)%4=1 -> total=4, current=1.\n            task2: (2-1)%4=1 -> total=5.\n\n            Simulation: \n                Start at 1.\n                To 4: 1->2->3->4 (3 steps)\n                Then from 4 to 1: 4->1 (1 step)\n                Then from 1 to 2: 1->2 (1 step)\n                Total: 3+1+1=5.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            However, wait: the example [4,1,2] is valid.\n\n            But wait: the example input format: \n                The first line: \"4 3\"\n                The second line: \"4 1 2\"\n\n            But wait, the example input in the problem statement was given as strings, but we are reading integers.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for t in tasks:\n                # Compute clockwise distance from current to t\n                d = (t - current) % n\n                # However, wait: is that the correct clockwise distance? \n                # In the example [4,1,2]: \n                #   From 1 to 4: d = (4-1)%4=3 -> correct.\n                #   From 4 to 1: d = (1-4)%4=1 -> correct (because from 4, clockwise: 4->1 is 1 step).\n                #   From 1 to 2: d = (2-1)%4=1 -> correct.\n\n                total_time += d\n                current = t\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n            But wait: what if n=10**5, and we have 10**5 tasks? The modulus operation is O(1) so it's acceptable.\n\n            However, wait: there's a potential issue: the modulus operation for very large numbers? But n is up to 10^5, and the numbers are within [1,10^5], so the subtraction is at most 10^5, and modulus by 10^5 is cheap.\n\n            Let me test with n=10**5, and m=10**5, and the worst-case: alternating between 1 and n.\n\n            Example: [1, n, 1, n, ...] for 10**5 times.\n\n            Each step: \n                from 1 to n: d = (n-1) % n = n-1 (because n-1 < n) -> n-1\n                from n to 1: d = (1-n) % n = (1-n+n) % n? Actually, (1-n) % n = (1-n) + n*ceil((n-1)/n)? Let me compute:\n\n                In Python: (1-n) % n = 1-n+n = 1? Because (1-n) % n = (1-n) + n * ceil((n-1)/n) ? \n\n                Actually, let's break down: \n                    (a % n) = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n                For a=1-n, and n=10**5, floor((1-n)/n) = floor(-99999/100000) = floor(-0.99999) = -1 (since floor rounds towards -inf)\n\n                Then (1-n) % n = (1-n) - 100000*(-1) = 1-n+100000 = 1 - 100000 + 100000 = 1.\n\n                So from n to 1: 1 step.\n\n                Then from 1 to n: n-1 steps.\n\n                So one cycle (two tasks) takes (n-1)+1 = n steps.\n\n                Then 10**5 tasks (which is 50000 cycles) would take 50000 * n = 50000 * 100000 = 5e9, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n                But wait, 5e9 is the total_time, and we are just adding integers. The problem says to print a single integer, and 5e9 is within the range of Python integers.\n\n                However, the problem constraints say that m and n can be up to 10^5, and the total_time might be as large as 10^10 (if each step is 10^5, then 10^5 steps * 10^5 = 10^10, which is acceptable in Python because integers are arbitrary precision, but we must be cautious of performance.\n\n                But 10^10 is 10 billion, which is acceptable to store in an integer and print.\n\n            However, wait: the modulus operation is done 10^5 times, and each modulus operation is O(1). So the whole program runs in O(m).\n\n            Therefore, we can submit.\n\n            But wait: let me compare with the if-else version for clarity:\n\n            n, m",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ring road with clockwise movement only. The key insight is that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order, moving only clockwise between houses. The movement from one house to another is calculated based on the circular nature of the ring road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must visit a sequence of houses specified by the task list. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction, so the distance between two houses is calculated considering the circular arrangement. For example, moving from house 3 to house 2 in a 4-house ring requires passing through houses 4 and 1, totaling 3 steps.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves iterating through each task in sequence, calculating the clockwise distance from the current position to the next task's house. The total time is the sum of these distances.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance using modulo arithmetic. This efficiently handles both cases where the next house is ahead or behind the current position in the circular arrangement.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, performing constant-time operations (modulo and addition) for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(m), where m is the number of tasks, which is optimal given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor t in tasks:\n    d = (t - current) % n\n    total_time += d\n    current = t\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. Then read the list of task locations.\n2. **Tracking Position and Time**: Start from house 1 (`current = 1`) and initialize `total_time` to 0.\n3. **Processing Each Task**: For each task location `t`:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: Compute the clockwise distance from `current` to `t` using `(t - current) % n`. This formula accounts for both cases where `t` is ahead or behind `current` in the circular arrangement.\n   - **Update Total Time and Position**: Add the computed distance to `total_time` and update `current` to `t`.\n4. **Output**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated `total_time`.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring road, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
