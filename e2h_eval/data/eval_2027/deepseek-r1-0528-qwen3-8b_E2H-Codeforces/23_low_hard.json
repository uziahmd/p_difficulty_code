In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'. But note: the input is given as three separate strings in one line? Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", meaning we have one line with three space-separated strings? Or three tokens?\n\n Example input: \n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, actually the example input is shown as three separate examples. The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — but each string is a tile? Or each string is a representation of three tiles?\n\n Let me read again: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input description: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n However, note the example input is given as three examples, but the actual input format is: one line with three strings? Or one line with three tiles (each tile being a two-character string) but that would be 6 characters? Or is it one line with three two-character strings separated by spaces?\n\n Actually, the example input is shown as:\n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, this is just an example of three test cases. The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n Clarification from typical problems: In many problems, when they say \"the first line has three integers\" they mean one line with three numbers (like \"1 2 3\"). Similarly, here the input is one line with three strings, each string representing a tile? Or three tiles (so six characters)?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"three strings\", and each tile is represented by two characters. But if we have three tiles, then the entire input would be 6 characters? Or the input is three strings, each being a tile?\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n But wait, the example output for the first example is 0, so the hand is [1s, 2s, 3s] which is a shuntsu.\n\n However, the example input is written as: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing. Let me look again at the problem statement:\n\n   Input: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n And then the example output is given as three separate answers: 0, 0, 1.\n\n So the problem expects multiple test cases? Or is there only one test case per run?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line\", meaning one line of input. But the example input shows three different examples. \n\n I think the example input was provided to show three examples, but in the actual problem, we have one test case per run.\n\n Therefore, the input will be one line with three two-character strings (tiles). But wait, three two-character strings would be 6 characters? Or one string containing three two-character strings separated by spaces?\n\n Let's read the example: \n   Example 1: Input is three tiles: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\". How is that given? Probably as \"1s2s3s\" without spaces? Or with spaces?\n\n But the problem says: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n And then: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n So, the input is one line with three strings. Each string is one tile? Then the line would have three two-character strings separated by spaces.\n\n Example: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n So we can split the input line by space to get three two-character tokens.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the input line and split it into three parts (each part is two characters).\n\n 2. We have three tiles.\n\n 3. We need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we can form at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu) in the hand.\n\n Note: After drawing, the hand may have more than three tiles, but we only need one mentsu (three tiles) anywhere in the hand.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand\". So even if she draws one tile, then the hand has four tiles. But we don't require the entire hand to be a mentsu, just that there is at least one mentsu (three tiles) in",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking if the current hand of three tiles can form a mentsu either immediately or with the fewest additional tiles. A mentsu is either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Triplet Check**: If any tile appears three times in the hand, no tiles need to be drawn (answer is 0).\n   - **Sequence Check**: For sequences, we look for three consecutive numbers in the same suit. The hand might already contain part of a sequence (e.g., two tiles differing by one number), requiring one additional tile to complete the sequence.\n   - **Mixed Tiles**: If the tiles are of different suits or numbers, we need to check if drawing one or two tiles can form a triplet or sequence.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Immediate Mentsu**: First, check if the hand already contains a mentsu (either triplet or sequence).\n   - **One Tile Draw**: If not, check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This involves checking for possible completions of a triplet or sequence.\n   - **Two Tile Draw**: If one tile isn't sufficient, check if two tiles can form a mentsu. This typically happens when the hand has two tiles that can be part of a triplet or sequence with two additional tiles.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves checking all possible combinations of the given tiles and potential draws, which is efficient given the constraints (tiles have limited suits and numbers).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n\n    # Check for koutsu (triplets)\n    from collections import Counter\n    count_tiles = Counter(tiles)\n    if any(count == 3 for count in count_tiles.values()):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for shuntsu (sequences)\n    suits = set(tile[1] for tile in tiles)\n    if len(suits) == 1:\n        numbers = sorted(set(int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles))\n        if len(numbers) == 3:\n            if numbers[2] - numbers[0] == 2:\n                print(0)\n                return\n\n    # Check if we can form a shuntsu by drawing one tile\n    suit_options = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    num_options = range(1, 10)\n\n    found_one = False\n    for s in suit_options:\n        for n in num_options:\n            candidate_tile = f\"{n}{s}\"\n            test_hand = tiles + [candidate_tile]\n            test_count = Counter(test_hand)\n            if any(count == 3 for count in test_count.values()):\n                found_one = True\n                break\n            else:\n                test_suits = set(tile[1] for tile in test_hand)\n                if len(test_suits) == 1:\n                    test_nums = sorted(set(int(tile[0]) for tile in test_hand))\n                    if len(test_nums) >= 3:\n                        unique_nums = set(test_nums)\n                        if len(unique_nums) == 3:\n                            if max(unique_nums) - min(unique_nums) == 2:\n                                found_one = True\n                                break\n                        elif len(unique_nums) == 2:\n                            if (min(unique_nums) * 2 == max(unique_nums)) or (min(unique_nums) + 1 == max(unique_nums)):\n                                found_one = True\n                                break\n                if found_one:\n                    break\n        if found_one:\n            break\n\n    if found_one:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read as three strings, each representing a tile (e.g., \"1s\").\n2. **Triplet Check**: Using a counter, we check if any tile appears three times. If yes, the answer is 0.\n3. **Sequence Check**: If all tiles are of the same suit, we check if they form a sequence (three consecutive numbers). If yes, the answer is 0.\n4. **One Tile Draw Check**: We simulate drawing each possible tile (any number in any suit) and check if the resulting hand forms a triplet or sequence.\n5. **Two Tile Draw Check**: If drawing one tile doesn't suffice, the answer defaults to 2, meaning two tiles are needed to form a mentsu.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal tiles needed, leveraging combinatorial checks for triplets and sequences.",
