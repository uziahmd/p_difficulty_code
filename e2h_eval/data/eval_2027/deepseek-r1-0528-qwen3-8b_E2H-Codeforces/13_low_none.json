For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string with three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (tone index) in a 12-note circle.\n    Let's assign:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   [Note: In some systems, H is B-flat? But according to the problem, after H comes C and they are identified. However, in the example input we have \"A B H\", so we must map H to 11.]\n\n 2. Since the circle is cyclic, we can compute distances modulo 12.\n\n 3. Given three notes, we have three intervals. We need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if there exists an ordering such that:\n    - For major: the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (in the same order) are 3 semitones apart (so total 7 from first to third).\n    - For minor: the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two are 4 semitones apart.\n\n 4. But note: the chord is unordered. So we consider all cyclic orders? Actually, we can consider all permutations of the three notes.\n\n 5. However, note that the definition says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" for major.\n\n    This means: \n        Option 1: \n            Let the ordered notes be (a, b, c). Then we require:\n                dist(a, b) = 4, dist(b, c) = 3, and then dist(a, c) should be (4+3)%12 = 7.\n\n        Option 2: Alternatively, the same three notes might be arranged in a different way (like wrapping around) but note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. However, the example: E to C is 8 semitones (which is the same as going from E to C by wrapping: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->C: 8 steps). But wait, the definition says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", meaning we don't necessarily take the shortest path? \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones\" and \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So we are to consider the linear ordering of the 12 notes as a circle, but the distance is measured without wrapping? Actually, the problem states: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" and then the distance from E to C is 8. \n\n    But wait: the example says \"distance between C and E is 4 semitones\" (which is 4) and \"between E and C is 8 semitones\". So the distance from a lower note to a higher note is the forward distance (without wrapping). However, when we have three notes, we might have to consider the circular arrangement? \n\n    Actually, the chord definition does not specify direction. We are allowed to order arbitrarily. But note: the condition for major requires an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and Y to Z is 3. However, the distance from X to Z (if we go directly) would be 7. But if we have to consider the circular arrangement, then we must account for the fact that the entire circle is 12 semitones.\n\n    Important: The problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are only considering the increasing order (without wrapping). But wait, what if the chord spans the octave boundary? \n\n    Example: Consider the chord \"B C E\". \n        Without wrapping: \n            B to C: 1 semitone (because from B (index10) to C (index0): if we go forward, we pass through C (0) so the distance from B to C is (0 - 10) mod 12? But the problem says from lowest to highest. \n\n    However, note: the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to a numerical value representing its position in the 12-note musical scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11). This mapping helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance is calculated as the difference in their numerical values. If the direct difference is negative, it is adjusted by adding 12 to ensure it represents the correct semitone distance in the circular scale.\n3. **Chord Classification**: The three notes are permuted in all possible orders. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are checked:\n   - **Major Chord**: The first two notes must be 4 semitones apart, and the next two must be 3 semitones apart.\n   - **Minor Chord**: The first two notes must be 3 semitones apart, and the next two must be 4 semitones apart.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation satisfies the major or minor criteria, the corresponding result is printed. If no permutation meets either criterion, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    note_to_index = {'C': 0, 'C#': 1, 'D': 2, 'D#': 3, 'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'F#': 6, 'G': 7, 'G#': 8, 'A': 9, 'B': 10, 'H': 11}\n    \n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n    \n    def dist(a, b):\n        d = (b - a) % 12\n        if d < 0:\n            d += 12\n        return d\n\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = dist(a, b)\n        d2 = dist(b, c)\n        d3 = dist(a, c)\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 and d3 == 7:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4 and d3 == 7:\n            found_minor = True\n\n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes, which are read and split into a list.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note is converted to its corresponding numerical index using a predefined dictionary.\n3. **Distance Function**: The `dist` function calculates the semitone distance between two notes, adjusting for circularity by ensuring the result is within the range [0, 11].\n4. **Permutations Check**: All permutations of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are checked against the criteria for major and minor chords.\n5. **Result Output**: Based on whether the criteria for major or minor chords are met (and not both), the appropriate result (\"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\") is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to classify them correctly, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of musical scales.",
