При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one string t (the received message) and we need to check if it can be the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message s, where an error caused the two copies to overlap.\n\n Conditions:\n - The entire string t must be formed by two copies of s overlapping.\n - The two copies must be of the same message s, and the entire t must be the concatenation of two s's that have overlapped by some positive number of characters (but not the entire s, so the overlap is less than the length of s).\n - Also note: if there is no error (i.e., the two messages were sent without the described error) then we just have two copies concatenated without overlapping. However, the problem states that without error, the two identical messages are simply sent as two separate parts (so t = s+s). But note: the problem also says that if the entire second message is overlapped (which would mean the first copy ends exactly at the start of the second, i.e., the entire second copy is overlapped) then that is considered an error? Actually, the problem says: \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений.\" meaning that if the entire second message is overlapped (so t becomes the first message only) then that is not considered an error. But wait, the example: \"abcd\" -> NO. Actually, the example says: if we get \"abcd\", then no error. Similarly, \"abcabc\" has no error.\n\n However, note the definition: \n   \"When two identical messages are transmitted consecutively, an error may occur in which they merge. The merging happens by matching the end of the first with the beginning of the second. The length of the overlap must be a positive number and less than the length of the message.\"\n\n So, the condition for an error is that the overlap is at least 1 and at most len(s)-1.\n\n Therefore, the entire string t must be decomposed as:\n   t = s + s[overlap:]   with 0 < overlap < len(s)\n\n But note: we don't know s. However, we can deduce that s must be such that:\n   Let n = len(t). Then s must be a substring of t that is repeated twice with an overlap.\n\n Alternatively, consider that the entire string t is formed by two copies of s, and the second copy starts before the first copy ends. Specifically, the first copy is s, and the second copy is s but starting from the last `k` characters (where k is the overlap). Then the total length is |s| + (|s| - k) = 2*|s| - k.\n\n And note: the entire t must be equal to the concatenation of two copies of s with an overlap of k (k>=1 and k < |s|). This means that t must have a prefix which is s, and then the rest of the string must be the part of s starting from index k.\n\n How can we approach?\n\n Observation: The total length of t must be at least 3 (since k>=1 and |s|>=2, because if |s|=1 then k must be 0 or 1, but k must be positive and less than 1 -> no solution). Actually, let's consider:\n\n Example: s=\"ab\", then two copies without error: \"abab\". With error and overlap 1: \"aba\" (if we take s=\"aba\"?). Wait, no: the two copies are both \"ab\", so the second copy starts at the last character of the first copy. But the first copy is \"ab\", so the second copy starts at the last character 'b'. Then the merged message is \"a\" (from the first copy) and then the second copy without the first character: so \"ab\" without the first character is \"b\", so the whole message is \"a\" + \"b\" = \"ab\", which is s again. But wait, the problem says: the entire message t must be the result. \n\n Actually, let me re-read: \"When two identical messages are sent consecutively, an error may cause them to merge. The merging happens by matching the end of the first with the beginning of the second. The length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message.\"\n\n So, the two copies are s and s. The first copy is s, and the second copy is s, but we remove the first (overlap) characters of the second copy and attach the rest to the end of the first copy.\n\n Therefore, the resulting string t is: \n   t = s[0 : len(s)] + s[overlap:]\n\n But note: the first copy is s, and the second copy starts at position (len(s) - overlap) in the first copy? Actually, the second copy is aligned so that the last `overlap` characters of the first copy match the first `overlap` characters of the second copy.\n\n Then the total length is len(s) + (len(s) - overlap) = 2*len(s) - overlap.\n\n Also, the entire string t must be equal to the two copies with this overlap.\n\n However, note: the entire string t might be longer than 2*len(s) - overlap? Actually, we are constructing t from two copies of s. So the length of t must be exactly 2*len(s) - overlap.\n\n But we don't know s. We only know t.\n\n Another way: t must be decomposable as:\n   t = A + B, where A is the first copy of s and B is the second copy of s without the first k characters (so B = s[k:]), and k is the overlap (with 0 < k < len(s)).\n\n Then, note that the second copy is s, so the entire second copy (including the first k characters) is the substring t[-k-?] ... Actually, we can think:\n\n   The entire t is: [s][s[k:]] = s + s[k:]\n\n But also, the second copy must appear in the first copy? Actually, the second copy is s, so we have:\n\n   s = t[0:n]   [if we assume that the first copy is the entire s, but wait, what if the second copy is longer than the first copy? No, because s is fixed. Actually, the two copies are both s, and the total length is 2*len(s)-k.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire string t is composed of two copies of s, and the two copies are overlapping by k. Then:\n\n   t = s + s[k:]\n\n But note: the first copy is s, and the second copy is s[k:], so the entire string is s + s[k:].\n\n Then, the length of t is len(s) + (len(s) - k) = 2*len(s) - k.\n\n Also, the first len(s) characters of t must be s, and the next (len(s)-k) characters must be s[k:].\n\n But wait, we don't know s. However, we can try to find a candidate s.\n\n Since the entire t is built from two copies of s, we have:\n\n   t[0:len(s)] = s\n   t[len(s):] = s[k:]   (which is the second copy without the first k characters)\n\n And note that the second copy is s, so the substring t[len(s):] must equal s[k:].\n\n But also, the second copy must start at the correct place: the last k characters of the first copy (s) must equal the first k characters of the second copy (s). That is, s[-k:] == s[:k].\n\n Now, what are the constraints on the length of t? The length of t must be at least 3 (as discussed). But note: if s has length 1, then k must be between 1 and 0 -> no solution. So s must have at least length 2.\n\n However, note: the problem says the entire message t is the result. So t must be exactly s + s[k:].\n\n But we don't know s. How to find s?\n\n Let n = len(t). Then n = 2*len(s) - k. Since k is at least 1 and at most len(s)-1, then:\n\n   n = 2*len(s) - k => n < 2*len(s) and n >= 2*len(s) - (len(s)-1) = len(s)+1.\n\n So, we have: len(s) = (n + k) / 2, and since k is between 1 and len(s)-1, then:\n\n   n < 2*len(s)  => len(s) > n/2\n   n >= len(s)+1 => len(s) <= n-1\n\n Actually, from n = 2*len(s)-k, we have len(s) = (n+k)/2. Since k>=1, then len(s) >= (n+1)/2. And k<=len(s)-1, so n = 2*len(s)-k >= 2*len(s) - (len(s)-1) = len(s)+1 -> len(s) <= n-1.\n\n Therefore, the length of s must be in the range: ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1.\n\n However, note: we don't know k. So we can iterate over possible lengths of s.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let n = len(t)\n 2. Consider all possible lengths L for s: from floor((n+1)/2) to n-1 (inclusive). Actually, from (n+1)//2 to n-1.\n\n    Why (n+1)//2? Because: n = 2*L - k, and k>=1 -> n <= 2*L-1 -> L >= ceil((n+1)/2). But note: L must be integer.\n\n    Alternatively, we can express: L must satisfy: \n        L > n/2   (since n < 2L) and L <= n-1.\n\n    So L from floor(n/2)+1 to n-1? Actually, from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1.\n\n    Example: n=3 -> L from ceil(4/2)=2 to 2 (since n-1=2). Then k = 2*2-3=1 -> valid.\n\n 3. For each candidate L, set s = t[0:L] (the first L characters). Then the second part should be t[L:] and must equal s[k:], where k is the overlap.\n\n    But note: the entire string t is built from s and then s[k:]. So the length of the second part is n - L = (2*L - k) - L = L - k.\n\n    Also, k must be between 1 and L-1, and the condition is that s[-k:] == s[:k] (the overlapping part) and the second part of t (t[L:]) must equal s[k:].\n\n    But note: the second part of t is of length L-k, and s[k:] is of length L-k, so they must match.\n\n 4. Additionally, we must have that the entire string t is exactly s + s[k:].\n\n    However, note: the problem says that the entire message t is the result of two copies. So we must have:\n\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n    But wait, what if we take s from the beginning? The problem doesn't specify that the first copy is the entire s. However, the error condition is that the two copies are consecutive and the second copy is overlapped. The entire message t is the result. The first copy is s, and the second copy is s but with the first k characters merged (so not included). \n\n    But note: the example \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\": \n        s = \"abrakadabra\", then k=1: t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (which matches).\n\n    However, what if we consider a different s? The problem says: if the message t can be the result, then output YES and any possible s.\n\n    There might be multiple possibilities. But note: the problem says \"possibe value s\", so we can choose any.\n\n 5. Algorithm:\n\n    n = len(t)\n    If n <= 2: # because minimum length for an error is 3 (e.g., \"aba\" from \"ab\" with overlap 1: t = \"a\" + \"b\" -> \"ab\" is without error? Actually, wait: \n        Without error: two copies of s=\"ab\" would give \"abab\". But with error: we require two copies of s and then merge. For s=\"a\", then k must be 0 (not allowed) or 1 (then the second copy is s[1:] which is empty, so t = \"a\" + \"\" = \"a\", but then the entire second copy is overlapped (so not allowed by the problem: the overlap must be less than the length of s, and here k=1 is equal to the length of s, so not allowed). So the minimal s is of length 2.\n\n        Actually, the minimal s is of length 2, then minimal t is of length: 2*2 - 1 = 3.\n\n        Therefore, if n<3, then no error.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        For L in range(floor((n+1)/2), n):   # L from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, inclusive.\n\n            s = t[:L]\n            remaining_length = n - L\n            # Then the second copy part should be s[k:], and the length of that part is L - k, so k = L - (remaining_length) = L - (n - L) = 2*L - n.\n\n            # But note: we must have k = 2*L - n, and k must be between 1 and L-1.\n\n            k = 2*L - n\n\n            If k is an integer and 1 <= k < L:\n                Then check:\n                    Condition 1: the last k characters of s must equal the first k characters of s: s[-k:] == s[:k]\n                    Condition 2: the entire string t must be s + s[k:]\n\n                But note: t is given as a string. We can check condition 2 by: \n                    expected_t = s + s[k:]\n                    if expected_t == t: then we found a candidate.\n\n            However, note: we can also check without building the entire string? Actually, we can break the string t into two parts: the first L characters must be s, and the next n-L characters must be s[k:].\n\n            But note: we have defined s = t[:L] and then we require that the rest of the string (t[L:]) equals s[k:].\n\n            So condition 2 is: t[L:] == s[k:]\n\n        But note: we have defined k = 2*L - n. And from the equation: n = 2*L - k, so the length of the rest is n-L = L - k.\n\n        Therefore, if t[L:] == s[k:] and s[-k:] == s[:k], then we have a valid s.\n\n    However, note: the condition s[-k:] == s[:k] is necessary for the overlapping part to match. But note: the entire t is built by having the second copy s, and we are taking s[k:] for the part that is appended. The overlapping part (the last k of the first copy and the first k of the second copy) must be identical.\n\n    But wait, the second copy is s, so the first k characters of the second copy are s[:k]. And the last k characters of the first copy are s[-k:]. They must be equal.\n\n    Therefore, we have two conditions.\n\n 6. However, note: we don't know if the entire t is built from two copies of s. The above reasoning is for a specific s being the first L characters. But what if the two copies are not aligned at the beginning? \n\n    Example: Consider t = \"abab\", then we can have s=\"ab\", and k=1: \n        s = \"ab\", k=1 -> s[-1:] = \"b\", s[:1]=\"a\" -> they are not equal. \n        But wait, then how did we get \"abab\"? Without error: two copies of \"ab\" gives \"abab\", and with error we require an overlap. \n\n    Actually, the example \"abab\" is without error? The problem says: without error, we just have two copies. But the problem also says that if the entire second copy is overlapped (which is not the case here, because the second copy is \"ab\", and we only overlapped 0? Actually, the error condition requires that the two copies are merged by an overlap (positive and less than the length). \n\n    In the example \"abab\", we can also consider s=\"abab\", then the two copies are \"abab\" and \"abab\", but then the entire second copy is overlapped? The problem says: the entire second copy cannot be overlapped (must be less than the length). Here, if we take s=\"abab\", then the overlap k must be less than 4. But the total length is 4 = 2*4 - k => k=4, which is not allowed (must be less than 4). \n\n    Alternatively, we can consider s=\"aba\", then n=4, so 4 = 2*3 - k => k=2. Then check: s[-2:]==\"ba\", s[:2]==\"ab\" -> not equal. \n\n    Or s=\"bab\", then n=4, 4=2*3-k -> k=2, then s[-2:]=\"ab\", s[:2]=\"ba\" -> not equal.\n\n    Or s=\"ab\", then n=4, 4=2*2-k -> k=0, which is not positive.\n\n    So \"abab\" is not formed by an error? Then the answer for \"abab\" is \"NO\"?\n\n    But wait, the example input: ['abcabc'] -> NO. But our example \"abab\" is similar.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"abcabc\" is without error. Similarly, \"abab\" is without error? \n\n    But note: the problem says that without error, we have two copies. So \"abab\" is two copies of \"ab\", so no error. Therefore, we should output \"NO\" for \"abab\" because the problem does not consider the error condition when there's no overlap. The error condition only applies when an error occurred, i.e., when there was an overlap (positive and less than the length). \n\n    So the problem says: if the message t does not contain an error, output \"NO\". \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"if the message t does not contain an error\", then output \"NO\". Otherwise, output \"YES\" and the s.\n\n    But note: the example input includes \"abababab\" and outputs \"YES\\nababab\".\n\n    Let me check \"abababab\": \n        Length 8. Candidate L: from ceil((8+1)/2)=ceil(9/2)=5 to 7.\n\n        L=5: k=2*5-8=2. Then s = \"ababa\", then check: s[-2:]=\"ba\", s[:2]=\"ab\" -> not equal. Also, the rest of the string is t[5:]=\"bab\", and s[2:]=\"aba\", which is not equal to \"bab\".\n        L=6: k=2*6-8=4. Then s = \"ababab\", then check: s[-4:]=\"baba\", s[:4]=\"abab\" -> not equal. Rest: t[6:]=\"ab\", s[4:]=\"ab\" -> matches. But the condition for the overlapping part fails.\n\n        L=7: k=2*7-8=6. Then s = \"abababa\", then check: s[-6:]=\"bababa\", s[:6]=\"ababab\" -> not equal. Rest: t[7:]=\"b\", s[6:]=\"a\" -> not equal.\n\n        Then why the example output for \"abababab\" is \"YES\\nababab\"?\n\n        Wait, the example output says: \n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n            Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        So for \"abababab\", the output is \"YES\\nababab\", meaning s=\"ababab\".\n\n        Let me check with s=\"ababab\", then the total length of t must be 2*6 - k. We have n=8, so k=2*6-8=4. Then the second part is s[4:]= \"ab\". Then the entire string t would be s + s[4:] = \"ababab\" + \"ab\" = \"abababab\", which matches.\n\n        Now, check the overlapping condition: the last 4 characters of s must equal the first 4 characters of s? \n            s = \"ababab\"\n            last 4: \"baba\" (from index 2 to 5: \"ababab\" -> indices: 0:a,1:b,2:a,3:b,4:a,5:b -> last 4: from index 2 to 5: \"abab\"? Actually, let me count: \n                s[0:6] = \"ababab\"\n                s[2:6] = \"abab\" -> that's the last 4? Actually, the last 4 is s[2:6] but wait, the last 4 characters are from index 2 to 5 (inclusive) is 4 characters? \n                Actually, s[-4:] is the last 4: from index 2 to 5 (0-indexed, the string is 6 long, so indices 0..5; the last 4: from index 2 to 5 inclusive: \"a\",\"b\",\"a\",\"b\" -> \"abab\")\n                The first 4: s[:4] = \"abab\"\n\n            So s[-4:] = \"abab\" and s[:4]=\"abab\" -> they are equal.\n\n        Therefore, it works.\n\n        But wait, the example \"abcabc\": \n            n=6, candidate L from ceil(7/2)=4 to 5.\n\n            L=4: k=2*4-6=2. Then s=t[:4]=\"abc\", then check: s[-2:]=\"bc\", s[:2]=\"ab\" -> not equal. Then the rest of the string: t[4:]=\"bc\", and s[2:]=\"c\", which is not equal to \"bc\".\n\n            L=5: k=2*5-6=4. Then s=t[:5]=\"abcab\", then check: s[-4:]=\"cab\", s[:4]=\"abca\" -> wait, wait: \n                s[-4:] is the last 4: from index 1 to 4: \"abcab\" -> last 4: \"bcab\" (if we take negative indexing: s[-4:] is from the 4th last to the end: that's from index 1 to 4 -> \"bcab\")\n                s[:4] = \"abca\" -> not equal.\n\n            So no candidate. Therefore, we output \"NO\", which matches.\n\n        But wait, the example \"abcabc\" is without error? Yes, because without error, we have two copies of \"abc\", so t=\"abcabc\". The problem says that without error, we don't consider the error condition. But note: the problem says to output \"NO\" if there is no error. However, we are only checking for the error condition (with overlap). The string \"abcabc\" can be interpreted as two copies without error. But the problem does not require that the error condition must be the only way to form the string. It says: if the message t does not contain an error, then output \"NO\". \n\n        What does \"contain an error\" mean? It means that there exists a decomposition as two copies of s with an overlap (positive and less than the length). \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети\". So we are to check if it is possible that the error occurred.\n\n        But note: the example \"abcabc\" is two copies without error. But is it also possible that the error occurred? \n\n        Let's check: \n          Is there an s and an overlap k (1<=k<len(s)) such that t = s + s[k:] and t = \"abcabc\"?\n\n          Suppose s = \"abcabc\", then k=2*6-6=6 -> not allowed (k must be less than 6). \n          Or s = \"abc\", then k=2*3-6=0 -> not allowed.\n\n          Or s = \"abca\", then n=6, so 6=2*4-k -> k=2. Then s=\"abca\", then the last 2 of s is \"ca\", the first 2 is \"ab\" -> not equal. And the rest of the string is t[4:] = \"bc\", and s[2:]=\"ca\" -> not equal.\n\n          Or s = \"abcab\", then n=6, 6=2*5-k -> k=4. Then s[-4:]=\"bcab\", s[:4]=\"abca\" -> not equal.\n\n          So no candidate for error. Therefore, \"abcabc\" does not contain an error.\n\n        But note: the problem says that without error, we have two copies. So the two copies without error is the only way. However, the problem does not say that the error condition must be the only explanation. It says: if the message t does not contain an error, output \"NO\". \n\n        So we are only concerned with the error condition: if there exists an s and an overlap k (1<=k<len(s)) such that t = s + s[k:], then we output \"YES\" and s.\n\n        In the case of \"abcabc\", there is no such s and k, so we output \"NO\".\n\n        Similarly, \"abababab\" has a candidate s=\"ababab\" and k=4, so we output \"YES\".\n\n 7. However, note: the example \"acacacaca\" (input) is given and the output is \"YES\\nacaca\". Let's check:\n\n        t = \"acacacaca\", n=9.\n\n        Candidate L from ceil((9+1)/2)=5 to 8.\n\n        Let L=5: k=2*5-9=1. Then s=\"acaca\", then check: \n            s[-1:]=='a', s[:1]=='a' -> matches.\n            Then the rest of the string is t[5:]==\"caca\", and s[1:]==\"cacaca\" -> wait, that's not matching.\n\n        Actually, the entire string t should be s + s[1:] = \"acaca\" + \"cacaca\" = \"accacaca\", but we have \"acacacaca\". \n\n        Alternatively, maybe we have to consider that the two copies are not necessarily the first L characters? \n\n        Let me reexamine: the problem says that the two copies are consecutive. The error merges the two copies. The first copy is s, and the second copy is s but merged by the last k of the first copy and the first k of the second copy.\n\n        So the entire string t is the first copy (s) and then the second copy without the first k characters. \n\n        But note: the second copy is s, so the entire second copy is s, but we are removing the first k characters. \n\n        Therefore, the entire string t is s + s[k:].\n\n        However, the example \"acacacaca\" has length 9.\n\n        Let me try L=5: then s=\"acaca\", and k=1, then t_expected = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"accaca\", which is not \"acacacaca\".\n\n        How about L=4: \n            k=2*4-9 -> negative? Then skip.\n\n        L=6: k=2*6-9=3. Then s=\"acacac\", then check: \n            s[-3:]==\"cac\", s[:3]==\"aca\" -> not equal.\n\n        L=7: k=2*7-9=5. Then s=\"acacaca\", then check: \n            s[-5:]=\"caca\" -> wait, let's do: \n                s = \"acacaca\", last 5: from index 2 to 6: \"acaca\" -> actually, we should use negative indexing: \n                s[-5:] = \"caca\" (if we take from index 2: 'a','c','a','c','a'? Let me write: \n                s = \"acacaca\": \n                    index0: 'a'\n                    index1: 'c'\n                    index2: 'a'\n                    index3: 'c'\n                    index4: 'a'\n                    index5: 'c'\n                    index6: 'a'\n\n                Actually, the last 5: from index 2 to 6: \"a\",\"c\",\"a\",\"c\",\"a\" -> \"acaca\"\n                The first 5: s[:5]=\"acaca\"\n\n                So s[-5:]==\"acaca\", s[:5]==\"acaca\" -> matches.\n\n                Then the rest of the string is t[7:]==\"ca\", and s[5:]==\"ca\", so matches.\n\n                Then the entire t_expected = s + s[5:] = \"acacaca\" + \"ca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is the given t.\n\n        But wait, the example output says \"acaca\". \n\n        However, note the problem says: \"If several answers are possible, you can output any.\"\n\n        But note: we found s=\"acacaca\" (length 7) and also there might be a shorter s?\n\n        Let me try L=5 again: didn't work. L=6: didn't work. L=7: worked.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"acaca\". How is that?\n\n        Let me check with s=\"acaca\" (length 5) and k=?\n\n        Then the total length of t would be 2*5 - k = 10 - k. We have n=9, so 10-k=9 -> k=1. Then we have:\n\n            s[-1:]=='a', s[:1]=='a' -> matches.\n\n            Then t_expected = s + s[1:] = \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" = \"accacac\", but the given t is \"acacacaca\", which is not the same.\n\n        So the example output \"acaca\" must be a mistake? Or perhaps I misunderstood.\n\n        Actually, the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"YES\\nacaca\".\n\n        Let me see: the example says \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\" -> wait, the example output says \"acaca\", but the note says \"acacaca\". \n\n        Correction: the example input is given as ['acacacaca'] and the output is 'YES\\nacaca'. \n\n        But wait, the example output is written as: \n            ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        So they output \"acaca\", but our candidate s must be \"acacaca\" (length 7). \n\n        Alternatively, maybe there is a candidate s=\"acaca\" (length 5) for a different k? \n\n        The formula: n = 2*L - k -> 9 = 2*5 - k -> k=1, but then the entire string must be \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" = \"accacac\", which is not \"acacacaca\".\n\n        So the example output might be incorrect? Or perhaps the problem allows multiple ways to break the string?\n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \"By transmission of two identical messages consecutively, an error may occur, in which they merge. The merging happens by matching the end of the first with the beginning of the second. The length of the overlap must be a positive number and less than the length of the text.\"\n\n        The two copies are s and s. The entire string t is the first copy (s) and then the second copy without the first k characters.\n\n        But note: the entire string t must be the concatenation of the two copies with the overlap. \n\n        However, the example \"acacacaca\" might be broken differently? \n\n        What if s=\"acac\", then k=2*4-9 -> negative, skip.\n\n        s=\"aca\", then 9=2*3-k -> k=-3, invalid.\n\n        s=\"cac\", then 9=2*3-k -> k=-3, invalid.\n\n        s=\"aca\", already tried.\n\n        Alternatively, the two copies might not be taken as the entire s? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify that the entire second copy is present. It says the second copy is merged by the overlap. \n\n        But note: the example \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\": \n            s=\"abrakadabra\", then t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\".\n\n        Here, the second copy is the entire s without the first k (k=1) character.\n\n        Similarly, for \"acacacaca\", we found that s=\"acacaca\" (length 7) works.\n\n        But the example output says \"acaca\", which is length 5.\n\n        Let me check with s=\"acaca\" (length 5) and k=4: \n            Then total length = 2*5-4=6, but t has length 9 -> no.\n\n        k=2: then total length=2*5-2=8, not 9.\n\n        k=3: then total length=7, not 9.\n\n        k=1: 9, as above.\n\n        So no.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the two copies are not the entire s? \n\n        Wait, the problem says: two identical messages. So the first copy is s, and the second copy is s. Then the entire string t is s + s[k:].\n\n        The example output \"acaca\" must be an error in the example? \n\n        But wait, the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"YES\\nacaca\". \n\n        Let me check the sample input provided in the problem:\n\n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n            Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        The second element of input is 'acacacaca', and the second element of output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\n        How can 'acaca' be the original message? \n\n        Then the two copies of s=\"acaca\" would be \"acacaacaca\". But wait, the error condition: \n            t = s + s[k:].\n\n        For s=\"acaca\", k must be 1: then t = \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" = \"accacac\", which is not \"acacacaca\".\n\n        For k=2: then t = \"acaca\" + \"acac\" = \"acacacac\", not matching.\n\n        For k=3: then t = \"acaca\" + \"ca\" = \"acacaca\", which is length 7, not 9.\n\n        So there is no way to get \"acacacaca\" from s=\"acaca\".\n\n        Therefore, the example output seems to be wrong.\n\n        But wait, let me check the example note: \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\" -> meaning in the second example, a valid answer is the string \"acacaca\". \n\n        The example output says \"acaca\", but the note says \"acacaca\". \n\n        Actually, the problem statement says: \"Во вторем примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca\", so the intended answer for the second example is \"acacaca\", but the output example says \"acaca\".\n\n        This is a discrepancy. \n\n        However, note the example output format: the second example output is 'YES\\nacaca'. \n\n        Let me check the example input string: the second string is 'acacacaca'. \n\n        There is another possibility: the problem allows that the two copies are not necessarily starting from the beginning of the entire string? \n\n        But the problem says: \"By transmission of two identical messages consecutively\", meaning the entire first message is sent, then the entire second message is sent, and then the error occurs. \n\n        However, the error condition is defined by the overlapping part. The entire string t is the concatenation of the two copies with the overlap.\n\n        Therefore, the first copy must be at the beginning of t.\n\n        After rethinking, I think the example output is correct if we consider that the two copies are not necessarily the entire s? \n\n        Actually, no: the problem says the two copies are identical and the error merges them. \n\n        But wait, the problem does not say that the entire string t is the entire two copies. It says: the result is the two copies merged by the error. \n\n        However, the example",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap of some positive number of characters (less than the length of `s`). If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be constructed by taking the first copy of `s` (which is `t[0:L]` for some length `L`) and appending the second copy of `s` starting from the `k`-th character (where `k` is the overlap length). The overlap `k` must satisfy `1 ≤ k < L`, and the last `k` characters of the first copy must match the first `k` characters of the second copy.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over all possible lengths `L` of `s` from `ceil((n + 1)/2)` to `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of `t`). For each `L`, we compute the overlap `k` as `2*L - n`. If `k` is within the valid range, we check if the last `k` characters of `t[0:L]` match the first `k` characters of `t[0:L]` and if the remaining part of `t` (from `L` onwards) matches the substring `t[0:L][k:]`.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks all possible lengths `L` for `s`, which ranges from approximately `n/2` to `n-1`. For each `L`, the operations involve simple string slicing and comparisons, which are linear in the length of `s`. Given that the maximum length of `t` is 100, this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    if n < 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    found = False\n    for L in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue\n            \n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        if s_candidate[-k:] != s_candidate[:k]:\n            continue\n            \n        if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the length of `t` is less than 3, it's impossible to have a valid overlap, so the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` of `s` (from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1`), compute the overlap `k` as `2*L - n`.\n4. **Validation Checks**: For each `L`, check if `k` is valid (i.e., `1 ≤ k < L`). Then verify that the last `k` characters of the first copy of `s` match the first `k` characters of `s`, and that the remaining part of `t` matches the substring of `s` starting from index `k`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" and `s`; otherwise, print \"NO\" after checking all possible lengths.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all potential candidates for `s` by leveraging the constraints provided by the problem, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
