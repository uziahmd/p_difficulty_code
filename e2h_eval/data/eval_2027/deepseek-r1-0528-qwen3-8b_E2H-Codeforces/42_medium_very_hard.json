Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each with size between 1 and 1000 bytes.\n We have two progress bars:\n   First: for the current file i, after copying x bytes: floor(100 * x / a_i)\n   Second: overall, after copying (a_1 + ... + a_{i-1} + x) bytes: floor(100 * (sum_so_far) / total_sum)\n\n We need to find all integers p from 0 to 100 such that there exists some moment (i.e., at some byte x of some file i) \n where both progress bars show p.\n\n Note: The problem says that the second progress bar uses the cumulative sum up to the current point (so far including the current x).\n\n Approach:\n\n We cannot simulate every byte for every file because the total data might be large (each file up to 1000, and n up to 100 -> 100*1000=100000 bytes per file, and 100 files -> 10000000 bytes worst-case). However, note that the problem says the file sizes are at most 1000, so the total sum is at most 100000 (n<=100, each <=1000). But we cannot iterate over every byte (which would be 10000000 iterations in worst-case) because 10^7 is acceptable in Pyton? Actually, worst-case n=100, each file 1000 bytes -> 100000 bytes. Then we have 100000 * 100 = 10e6 * 100? Wait no, wait: the total number of bytes is the sum of the files, which is at most 100000. And we have to simulate each file one by one.\n\n However, note that the second progress bar depends on the entire history. We can break down the problem by considering each file.\n\n Let total = a1+a2+...+an.\n\n For a fixed file i (with size a_i) and a fixed percentage p (from 0 to 100), we want to know if there exists an integer x (0 <= x <= a_i) such that:\n\n Condition 1 (first progress bar):\n     floor(100*x/a_i) = p\n\n Condition 2 (second progress bar):\n     Let S = (a1+a2+...+a_{i-1} + x) [the cumulative bytes copied so far]\n     Then floor(100*S/total) = p.\n\n But note: the second condition depends on the previous files' sizes and the current x.\n\n However, we must consider that the moment when the current file has been copied x bytes, the overall progress is (previous_total + x) / total.\n\n How to check for a fixed p?\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over the files and within each file, we can compute the set of p's that can appear during that file.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the total sum = T.\n\n 2. We'll keep track of the cumulative sum up to the start of the current file (let's call it prefix_sum).\n\n 3. For file i (size a_i):\n\n    For the first condition: \n        p must satisfy: \n            p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n        => x must be in the interval [ceil(p*a_i/100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)]? Actually, we use integer x.\n\n        But note: we require floor(100*x/a_i) = p.\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n            x_min = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   [but note: if p=0 then x_min=0]\n            x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100   [because floor((p+1)*a_i/100) is the next integer value, so we take strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100]\n\n        Actually, let me write:\n\n            p = floor(100*x/a_i) \n            => p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n            => ceil(p * a_i / 100) <= x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) ?\n\n        But note: x must be integer. So:\n\n            Lower bound: L = ceil(p * a_i / 100)   [if p>0, but if p==0 then L=0]\n            Upper bound: U = (p+1)*a_i // 100   [because if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then at x=(p+1)*a_i//100, the value becomes p+1, so we must stop at (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1?]\n\n        Actually, the condition is:\n            x must be an integer such that:\n                p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n            => x >= ceil(p * a_i / 100) and x < (p+1)*a_i/100.\n\n        Since x is integer, we have:\n            x_min = ceil(p * a_i / 100)\n            x_max = min(a_i, floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9))   [but note: (p+1)*a_i/100 might not be integer, and we want the largest integer strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100]\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [ceiling division without floats]?\n            Actually, ceiling of (p*a_i/100) = (p*a_i + 99) // 100? \n            But wait: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b for positive integers.\n\n        However, note: p*a_i might not be an integer, but we are using integer arithmetic.\n\n        But note: p is integer, a_i is integer.\n\n        We can compute:\n            low_bound = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [this gives the ceiling of (p*a_i/100)]\n            high_bound = (p+1)*a_i // 100   [this gives the floor of ((p+1)*a_i/100)]\n\n        Then the condition for x is: x in [low_bound, high_bound - 1] (if high_bound is the first x that gives p+1, then we want x from low_bound to high_bound-1) but wait:\n\n        Actually, the condition for x is:\n            p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n\n        Multiply by a_i/100:\n            p * a_i / 100 <= x < (p+1)*a_i/100\n\n        Then x must be an integer in [ceil(p*a_i/100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)].\n\n        But note: (p+1)*a_i/100 might be an integer. Then the condition is x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum x is (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        However, we can also use:\n\n            low_bound = ceil(p*a_i/100)\n            high_bound = floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)   -> but we don't want to use floating point.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n\n            low_bound = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            high_bound = (p+1)*a_i // 100   # This is the smallest x that would give p+1? Actually, (p+1)*a_i/100 might be an integer, then x = (p+1)*a_i//100 gives p+1.\n\n        So x must be in [low_bound, high_bound - 1] if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, and [low_bound, high_bound - 1] if not? Actually, note:\n\n            If (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0, then at x = (p+1)*a_i//100, we get 100*x/a_i = (p+1) exactly -> then floor is p+1, so we must exclude that x.\n\n        Therefore, the valid x for the first condition are from low_bound to high_bound - 1, provided that low_bound <= high_bound-1.\n\n        But note: if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100, then high_bound = (p+1)*a_i//100 is the floor, and x can go up to high_bound (because then 100*x/a_i < p+1 still holds until x=high_bound? Actually, no: \n\n            Example: a_i=100, p=0 -> then we require 0 <= 100*x/100 < 1 -> x in [0, 0.99...] -> so x=0 only.\n\n            Then low_bound = (0+99)//100 = 0, high_bound = (1*100)//100 = 1 -> then x in [0, 0] (since 1-1=0). Correct.\n\n        Another example: a_i=100, p=1 -> then we require 1 <= 100*x/100 < 2 -> x in [1, 1.99...] -> so x=1.\n\n            low_bound = (1*100+99)//100 = (100+99)//100 = 199//100 = 1\n            high_bound = (2*100)//100 = 2 -> then x in [1, 1] (because 2-1=1). Correct.\n\n        So we can define:\n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100   # This is the smallest integer x such that 100*x/a_i >= p+1? Actually, no: (p+1)*a_i//100 is the floor of (p+1)*a_i/100.\n\n        Then the condition is x_min <= x <= min(a_i, x_max - 1) [if x_max is at least x_min, and also x cannot exceed a_i].\n\n        But note: if (p+1)*a_i//100 is less than x_min, then no x for this p in this file.\n\n 4. Now, for the second condition, at the same x (in the current file) the overall progress must be p.\n\n        Let S = prefix_sum + x   (where prefix_sum is the total bytes copied before starting this file)\n        Then: floor(100 * S / T) = p.\n\n        This condition is:\n            p <= 100*S/T < p+1\n            => p*T <= 100*S < (p+1)*T\n\n        But S = prefix_sum + x, so:\n\n            p*T <= 100*(prefix_sum + x) < (p+1)*T\n\n        =>  (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) / 100 <= x < ((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum) / 100\n\n        Then x must be an integer in the interval [ceil((p*T - 100*prefix_sum)/100), floor(((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum)/100 - 1e-9)]? \n\n        But note: we already have a constraint on x from the first condition. So we can combine:\n\n        For a fixed file i and a fixed p, we require:\n\n          x_min1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n          x_max1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   [then we consider x from x_min1 to min(a_i, x_max1-1)]\n\n          Also from the second condition:\n\n          x_min2 = ceil((p * T - 100 * prefix_sum) / 100.0)   [but we need to avoid floating point?]\n          x_max2 = (p+1)*T // 100   [then we require 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T -> so x < ((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum)/100, so x_max2 = floor(((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum - 1) / 100)? ]\n\n        Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic for the second condition as well:\n\n          Condition: 100*(prefix_sum+x) >= p*T and 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T.\n\n          => x >= ceil((p*T - 100*prefix_sum)/100)   [if (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) is negative, then ceil might be negative? But note p>=0, prefix_sum is nonnegative, T>=prefix_sum+x, so p*T <= 100*(prefix_sum+x) is the lower bound, so if p*T > 100*(prefix_sum+x) then condition fails. However, note that we are iterating p from 0 to 100, and the overall progress must be at least the progress of the previous files. But the overall progress might jump by more than one p at a time? Actually, we are checking for a fixed p.\n\n        But note: the overall progress bar is defined by the entire cumulative sum. The second condition must hold at the same x that satisfies the first condition.\n\n        However, we cannot iterate over all p from 0 to 100 for each file (that would be 101 * 100 * 100 = 1e6 * 100? Actually, 100 files, 101 p's per file -> 100*101=10100, then for each p we do some calculations, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: we are going to check for each p (0 to 100) and for each file, and then check if there is an integer x in the intersection of the two intervals.\n\n        However, note that the second condition also requires that the overall cumulative sum (prefix_sum+x) is at least the current file's x. And the second condition's bounds depend on the entire prefix_sum and T.\n\n        Steps for fixed file i and fixed p:\n\n          Step 1: Compute the range of x from the first condition: [x_min1, x_max1] (if x_min1 <= x_max1, and also x_max1 is the upper bound exclusive, so actually the interval is [x_min1, x_max1-1] but note: if x_max1 is the floor of (p+1)*a_i/100, then the condition is x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum integer x is x_max1-1, unless (p+1)*a_i/100 is not an integer then x_max1 is the floor and the condition is x <= x_max1 (because x_max1 is the last integer below (p+1)*a_i/100). Actually, our calculation for x_max1 was (p+1)*a_i//100, which is the floor. Then the condition is x <= x_max1-1.\n\n          Step 2: From the second condition, we require:\n              100*(prefix_sum+x) >= p*T   and  100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T.\n\n          Solve for x:\n\n              x >= (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) // 100   [ceiling of (p*T - 100*prefix_sum)/100]? \n\n          Actually, we require:\n\n              x >= ceil((p*T - 100*prefix_sum)/100)   [if (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) is negative, then ceil(negative) is negative, but then we should clamp x to at least 0. However, note x is from 0 to a_i.\n\n          But note: we are in the middle of the file, and the overall progress must be at least p. It is possible that the overall progress is already above p? Actually, we are considering the moment during the file, so the overall progress is increasing.\n\n          However, we can compute:\n\n              low_bound_second = ceil((p*T - 100*prefix_sum) / 100.0)\n              high_bound_second = floor(((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum - 1) / 100)   [because the condition is 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T -> x < ((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum)/100, so the maximum integer x is floor(((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum - 1)/100) ??? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n              low_bound_second = (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) // 100   [ceiling division for positive numbers? But note: if p*T - 100*prefix_sum is negative, then we need to adjust]\n\n          However, note: we are dealing with integers and we want the smallest integer x such that 100*(prefix_sum+x) >= p*T.\n\n          Let required = p*T - 100*prefix_sum\n          Then x >= ceil(required/100) if required is positive, but if required is negative, then even x=0 satisfies.\n\n          Actually, we can write:\n\n              low_bound_second = max(0, (required + 99) // 100)   [if we use integer ceiling for nonnegative required, but note: if required is negative, then (required+99)//100 might be negative or zero?]\n\n          But wait: the condition is 100*(prefix_sum+x) >= p*T.\n\n          Rearranged: x >= (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) / 100.\n\n          If (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) is negative, then even x=0 satisfies.\n\n          So:\n\n              If (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) <= 0, then the second condition is satisfied for any x>=0.\n\n          How to compute the ceiling for negative numbers? We can do:\n\n              low_bound_second = (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) // 100\n\n          But wait: ceiling of a negative number? Example: ceil(-0.5) = -0, but in integer we might get:\n\n          In Python, for negative numbers, floor division rounds toward -infinity. We want ceiling.\n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid floating point by:\n\n              If (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) <= 0, then low_bound_second = 0.\n\n              Else, low_bound_second = (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) // 100   [ceiling for positive numbers]\n\n          But note: if (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) is positive, then we use ceiling. However, we can use:\n\n              low_bound_second = (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) // 100\n\n          But wait, for positive numbers, ceiling(a) = (a + 99) // 100? Actually, for positive a, we have:\n\n              ceil(a) = (a + denominator - 1) // denominator.\n\n          Here denominator is 100.\n\n          However, if (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) is negative, then (a+99)//100 might be negative, and we want 0. Actually, the condition is automatically satisfied for x=0, so we can set low_bound_second = 0.\n\n          Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n              low_bound_second = (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) // 100\n              But if (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) is negative, then (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) might be negative and the floor division by 100 will round down, but we want the ceiling to be negative? Actually, no: we want the smallest integer x (>=0) that satisfies the condition. So we can take:\n\n              low_bound_second = max(0, (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) // 100)\n\n          However, wait: if (p*T - 100*prefix_sum) is negative, then (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99) might be negative, then (p*T - 100*prefix_sum + 99)//100 is negative, so we set to 0.\n\n          Similarly, for the upper bound of the second condition:\n\n              Condition: 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T\n              => x < ((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum) / 100\n\n          So the maximum x is floor(((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum - 1) / 100) ? Or we can use:\n\n              high_bound_second = ((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum - 1) // 100\n\n          But note: we want the largest integer x such that 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T.\n\n          This is equivalent to:\n\n              x <= floor(( (p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum - 1 ) / 100)\n\n          However, we can also use:\n\n              high_bound_second = ((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum - 1) // 100\n\n          But wait: if (p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum - 1 is negative, then we set high_bound_second to -1, meaning no x. However, note that the overall progress cannot be negative.\n\n          Actually, the overall cumulative sum (prefix_sum+x) is at least prefix_sum (when x=0) and the overall progress is floor(100*prefix_sum/T). Since we are considering p from 0 to 100, and the overall progress must be at least the progress of the previous files, we don't have to worry about negative.\n\n          But note: the entire process starts with 0, and the overall progress is increasing. The second condition for p is only considered if the overall progress is at least p. However, we are iterating p from 0 to 100, and for a fixed file i, the overall progress at the start of the file is floor(100*prefix_sum/T). So if p is greater than that, then we require that x is enough to bring the overall progress to p.\n\n          However, we are iterating p independently, so we must consider all p.\n\n        But note: the second condition must hold at the same time as the first condition. We are combining:\n\n          x must be in [max(x_min1, low_bound_second), min(x_max1-1, high_bound_second)] and also x must be in [0, a_i].\n\n        However, note: the first condition's x_min1 is computed from the current file, and the second condition's low_bound_second and high_bound_second are computed from the entire prefix and the total.\n\n        But wait: the second condition's low_bound_second might be negative, then we set to 0.\n\n        Steps for fixed file i and fixed p:\n\n          Let L1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n          Let R1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   [then the x for the first condition must be in [L1, R1-1] (if R1-1 >= L1, otherwise no solution from the first condition alone)\n\n          Then, from the second condition:\n\n            Let A = p * T - 100 * prefix_sum\n            Let B = (p+1)*T - 100 * prefix_sum\n\n            Then x must be >= ceil(A/100) and x must be < B/100.\n\n            We can compute:\n                L2 = ceil(A/100) if A > 0 else 0   [if A<=0 then any x>=0 works, so we set L2=0]\n                But note: if A is negative, then even x=0 satisfies, so L2=0.\n\n            However, we can compute L2 without branching by: L2 = (A + 99) // 100 if A >= 0 else 0, but wait: if A is negative, then (A+99)//100 might be negative, so we set L2 = max(0, (A+99)//100) if A>=0, and if A<0 then L2=0.\n\n            Actually, we can do: L2 = (A + 99) // 100 if A >= 0 else 0   [but if A is negative, then (A+99)//100 might be negative, so we take max(0, ...)]\n\n            Alternatively, we can use: \n                if A < 0:\n                    L2 = 0\n                else:\n                    L2 = (A + 99) // 100\n\n            Similarly, for the upper bound:\n\n                Condition: x < B/100   -> x <= floor((B-1)/100)   [because x must be integer]\n\n                But note: B might be negative, then the condition fails? Actually, the overall progress must be at least p, so if p is too high then B might be negative? No, because T = total, and prefix_sum is fixed, and p from 0 to 100, so (p+1)*T >= 100*prefix_sum? Not necessarily.\n\n            Actually, the condition for the second condition is:\n\n                100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T\n\n            But note: prefix_sum is the sum of the previous files, and T is the total. The maximum overall progress is 100, so (p+1)*T might be very large? Actually, we are iterating p from 0 to 100, so (p+1)*T is at most 101*T, which is okay.\n\n            However, the condition 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T might be always true if (p+1)*T is very large, but we are only interested in x in [0, a_i]. So the upper bound for x from the second condition is min(a_i, floor((B-1)/100))? \n\n            Actually, we can set:\n\n                H2 = (B - 1) // 100   [floor((B-1)/100)]? \n\n            But note: we want the largest integer x such that 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T.\n\n            We have: 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T\n            => x < ((p+1)*T - 100*prefix_sum) / 100 = B/100.\n\n            Then x <= floor((B-1)/100) is the same as x < B/100? \n\n            Example: B=100, then x < 100/100 -> x<1 -> so x<=0. Then floor((100-1)/100)=floor(99/100)=0. Correct.\n\n            Example: B=101, then x < 101/100 -> x<1.01 -> so x<=1, then floor((101-1)/100)=floor(100/100)=1 -> correct.\n\n            Example: B=200, then x < 2 -> x<=1, then floor((200-1)/100)=floor(199/100)=1 -> correct.\n\n            So H2 = (B-1)//100   [this is integer floor division, and it gives the largest integer strictly less than B/100]\n\n            But note: if B is negative, then (B-1)//100 is negative, and then we set the upper bound to negative? That doesn't make sense because x>=0.\n\n            So we should set H2 = min(a_i, (B-1)//100) if (B-1)//100 >=0, but if (B-1)//100 is negative, then no x satisfies the second condition (because x>=0 and the condition requires x < B/100, and B/100 is negative, so x must be negative, which is impossible). \n\n            Actually, we can set:\n\n                H2 = (B-1) // 100   [if B-1 is negative, then H2 is negative, then the valid x must be from 0 to H2, which is empty if H2<0]\n\n            Then the condition for the second condition is x in [L2, H2] (if L2<=H2) and x>=0 and x<=a_i.\n\n        Then, for the fixed file i and fixed p, we have:\n\n            x must be in [L1, R1-1] (from the first condition) and [L2, H2] (from the second condition) and [0, a_i] (trivially).\n\n        Then the intersection is [max(L1, L2, 0), min(R1-1, H2, a_i)] and we require that the lower bound <= the upper bound.\n\n        Then if there exists an integer x in that interval, then p is achieved during file i.\n\n        However, note: the first condition's interval is [L1, R1-1] and the second condition's interval is [L2, H2] (both inclusive). \n\n        But wait: the first condition's interval is inclusive of L1 and exclusive of R1 (meaning x from L1 to R1-1). The second condition's interval is inclusive of L2 and H2 (because H2 is defined as the largest integer strictly less than B/100). So both conditions are inclusive.\n\n        Therefore, we can combine the intervals.\n\n 5. We must do this for every file and every p from 0 to 100, and collect the p's that appear at least once.\n\n 6. However, note: the same p might be achieved in multiple files, but we only need to output each p once.\n\n 7. But note: the overall progress bar might show the same p at multiple moments, but we only care if it happens.\n\n 8. Implementation:\n\n        Read n\n        Read list a of n integers.\n\n        T = sum(a)\n\n        Let ans = set()   # to collect all p that appear\n\n        prefix_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a_i = a[i]\n            # This file's progress bar: from 0 to 100, but we consider p from 0 to 100.\n\n            # For each p from 0 to 100:\n            for p in range(0, 101):\n                # First condition: \n                #   L1 = ceil(p * a_i / 100) = (p*a_i + 99) // 100\n                L1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n                #   R1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   [then x must be <= R1-1]\n                R1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100\n\n                # The first condition requires x in [L1, R1-1] (if L1 <= R1-1, else skip)\n                if L1 > R1-1:\n                    continue\n\n                # Second condition:\n\n                #   Condition: 100*(prefix_sum+x) >= p*T and 100*(prefix_sum+x) < (p+1)*T.\n\n                #   Let A = p*T - 100*prefix_sum\n                A = p * T - 100 * prefix_sum\n                B = (p+1)*T - 100 * prefix_sum\n\n                #   Then the second condition requires:\n                #       x >= ceil(A/100) if A > 0, else 0.\n                #   But we can compute L2 = (A + 99) // 100 if A>=0 else 0, then clamp to at least 0.\n                if A < 0:\n                    L2 = 0\n                else:\n                    L2 = (A + 99) // 100\n\n                #   And the upper bound: H2 = (B-1) // 100   [largest integer strictly less than B/100]\n\n                #   But note: if B-1 is negative, then (B-1)//100 is negative, then the interval [L2, H2] is empty if L2>H2.\n\n                H2 = (B - 1) // 100\n\n                # Now, the x must be in [L2, H2] (inclusive) and also in [0, a_i] (but L2 is at least 0, and H2 might be negative).\n\n                # Check if [L2, H2] is valid: if H2 < L2, skip.\n\n                if H2 < L2:\n                    continue\n\n                # Now, the common x must be in [max(L1, L2), min(R1-1, H2, a_i)] and the interval must be non-empty.\n\n                low_x = max(L1, L2)\n                high_x = min(R1-1, H2, a_i)\n\n                if low_x <= high_x:\n                    # Then there exists an x (at least one) that satisfies both conditions for this p in this file.\n                    ans.add(p)\n\n            # Update prefix_sum for the next file\n            prefix_sum += a_i\n\n        Then, we output all p in ans, sorted.\n\n 9. But wait: what if the same p is achieved in multiple files? Then we use a set.\n\n 10. However, we must consider: is it possible that the same p appears in multiple files? Yes, but we only need to output it once.\n\n 11. Let's test with the first example: ['1\\n6'] -> one file of 6 bytes.\n\n        n=1, a=[6], T=6.\n\n        prefix_sum=0 for the first (and only) file.\n\n        p from 0 to 100.\n\n        For p=0:\n            First condition: L1 = (0*6+99)//100 = 0, R1 = (1*6)//100=0, then [0, -1] -> invalid? \n\n        Correction: for p=0, the condition for the first progress bar is: floor(100*x/6)=0.\n\n            x must be in [0, (1*6)//100] -> [0,0] (because (0+99)//100=0, and (1*6)//100=0, then R1-1=-1). So no x for p=0? \n\n        But wait: the first condition: floor(100*x/6)=0 -> 0 <= 100*x/6 < 1 -> x in [0, 0.06] -> so x=0 is the only solution.\n\n        Then why did we set R1 = (p+1)*a_i//100 = 0? Then the interval is [0, -1] -> empty.\n\n        The issue: (p+1)*a_i//100 is the floor of (p+1)*a_i/100. For p=0, (1*6)//100=0. Then the condition is x < 0.6, so x can be 0. But our representation for the first condition was [L1, R1-1] which is [0, -1] -> which is empty.\n\n        We made a mistake: the first condition's upper bound is not R1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 that can be displayed simultaneously on both progress bars at any point during the copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the copying process of multiple files and checking for each percentage value (0 to 100) if there exists a moment when both progress bars display the same value. The key insight is that for each file, we can compute the range of bytes copied within that file that would result in a specific percentage on the first progress bar. Then, for each such byte range, we check if the corresponding cumulative byte count meets the condition for the same percentage on the second progress bar.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each file and each percentage value (0 to 100), we calculate the minimum and maximum bytes that need to be copied in the current file to achieve that percentage on the first progress bar. We then determine the range of bytes copied in the current file that would also result in the same percentage on the second progress bar, considering the cumulative bytes from previous files. If there's an overlap between these two ranges, the percentage is valid.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over each file and each percentage value (0 to 100). For each combination, it calculates the valid byte ranges for both progress bars using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies. The solution checks for overlapping ranges and collects all valid percentages in a set to ensure uniqueness.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each file and each percentage value (100 files * 101 percentages = 10,100 iterations). For each iteration, it performs constant-time arithmetic operations, making the overall complexity O(n * 101), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(a_list)\n    prefix_sum = 0\n    valid_p = set()\n    \n    for a_i in a_list:\n        for p in range(0, 101):\n            L1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            R1 = (p + 1) * a_i // 100\n            \n            if L1 > R1 - 1:\n                continue\n                \n            A = p * total_sum - 100 * prefix_sum\n            B = (p + 1) * total_sum - 100 * prefix_sum\n            \n            if A < 0:\n                L2 = 0\n            else:\n                L2 = (A + 99) // 100\n                \n            H2 = (B - 1) // 100\n            \n            if H2 < L2:\n                continue\n                \n            low_bound = max(L1, L2)\n            high_bound = min(R1 - 1, H2, a_i)\n            \n            if low_bound <= high_bound:\n                valid_p.add(p)\n                \n        prefix_sum += a_i\n        \n    for p in sorted(valid_p):\n        print(p)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes. The total sum of all file sizes is computed once.\n2. **Iterating Over Files and Percentages**: For each file, the algorithm checks each percentage value from 0 to 100.\n3. **First Progress Bar Condition**: For each percentage, it calculates the minimum (`L1`) and maximum (`R1`) bytes that need to be copied in the current file to achieve that percentage.\n4. **Second Progress Bar Condition**: Using the cumulative bytes from previous files, it checks if the current byte count (from the first condition) results in the same percentage when considering all files copied so far. This involves calculating `L2` (minimum bytes needed) and `H2` (maximum bytes allowed) for the second condition.\n5. **Checking Overlapping Ranges**: If there exists a byte count that satisfies both conditions, the percentage is added to a set to avoid duplicates.\n6. **Output**: Finally, the valid percentages are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios where both progress bars display the same percentage by leveraging integer arithmetic and set operations to ensure correctness and uniqueness.",
