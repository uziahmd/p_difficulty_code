Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an initial string s and then n queries. Each query is of the form \"di->ti\", meaning replace every occurrence of the digit di with ti.\n\n However, note: the replacements are done sequentially, and the total length of all ti's is at most 10^5, but the initial string can be up to 10^5 and there can be up to 10^5 queries.\n\n But note: if we do direct string replacement naively for each query (like using a loop for each occurrence), then in worst-case we might have a chain reaction: replacing one digit by a long string, which then contains digits that are replaced by subsequent queries. And the total length of the string might become huge (exponential growth) so we cannot build the entire string.\n\n Instead, we need to process the queries in reverse order? Or use dynamic programming/state machines? \n\n Observation: The problem asks for the number modulo 1000000007. We can compute the number from left to right, but the replacements might change the positions and the power of 10 for each digit.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a transformation on the digits: think about how the replacements propagate.\n\n Important: The queries are applied in the given order. However, note that after a query, the string may contain new digits (from the replacement) that will be subject to future queries. But the catch is: we have only 10 digits (0-9). So we can precompute for each digit what it should be transformed into at the end, after processing all queries.\n\n However, note: the queries are sequential and a replacement in an early query might introduce digits that are then replaced by later queries. But if we process from the last query backwards, we can update the transformations.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea: \n Let f(d) be the final string that the digit d becomes after all the queries.\n\n Then, we can start from the last query and go backwards, updating the transformation for the digit being replaced.\n\n However, note: the replacement rules might refer to digits that are defined later? Actually, the queries are given in the order of application. So the last query is the last transformation.\n\n We can do:\n\n Let T be a mapping from a digit to a string (initially, for each digit d, T[d] = d).\n\n Then, we process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For a query (d -> t), we want to update T[d] to be the transformation of t (but note: in the current state, t is a string that might contain digits that have been transformed by subsequent queries). So we can do:\n\n   For each digit c in t:\n        T[d] += T[c]\n\n But wait: what if the same digit d appears multiple times? Then we must consider that each occurrence is replaced by T[c] (the current transformation for c).\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in order. In reverse processing, when we update T[d], we want to use the transformations that have been updated for the digits that appear in t (which were processed in later queries). So we must process the queries from last to first.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        s = \"222\"\n        n=2\n        queries: \n            \"2->0\"\n            \"0->7\"\n\n   We process the last query first: \n        Initially, T['0'] = \"0\", T['2'] = \"2\", ... others are themselves.\n\n        Process the last query: \"0->7\": then set T['0'] = \"7\".\n\n        Then process the first query (now the next one): \"2->0\": then set T['2'] = T['0'] which is \"7\".\n\n        Then, the entire string \"222\" becomes \"777\".\n\n   But note: the example output is 777.\n\n   Another example: \n        Input: \n            s = \"123123\"\n            n=1\n            query: \"2->00\"\n\n        Then we process the query (only one) and set T['2'] = \"00\". Then we transform the string: \n            For each char in \"123123\": \n                '1' -> '1' (unchanged)\n                '2' -> '00'\n                '3' -> '3'\n\n            So we get \"10031003\".\n\n   However, note that the example also has: \n        s = \"123123\"\n        n=1\n        query: \"3->\" (empty string)\n\n        Then T['3'] becomes empty string. Then the string becomes \"1212\".\n\n   So the plan is:\n\n        Step 1: Initialize an array (or dictionary) for T for digits '0' to '9'. Initially, T[d] = d (as a string).\n\n        Step 2: Read the n queries and store them.\n\n        Step 3: Process the queries from last to first (reverse order). For each query (d, t):\n            We set T[d] = the concatenation of T[c] for each c in t.\n\n            Why? Because when we replace d by t, then in the final result, each character in t is transformed by the subsequent transformations (which we have already processed because we are going backwards). \n\n        Step 4: Now, we have the transformation T for each digit. Then, we traverse the initial string s, and for each digit d in s, we replace it by T[d]. Then, we have to compute the number represented by the resulting string modulo 1000000007.\n\n        However, note: the resulting string might be very long? The total length of all T[d] is the sum_{d} |T[d]|. Initially, each T[d] is 1, and then we update. The total length of the transformed string is the sum over the original string of |T[d]| for each digit. But the sum of the lengths of all T[d] might be large? \n\n        But note: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. And we are updating T for each digit. However, we are storing for each digit a string, and the total length of these strings might be large because one digit might be expanded many times.\n\n        But note: we are not building the entire string explicitly until Step 4. However, Step 4 requires building the entire string? But the length might be too big (exponential growth) and we cannot build a string of length 10^5 * (average expansion factor) if the expansion factors are large.\n\n        Alternative: we can compute the number without building the entire string.\n\n        How?\n\n        We can process the transformed string from left to right, and accumulate the number. But note: the number is built by:\n\n            num = 0\n            for each char c in the transformed string:\n                num = (num * 10 + int(c)) % mod\n\n        However, the transformed string might be huge (in terms of length) but the modulus is 10^9+7. But even if we build the string, the length might be astronomical (because each replacement might be long and recursive). \n\n        But wait: the problem says the total length of all ti in the queries is at most 10^5. And we are updating the transformations by concatenating the current transformations for each digit in ti. This means that the total length of the transformed string for a single digit might be large, but note that we are only storing the transformations for the 10 digits. The entire transformation for a digit is stored as a string, and the total length of these 10 strings might be large.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say that the sum of the lengths of the ti (the replacement strings) for all queries is at most 10^5. But during the reverse processing, we are expanding the replacement strings by replacing each digit in ti by its transformation. This expansion might lead to very long strings.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of the ti in the input is <= 10^5, but the expansion is done recursively. The worst-case expansion might be exponential, but note that the queries are at most 10^5 and the digits are only 10, so we can use dynamic programming and store the transformation for each digit as a string, but we have to be careful about the length.\n\n        However, the problem says: the sum of the lengths of the ti (the replacement strings) for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. But in our reverse processing, we are not limited by the original ti's because we expand them. But note: we are only storing 10 strings (for digits 0-9). The length of each transformation T[d] is the length after applying all the subsequent queries. \n\n        But note: the total length of the transformed string for the entire initial string might be huge (like 10^(number of queries) * |s|) and we cannot build it.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid building the entire string.\n\n        Alternate approach: \n\n        We can compute the value of the entire transformed string without building it by processing the initial string and the transformations in a streaming fashion, but we have to account for the fact that the transformation for a digit is a string of digits. \n\n        However, we can precompute for each digit d:\n            value[d] = the value (mod 1000000007) of the string T[d]\n            length[d] = the length (number of digits) of the string T[d]\n\n        Then, when we have the entire transformed string, we can process it as:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each digit d in the initial string:\n                Let v = value[d]   (the value of T[d])\n                Let L = length[d]   (the number of digits in T[d])\n\n                Then, we can update the result as:\n\n                result = (result * (10 ** L) + v) % mod\n\n        But note: the transformed string is the concatenation of the T[d_i] for each digit d_i in the initial string.\n\n        However, the value of T[d] is not independent of the position: because when we have two consecutive digits d1 and d2, the transformation T[d1] is placed at a higher power of 10 than T[d2] (if d1 comes before d2). Specifically, if we have two parts: part1 and part2, then the whole number is part1 * (10^(len(part2))) + part2.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            total_value = 0\n            total_length = 0\n\n            For each digit d in the initial string (from left to right):\n                Let L_d = length[d]   (the length of T[d])\n                Let V_d = value[d]    (the value of T[d])\n\n                Then, the current part (T[d]) will be appended to the right. So we need to shift the current total_value by L_d digits and add V_d.\n\n                total_value = (total_value * pow(10, L_d, mod) + V_d) % mod\n\n                And we also need to keep track of the total length? Actually, no: we only use the length to compute the power of 10 for shifting.\n\n            But wait: we don't know the entire transformed string's length until we process all digits? Actually, we can precompute for each digit d: \n                value[d] and len[d] (the length of T[d])\n\n            Then, we can process the initial string from left to right, and for each digit d, we multiply the current result by (10^(len[d])) and add value[d].\n\n        However, there is a catch: the transformation T[d] is defined recursively, and we are going to update the value[d] and len[d] for each digit during the reverse processing of queries.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let mod = 1000000007.\n\n          Step 1: Initialize for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n                  value[d] = int(d)   [if d is a digit, then value[d] = d converted to integer]\n                  len[d] = 1\n\n          Step 2: We are going to process the queries from last to first. For each query (d, t):\n\n                  We want to update the transformation for d.\n\n                  The new value for d is the value of the string obtained by concatenating the transformations of each digit in t.\n\n                  Similarly, the new length for d is the sum of the lengths of the transformations for each digit in t.\n\n                  But note: we cannot simply set value[d] to the integer value of the entire transformed string T[d] because T[d] might be very long and we cannot convert it to an integer directly (it might be too big). However, we are storing value[d] modulo mod, and the length is just the count of digits (which is an integer, and the maximum length is at most 10^5 * (some expansion) but note: the total expansion is bounded by the fact that the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion is recursive and the length might be large? \n\n                  However, the problem says the sum of the lengths of the ti (the replacement strings) for all queries is <= 10^5. But during reverse processing, the length of T[d] can be large. But note: the modulus for the value is 1000000007, and the length is used only for shifting (and the length itself is used to compute the power of 10). The length of T[d] might be very large (exceeding the modulus) but we are storing it as an integer. \n\n                  However, the maximum length: initially, each T[d] has length 1. Then, in a query, we replace a digit by a string of length L, and that digit's transformation becomes the concatenation of the current transformations of the digits in the replacement string. The length update is additive (each digit c in the replacement string contributes len[c]). The maximum length we can get is the sum of the lengths of the transformations of all the digits in the replacement string, and the total expansion factor is additive.\n\n                  But note: the total length of the replacement strings in the input is 10^5, but the expansion is done recursively. The worst-case expansion might be: if we have a query that replaces a digit by a string containing that same digit, then we get an infinite recursion? Actually, we are processing the queries in reverse order and updating the transformations. The update for a query does not depend on the same digit appearing in the replacement until we process a query that comes earlier (which we haven't updated yet because we are going backwards). \n\n                  Example: \n                      Query1: \"2->0\"\n                      Query2: \"0->2\"\n\n                  Then, processing in reverse order:\n\n                      First, update for \"0->2\": set T['0'] = T['2'] (but at this point, T['2'] is still \"2\", so T['0'] becomes \"2\")\n                      Then, update for \"2->0\": set T['2'] = T['0'] which is now \"2\"\n\n                  Then, both become \"2\". This is a fixed point.\n\n                  But what if we have:\n\n                      Query1: \"2->00\"\n                      Query2: \"0->2\"\n\n                  Reverse processing:\n\n                      First, update for \"0->2\": set T['0'] = T['2'] (which is currently \"2\") -> so T['0'] = \"2\"\n                      Then, update for \"2->00\": set T['2'] = T['0'] + T['0'] = \"2\"+\"2\" = \"22\"\n\n                  Then, the initial string \"2\" becomes \"22\", and \"0\" becomes \"2\".\n\n                  This is correct: \n                    Without the second query, the first query would turn \"2\" into \"00\", and then the second query (if applied after) turns \"00\" into \"22\". So in reverse, we do the second query first and then the first.\n\n                  How to update value[d]?\n\n                  We cannot simply use the value of the entire string T[d] because T[d] might be long. But note: the entire string T[d] is the concatenation of the transformations of the digits in t. So:\n\n                  Let t be the replacement string.\n\n                  Then, the value for d is computed by:\n\n                    value[d] = 0\n                    For each digit c in t (from left to right):\n                         value[d] = (value[d] * (10 ** len[c]) + value[c]) % mod\n\n                  Similarly, the length for d is the sum of len[c] for each c in t.\n\n                  But note: the length is just the total number of digits, so:\n\n                    len[d] = sum(len[c] for c in t)\n\n                  However, the problem: we are updating the transformations for the digits, and the same digit might be updated multiple times (in the reverse processing). Also, the replacement string t can contain any digit (0-9) and the transformation for that digit might have been updated in a previous (later) query.\n\n                  So the update for a query (d, t) is:\n\n                    new_len = 0\n                    new_value = 0\n                    for each char c in t:\n                        new_len = (new_len + len[c]) % ???   # but note: the length is used for exponentiation (shifting) and we need the actual length (not modulo) because the exponentiation base 10 is done with exponents that are the length (which might be huge, but we are only storing the length as an integer). However, the length might be astronomically large (like 10^100000) and we cannot store that as an integer.\n\n                  But note: the modulus for the value is 1000000007, but the length is used to compute the power of 10. However, the modulus for the exponentiation is not the same. We have to use modular exponentiation for the value, but the length is used in the exponent. \n\n                  However, the problem: the length might be very large (exceeding the modulus) but Euler's theorem requires the modulus to be coprime, and 10 and mod (10^9+7) are coprime, so we can reduce the exponent modulo phi(mod) for modulus operations? But note: the exponentiation base 10 and modulus 1000000007: we can use pow(10, exponent, mod) but the exponent is the length. However, the length is the total number of digits, and the exponent can be huge (like 10^18 or more). But the modulus for exponents in modular exponentiation is not the modulus of the base, but we can use Euler's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo phi(1000000007) if we know that 10 and mod are coprime.\n\n                  However, note: the modulus for the exponentiation is 1000000007, and the exponent is the length (number of digits). The length is an integer, and we can use:\n\n                    base = 10\n                    exponent = L (the length, which is the total number of digits to shift)\n\n                    Then, we compute (base ** exponent) % mod.\n\n                  But the exponent L might be huge. We can use pow(10, L, mod) which uses modular exponentiation and can handle exponents that are integers (even very big) efficiently (in logarithmic time). However, the problem is that L might be too big to represent as an integer? \n\n                  But note: the total length of the transformed string for one digit might be huge because of the recursive expansions. However, the problem states that the sum of the lengths of the ti (the replacement strings) for all queries is <= 10^5, but the expansion is done for each query. \n\n                  The worst-case expansion: \n                    Suppose we have a query that replaces a digit d by a string containing d, then the expansion factor is multiplicative. \n\n                  However, we are storing the length as an integer. The length of the transformation for a digit might be the sum of the lengths of the transformations of the digits in the replacement string. This is additive. \n\n                  But note: the initial length for each digit is 1. Then, if a query replaces a digit d by a string of k digits, then the new length for d is the sum of the lengths of the k digits. \n\n                  Example: \n                    Start with all digits having length 1.\n                    Query: \"0->11\" -> then T['0'] becomes T['1']+T['1'] -> length = 1+1 = 2.\n                    Then, if we have a query \"1->00\", then T['1'] becomes T['0']+T['0'] -> length = 2+2 = 4.\n\n                  Then, if we have a query \"0->11\" again, then T['0'] becomes T['1']+T['1'] -> length = 4+4 = 8.\n\n                  So the length grows exponentially. \n\n                  The maximum length we can store: the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion is done recursively and the length of a transformation might become 2^(number of queries that affect that digit) * (initial length). \n\n                  However, the problem says the total length of the ti (the replacement strings) for all queries is <= 10^5. This is the raw input, but the expansion might produce very long strings.\n\n                  But note: we are storing the length for each digit. The length is an integer. The problem constraints say that the total length of the replacement strings is <= 10^5, but the expansion might lead to a length that is, say, 2^(10^5) which is way too big to store.\n\n                  We cannot store such huge integers.\n\n        Alternative approach: \n\n        We must avoid storing the entire transformed string and avoid storing the length as an integer that might be huge.\n\n        Insight: the modulus is 1000000007. The value of the entire transformed string is computed modulo 1000000007. We can compute the value and the length (for shifting) without storing the entire string.\n\n        However, the length is needed for the shifting: to shift the current accumulated value by L digits, we multiply by 10^L. But if L is huge (say, 10^18) then we can compute 10^L mod 1000000007 using modular exponentiation, which is efficient (logarithmic in L). But the issue is that we need to know L (the exponent) as an integer, and if L is too big (like 10^18) then we can store it as an integer because 10^18 is a 64-bit integer (Python can handle that). But what if the exponent is 10^5? Then 10^100000 is a number with 100000 digits, and we cannot compute 10^(100000) mod 1000000007 by standard exponentiation? Actually, we can: using pow(base, exponent, modulus) with modulus=1000000007, the exponent can be an integer of any size (as long as we can represent it) and the algorithm is logarithmic in the exponent.\n\n        However, the problem is that the length (the exponent) might be so huge that it cannot be stored as an integer (like 2^100000, which is a number with about 30000 digits). Then we cannot store it.\n\n        We need to avoid storing the length as an integer. \n\n        Alternate idea: use the transformation rules to compute the value and the length (mod something) without storing the entire string. But note: the length is used for shifting, and the shifting is done by multiplying the current value by 10^(length) and then adding the value of the next part.\n\n        However, we can store the value and the length (as an integer) for each digit, and update them in the reverse processing. But the length might be too big (exponential) and we cannot store the entire length.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints say that the total length of the replacement strings (the ti) in the input is <= 10^5. However, the expansion is done recursively. The length of the transformation for a digit is the sum of the lengths of the transformations of the digits in the replacement string. \n\n        The maximum length we might get: \n\n          Let F(d) be the length of the transformation for digit d.\n\n          Initially, F(d) = 1 for all d.\n\n          Then, for a query (d, t): \n              F(d) = sum_{c in t} F(c)\n\n          Similarly, the value V(d) is computed by:\n\n              V(d) = 0\n              for each c in t:\n                 V(d) = (V(d) * (10 ** F(c)) + V(c)) % mod\n\n          But note: the exponent F(c) might be huge (so 10 ** F(c) mod mod is computed by pow(10, F(c), mod)), but if F(c) is huge, then we cannot compute that because F(c) is too big to represent.\n\n        We must avoid storing F(c) as an integer.\n\n        How?\n\n        We can use the fact that the transformation for each digit is linear in terms of the contributions from the replacement string. But note: the value and the length are two separate things.\n\n        However, we can store the value and the length (the length is the exponent) modulo the totient function for the modulus? But the modulus for the exponent in modular exponentiation is the totient of 1000000007, which is 1000000006 (if 1000000007 is prime). Then, we can use:\n\n          10^k mod 1000000007 = 10^(k mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007   [by Euler's theorem, provided k >= 0 and 10 and 1000000007 are coprime]\n\n        But note: Euler's theorem requires that base and modulus are coprime, and 10 and 1000000007 are coprime. So we can reduce the exponent k modulo 1000000006 (phi(1000000007)=1000000006).\n\n        Then, we can store for each digit d:\n            value[d] = the value of T[d] mod 1000000007\n            len_mod[d] = the length of T[d] modulo 1000000006\n\n        Then, when updating a query (d, t):\n\n            new_value = 0\n            new_len = 0   (this is the length modulo 1000000006)\n\n            for each c in t:\n                # Compute the contribution of the transformation for c: \n                # The value part: we have to shift the current new_value by (length of T[c]) and add value[c]\n                # But the length of T[c] is stored as len_mod[c] (which is the length modulo 1000000006)\n\n                # However, note: the shifting factor is 10^(len_mod[c]), but wait: the actual length is L = (actual length) which we don't store. But we are storing the length modulo 1000000006 for the purpose of modular exponentiation.\n\n                # But the value computation requires the exact length? Actually, no: because the value of T[d] is computed by:\n\n                #   T[d] = T[c1] + T[c2] + ... \n\n                # and the value is: \n                #   value[d] = (value[c1] * (10^(len(c2)+...+len(ck)) + value[c2] * (10^(len(c3)+...+len(ck)) + ... ) % mod\n\n                # But we can break it down by processing the digits in t from left to right:\n\n                #   Let the current accumulated value be 'acc' and the current total length (for shifting) be 'shift' (which is the sum of the lengths of the following transformations). \n\n                # However, we are storing the length modulo 1000000006 for the exponent. But note: the exponent (the length) is used in the shifting, and we are storing the exponent modulo 1000000006. Then, when we do:\n\n                #   new_value = (new_value * (10^(len(c)) + value[c])) % mod\n\n                # But wait: the shifting factor is 10^(len(c)) for the entire T[c]? No, actually, the shifting factor for the entire T[c] is 10^(total length of the rest) but we are processing left-to-right and we don't know the rest. \n\n                # Alternatively, we can process the replacement string t from left to right and for each digit c:\n\n                #   new_value = (new_value * (10^(F(c))) + value[c]) % mod\n\n                # where F(c) is the length of T[c]. But we don't store F(c) exactly, we store it modulo 1000000006 (call it L_c).

For each query, update the transformation for the queried digit by concatenating the transformations of the characters in its replacement string. This ensures that each digit's transformation accounts for all subsequent transformations.\n3. **Efficient Value Calculation**: For each digit's transformation, compute its value modulo 1000000007 by iteratively combining the values of its constituent characters, using modular exponentiation for efficient power calculations.\n4. **Result Construction**: After processing all queries, construct the final number by processing the initial string from left to right, combining the transformations of each digit using their respective lengths and values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\nPHI_MOD = 1000000006  # Euler's totient for MOD\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        q = data[i].strip()\n        if len(q) > 0:\n            parts = q.split('->')\n            if len(parts) == 2:\n                queries.append((parts[0], parts[1]))\n    \n    val = {}\n    length_mod = {}\n    for digit in '0123456789':\n        val[digit] = int(digit)\n        length_mod[digit] = 1\n    \n    if n > 0:\n        for i in range(len(queries) - 1, -1, -1):\n            d_str, t_str = queries[i]\n            d = d_str\n            new_val = 0\n            new_len = 0\n            for c in t_str:\n                new_val = (new_val * pow(10, length_mod[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n                new_len = (new_len + length_mod[c]) % PHI_MOD\n            \n            val[d] = new_val\n            length_mod[d] = new_len % PHI_MOD\n    \n    result = 0\n    total_shift = 1\n    for char in s:\n        result = (result * pow(10, length_mod[char], MOD) + val[char]) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input string and queries. It initializes dictionaries `val` and `length_mod` to store the value and length (mod 1000000006) for each digit.\n2. **Reverse Query Processing**: The queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the transformation for the queried digit is updated by combining the transformations of the characters in its replacement string. The new value is computed by shifting the current accumulated value by the length of each character's transformation and adding its value, modulo 1000000007. The new length is the sum of the lengths of the characters' transformations, modulo 1000000006.\n3. **Result Construction**: After processing all queries, the initial string is processed from left to right. For each digit, the result is updated by shifting the current result by the digit's transformation length and adding its value, again modulo 1000000007.
