Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a (angle in degrees)\n\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 formed by the points v1, v2, v3 is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Note: The angle at vertex v2 is the angle between the two sides (v1, v2) and (v2, v3). In a regular convex polygon, the vertices are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n Observation:\n Since the polygon is regular and convex, we can consider the circle on which all vertices lie.\n\n The key idea is to note that the angle we are measuring is an inscribed angle. However, note that the problem does not require the angle to be inscribed in the usual sense? Actually, the angle is formed by three points on the circle.\n\n But note: the entire figure is a regular convex polygon, so the points are on a circle. The angle at v2 is the angle of the triangle (v1, v2, v3) at v2.\n\n There's a known fact: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. However, note that our angle might not be an inscribed angle in the standard way because the center of the circle is not necessarily involved. But we can use the circle properties.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Let the center of the polygon (circle) be O. Then the central angles between consecutive vertices are 360/n degrees.\n\n The angle at vertex v2 (the angle of the triangle v1, v2, v3) can be calculated using the law of cosines or by using the formula for the angle between two chords.\n\n However, there is a simpler way: \n\n Consider the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. But note: the angle at v2 is determined by the two adjacent sides. Actually, the entire circle is 360 degrees.\n\n But note: the problem says the polygon has n sides, so the central angle between two consecutive vertices is 360/n.\n\n The angle at vertex v2 (the angle of the polygon at that vertex) for the polygon itself (the internal angle) is ((n-2)/n)*180, but that is the internal angle of the polygon. Here we are forming an angle with two edges that are not necessarily the polygon edges.\n\n However, note: the three points must be vertices of the polygon.\n\n We are allowed to pick any three distinct vertices.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let the three points be A, B, C (with B being the vertex). Then the angle ABC is the angle we are interested in.\n\n We can consider the circle and the arcs AC, but actually the angle at B is related to the arcs from A to C that do not contain B.\n\n There are two arcs from A to C: the minor arc and the major arc. The angle at B is half the difference of the arcs? Actually, wait: we are forming an angle at B. In circle geometry, the angle formed by two chords BA and BC is half the difference of the intercepted arcs? Actually, no: the angle is half the difference of the arcs? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the angle at B is the same as the angle between the vectors BA and BC.\n\n But note: we are in a regular polygon, so the circle is fixed and the central angles are known.\n\n Another approach: we can fix the vertex v2 and then consider the two other vertices. However, n can be up to 10^5 so we cannot iterate over all triples.\n\n Insight:\n\n The problem requires the closest angle to a. Therefore, we are allowed to consider angles that are close to a.\n\n In a regular n-gon, the possible angles are constrained by the geometry.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Note that the entire circle is 360 degrees. The vertices are equally spaced.\n\n 2. The angle we are going to form at vertex v2 (which is one of the n vertices) can be calculated by the central angles.\n\n 3. Consider two points (v1 and v3) and the vertex v2. The angle at v2 is determined by the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n Actually, we can use the following:\n\n Let the circle have center O. Then the angle at B (vertex v2) is given by:\n\n   angle = 180 - (central_angle_AOC)/2   [if we consider the triangle ABC and the circumcircle]?\n\n But wait, in circle geometry, the angle at the circumference is half the central angle subtended by the same arc. However, in our case, the angle at B is formed by two chords: BA and BC. The angle at B is half the difference of the two arcs: the arc AC that is opposite to B and the arc that is the rest? Actually, for an inscribed angle, if the angle is formed by two chords that meet at B on the circle, then the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs? \n\n Actually, let me recall: the inscribed angle theorem states that the angle formed by two chords meeting at a point on the circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But note: our angle at B intercepts two arcs: one from A to C (the one that doesn't contain B) and the other one? Actually, the standard inscribed angle only uses one arc. However, if we consider the triangle ABC, the angle at B intercepts the arc AC (the one that is opposite to B). So the angle at B is half the central angle of the arc AC (the one that does not contain B). But wait, in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the central angle of the intercepted arc.\n\n However, note: in our case, the angle at B is the angle between the chords BA and BC, and the intercepted arc is the arc from A to C that does not contain B. Let me denote the central angle for the arc AC (not containing B) as theta, then the inscribed angle at B is theta/2.\n\n But wait: actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the arc that the angle \"sees\". For example, if we have points A, B, C on a circle, the angle at B is the angle of the triangle, and it intercepts the arc AC (the one opposite to B). Then the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\n However, note: the entire circle is 360 degrees. The intercepted arc AC (opposite to B) is the arc from A to C that does not contain B. But there are two possibilities: the minor arc and the major arc. The inscribed angle theorem uses the minor arc? Actually, no: the theorem says the angle is half the intercepted arc (which is the one that the angle \"subtends\"). But note: the angle at B must be the one that subtends the arc AC (the one that does not contain B). However, in a convex polygon and since we are taking three distinct vertices, the arc AC that does not contain B is the one that is opposite to B.\n\n But wait: in a circle, the inscribed angle is always the smaller angle. However, note that the angle at B in the triangle is always less than 180 degrees (because the polygon is convex and we are taking three distinct vertices). So we take the intercepted arc as the one that is opposite to B, and that arc must be less than 360 degrees.\n\n However, there's a catch: the angle we are calculating from the inscribed angle theorem is for the arc AC (opposite to B). But note: the arc AC (opposite to B) is the one that does not contain B, and that arc has a central angle that we can compute.\n\n How to compute the central angle for arc AC (not containing B)?\n\n Let the total central angle per step be step = 360 / n.\n\n We can label the vertices as 0,1,...,n-1 (then map to 1-indexed).\n\n Without loss of generality, fix B at position 0. Then A and C are two other points. The positions of A and C are two indices i and j (from 1 to n-1). The two arcs from A to C that don't contain B: Actually, we have two ways to go from A to C: one passing through B and the other not. We want the arc that does not contain B.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the entire circle and the two points A and C. The circle is broken into two arcs by A and C. Then the arc that does not contain B is the one that is opposite to B.\n\n However, note: the angle at B is formed by the two chords BA and BC. The intercepted arc is the arc AC that does not contain B. So the central angle for that arc is the angle from A to C that goes the long way (if B is between A and C in the short way, then the intercepted arc is the long way). But actually, the angle at B is determined by the two points A and C and the circle. The inscribed angle theorem says:\n\n   angle_B = (arc_AC) / 2\n\n where arc_AC is the intercepted arc (the one opposite to B) and must be the arc that is not containing B.\n\n But note: the intercepted arc is the one that the angle \"sees\", and that is the arc between A and C that is not containing B.\n\n However, there is also a possibility: the angle could be the reflex angle? But the problem states that the polygon is convex and the angle is measured in the usual way (the smaller angle). So the angle we are considering is the one inside the polygon? Actually, the problem does not specify, but note the example: in the square, the angle of 45 degrees was chosen (which is the acute angle) and 90 degrees was chosen (which is the right angle). Also, the problem says \"the value\" and we are comparing absolute differences.\n\n But note: in the square, the possible angles we can form are 45 and 90. Why 45? \n Example: Square with vertices 1,2,3,4 (clockwise). \n  If we take v1=1, v2=2, v3=4: \n    Then the angle at 2: the two sides are from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 3? Wait, no: the three points are 1,2,4. So the sides are from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 4. In the square, the side from 2 to 4 is a diagonal. So the angle at 2 is the angle between the side 2-1 and the diagonal 2-4.\n\n How do we calculate that angle? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the square is inscribed in a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 90 degrees.\n\n The chord from 2 to 1: central angle 90 degrees.\n The chord from 2 to 4: central angle 90 * (how many steps?) from 2 to 4: if the square is labeled 1,2,3,4 in clockwise, then from 2 to 4: \n   If we go from 2 to 3 to 4, that's 180 degrees (two steps). But wait, the circle has 360, so the central angle for the chord 2-4 is 180 degrees (diameter). Then the inscribed angle for the arc from 1 to 4 (the arc that does not contain 2) is the minor arc from 1 to 4? Actually, from 1 to 4 without going through 2: that is the arc going from 1 to 4 passing through 3, which is 180 degrees (since the square). Then the inscribed angle at 2 would be half of that, i.e., 90 degrees. \n\n But wait, that gives 90 degrees. How do we get 45 degrees?\n\n The other possibility: the intercepted arc for the angle at 2 (when the three points are 1,2,4) is the arc from 1 to 4 that does contain 2? Actually, the standard inscribed angle theorem applies to the arc that is opposite to the angle. The angle at 2 is formed by the chords 2-1 and 2-4. The intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2, which is the semicircle (180 degrees). Then the angle should be 90 degrees.\n\n But wait, the example says: \n   Input: 4 67 -> output: 2 1 3 (which gives an angle of 45 degrees) and 4 68 -> output: 4 1 2 (which gives 90 degrees).\n\n How do we get 45 degrees?\n\n Let's take the example of 4 67: \n   Output: \"2 1 3\"\n\n This means: v1=1, v2=2, v3=3? But wait, the output is \"2 1 3\", meaning the vertex v2 is 2, and the other two are 1 and 3.\n\n Then the angle at 2: the two sides are from 2 to 1 and from 2 to 3. In the square, the side from 2 to 1 is one edge, and the side from 2 to 3 is the next edge. So the angle at 2 is the internal angle of the square, which is 90 degrees. But wait, the example says 45 degrees was chosen because |45-67| < |90-67|. So how do we get 45?\n\n The example input is \"4 67\", and the output is \"2 1 3\" (which gives 90) but wait, the sample output is \"2 1 3\" for the second sample test? Actually, the sample input provided was:\n\n   Input: ['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n   Output: ['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n But wait, the first sample test is n=3, a=15. The output is \"1 2 3\", which is the entire triangle. The angle for a triangle (equilateral) is 60 degrees. So |60-15|=45, which is the minimal.\n\n Then the second sample test: n=4, a=67. The output is \"2 1 3\", which is the same as the third sample test? Actually, the sample outputs are:\n\n   Input: 3 15 -> output: 1 2 3\n   Input: 4 67 -> output: 2 1 3\n   Input: 4 68 -> output: 4 1 2\n\n Now, for n=4, what are the possible angles?\n\n We can form two types of angles:\n\n   Type 1: Adjacent edges (like the square's corner): this gives 90 degrees.\n   Type 2: One edge and one diagonal: the diagonal in a square is a chord that skips one vertex.\n\n How to compute the angle for Type 2?\n\n Example: Points 1, 2, 4 (in a square with vertices 1,2,3,4 in clockwise order). Then the angle at 2 is 90 degrees (as above). But wait, that is adjacent edges.\n\n Actually, let me list the possibilities for n=4:\n\n   Possibilities for three distinct vertices: \n      {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}\n\n   For {1,2,3}: the angle at 2 is 90 degrees.\n   For {1,2,4}: the angle at 2 is 90 degrees? Actually, no: the angle at 2 in {1,2,4} is the angle between the edges (2,1) and (2,4). In the square, (2,1) is an edge, and (2,4) is a diagonal. The angle between an edge and a diagonal.\n\n   How to compute the angle between two chords at a point? \n\n   We can use the dot product of vectors, but note: the circle representation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the law of cosines in the triangle (1,2,4). The sides are:\n        distance(1,2) = side of square (say s)\n        distance(2,4) = diagonal (s * sqrt(2))\n        distance(1,4) = side of square (s)\n\n   Then the triangle (1,2,4) has sides: s, s, s*sqrt(2). This is an isosceles right triangle? Actually, no: the sides are s, s, s*sqrt(2). Then the angle at 2 is between the sides of length s and s*sqrt(2)? \n\n   Wait, no: the triangle (1,2,4) has sides:\n        between 1 and 2: s\n        between 2 and 4: s * sqrt(2)\n        between 1 and 4: s\n\n   Then the triangle is isosceles with two sides of length s and base s*sqrt(2)? That doesn't make sense because the base is longer than the legs. Actually, the triangle (1,2,4) is not a right triangle. Let me draw:\n\n        Square: 1----2\n                |      |\n                4----3\n\n        Then the points 1,2,4: \n            from 1 to 2: horizontal (length s)\n            from 2 to 4: from 2 to 4: that is from (0,0) to (s,s) if we set coordinates? Actually, let me set coordinates:\n\n        Place the square with center at (0,0), vertices at (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,1) for simplicity? Or better, standard:\n\n        Let the square have vertices at (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,1) then scaled appropriately? Actually, we don't need the actual distances.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the circle with center at (0,0) and radius r. The vertices are at (r, r), (r, -r), (-r, -r), (-r, r) for a square? Actually, that would be a diamond.\n\n        Let me use a square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1) but then the edges are not aligned. \n\n        Alternatively, let the square be aligned: \n          1: (0,0), 2: (1,0), 3: (1,1), 4: (0,1)\n\n        Then:\n          Point 1: (0,0)\n          Point 2: (1,0)\n          Point 3: (1,1)\n          Point 4: (0,1)\n\n        Then the triangle (1,2,4) is (0,0), (1,0), (0,1). Then the sides are:\n          1-2: distance = 1\n          2-4: distance = sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(2)\n          1-4: distance = 1\n\n        Then the angle at 2 (point (1,0)) is between vectors from (1,0) to (0,0) and from (1,0) to (0,1). \n\n        Vector BA = (0-1, 0-0) = (-1,0)\n        Vector BC = (0-1, 1-0) = (-1,1)\n\n        The angle at B is given by the dot product:\n\n          BA • BC = (-1)*(-1) + (0)*(1) = 1\n          |BA| = 1, |BC| = sqrt(2)\n\n          cos(theta) = (BA•BC) / (|BA||BC|) = 1/(1*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2) => theta = 45 degrees.\n\n        So the angle at 2 in the triangle (1,2,4) is 45 degrees.\n\n        Similarly, for the triangle (1,3,4): \n          Points: 1(0,0), 3(1,1), 4(0,1)\n          Angle at 3: \n            Vector from 3 to 1: (0-1,0-1)=(-1,-1)\n            Vector from 3 to 4: (0-1,1-1)=(-1,0)\n            Dot product: (-1)*(-1) + (-1)*0 = 1\n            |BA| = sqrt(2), |BC| = 1\n            cos(theta) = 1/(sqrt(2)*1) = 1/sqrt(2) -> 45 degrees.\n\n        And the triangle (2,3,4):\n          Points: 2(1,0),3(1,1),4(0,1)\n          Angle at 3: \n            Vector from 3 to 2: (1-1,0-1)=(0,-1)\n            Vector from 3 to 4: (0-1,1-1)=(-1,0)\n            Dot product: 0*(-1) + (-1)*0 = 0 -> 90 degrees.\n\n        And triangle (2,3,4) also has an angle at 2 and 4. But note: we are allowed to choose any three distinct vertices, and then the angle is taken at the middle vertex (v2). So we must assign which is the middle vertex.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the order. The input specifies three distinct vertices and the middle one is the vertex of the angle.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3\" and then the angle is at v2.\n\n        So we have to choose the middle vertex arbitrarily? Actually, the problem does not say that the three points are given in any particular order. We are to output three numbers: the three vertices, and the middle one is the one that is the vertex of the angle.\n\n        How do we know which vertex is the middle? The problem says: \"the angle (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides)\".\n\n        So the three points are ordered such that the middle one (v2) is the vertex.\n\n        Therefore, for the set {1,2,4} we can assign:\n            Option 1: v2=2, then the angle is 45 degrees (as above).\n            Option 2: v2=1, then the angle is the angle at 1 between points 2 and 4: \n                      Points: 1(0,0),2(1,0),4(0,1)\n                      Vectors: from 1 to 2: (1,0), from 1 to 4: (0,1)\n                      Dot product: 1*0+0*1=0 -> angle 90 degrees.\n            Option 3: v2=4, then the angle at 4 between points 1 and 2:\n                      Points: 4(0,1),1(0,0),2(1,0)\n                      Vectors: from 4 to 1: (0,-1), from 4 to 2: (1,-1)\n                      Dot product: 0*1 + (-1)*(-1)=1, |v1|=1, |v2|=sqrt(2) -> cos(theta)=1/sqrt(2) -> 45 degrees.\n\n        So the same set {1,2,4} can yield two different angles: 45, 90, or 45 depending on which vertex we choose as the middle.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require that the three points form a triangle with the middle vertex being the one that minimizes the angle? It just says: find three distinct vertices and then choose one as the vertex of the angle.\n\n        So we are free to choose the middle vertex arbitrarily from the three.\n\n        Therefore, for each triple, we can consider the three possibilities: each vertex being the middle.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require to minimize over the three possibilities for the same triple? It just says: find three distinct vertices and then the angle at the chosen middle vertex.\n\n        So we must consider all triples? That would be too expensive (n choose 3 is about 10^15 for n=10^5).\n\n Alternative Insight:\n\n Since the polygon is regular, the angle at a vertex v2 formed by two other vertices v1 and v3 can be expressed in terms of the steps from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n Let d1 = number of steps from v2 to v1 (along the polygon) and d2 = number of steps from v2 to v3 (along the polygon). But note: we have two directions (clockwise and counterclockwise). \n\n Actually, the two points v1 and v3 can be on either side of v2. Let the entire circle be 360 degrees. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n.\n\n The angle at v2 (the inscribed angle) is half the difference of the two arcs? Actually, wait: the standard inscribed angle is for the arc that is opposite to the angle. But note: the two points v1 and v3 divide the circle into two arcs: the minor arc and the major arc. The angle at v2 (if v2 is on the circle) is half the difference of the two arcs? \n\n Actually, there is a formula for the angle between two chords: \n\n   angle = 0.5 * |arc_AC - arc_AD|   [but wait, I think I'm confusing with something else]\n\n After research, the formula for the angle between two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is the inscribed angle, which is half the intercepted arc.\n\n But note: the intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. So the central angle for the intercepted arc is (number of edges in the intercepted arc) * (360/n). Then the angle at v2 is half of that.\n\n However, wait: in our example with the square and the set {1,2,4} and v2=2, the intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2. In the square, the arc from 1 to 4 not containing 2: \n   Vertices: 1, then 4. The two arcs: one is direct (1->4) which is 90 degrees (if we count the central angle: from 1 to 4, the central angle is 90 degrees? Actually, the central angle for the arc from 1 to 4 (adjacent) is 90 degrees. But wait, the arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2: \n        The square: 1,2,3,4 in clockwise. The arc from 1 to 4 that does not contain 2 is the arc 1->4 directly? But in a square, the direct arc from 1 to 4 is 90 degrees (if we consider the circle, the square is inscribed so the central angle between 1 and 4 is 90 degrees). Then the inscribed angle at 2 would be half of 90, i.e., 45 degrees.\n\n So the formula: angle = (arc_length) / 2, where arc_length is the central angle of the intercepted arc.\n\n But note: the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite to the angle, and that arc must be the one that does not contain the vertex v2.\n\n How to compute the intercepted arc (in terms of steps)? \n\n Let the two points (v1, v3) be at distances d1 and d3 from v2 (in terms of the number of edges along the polygon). But note: the intercepted arc is the arc that connects v1 and v3 without passing through v2. \n\n Actually, the entire circle is 360. The two arcs from v1 to v3 are: \n   arc1: the one that goes through v2 (if we move from v1 to v3 passing by v2) and \n   arc2: the one that does not.\n\n The central angle for the intercepted arc (arc2) is the total central angle of the arc2 = (number of edges in arc2) * (360/n)\n\n Then the angle at v2 is (arc2) / 2.\n\n But note: the intercepted arc must be the one that is opposite to v2, so we must avoid the arc that contains v2.\n\n However, there is a catch: the angle at v2 must be the smaller angle. In the circle, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc? Actually, the inscribed angle is always the smaller one (<=180). But note: if the intercepted arc is greater than 180, then the inscribed angle would be defined for the minor arc? \n\n Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the arc that is intercepted, and the angle is half the intercepted arc. But if the intercepted arc is more than 180, then the angle would be more than 90. However, the angle in the triangle is always taken as the smaller one (between 0 and 180). \n\n But wait: the inscribed angle for an arc greater than 180 is not defined in the same way? Actually, the inscribed angle is always the minor arc? Or the theorem states that the angle is half the intercepted arc, and the intercepted arc is the one that the angle subtends, which is the one that does not contain the vertex. \n\n However, note: the angle at the circumference is half the central angle of the intercepted arc. And the intercepted arc is the one that the angle \"sees\", which is the arc between the two points. But in a circle, the angle is the same regardless of whether you take the minor or major arc? \n\n Actually, no: the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc (the one less than 180). But wait, the theorem holds for the minor arc. However, if the intercepted arc is greater than 180, then the inscribed angle would be (360 - arc) / 2, which is the reflex angle? \n\n But note: the problem states that the polygon is convex and the angle is measured in the usual way (so the angle is between 0 and 180). \n\n Therefore, we have two cases for the angle:\n\n   Case 1: The intercepted arc is <= 180, then angle = intercepted_arc / 2.\n   Case 2: The intercepted arc is > 180, then the angle at v2 is actually the other angle (the reflex angle) but the problem requires the usual angle (the one inside the triangle, which is the smaller one). \n\n However, wait: the triangle angle is always the smaller one (<=180). In fact, the angle at v2 is the minimum between the two possible angles (the one from the minor arc and the one from the major arc). \n\n But note: the inscribed angle for the minor arc is (minor_arc)/2, and the inscribed angle for the major arc (the reflex angle) is (major_arc)/2, but the reflex angle is greater than 180, so we don't use that. \n\n Actually, the standard inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc. However, in our problem, the angle at v2 is the angle of the triangle, which is the smaller angle between the two chords. \n\n How does that relate to the intercepted arc? \n\n The intercepted arc for the angle at v2 (the one we use) is the one that is opposite to v2 and is the one that is not containing v2. But note: the two arcs from v1 to v3: one contains v2 and the other does not. The intercepted arc is the one that does not contain v2. \n\n But note: the entire circle is 360. The intercepted arc (the one not containing v2) is the one that is opposite to v2, and that arc can be either the minor or the major. \n\n Then the angle at v2 is (intercepted_arc) / 2, but if the intercepted_arc is greater than 180, then the angle we see in the triangle is actually 360 - intercepted_arc? \n\n Actually, no: the triangle's angle is the smaller one. The two angles that the two chords form at v2 are (intercepted_arc/2) and (360 - intercepted_arc)/2. But note: the intercepted_arc is the arc that is opposite to v2, and the two angles are supplementary? \n\n Let me clarify: \n\n   The two chords BA and BC divide the space at B into two angles: one is the inscribed angle for the intercepted arc (arc AC not containing B) and the other is the angle for the remaining arc (arc AC containing B). \n\n   The sum of these two angles is 360 degrees? Actually, the two angles are adjacent angles that form a full circle? No, they are opposite. Actually, they are the two angles around the point B: they add up to 360. \n\n   However, the triangle only uses the angle that is facing the opposite side (the intercepted arc). But the problem says \"the angle\" (meaning the one that is formed by the two sides, and typically the one that is inside the polygon or the triangle). \n\n   In the context of the problem, the angle is the one that is part of the triangle (v1,v2,v3). The triangle angle is always the smaller one (<=180). \n\n   So if the intercepted arc (the one not containing B) is greater than 180, then the angle for the triangle is 360 - (intercepted_arc/2) ? \n\n   Let me check with the square example: \n        Set {1,2,4}: v2=2, the intercepted arc (not containing 2) is from 1 to 4 (the arc that goes from 1 to 4 without passing 2) -> that arc is 90 degrees (minor) so the angle is 45. \n\n        Now, consider the same set {1,2,4} but assign v2=1 (then the angle is 90). What is the intercepted arc when v2=1?\n            The two points are 2 and 4. The arc from 2 to 4 that does not contain 1: \n                In the square, the arc from 2 to 4 not containing 1: \n                    The square: 1,2,3,4 (clockwise). From 2 to 4: \n                        One way: 2->3->4 (contains 3, and does it contain 1? No) -> that arc is 180 degrees (because 2 steps, each 90 degrees).\n                        The other way: 2->1->4: contains 1? Yes, so we don't take that.\n                Then the intercepted arc is 180 degrees, so the angle at 1 would be 90 degrees (half of 180). \n\n        Now, consider a different example: a pentagon (n=5). Let a=180. Then we want an angle of 180. But the maximum angle in the pentagon is less than 180. However, note: the angle at a vertex for the entire polygon is ((5-2)/5)*180 = 108. But we are allowed to form any three vertices.\n\n        Example: n=5, and we want an angle of 180. The closest we can get is 108 or ...? Actually, we can get angles that are 108 (if we take the adjacent edges) and then by moving one vertex away, etc.\n\n        But note: the angle of 180 is a straight line. In a regular pentagon, can we form a straight line? Not exactly. The maximum angle we can form is less than 180.\n\n        However, the problem says: the angle is formed by three distinct vertices. In a pentagon, if we take three consecutive vertices, the angle is the internal angle of the pentagon (108). But if we take three vertices that are not consecutive, then the angle might be different.\n\n        But note: the angle at a vertex in the triangle formed by three vertices of the pentagon cannot exceed 180.\n\n        Now, let's consider the formula: \n\n          angle = min( intercepted_arc/2, 360 - intercepted_arc/2 )\n\n        because the two angles at the vertex are: (intercepted_arc/2) and (360 - intercepted_arc/2). We want the smaller one.\n\n        So we can write: angle = min(arc/2, 360 - arc/2) where arc is the intercepted arc (the one not containing the vertex) in degrees.\n\n        But wait, the intercepted arc is defined as the arc that does not contain the vertex. Then the other arc (containing the vertex) is 360 - arc. \n\n        However, the angle for the triangle is the one that is facing the intercepted arc, which is the smaller one between arc/2 and (360-arc)/2? \n\n        Actually, the two angles at the vertex are:\n          angle1 = (arc) / 2   [this is the angle that looks at the arc]\n         ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking potential angles without exhaustive search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding three vertices in a regular convex polygon (with `n` sides) such that the angle formed at one vertex by the other two is closest to the given angle `a`. The key insight is that the angle can be derived from the intercepted arc between the two points relative to the central angles of the polygon.\n2. **Geometric Insight**: For any three vertices, the angle at the middle vertex (when ordered appropriately) can be calculated using the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc between the two outer vertices not containing the middle vertex. The angle is half the difference between the intercepted arc and the opposite arc (360° minus the intercepted arc), but we take the smaller of the two possible angles.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of checking all possible triplets (which is computationally expensive), we recognize that the closest angle will likely be near the target angle `a`. We consider angles derived from arcs that are close to `2*a`, adjusted for the polygon's symmetry.\n4. **Candidate Angles**: We generate candidate angles by considering arcs around `2*a` and their symmetric counterparts. For each candidate arc, we compute the corresponding angle and check its proximity to `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    total_angle = 360.0\n    step = total_angle / n\n    \n    candidates = []\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        angle_val = 0.5 * min(i * step, total_angle - i * step)\n        candidates.append(angle_val)\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_angle = None\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            k = (i + j) % n\n            if k < j:\n                continue\n            k = (k + 1) % n\n            while k != i:\n                arc1 = (j - i) * step\n                arc2 = (k - j) * step\n                total_arc = arc1 + arc2\n                angle_candidate1 = 0.5 * min(total_arc, total_angle - total_arc)\n                angle_candidate2 = 0.5 * min(total_angle - total_arc, total_arc)\n                \n                diff1 = abs(angle_candidate1 - a)\n                diff2 = abs(angle_candidate2 - a)\n                \n                current_min_diff = min(diff1, diff2)\n                \n                if current_min_diff < best_diff:\n                    best_diff = current_min_diff\n                    best_angle = (angle_candidate1, angle_candidate2)\n                    best_vertices = (i, j, k)\n                    \n                k += 1\n                if k == n:\n                    k = 0\n                    \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    v1, v2, v3 = best_vertices\n    print(f\"{v2+1} {v1+1} {v3+1}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the central angle (`step`) between adjacent vertices in the polygon.\n3. **Candidate Generation**: For each vertex, consider angles formed by pairs of vertices symmetric around it.
