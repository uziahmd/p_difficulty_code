Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is to check two things:\n 1. The combined letters of the first two names (guest and host) must be exactly the same as the letters in the pile (third line), including the frequency of each letter.\n 2. There should be no extra letters or missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, strip the newlines.\n - Concatenate the first two strings (guest name and host name) and then compare the sorted version with the sorted version of the third string (the pile).\n\n However, note: the problem says that the pile must be able to form the two names without any extra letters. So the total count of each letter in the pile must equal the sum of counts from the two names.\n\n Example: \n   Input 1: \n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Here, if we combine guest and host: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and sort both this string and the pile string, they should be the same.\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string with multiple lines. Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n However, we are reading three separate lines.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n We can combine the first two: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" and then sort it.\n\n Alternatively, we can count the frequency of each letter in the first two and then in the third, and check if they are the same.\n\n Approach 1: Sort the entire string (which is acceptable because the length is at most 100*2=200, so sorting is O(200 log 200))\n\n Steps:\n   s1 = first line\n   s2 = second line\n   s3 = third line\n\n   total_letters = sorted(s1 + s2)\n   pile_letters = sorted(s3)\n\n   Then if total_letters == pile_letters, print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n However, what if there are spaces? The problem says: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" and no newline issues because we stripped.\n\n But wait: the example input has newline characters? Actually, the input is given as three lines. We can use:\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n Then proceed.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n   Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Sort the combined: \n        sorted(\"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\") \n   Sort the pile: \n        sorted(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\")\n\n   They are not the same because the combined string has one 'P' (from PAPAINOEL) and the pile has two 'P's? Actually, let's count:\n\n   In \"PAPAINOEL\": \n        P: 2, A: 2, I: 1, N: 1, O: 1, E: 1, L: 0 (but wait, the word is \"PAPAINOEL\" -> P appears twice? Yes: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L -> actually P:2, A:2, etc.)\n\n   Now, the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Let's break down the pile: \n        J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:1, E:1, K:1, (and maybe others?)\n\n   But wait, the example output for the second sample is \"NO\". \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"In the second sample letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'.\"\n\n   So in the combined name: \n        \"PAPAINOEL\" and \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   Combined: \n        P: 2 (from PAPAINOEL) + 0 (from JOULUPUKKI) = 2\n        A: 2 + 0 = 2\n        I: 1 + 1 (from JOULUPUKKI:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking the frequency of each letter in the combined names against the letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read three lines from the input, representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Letter Frequencies**: Compare the sorted list of letters from the combined names with the sorted list of letters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the required letters; otherwise, it does not.\n4. **Output Result**: Print \"YES\" if the frequencies match, otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three lines of input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string called `combined`.\n3. **Sorting and Comparison**: The `combined` string and the pile string are both sorted alphabetically. If the sorted versions of these strings are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, just possibly in a different order. The program then prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n4. **Efficiency**: Sorting is an efficient way to compare letter frequencies because it groups identical letters together, allowing a straightforward comparison. The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n) for strings of length up to 200 (since each name can be up to 100 characters), making this approach efficient for the given constraints.",
