In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'. But note: the input is given as three separate strings in one line? Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", but looking at the example input:\n\n Input: \n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n However, the problem actually says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning one line with three space-separated strings? Or one string containing three tiles? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n Example input format: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the example input is shown as three examples. Actually, the example input is provided as three separate examples, but the problem states that there is one line.\n\n Clarification from the example: \n   Example 1: Input is \"1s 2s 3s\"\n   Example 2: Input is \"9m 9m 9m\"\n   Example 3: Input is \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But wait, the example input has three examples. The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then gives examples. \n\n However, the input format is: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n Actually, the hand has three tiles. So the input should be three strings (each representing a tile) concatenated by spaces? Or each string is one tile?\n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: \"1s 2s 3s\" — this is one string with three tokens? Or three strings?\n\n The problem says: \"the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand\" — three tiles. And then: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n This suggests that the input line will have three tokens (each token is two characters). But the example input is written as:\n\n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing. Actually, the example input is given as three separate examples. The actual input for the program would be one line with three two-character strings separated by spaces.\n\n Example input line 1: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n Example input line 2: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n Example input line 3: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But wait, the third example has three tiles: \"3p\", \"9m\", \"2p\". So the input is three two-character strings. How are they separated?\n\n The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\". So we can split the input line by space to get three strings.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Read the entire line and split it into three strings.\n  2. Each string is a tile: [digit][suit_letter]\n\n Conditions:\n  - We have exactly three tiles initially.\n\n We need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we have at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Case 0: Already have a mentsu -> 0 draws.\n\n Case 1: Not having a mentsu initially.\n\n We can consider drawing 0, 1, 2, or 3 tiles (since we start with 3, and we need at least 3 tiles for a mentsu). But note: we might form a mentsu without drawing any? Then 0. If not, then we consider drawing 1, then 2, then 3.\n\n However, note: we can draw any tile arbitrarily. Since we can draw any tile (including duplicates), we have many possibilities.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are allowed to draw any number of tiles (minimum required). We are to find the minimum number of draws so that the hand (original plus drawn) contains at least one mentsu (triplet or sequence).\n\n Note: After drawing, the hand will have more than 3 tiles? Yes, but the mentsu is just three tiles. So we only need to check if there exists a set of three tiles (from the hand) that forms a mentsu.\n\n However, we are not forced to use all the tiles. We just need at least one mentsu.\n\n Since the goal is the minimum number of draws, we can consider:\n\n Option 0: Check if we already have a mentsu.\n\n Option 1: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing 1 tile.\n\n Option 2: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing 2 tiles.\n\n Option 3: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing 3 tiles.\n\n But note: sometimes we might be able to form a mentsu by drawing fewer than 3, but we have to consider that we are adding tiles arbitrarily (and we can choose which ones). \n\n However, note that the hand size increases, but we don't require to use all the tiles. So we are just checking: after adding k tiles, does there exist a triplet or a sequence?\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose the drawn tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose the best ones.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the initial three tiles form a mentsu, answer 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, consider drawing 1 tile. We can try every possibility of drawing one tile (which could be any tile from the set of 9*3=27 tiles) and check if the hand (4 tiles) contains a mentsu.\n\n    However, we don't need to iterate over all 27 because we can reason:\n\n    - To form a triplet: we need three identical tiles. So if we have two of the same, then drawing one more of that same tile gives a triplet. But note: we have three tiles. What if we have two of one kind and one of another? Then drawing one more of the two makes a triplet.\n\n    - To form a sequence: we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n    But note: we can also form two different mentsus? Actually, we only need one.\n\n 3. Similarly, we can consider drawing 2 tiles and 3 tiles.\n\n However, we are to find the minimum number. So we can do:\n\n   if already_mentsu(3_tiles): return 0\n\n   else if already_mentsu(4_tiles) [by drawing one tile]: return 1\n\n   else if already_mentsu(5_tiles) [by drawing two tiles]: return 2\n\n   else if already_mentsu(6_tiles) [by drawing three tiles]: return 3\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose the drawn tiles arbitrarily. So we don't need to try every possibility? Actually, we can design the drawn tiles optimally.\n\n However, we must consider: what are the conditions for being able to form a mentsu after drawing k tiles?\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n With 3 tiles: check if they form a mentsu.\n\n With 4 tiles: we have added one tile. We can form a mentsu if there is any set of three tiles that form a mentsu.\n\n Similarly for 5 and 6.\n\n But note: the hand might have duplicate tiles. We are allowed to have duplicates.\n\n How to check for mentsu in a set of n tiles?\n\n Conditions for a triplet: three identical tiles (same number and same suit).\n\n Conditions for a sequence: three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) in the same suit.\n\n However, note: the sequence can wrap around? According to the problem, no: [9m, 1m, 2m] is not a sequence. So the numbers must be consecutive and in the same suit, and the numbers must be in the range 1-9.\n\n Since we are allowed to choose the drawn tiles arbitrarily, we can try to complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n For triplet: \n   We have a tile (a,b). We can complete a triplet if we have at least two of the same tile. Then drawing one more completes it.\n\n   But we might have one of a tile and then draw two more? Then we can complete a triplet. However, we are trying to minimize the number of draws.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n   - If we have three identical tiles: already done.\n\n   - Else, if we have two of a tile, then drawing one more of that tile gives a triplet. So we can complete a triplet with 1 draw.\n\n   - Else, if we have one of a tile, then we need two more to complete a triplet. So two draws.\n\n   But wait: we might have multiple tiles. We are allowed to form any triplet from the entire hand. So we can choose which triplet to complete.\n\n   However, we are only concerned with the minimum draws. So we can look for the best option.\n\n For sequence:\n\n   We need three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n   Consider: we have a set of tiles. We can group by suit and then within a suit, sort by number.\n\n   Then, for each suit, we look for runs of three consecutive numbers. But note: we might have duplicates? \n\n   Example: [1m, 1m, 2m, 4m] -> we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing one 3m, or [2m,3m,4m] by drawing one 3m? Actually, we have two 1m's. But we only need one set of three. However, we cannot use the same tile twice.\n\n   So we need to have distinct tiles for the sequence.\n\n   Therefore, for a sequence, we require three distinct tiles (with distinct numbers) in the same suit and consecutive numbers.\n\n   Steps for sequence:\n\n     Group by suit.\n\n     For each suit, collect the distinct numbers (or count the frequency doesn't matter for the minimal requirement, but we need at least one occurrence of each number in the sequence).\n\n   However, we are allowed to draw arbitrarily. So we can complete a sequence by drawing the missing numbers.\n\n   Example: [1m, 2m] -> we need to draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. But if we have [1m, 1m, 2m], then we can use one 1m and one 2m and draw one 3m.\n\n   But note: we might have two sequences possible and we can choose the one that requires the least draws.\n\n   However, we are only concerned with the minimum total draws to have at least one mentsu.\n\n   So we have two types: triplet and sequence.\n\n   We can compute:\n\n   Option 1: Complete a triplet.\n\n      For each distinct tile (represented as (number, suit)), let count = frequency of that tile.\n\n      Then, to complete a triplet for that tile, we need (3 - count) tiles.\n\n      But note: we can only use one triplet. However, we are allowed to draw any tile, so we can complete the most promising triplet.\n\n      However, we are minimizing the number of draws. We want the minimum k such that we can form at least one triplet or one sequence.\n\n   Option 2: Complete a sequence.\n\n      For each suit, we look for consecutive triplets.\n\n      But note: we might have multiple sequences in one suit. We are allowed to complete one sequence.\n\n      How to compute the minimal draws for a sequence?\n\n        For a fixed suit, say 'm', we have a multiset of numbers. We want to find a consecutive triplet [n, n+1, n+2] (n from 1 to 7) such that we have at least one of each number, and then the number of draws required is (3 - (number of distinct numbers present in the triplet)).\n\n        But wait: we might have duplicates. For example, if we have [1m, 1m, 2m, 3m], then the triplet [1,2,3] requires 3 - 2 = 1 draw (because we have two distinct numbers: 1,2,3 are present? Actually, we have 1,2,3 but we have two 1s. But the definition of sequence requires three distinct tiles? Actually, the representation: [5p,4p,6p] — here, if we have two 5p, then we cannot use two 5p in the same sequence. We need one 5p, one 4p, and one 6p.\n\n        So for the sequence [n, n+1, n+2] in suit s, we require:\n\n            at least one tile with number n and suit s,\n            at least one tile with number n+1 and suit s,\n            at least one tile with number n+2 and suit s.\n\n        Then the number of draws for this particular sequence is:\n\n            (3 - (# of distinct numbers we have in {n, n+1, n+2}))\n\n        However, note: we might have duplicates, but we only need one copy of each. So if we have two copies of n, that doesn't help for the sequence beyond having one.\n\n        But wait, we have a hand that may contain multiple suits. We are grouping by suit.\n\n        So for a given suit, we can consider each consecutive triplet (n from 1 to 7) and calculate:\n\n            required_draws = 3\n            for num in [n, n+1, n+2]:\n                if there is at least one tile of (num, suit) in the hand, then required_draws -= 1\n\n            Then the total draws for that sequence would be required_draws.\n\n        Then, the minimal draws for forming a sequence in that suit is the minimum required_draws over all consecutive triplets in that suit.\n\n        Then, we take the minimum over all suits.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to draw any tiles, so we can also complete a sequence that spans multiple suits? No, because a sequence must be in the same suit.\n\n   So we consider:\n\n        Answer0 = 0 if initial hand has a mentsu.\n\n        Otherwise, we consider:\n\n        Option1: Minimal draws to complete a triplet (if any triplet can be completed) or to complete a sequence.\n\n        Actually, we can combine both: the minimal k (from 0 to 3) such that we can form a mentsu.\n\n   But note: we are starting with 3 tiles.\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let T = set of tiles (each tile is (int(digit), suit))\n\n        We can check for triplet: for any tile, if count(tile) >= 3, then yes. But note: we have only three tiles. So if we have three same, then yes.\n\n        For sequence: for any suit, and for any n in [1,7], if we have (n, suit), (n+1, suit), (n+2, suit), then yes.\n\n   Now, for drawing k tiles (k=0,1,2,3):\n\n        We are going to consider: what is the minimal k such that by adding k tiles (any) we can form a mentsu.\n\n   However, we can also think: \n\n        In the best scenario, we can complete a triplet with 1 draw (if we have two of a kind) or 2 draws (if we have one of a kind). Similarly, for a sequence, we can complete with 1, 2, or 3 draws.\n\n        We are to find the minimum k (from 0 up) for which there exists a way to add k tiles to form a mentsu.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Check k=0.\n\n        Step 2: Check k=1.\n\n        Step 3: Check k=2.\n\n        Step 4: Check k=3.\n\n        Then output the smallest k that satisfies.\n\n   But how to check for k=1, k=2, k=3?\n\n        We can simulate:\n\n        For k=1: we can draw one tile. Then the hand has 4 tiles. We can choose the drawn tile arbitrarily. We need to know: is there a choice of one tile such that the hand (with that tile) contains a mentsu?\n\n        Similarly for k=2: we can draw two tiles arbitrarily, so we choose two tiles (each from the infinite supply) to maximize the chance of forming a mentsu.\n\n        However, we don't need to iterate over all possibilities because we can reason about the necessary conditions.\n\n        Alternative approach:\n\n        We can compute:\n\n        Option A: Triplet completion:\n\n            Let freq = dictionary of counts for each tile.\n\n            For each tile type t, we need (3 - freq[t]) more tiles to complete a triplet.\n\n            But note: we can only complete one triplet. So the minimal draws for a triplet is min_{t} (max(0, 3 - freq[t])). However, we are allowed to draw any tiles, but we are constrained by the fact that we are drawing a fixed number of tiles. \n\n            However, we are not limited to one tile type: we can complete a triplet for one tile type, and we are free to choose the drawn tiles arbitrarily.\n\n            So the minimal draws to complete a triplet is:\n\n                Let d_triplet = min_{t} (3 - freq[t]) if 3 - freq[t] > 0, but if no tile has at least one, then we need 3 draws (but we start with three tiles, so at least one tile must be present). Actually, we start with three tiles, so there must be at least one tile that appears at least once.\n\n            However, note: we are not forced to complete a triplet that is already partially built. We can complete any triplet. So we can consider:\n\n                For each tile type t, the cost is max(0, 3 - freq[t])\n\n                Then the minimal cost for a triplet is the minimum of these costs over all t.\n\n            But wait: we can also complete a triplet that we don't have at all? Yes, because we can draw any tile. For example, if we don't have a 1m, then we can draw two 1m to complete a triplet. So for a tile type we haven't seen, the cost is 3.\n\n            Actually, for a tile type that doesn't appear, the cost is 3.\n\n            Then, the minimal triplet draws is the minimum over all tile types (each tile type is (number, suit)) of (3 - freq.get(t,0)).\n\n        Option B: Sequence completion:\n\n            We consider each suit separately.\n\n            For a given suit s, we have a set of numbers that we have (ignoring duplicates, because we only need one copy per number).\n\n            Then, we look for consecutive triplets in the range [1,7] (i.e., n from 1 to 7) such that the set of numbers in the triplet is a subset of the numbers we have in suit s.\n\n            For a triplet [n, n+1, n+2], the required draws is (3 - |{n, n+1, n+2} ∩ (set of numbers we have in suit s)|)\n\n            Then, the minimal draws for a sequence in suit s is the minimum over n of (3 - |intersection|).\n\n            Then, the overall minimal sequence draws is the minimum over all suits of that value.\n\n        Then, the minimal draws needed is the minimum between:\n\n            minimal_triplet_draws (from Option A) and minimal_sequence_draws (from Option B)\n\n        But wait: we are allowed to form either a triplet or a sequence. So we can choose the best option.\n\n        However, note: we are drawing k tiles. We are not forced to use the same drawn tiles for both. But we are drawing one set of tiles to satisfy one condition.\n\n        Actually, the above computations for triplet and sequence are independent. We can compute:\n\n            k_triplet = minimal_triplet_draws   (which is the minimal number of draws to complete at least one triplet)\n\n            k_sequence = minimal_sequence_draws   (minimal number of draws to complete at least one sequence)\n\n        Then the answer is min(k_triplet, k_sequence) ?\n\n        But wait: we are drawing k tiles and we can choose them arbitrarily. However, we are not forced to complete one specific triplet or one specific sequence. We can use the same drawn tiles for both? \n\n        Actually, no, because we are just counting the total number of draws. We are allowed to draw any tiles, and we can use them arbitrarily. So we can use the drawn tiles to complete a triplet and simultaneously help a sequence? \n\n        But note: we are only required to have one mentsu. So we choose the one that requires fewer draws.\n\n        However, the above computations for triplet and sequence are independent and we are calculating the minimal draws needed for each type separately. Then the overall minimal draws is the minimum of the two.\n\n        But wait: is that always valid? Consider:\n\n          We are allowed to choose the drawn tiles arbitrarily. We can choose a tile that helps both? \n\n          Example: We have two different tiles that are part of two different mentsus. But we are only required to form one. So we can focus on one.\n\n        However, the catch: we are drawing one set of tiles and we are free to choose. So we can choose the drawn tiles that help the best option.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n          Option1: k1 = minimal draws to form a triplet (by completing the best available triplet)\n\n          Option2: k2 = minimal draws to form a sequence (by completing the best available sequence)\n\n          Then, the answer is min(k1, k2)\n\n        But wait: we are not limited to forming one type. However, we are only counting the minimal draws for each type independently. Then the minimal draws overall is the minimum of the two.\n\n        However, note: we are drawing k tiles. The two options might require the same drawn tile? But since we can choose arbitrarily, we can assign the drawn tiles to the best option.\n\n        Example: We have [1m, 1m, 1m] — then k1=0, k2=? We don't need to complete a sequence, but we are allowed to choose 0. So we return 0.\n\n        But wait, we must check the initial hand for mentsu. Our k1 and k2 are computed from the initial hand and then the number of draws. However, we must first check if the initial hand already has a mentsu (k=0).\n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n          Check for triplet in initial hand: any tile with count>=3? Then k1=0.\n\n          Check for sequence in initial hand: any consecutive triplet in the same suit? Then k2=0.\n\n        Then the answer is 0.\n\n        But if not, then we compute k1 and k2 for the initial hand (without drawing) and then the minimal draws is min(k1, k2). However, wait: k1 and k2 as defined above are the number of draws needed to complete a triplet/sequence. But if we have two tiles of the same, then k1=1. But if we have two tiles of the same and also a sequence missing one, then we might complete the sequence with 1 draw and the triplet with 1 draw. But note: we are allowed to choose the drawn tile arbitrarily. So we can choose the drawn tile to complete either.\n\n        However, the above computation for k1 and k2 is the minimal draws to complete a triplet OR a sequence, respectively. Then we take the minimum of the two.\n\n        But wait: our k1 is computed by: for each tile type, the number of draws to complete a triplet for that tile type (if we focus only on that tile type). Similarly, k2 is the minimal draws to complete a sequence (over all suits and consecutive triplets).\n\n        However, note: we are drawing k tiles, and we can draw any k tiles. But we are counting the minimal k such that there exists a way to form a mentsu. And we are allowed to use the drawn tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose the best option.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            if (already has a mentsu): 0\n\n            else: min( minimal_draws_triplet, minimal_draws_sequence )\n\n        But wait: what if we need to draw two tiles to complete a triplet, but one of those two tiles is also used to complete a sequence? Then we might complete two mentsus at the same time? But we only need one. However, we are computing the minimal draws for each type independently. The independent computation is valid because we can choose the drawn tiles arbitrarily to complete the best option.\n\n        However, note: the above k1 (for triplet) is the minimal draws to complete a triplet (by focusing on one tile type). Similarly, k2 is the minimal draws to complete a sequence (by focusing on one consecutive triplet). \n\n        But is that the whole story?\n\n        Example: \n          Hand: ['1m','1m','2m'] (three tiles)\n\n          Check for triplet: no (two 1m, one 2m) -> k1 = min(3-2, 3-1, 3-0 for other tiles) = min(1, 2, ...) -> 1.\n\n          Check for sequence: \n            For suit 'm': we have [1,2]. We look for consecutive triplets: \n                n=1: [1,2,3] -> missing 3 -> draws=1.\n                n=2: [2,3,4] -> missing two -> draws=2.\n            So k2 = 1.\n\n          Then answer is min(1,1)=1.\n\n        Example: \n          Hand: ['1m','2m','4m'] (three tiles)\n\n          Triplet: no (all distinct) -> k1 = min(3-0 for each tile) -> but wait, we have three distinct tiles, so for each tile we have count=1, so k1 = min(2,2,2) = 2.\n\n          Sequence: \n            For suit 'm': [1,2,4]\n                n=1: [1,2,3] -> missing 3 -> draws=1 (because we have 1 and 2, so two out of three)\n                n=2: [2,3,4] -> missing 3 -> draws=1\n                n=3: [3,4,5] -> missing two -> draws=2\n            So k2 = 1.\n\n          Then answer=1.\n\n        Example: \n          Hand: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> already triplet, so 0.\n\n        Example: \n          Hand: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> already sequence, so 0.\n\n        Example: \n          Hand: ['1m','1m','4m'] -> \n            Triplet: for 1m: 3-2=1, for 4m: 3-1=2 -> k1=1.\n            Sequence: \n                [1m,2m,3m]: missing 2m,3m -> draws=2.\n                [2m,3m,4m]: missing 2m,3m -> draws=2.\n                [0m,1m,2m]: invalid.\n            k2=2.\n\n          Then answer=1.\n\n        Example: \n          Hand: ['1m','1m','2p'] -> \n            Triplet: for 1m: 1, for 2p: 2 -> k1=1.\n            Sequence: \n                For 'm': [1,1] -> consecutive triplets: n=1: [1,2,3] -> missing 2,3 -> draws=2; n=0: not valid.\n                For 'p': [2] -> no consecutive triplet (need three consecutive) -> draws=3 for each triplet (e.g., [1,2,3] or [0,1,2] etc.) -> minimal for 'p' is 3-1=2 (if we choose [1,2,3] then we are missing 1 and 3, but wait: we have 2, so for [1,2,3] we are missing two, so 2 draws; similarly [0,1,2] is invalid because 0 not allowed, [2,3,4] -> missing 3 and 4 -> 2 draws, etc.)\n\n            So k2 = 2.\n\n            Then answer=1.\n\n        However, wait: is there a way to complete a sequence with 1 draw? We need three consecutive in the same suit. We have two suits: 'm' and 'p'. In 'm', we have two 1m. We can complete [1m,2m,3m] by drawing one 2m and one 3m? But that's two draws. Alternatively, we can complete [0m,1m,2m] is not allowed because 0m is invalid. So no.\n\n        But note: we have two 1m. We can use one 1m for the sequence and the other 1m is extra. However, we still need 2m and 3m.\n\n        Alternatively, we can complete a triplet: draw one 1m to complete [1m,1m,1m].\n\n        So 1 draw.\n\n        Another example:\n\n          Hand: ['1m','2m','4s'] -> \n            Triplet: no (each tile appears once) -> k1=2 (because we need two more of any tile).\n            Sequence: \n                For 'm': [1,2] -> [1,2,3] missing 3 -> draws=1.\n                For 's': [4] -> [2,3,4] missing 2 and 3 -> draws=2; [3,4,5] missing 3 and 5 -> draws=2; [4,5,6] missing 5,6 -> draws=2.\n            Then k2=1.\n\n            So answer=1.\n\n        But wait: we can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing one 3m. Then we have four tiles: [1m,2m,4s,3m]. Then we have a sequence [1m,2m,3m] (same suit m) and the 4s is extra. So yes.\n\n        However, note: the hand after drawing is four tiles. But we don't require to use all. We just require one mentsu.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Parse the input.\n\n          Step 2: Check if the hand already contains a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, output 0.\n\n          Step 3: Compute the minimal draws for a triplet:\n\n                  Let freq = {}\n                  For each tile in the hand: \n                      tile_str = two chars, so convert the first char to int, and the second char is the suit.\n                  Count the frequency of each tile (each tile is (int_value, suit)).\n\n                  Then, for each tile type (each distinct (int_value, suit)) that appears, the draws needed for that tile type is max(0, 3 - freq[tile])\n\n                  Then, k1 = min_{tile_type} (max(0, 3 - freq[tile_type]))   [but note: we are allowed to complete any triplet, so we consider every tile type]\n\n          Step 4: Compute the minimal draws for a sequence:\n\n                  Group the hand by suit.\n\n                  For each suit, let S = set of numbers (the integer values) in that suit.\n\n                  Then, for n from 1 to 7 (inclusive), consider the consecutive triplet [n, n+1, n+2] (all must be in the same suit, which they are because we are in a suit).\n\n                  For this triplet, the number of missing numbers in S is: 3 - |S ∩ {n, n+1, n+2}|.\n\n                  Then, k2 = min_{suit} [min_{n=1 to 7} (3 - |S ∩ {n, n+1, n+2}|)]   [but note: if a number is missing, we have to draw it. However, we can draw any tile, so we are just counting the missing distinct numbers in the triplet.]\n\n          Step 5: Answer = min(k1, k2)\n\n        However, wait: is k1 computed correctly?\n\n          k1 is the minimal draws to complete a triplet. But note: we are only considering completing a triplet for a tile that we already have? What if we don't have any tile at all? But we have three tiles.\n\n          Actually, we have three tiles, so we have at least some tiles. But note: we can complete a triplet for a tile that we don't have at all? Then we need 3 draws. But if we don't have a tile, then we are not considering it in the freq dictionary. \n\n          Correction for k1: \n\n            We must consider all possible tiles (all 27 tiles). But the problem says we can draw any tile. \n\n            However, we are only concerned with the minimal draws. We can compute:\n\n                k1 = min_{all_possible_tile_types} (max(0, 3 - (current_count for that tile)))\n\n            But we don't know the current_count for tiles that are not in the hand? They are 0.\n\n            So:\n\n                k1 = min_{all_tile_types} (3 - max(0, current_count))   [but wait, if a tile type is not present, then we need 3 draws. And if it is present, then 3 - count (if count<3)].\n\n            But we don't need to iterate over all 27? We can iterate over the ones we have, and then the minimal is at most 3 (if we don't have any tile, but we have three tiles, so we must have at least one tile with count>=1). \n\n            Actually, we can compute:\n\n                k1 = 3   # worst-case\n\n                For each tile type t that appears in the hand, k1 = min(k1, 3 - freq[t])\n\n                Then, we must consider tiles that do not appear? That would require 3 draws. So we don't need to iterate over them because 3 is already the maximum we are considering.\n\n            But wait: maybe we can complete a triplet for a tile type that does not appear by drawing 3 of that type. Then k1=3.\n\n            However, we are taking the minimum over all tile types. The tile types that appear give a value <=2 (if they appear 1 or 2 times) and tile types that don't appear give 3.\n\n            So we can simply:\n\n                k1 = min(3, min_{t in hand} (3 - freq[t]))\n\n            But wait: what if the hand has three distinct tile types? Then for each tile type, we have freq[t]=1, so 3-1=2. Then k1=2.\n\n            But is that correct? Yes: to complete a triplet for a tile type that we have one of, we need two more. So two draws.\n\n            However, note: we can complete multiple triplets at the same time? But we are only concerned with the minimal draws to complete at least one triplet.\n\n            But wait: we can draw two tiles for one triplet and simultaneously draw two tiles for another triplet? But we are only counting the total draws. However, we are focusing on one triplet.\n\n            The above k1 is the minimal draws if we focus on one particular tile type. But we are allowed to choose which triplet to complete. So we choose the one that requires the least draws.\n\n            So k1 = min_{t in all_tile_types} (3 - freq[t])   [where freq[t] is the current count of tile t]\n\n            But note: we don't have to consider tile types that are not in the hand? Actually, we can consider all 27. But the minimal value is the minimum between the ones we have and 3. And the ones we have are at most 2 (because we have three tiles, so if a tile appears 3 times, then k1=0). \n\n            Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n                k1 = 3   # default if none found\n                for each distinct tile in the hand (each tile is (number, suit)):\n                    count = freq[tile]\n                    needed = 3 - count\n                    if needed < k1:\n                        k1 = needed\n\n                # Also, we must consider tiles not in the hand? They require 3, which is worse than the current k1 (which is at most 2, because we have three tiles and the maximum count for a tile is 3, then needed=0, then 1, then 2). So we don't need to consider tiles not in the hand.\n\n            But wait: what if we have three distinct tile types? Then the minimal needed is 2 (for each tile type). But we can also complete a triplet for a tile type that is not in the hand by drawing three, which is worse.\n\n            So k1 = min_{t in hand} (3 - freq[t])\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to complete a triplet for a tile type that is not in the hand. But that requires 3 draws, which is more than 2. So we don't need to consider.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two tiles of one type and one tile of another? Then the minimal k1 is min(1, 2) = 1.\n\n        So the code for k1:\n\n            freq = {}\n            for tile in hand:\n                # tile is string of length 2\n                num = int(tile[0])\n                suit = tile[1]\n                key = (num, suit)\n                freq[key] = freq.get(key,0)+1\n\n            k1 = float('inf",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence). The solution involves checking the initial hand for any existing mentsu and, if none are found, calculating the minimal draws required to form one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Check for Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already contain a mentsu. A mentsu can be a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n2. **Triplet Completion Calculation**: For each tile type in the hand, calculate the number of additional tiles needed to complete a triplet (three identical tiles). The minimal value across all tile types gives the number of draws required to form a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Completion Calculation**: For each suit, check all possible sequences (three consecutive numbers). The number of missing tiles for each sequence is calculated, and the minimal value across all sequences gives the number of draws required to form a sequence.\n4. **Result Determination**: The answer is the minimum between the draws needed for a triplet and those needed for a sequence. If no mentsu exists initially, the result is the minimal value from the two calculations; otherwise, it's zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = []\n    for s in data:\n        if len(s) != 2:\n            print(0)\n            return\n        tiles.append((int(s[0]), s[1]))\n    \n    # Check for triplet or sequence in the initial hand\n    has_triplet = False\n    has_sequence = False\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    suits = defaultdict(set)\n    numbers = set()\n\n    for num, suit in tiles:\n        freq[(num, suit)] += 1\n        suits[suit].add(num)\n        numbers.add((num, suit))\n        \n    for (num, suit), count in freq.items():\n        if count >= 3:\n            has_triplet = True\n            \n    for suit, num_set in suits.items():\n        nums = sorted(num_set)\n        n = len(nums)\n        if n < 3:\n            continue\n        for i in range(n - 2):\n            if nums[i+1] == nums[i] + 1 and nums[i+2] == nums[i] + 2:\n                has_sequence = True\n                break\n        if has_sequence:\n            break\n            \n    if has_triplet or has_sequence:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k1 = float('inf')\n    for count in freq.values():\n        needed = 3 - count\n        if needed < k1:\n            k1 = needed\n\n    k2 = float('inf')\n    for suit, num_set in suits.items():\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            req_set = {start, start+1, start+2}\n            common = req_set & num_set\n            missing = 3 - len(common)\n            if missing < k2:\n                k2 = missing\n                \n    answer = min(k1, k2)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the initial hand contains a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). If either is found, it immediately returns 0 since no additional tiles are needed.\n2. **Frequency and Suit Analysis**: The code then analyzes the frequency of each tile and groups tiles by their suits to facilitate sequence checking.\n3. **Triplet Calculation**: For each tile type, it calculates how many more tiles are needed to complete a triplet (three identical tiles). The minimal value across all tile types is stored.\n4. **Sequence Calculation**: For each suit, it checks all possible sequences (from 1 to 7) and calculates the number of missing tiles required to complete each sequence. The minimal value across all sequences is stored.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum between the draws needed for a triplet and those needed for a sequence, providing the least number of tiles Tokitsukaze must draw to form a mentsu.",
