Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n The idea is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. We note that the street must be from 0 to l. So we need to cover from the start (0) to the end (l).\n\n Observation:\n - The first lantern covers from the leftmost point to the right. The leftmost gap might be from 0 to the first lantern.\n   Actually, the coverage of the first lantern (at position a0) extends from (a0 - d) to (a0 + d). But since the street starts at 0,\n   we require that the leftmost point 0 is covered. This requires that d >= a0 (if there's no lantern at 0) or more precisely, we require that \n   the leftmost lantern's left side must reach 0, i.e., d >= a0 (if we consider that the lantern at a0 must cover 0, then d >= a0 - 0 = a0).\n   However, if there's a lantern at 0, then we don't need to cover the left gap.\n\n - Similarly, the last lantern must cover up to l, so d must be at least (l - a_last).\n\n 3. But also, we have gaps between consecutive lanterns. For two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y (with x <= y), the gap in the middle is from x+d to y-d.\n    To cover the entire street between x and y, we need that the coverage from the left lantern (x) and the right lantern (y) must meet or overlap.\n    The condition is: x + d >= y - d   =>  2*d >= y - x  => d >= (y - x)/2.\n\n However, note that the entire street must be covered. So we break the problem into:\n\n  a) Cover the beginning: from 0 to the first lantern. The required d for this segment is: d0 = a0 (if the first lantern is at a0, then to cover 0 we need d >= a0, but actually if we set d >= a0, then the lantern at a0 will cover [a0-d, a0+d]. For 0 to be covered, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. However, wait: if we set d = a0, then the lantern at a0 covers from 0 to 2*a0. But what if 2*a0 is beyond the next lantern? Actually, we have to consider the entire street.\n\n  Let's reframe:\n\n  We can think of the street as being covered by the union of intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d]. We need to cover [0, l].\n\n  Conditions:\n  1. The leftmost point 0 must be covered: so there exists at least one lantern such that a_i - d <= 0. Since the first lantern is the leftmost, we require d >= a0 (the distance from the first lantern to 0) unless there is a lantern at 0.\n\n  2. The rightmost point l must be covered: so the last lantern must have a_i + d >= l, i.e., d >= l - a_last.\n\n  3. Between two consecutive lanterns (after the first and before the last), the gap must be covered. Consider two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y (x < y). The left lantern covers up to x+d, and the right lantern covers from y-d. We require that x+d >= y-d, i.e., d >= (y - x)/2.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to choose a single d for all lanterns.\n\n Therefore, the minimal d must be at least:\n   d_min = max( \n        a0,                  # because we need to cover from 0 to a0 (if the first lantern is at a0, then d must be at least a0 to cover 0)\n        l - a_last,          # because we need to cover from a_last to l\n        (gaps between consecutive lanterns)/2.0   # for each consecutive gap (y-x) we require d >= (y-x)/2 to bridge the gap\n    )\n\n But wait: the condition for consecutive gaps is not exactly that. Actually, the entire street must be covered from 0 to l. We can break the problem into:\n\n  - The first segment: from 0 to the first lantern's coverage. Actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the next lantern? Not necessarily.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n  Let the sorted lantern positions be a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\n ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius \\( d \\) such that all points along a street of length \\( l \\) are covered by the lanterns. The lanterns are positioned at specific points on the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance \\( d \\) from its position. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in systematically analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - **Leftmost Coverage**: The leftmost point (0) must be covered by the first lantern. The required \\( d \\) here is the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street, i.e., \\( \\max(\\text{first\\_lantern\\_position}, 0) \\).\n   - **Rightmost Coverage**: Similarly, the rightmost point (\\( l \\)) must be covered by the last lantern. The required \\( d \\) here is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street, i.e., \\( \\max(l - \\text{last\\_lantern\\_position}, 0) \\).\n3. **Middle Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by the combined light of the two lanterns. The minimal \\( d \\) required to cover the gap between two consecutive lanterns at positions \\( a_i \\) and \\( a_{i+1} \\) is \\( \\frac{(a_{i+1} - a_i)}{2} \\).\n\nThe overall solution involves taking the maximum value among the leftmost coverage, rightmost coverage, and the largest gap coverage requirement. This ensures that all parts of the street are adequately lit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    positions = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    positions.sort()\n    \n    d_candidate1 = positions[0] if positions else l\n    d_candidate2 = l - positions[-1] if positions else l\n    \n    max_gap = 0.0\n    for i in range(len(positions)-1):\n        gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n        needed = gap / 2.0\n        if needed > max_gap:\n            max_gap = needed\n            \n    d_candidate3 = max_gap\n    \n    answer = max(d_candidate1, d_candidate2, d_candidate3)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(answer))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns \\( n \\), the length of the street \\( l \\), and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order, which simplifies gap analysis.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**:\n   - **Leftmost Coverage**: The distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0) is calculated as \\( \\text{positions}[0] \\).\n   - **Rightmost Coverage**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (\\( l \\)) is calculated as \\( l - \\text{positions}[-1] \\).\n4. **Middle Gaps**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is divided by 2 to find the minimal \\( d \\) needed to cover the gap. The largest such value across all gaps is stored.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final \\( d \\) is the maximum value among the leftmost coverage, rightmost coverage, and the largest middle gap coverage. This ensures the entire street is covered.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal light radius by considering all critical segments of the street, ensuring comprehensive coverage with optimal performance.",
