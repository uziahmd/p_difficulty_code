Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of old candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour.\n   - When we burn a candle, it becomes an old candle.\n   - After burning, if we have collected 'b' old candles, we can make one new candle from them.\n\n Steps:\n   Let:\n     hours = 0\n     current_candles = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n   However, we can think of it as:\n     While we have candles (either new or from leftovers) we can burn them.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a loop:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But note: the process is:\n     - Burn some candles (each gives one hour and one leftover)\n     - Then, we can combine the leftovers to form new candles.\n\n   Actually, we can simulate:\n     total_hours = 0\n     current = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n   However, we can also consider that each candle initially gives one hour and then leaves one unit for leftover.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break down the process:\n\n   Step 1: Start with 'a' new candles.\n   Step 2: Burn all the candles we have (which are the sum of new and leftover from previous steps).\n            Then, we get as many leftovers as the number of candles we burned.\n\n   So:\n     total_candles = a + leftover\n     total_hours += total_candles\n     Then, we set leftover = total_candles // b * 1? Actually, we use up the leftovers to make new candles, but we leave the remainder.\n\n   Actually, we do:\n     We burn all available candles (which are current new plus leftover from before). Then we get one leftover per candle burned.\n\n   But note: the problem says when Vasily lights up a new candle, it burns for an hour and then goes out. And he can make b went out candles into a new candle.\n\n   Therefore, we can model:\n\n     total_hours = 0\n     current = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n     while current > 0:\n         # Burn all current candles\n         total_hours += current\n         # Now, these current candles become leftovers (each one does)\n         leftover += current\n         # Now, we can convert some leftovers into new candles\n         new_candles = leftover // b\n         leftover = leftover % b\n         current = new_candles\n\n   But wait, let's test with the example: a=4, b=2\n\n     Step 0: current=4, leftover=0, total_hours=0\n        Burn 4: total_hours=4\n        leftover becomes 4\n        new_candles = 4//2 = 2, leftover becomes 0\n        current becomes 2\n\n     Step 1: current=2, leftover=0, total_hours=4\n        Burn 2: total_hours=6\n        leftover becomes 2\n        new_candles = 2//2 = 1, leftover becomes 0\n        current becomes 1\n\n     Step 2: current=1, leftover=0, total_hours=6\n        Burn 1: total_hours=7\n        leftover becomes 1\n        new_candles = 1//2 = 0, leftover becomes 1\n        current becomes 0 -> stop.\n\n     This gives 7, which matches.\n\n   Another example: a=6, b=3\n\n     Step0: current=6, leftover=0, total_hours=0\n        Burn 6: total_hours=6\n        leftover=6\n        new_candles = 6//3 = 2, leftover=0\n        current=2\n\n     Step1: current=2, leftover=0, total_hours=6\n        Burn 2: total_hours=8\n        leftover=2\n        new_candles = 2//3 = 0, leftover=2\n        current=0 -> stop.\n\n     This gives 8, which matches.\n\n   However, note: in the second step of the first example, we had 4 initial candles, then after making 2 new ones, we burned those 2 and made 1 more, then burned the last one.\n\n   But wait, is there a possibility that we don't have to burn all at once? Actually, the problem states that we act optimally. The above simulation burns all available candles at each step.\n\n   But what if we don't use all the leftover to make new candles? Actually, we use exactly floor(leftover / b) to make new candles and leave the rest. This is optimal because we want to maximize the number of candles (and hence hours).\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n     a, b = map",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and converting leftover burned candles into new ones until no more candles are left.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (`a`) and the number of burned candles needed to make a new one (`b`).\n2. **Simulation Loop**: \n   - **Burning Candles**: Each hour, burn all available candles (both new and any leftovers from previous steps). Each burned candle contributes one hour and leaves one unit of leftover.\n   - **Recycling Leftovers**: After burning, calculate how many new candles can be made from the accumulated leftovers. This is done by integer division of the total leftovers by `b`. The remainder represents the leftover burned candles that cannot form a new candle.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no more candles left to burn. The total hours are accumulated during each burning step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total_hours = 0\n    current = a\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while current > 0:\n        total_hours += current\n        leftover += current\n        new_candles = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n        current = new_candles\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The variables `total_hours`, `current`, and `leftover` are initialized to zero. `current` starts with the initial number of candles (`a`), and `leftover` keeps track of burned candles that can be recycled.\n- **Loop**: The loop runs as long as there are candles (`current > 0`). In each iteration:\n  - **Burning**: All available candles (`current`) are burned, adding their count to `total_hours`.\n  - **Recycling**: The burned candles (`leftover + current`) are used to create new candles. The number of new candles is the quotient when divided by `b`, and the remainder becomes the new `leftover`.\n- **Output**: The total hours accumulated from burning candles is printed once the loop terminates.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources to maximize the illumination time.",
