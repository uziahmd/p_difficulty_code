Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

Each candle burns for an hour.\n   - When a candle burns out, it becomes a leftover. Also, when we use a new candle, we get a burned candle which is leftover.\n   - We can combine 'b' leftovers to make one new candle.\n\n How to think:\n   Let's denote:\n     hours = 0   (total hours so far)\n     current_candles = a   (the candles we have initially)\n     leftovers = 0        (we start with no leftovers)\n\n   However, note that the process is:\n     While we have candles (either new or from leftovers), we can burn them.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate:\n     Step 1: Use all available candles (both initial and those made from leftovers) for burning.\n     Then, the number of new candles we can make is floor(total_burned / b) [but note: we cannot use the same candle twice]\n\n   Actually, we can break down:\n\n     We start with 'a' candles. This gives a = a + 0, but then we burn them and get 'a' leftovers.\n\n     Then we can form new_candles = a // b, and the remaining leftovers are a % b.\n\n     Then we add the new_candles to the total candles and burn them again, and so on.\n\n   But note: the total hours is the sum of all candles we ever burn.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n     total_hours = 0\n     current = a\n     leftover = 0\n\n     But actually, the burning process:\n\n        While current > 0:\n            total_hours += current   # we burn all current candles\n            leftover += current       # all burned become leftovers\n            # Now, we can convert some leftovers to new candles\n            new_candles = leftover // b\n            leftover = leftover % b\n            current = new_candles\n\n     Then print(total_hours)\n\n   However, let's test with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n        Start: current = 4, leftover = 0, total_hours=0\n\n        Iteration 1:\n            total_hours += 4 -> 4\n            leftover += 4 -> 4\n            new_candles = 4 // 2 = 2, leftover = 0, current = 2\n\n        Iteration 2:\n            total_hours += 2 -> 6\n            leftover += 2 -> 2\n            new_candles = 2 // 2 = 1, leftover = 0, current = 1\n\n        Iteration 3:\n            total_hours += 1 -> 7\n            leftover += 1 -> 1\n            new_candles = 1 // 2 = 0, leftover = 1, current = 0 -> stop.\n\n        Output 7 -> matches.\n\n   Another example: \"6 3\"\n\n        Start: current=6, leftover=0, total_hours=0\n\n        Iteration 1:\n            total_hours=6\n            leftover=6\n            new_candles=6//3=2, leftover=0, current=2\n\n        Iteration 2:\n            total_hours=6+2=8\n            leftover=2\n            new_candles=2//3=0, leftover=2, current=0 -> stop.\n\n        Output 8 -> matches.\n\n   However, wait: the example output for \"6 3\" is 8, so this matches.\n\n   But note: what if we have a=1, b=2?\n        Start: current=1, leftover=0, total_hours=0\n        Iteration1: total_hours=1, leftover=1, new_candles=0 -> stop.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and converting leftover burned candles into new ones until no more candles can be made.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (`a`) and the number of burned candles needed to make a new one (`b`).\n2. **Burning Candles**: While there are candles available (either initial or newly made from leftovers), burn them all for each hour.\n3. **Leftover Management**: After burning the candles, count the leftovers (each burned candle becomes a leftover). Convert as many leftovers as possible into new candles by dividing the total leftovers by `b`.\n4. **Update Variables**: Subtract the converted leftovers from the total and set the current candles to the newly made ones. Repeat the process until no more candles can be made.\n5. **Output the Result**: The total hours is the sum of all candles burned during each iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current = a\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while current > 0:\n        total_hours += current\n        leftover += current\n        new_candles = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n        current = new_candles\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The program reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to make a new one).\n- **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are candles to burn (`current > 0`).\n  - **Burning Phase**: In each iteration, all available candles (`current`) are burned, adding their count to `total_hours`.\n  - **Leftover Calculation**: The burned candles become leftovers. The number of new candles that can be made is calculated by integer division of the total leftovers by `b`. The remaining leftovers after conversion are stored.\n- **Termination**: The loop exits when no more candles can be made (`current` becomes zero), and the total hours are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal usage to maximize the total burning hours.",
