    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a simpler approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the entire string might be considered, but if no duplicate substring of positive length exists, we output 0.\n 2. Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to iterate over possible lengths from the maximum down to 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can collect all substrings and then check for duplicates. But note: we are looking for the longest one that appears at least twice.\n\n Approach:\n Let n = len(string)\n We can start by checking for the longest substring (length L) that appears at least twice.\n\n We can do:\n   For L in range(n//2, 0, -1):   # Actually, the maximum length is n, but we can break when we find one? But note: the same substring might appear multiple times, but we are looking for at least two.\n   However, we must consider that the substring might not necessarily be half the string. Actually, the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice (with overlapping allowed) is n (if the whole string appears twice? but then the string must be periodic). But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and the two occurrences can overlap.\n\n But note: if we have a substring of length L, then the starting indices for the first occurrence must be i and j (i < j) such that j-i >= L (for non-overlapping) or we allow overlapping? The problem says \"occurrences can overlap\", meaning that they can share some characters.\n\n Example: \"ababa\" -> substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2 (overlapping). So we are allowed to have overlapping.\n\n How about: \n   We want to find the maximum L such that there exist two starting indices i and j (i < j) with i+L <= n and j+L <= n, and s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L].\n\n We can do:\n   Let ans = 0\n   For length L from min(n, ...) down to 1:\n        Use a set to record all distinct substrings of length L, and also check if any substring appears more than once (or at least twice). But note: we don't need the exact count, just if there's at least two.\n\n   However, we can break as soon as we find an L for which there are at least two distinct substrings (but wait, we are looking for the longest, so we should start from the maximum possible L and go downwards until we find one that has duplicates).\n\n   The maximum possible L is floor((n+1)/2) ? Not exactly. Consider \"abcabc\": the substring \"abc\" of length 3 appears twice, and 3 is more than half of 6 (which is 3). Actually, the maximum L is n, but if the whole string appears twice, then the string must be repeated. But note: we are allowed to have overlapping, so even if the string is \"aaa\", then the substring \"a\" (length 1) appears multiple times, but also \"aa\" (length 2) appears multiple times: \n        \"aaa\": \n          length 3: \"aaa\" only once -> not valid.\n          length 2: \"aa\" appears twice (from index0 and index1) -> valid, so answer 2.\n\n   Actually, the maximum L can be as large as n-1? Because if the entire string is \"aaaa\", then the substring of length 3 (\"aaa\") appears three times, so we can have L=3 for n=4.\n\n   But note: the two occurrences must be non-overlapping? No, they can overlap. So the condition is just that there are two starting indices i and j (with i < j) such that j-i < L (so they can overlap) and the substring is the same.\n\n   However, if we take L = n, then we have only one substring: the whole string. So we cannot have two occurrences of the entire string unless the string is repeated (like \"abcabc\") and then the entire string would be of length 6, and we could have two occurrences that are adjacent (non-overlapping). But if the string is \"abcabc\", then the entire string \"abcabc\" appears only once (unless the string is \"abcabcabc\", then the entire string \"abcabc\" appears twice: from index0 to 5 and from index3 to 8). However, our input string is fixed.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"can be met in the string at least twice\". So we are only considering the given string.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum L we can consider is n (the entire string) only if the entire string appears twice (as a contiguous substring) in the string. But if the string is \"abcabc\", then the entire string \"abcabc\" (length 6) appears only once (because the next occurrence would require the string to be longer). However, we can have two occurrences that are overlapping? Actually, the substring of length 6 must start at index0 and then the next occurrence must start at index>=1, but 1+6>6 (if the string is \"abcabc\") so it doesn't fit. \n\n   So actually, the maximum L for which a substring appears twice is at most n-1. Why?\n        Suppose we have two occurrences of a substring of length L. The first occurrence starts at i, the second at j (with i<j). Then we require j+L <= n (to not go out of bounds). The smallest j can be is i+1 (overlapping). Then we require i+L <= n and i+1+L <= n -> i+L <= n-1. So the condition is that the substring must end at or before n-1 (if we consider 0-indexed, the substring from i to i+L-1 must be within [0, n-1], and the next occurrence from j=i+1 must end at j+L-1 = i+L, which must be <= n-1). Therefore, i+L <= n-1, so the first occurrence must end at n-2 at the latest. Therefore, the maximum L we can have is n-1? \n\n   But wait, what if we have two non-overlapping occurrences? Then j >= i+L. Then we require j+L <= n, so i+L + L <= n -> i+2*L <= n. The maximum L then is floor((n)/2). However, the problem allows overlapping, so the condition is less strict.\n\n   Actually, the above reasoning for overlapping was: the two occurrences can start at i and i+1, then the first substring goes from i to i+L-1, the second from i+1 to i+L. Then the entire substring must be contained in the string from index i to i+L (which is a segment of length L+1). So we require i+L <= n-1 (since the last character of the second substring is at i+L, and we need that index to be <= n-1). Therefore, i can be from 0 to n-L-1.\n\n   So the maximum L we can consider is n-1 (if we allow overlapping). But note: if the string is \"aaa\", then for L=2: \n        substring \"aa\" can be found at index0 and index1. \n        Then we require for index0: 0+2 = 2 <= 2 (the string length is 3, so n=3 -> 0+2<=3-1? 2<=2 -> true). \n        So for L=2, the condition holds.\n\n   However, if the string is \"abcd\", then the maximum L is 0 because no substring of positive length appears twice.\n\n   Therefore, we can iterate L from min(n-1, n) down to 1? Actually, we can consider L from min(n, n) but note: for L=n, we require two starting indices i and j (with j>=i+1) such that i+n <= n-1 and j+n<=n-1? \n        i+n <= n-1 -> i <= -1 -> impossible. So L=n is never possible.\n\n   Similarly, for L = n-1: \n        The substring is of length n-1. The starting index i must satisfy i+n-1 <= n-1 -> i<=0. So i=0 is the only possibility. Then the substring is s[0:n-1]. Now, we need another occurrence: j must be at least 1, and j+n-1 <= n-1 -> j<=0 -> impossible. So L=n-1 is also not possible (unless n==1, then n-1=0, which we don't consider because n>=1 and we are iterating from 1 to n-1).\n\n   Actually, let me correct: for L=n-1, the condition for the second occurrence is j+n-1 <= n-1 -> j<=0. But j must be greater than i (which is 0) so j>=1, which fails. So indeed, L=n-1 is not possible.\n\n   Now, what is the maximum L? It must be at most floor((n+1)/2) ??? \n\n   Let me think: \n        We require two occurrences. The first occurrence is at i, the second at j (with j>=i+1). The first occurrence covers [i, i+L-1] and the second [j, j+L-1]. We require j+L-1 <= n-1 -> j <= n-L. Also, j>=i+1. The first occurrence requires i+L-1<=n-1 -> i<=n-L.\n\n   We can choose i from 0 to n-L, and j from i+1 to n-L. So we need at least two distinct starting indices i and j (with i<j) such that the substring s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L].\n\n   The maximum L for which this is possible is limited by the fact that we have at least two starting positions. The maximum L for which two starting positions exist is when n-L >= 1 (so L <= n-1) but also we require that the two substrings are the same.\n\n   However, we are not limited by the number of starting positions per se, but by the condition that the substring repeats. \n\n   Another idea: since the string length is at most 100, we can simply check for every L from 1 to n (but we know L=n is impossible, so from 1 to n-1) and for each L, check all substrings of length L and see if any substring appears at least twice.\n\n   Steps:\n        n = len(s)\n        For L in range(n-1, 0, -1):   # from n-1 down to 1\n            seen = {}\n            for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[start:start+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    # we found a duplicate for this L\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = 1\n\n        If we don't find any, then print 0.\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears more than twice? We break at the first duplicate we find. However, we are iterating from the largest L downward, so we will return the largest L for which there is a duplicate.\n\n   However, we must note: we are checking for duplicate in the current L. We are building a dictionary for each L separately.\n\n   Example: \"ababa\"\n        L=4: substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> we see \"aba\" twice. So we return 3.\n\n   Example: \"aaa\"\n        L=2: substrings: \"aa\", \"aa\" -> duplicate, so return 2.\n\n   Example: \"abcd\": no duplicate for any L from 1 to 3, so returns 0.\n\n   But wait, what about L=1 for \"abcd\"? \n        Substrings: 'a','b','c','d' -> no duplicate, so we move on to L=0? We are going from n-1 down to 1, so we don't check L=0. That's okay because the problem says \"longest substring\", and if there's no substring of length>=1 that appears twice, then we output 0.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require the substring to be of length>=1? It says \"at least twice\", and the empty substring? But the problem states the string is non-empty, and the example outputs are 0, 3, 2.\n\n   The problem says: Output one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n   The empty substring (length 0) appears everywhere? Actually, the empty substring is considered to appear infinitely many times. But the problem says \"substring\", and typically we consider non-empty? However, the examples: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> [0,3,2]. \n\n   In the example, for \"abcd\" we output 0. This implies that the problem does not consider the empty substring, or if it does, then the empty substring is the only one that appears at least twice, but then why output 0? \n\n   Let me read the problem statement: \"find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\"\n\n   The empty substring is a substring (by definition) and appears at least twice. However, the problem says \"longest\", so if the empty substring is allowed, then we would always have 0 as the answer (because the empty substring has length 0, and if there's no non-empty substring that appears twice, then the longest is 0). \n\n   But the example: \n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] \n        Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   So for \"abcd\", we output 0. This matches: because the empty substring is the only one that appears at least twice? But wait, the empty substring appears everywhere, so it does appear at least twice. However, the problem might be considering non-empty substrings? \n\n   Let's check the sample: \n        \"zzz\": \n            non-empty substrings: \n                length1: 'z' (appears 3 times) -> so we output 2 (because the sample output is 2). \n            But wait, the longest substring that appears at least twice is of length2: \"zz\" (appears twice: at index0 and index1). So the answer is 2.\n\n   However, the empty substring is length0, and there's also the substring \"z\" (length1) that appears 3 times. Then why the answer for \"zzz\" is 2? Because we are looking for the longest. \n\n   Therefore, we are to find the maximum length L (starting from the maximum possible) for which there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice. And if we find one, we output that L. If we don't find any (non-empty) substring that appears twice, then we output 0.\n\n   But note: the empty substring is length0. However, the problem says \"substring\", and typically in programming problems, substring can be empty. But the problem does not specify. \n\n   However, the example input \"abcd\" gives 0. If we consider the empty substring, then we would output 0 because that is the longest (since there is no non-empty substring that repeats). But if we don't consider the empty substring, then we also output 0.\n\n   So the problem likely does not consider the empty substring? Or the problem expects 0 to be the answer when no non-empty substring repeats.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"at least twice\". The empty substring meets that condition. However, the problem says \"longest\", so if we have both empty substring (length0) and a non-empty substring (say length1) that repeats, then we would choose the non-empty one. But in \"zzz\", the non-empty substring \"zz\" (length2) is longer than \"z\" (length1). \n\n   However, the problem does not require the substring to be non-empty, but the examples suggest that they are considering non-empty substrings? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the example outputs are consistent with not considering the empty substring (because if we consider the empty substring, then the answer for \"zzz\" would be 0? no, because 0 is the empty substring, but we found a substring of length2 which is longer than 0). \n\n   But wait: the empty substring is length0, and the substring \"zz\" is length2, so 2>0, so we output 2.\n\n   The problem: the empty substring is always present (infinite times). But the problem is asking for the longest. So if we have a non-empty substring that repeats, we ignore the empty substring because we are looking for the longest.\n\n   Therefore, we don't need to worry about the empty substring because we are iterating from the maximum L (which is n-1) down to 1. We are only considering positive lengths.\n\n   However, the problem does not explicitly say non-empty. But the examples output 0 for \"abcd\", meaning that the empty substring is considered? Or not?\n\n   Let me clarify: \n        In competitive programming, sometimes problems consider the empty substring, sometimes not. But note: the problem says \"substring\", and the standard definition includes the empty substring.\n\n   But the example output for \"abcd\" is 0. So if we output 0, that might be interpreted as the empty substring (if the problem considers it) or as no duplicate found (if the problem doesn't consider the empty substring). \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\"\n\n   The empty substring is a substring and it meets the condition (appears at least twice). So the longest substring (by length) that appears at least twice is the empty substring (length0). \n\n   But then why is the answer for \"zzz\" 2? Because 2 is greater than 0, so we output 2.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider the empty substring. However, note: the problem says \"longest\", so we are comparing by length. The empty substring has length0, and if we find a substring of length L (positive) that appears twice, then we output L (which is positive, so larger than 0). \n\n   So we don't need to handle the empty substring separately because we are iterating from the maximum L (which is n-1) down to 1, and if we find a duplicate at L, we output L. And if we don't find any duplicate for L>=1, then the next candidate is the empty substring (L=0) which is always present. \n\n   But wait, the problem says \"at least twice\", and the empty substring is present (infinitely many times). So we must output 0 if no positive-length substring repeats, because the empty substring is the longest (0) and that is the only one.\n\n   However, our algorithm above does not consider L=0. \n\n   So we must adjust: \n        We are iterating from n-1 down to 1. If we find a duplicate in that range, we output the L and exit. Otherwise, we output 0.\n\n   This 0 is the length of the empty substring? \n\n   But note: the problem does not specify that the substring must be non-empty. So we are effectively saying that the empty substring is allowed, and we output 0 when no non-empty substring repeats.\n\n   That matches the sample: \n        \"abcd\": no non-empty substring repeats -> output 0 (meaning the empty substring is the answer, but note: the empty substring is always there, so the answer is 0).\n        \"ababa\": we find \"aba\" (length3) -> output 3.\n        \"zzz\": we find \"zz\" (length2) -> output 2.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have a string of all same characters? For example, \"aaaa\":\n        n=4.\n        Check L=3: \n            substrings: \"aaa\" (from index0), then from index1: \"aaa\" (from index1 to 3) -> so duplicate found, output 3.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"aaa\" (length3) appears twice: \n        s[0:3] = \"aaa\", s[1:4] = \"aaa\"\n\n   So the answer for \"aaaa\" is 3.\n\n   However, note: we are iterating from L=n-1 (which is 3) down to 1. We check L=3 and find a duplicate, so we output 3.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"can be met in the string at least twice\", and \"occurrences can overlap\". The above example uses overlapping? Actually, the two occurrences of \"aaa\" in \"aaaa\" are overlapping (they share two characters). \n\n   Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # We consider L from n-1 down to 1 (because L=n is impossible as we saw)\n        # But note: the maximum L we can have is n-1, but we can also have a substring of length L that appears twice even if L is as small as 1.\n\n        # However, we can optimize by starting from the maximum possible L that we know is the maximum (n-1) and going down.\n\n        # But note: the maximum L for which a duplicate exists might be less than n-1. We are breaking at the first duplicate we find (largest L).\n\n        # Algorithm:\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = True\n\n        # If no duplicate found for any L from 1 to n-1, then output 0 (empty substring)\n\n        print(0)\n\n   However, let me test with a few examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> no duplicate, output 0. Correct.\n\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> \n        L=4: substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: substrings: \n            i=0: \"aba\" -> not seen -> add\n            i=1: \"bab\" -> not seen -> add\n            i=2: \"aba\" -> seen! -> output 3. Correct.\n\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" -> \n        L=2: \n            i=0: \"zz\" -> add\n            i=1: \"zz\" -> found duplicate -> output 2. Correct.\n\n   Example 4: \"aaaa\" -> \n        L=3: \n            i=0: \"aaa\" -> add\n            i=1: \"aaa\" -> found duplicate -> output 3. Correct.\n\n   Example 5: \"a\" -> \n        n=1, then loop from 0 to 0 (range(0,0,-1)) -> no iteration, then output 0. Correct.\n\n   Example 6: \"aa\" -> \n        n=2, then L from 1 down to 1.\n        L=1: \n            i=0: \"a\" -> add\n            i=1: \"a\" -> found duplicate -> output 1. \n        But wait, the substring \"a\" (length1) appears twice. So the answer is 1.\n\n   However, is there a longer substring? The entire string \"aa\" (length2) appears only once. So 1 is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"longest substring\", so 1 is the longest because 2 is not duplicated.\n\n   Example 7: \"aabbaabb\" (periodic string) -> \n        Let's look for the longest repeated substring. \n        The entire string \"aabbaabb\" (length8) is not repeated (only once). \n        Then check L=7: \"aabbaab\", \"abbaabb\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=6: \"aabbaa\", \"abbaab\", \"bbaabb\" -> no duplicate?\n            Actually, we have two occurrences of \"aabbaa\"? \n            s[0:6] = \"aabbaa\", s[4:10] -> out of bounds. \n            Actually, we are checking for L=6: \n                s[0:6] = \"aabbaa\"\n                s[1:7] = \"abbaab\"\n                s[2:8] = \"bbaabb\"\n            Now, is there any duplicate? \n            Then L=5: \n                s[0:5] = \"aabba\", s[1:6]=\"abbaa\", s[2:7]=\"bbaab\", s[3:8]=\"aabb\" (wait, no: for L=5, substring of length5: \n                s[0:5] = \"aabba\"\n                s[1:6] = \"abbaa\"\n                s[2:7] = \"bbaab\"\n                s[3:8] = \"baabb\"\n            Then L=4:\n                s[0:4]=\"aabb\", s[1:5]=\"abba\", s[2:6]=\"bbaa\", s[3:7]=\"baab\", s[4:8]=\"aabb\" -> duplicate \"aabb\" at index0 and index4 -> so output 4.\n\n        But wait, is there a longer substring? \n        What about L=4 is the maximum? \n\n        However, note: the entire string is periodic with period 4? \n        Actually, the string \"aabbaabb\" can be broken into two copies of \"aabb\". \n        So the substring \"aabb\" (length4) appears twice (at indices0 and indices4). \n\n        So the algorithm outputs 4.\n\n   But note: there is a substring of length4 that appears twice. Is there a substring of length5 that appears twice? \n        We checked: no.\n\n   So the algorithm is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above algorithm may use a lot of memory for storing substrings (each substring of length L, and we do for each L). But n<=100, and the maximum L is 99, but the total number of substrings we check is the sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1). For n=100, that's about 100*100/2 = 5000 substrings, which is acceptable.\n\n   But we can break early when we find a duplicate for a given L.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a set for each L and break when we find a duplicate.\n\n   We are already doing that.\n\n   Code:\n\n   Note: We assume the input is one string.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, the problem says: the first input line contains the string.\n\n   Example input format: \n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   But note: the example is given as a list, but the actual input is one string per line.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   Then proceed.\n\n   But note: the example input might have multiple test cases? The problem says \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n   So we assume one string per run.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of strings. But the problem says \"The first input line\", so we read one line.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example: \"abcd\" -> output 0\n        Example: \"ababa\" -> output 3\n        Example: \"zzz\" -> output 2\n\n   But wait, the sample output for \"zzz\" is 2, and our code outputs 2.\n\n   However, the sample input is given as:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This might be a typo in the problem statement. The problem says the first input line contains the string. So if we are to read one string, then the sample input should be provided as:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   But the example input is shown as a list. \n\n   Clarification: the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning one string per program run.\n\n   We'll read one string.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is non-empty.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # If the string is empty, then we output 0, but the problem says non-empty, so we skip.\n\n        # We consider L from n-1 down to 1.\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n        print(0)\n\n   However, the problem says the string length doesn't exceed 100, so using a set for each L is acceptable.\n\n   But note: worst-case, for a string of 100 characters, the set for L=1 would have up to 100 elements, then L=2: up to 99, etc. The total operations is the sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) which is O(n^2). For n=100, that's about 5000 substrings, which is acceptable.\n\n   Let me test with a string of 100 same characters: 'a'*100. Then for each L, we are storing substrings that are all the same. But wait, for L=1: \n        We store 'a' and then at the next index we see 'a' again -> duplicate, so we break at L=1 and output 1.\n\n   But wait, we are iterating from the largest L (99) down to 1. So we start with L=99: \n        We are going to check for duplicates in substrings of length99. \n        There are two: \n            i=0: substring = 'a'*99\n            i=1: substring = 'a'*99 -> duplicate -> output 99.\n\n   So the code outputs 99 for a string of 100 same characters.\n\n   But is that correct? \n        The substring of length99 (all 'a') appears at least twice (at index0 and index1). So yes.\n\n   However, the problem says \"longest\", so 99 is the longest.\n\n   But note: the entire string (length100) is not repeated, so we cannot use 100.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   One more edge: string with two different characters, say \"ababab...\", but we already tested \"ababa\".\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, but we are reading one string.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution must efficiently determine the answer for strings of length up to 100.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest substring within a given string that occurs at least twice. The key observation here is that the solution must consider all possible substrings of decreasing lengths, starting from the largest possible down to 1, and check for duplicates. The first duplicate found at any length will be the answer since we are checking from the largest to the smallest substring.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating from the largest possible substring length (which is `n-1` for a string of length `n`) down to 1, we can efficiently find the longest substring that repeats. For each length `L`, we examine all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return `L` as the result.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves nested loops: the outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from `n-1` down to 1, and the inner loop checks all substrings of the current length for duplicates using a set. This approach ensures that the first valid length found (from the largest) is the answer.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n^3) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because for each length `L`, we process up to `n - L + 1` substrings, each of length `L`. However, given the constraint `n â‰¤ 100`, this approach is feasible and efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            seen.add(substr)\n    \n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initial Check**: The length of the string `n` is determined. The outer loop starts from `n-1` (the maximum possible substring length that can repeat) down to 1.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: For each substring length `L`, a set is used to keep track of substrings encountered. Each substring of length `L` is checked against the set. If a duplicate is found, the length `L` is printed, and the program exits.\n4. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the program outputs `0`, indicating that only the empty substring (or no non-empty substring) repeats, though the problem context implies non-empty substrings are considered.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the first valid length, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
