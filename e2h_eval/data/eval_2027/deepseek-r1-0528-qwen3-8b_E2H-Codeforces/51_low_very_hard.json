Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to combine the first two strings (guest's name and host's name) and then check if the sorted version of this combined string is the same as the sorted version of the third string (the pile of letters).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and remove any extra whitespace (like newline characters).\n 2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest and host) to get the required letters.\n 3. Sort the concatenated string and sort the third string (the pile).\n 4. Compare the two sorted strings.\n\n However, note: the example input has multiple test cases? Actually, the problem states that the input consists of three lines. But the example provided is a list of three different examples.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as:\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... ]\n\n This seems to be one example with three lines. The problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n So, we are only dealing with one test case per run.\n\n However, looking at the example output, it shows ['YES','NO','NO'] for the input list. That input list actually contains three separate examples.\n\n Clarification from problem: the input file consists of three lines. So each test case is three lines.\n\n But the example input is given as a list of three strings? Actually, the example input is:\n\n Input:\n   SANTACLAUS\n   DEDMOROZ\n   SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n Then the next sample is:\n\n   PAPAINOEL\n   JOULUPUKKI\n   JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n And the third sample is:\n\n   BABBONATALE\n   FATHERCHRISTMAS\n   BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n So, we have three independent test cases in the example, but the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\".\n\n Actually, the problem statement says: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n This means we are reading one test case: three lines.\n\n However, the example output is a list of three answers. This suggests that the example input might be three test cases, each consisting of three lines? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n So, if the input file has three lines, then we have one test case.\n\n But then the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each containing three lines? Actually, no. The example input is given as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n This is confusing.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n So, one test case has three lines. But the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string being a mix of three consecutive lines? \n\n Let me clarify: the example input is given as a single string with three lines? Or are there three test cases?\n\n Looking at the problem statement: \n   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n And the example input is shown as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n This is likely the way the input is provided in the example. But in reality, the input file would have three lines for one test case.\n\n However, the example output is a list of three answers. This implies that the example input might be three separate runs, or the problem expects to handle multiple test cases?\n\n But the problem does not specify multiple test cases. It says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n Let me check the constraints: the length of each line does not exceed 100. \n\n After re‚Äêreading the problem statement: \n   \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n So, we assume one test case.\n\n But then why the example output is a list of three? \n\n Actually, the example input is provided as three separate test cases for illustration. Each test case is three lines.\n\n Since the problem says the input file has three lines, we must read three lines.\n\n However, the example input format in the problem is given as a list of three strings. This might be just an example representation.\n\n How should we handle the input?\n\n Since the problem says the input file consists of three lines, we can simply read three lines.\n\n But note: the example input is provided as a string that has newlines. So in the actual input, we will read:\n\n   line1 = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   line2 = \"DEDMOR",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the sorted version of the combined names matches the sorted version of the pile of letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input Lines**: The input consists of three lines: the first line is the guest's name, the second line is the host's name, and the third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Sort Strings**: Sort the combined string of names and the pile of letters separately.\n4. **Compare Sorted Strings**: If the sorted combined string matches the sorted pile of letters, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the possibility of forming the original names from the pile of letters by leveraging sorting, which ensures an exact match in terms of letter counts and arrangement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest_name = input().strip()\n    host_name = input().strip()\n    pile_letters = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest_name + host_name\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile_letters):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the combined string and the pile of letters are sorted alphabetically. If the sorted versions match, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, allowing them to be rearranged into the original names. The result is then printed as \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on this comparison.\n\nThis method efficiently checks for the required conditions by leveraging the properties of sorting and string comparison, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
