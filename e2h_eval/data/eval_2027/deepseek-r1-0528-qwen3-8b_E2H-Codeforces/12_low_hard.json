The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are moving in a circular ring road (clockwise) with n houses.\n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each requiring to be at house a_i (with the condition that we must complete tasks in order).\n\n Since the ringroad is circular and one-way (clockwise), we can only move from house i to house i+1 (with house n+1 being house 1).\n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to go through the entire circle necessarily. We can break the journey by going from house n to house 1.\n\n But note: the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n   Output: 6\n\n Explanation: \n   Start at 1 -> then go to 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3. \n   Alternatively, we can think of it as:\n     From 1 to 3: requires 2 steps (since from 1 to 2 to 3) OR if we consider the ring, we might also consider going backwards? \n   But wait: the ringroad is clockwise only. So from house 1, to get to house 3, we can only go 1->2->3 (which is 2 steps). \n\n   Then from 3 to 2: but wait, because we are at 3 and we need to go to 2, and the ring is clockwise, we cannot go counterclockwise. \n   Actually, the ring is circular so after 3 comes 4, then 1, then 2. So going from 3 to 2: we have two options?\n   However, the problem says the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So we must follow the clockwise direction.\n\n   Therefore, the movement is constrained: \n      We can only move from i to i+1 (with n+1 meaning 1).\n\n   So the distance from house x to house y in a clockwise-only ring is:\n        If x <= y: then distance = y - x\n        If x > y: then distance = (n - x) + y\n\n   But note: we are allowed to traverse the entire circle arbitrarily.\n\n However, the catch is that we must complete the tasks in order. So we start at house 1, then do task at a1, then a2, ... until am.\n\n The total time is the sum of the distances from the current house to the next task's house, but note that we are free to break the journey by going around the circle.\n\n Example: \n   First test case: n=4, m=3, tasks = [3,2,3]\n\n   Step 1: from 1 to 3 -> clockwise: \n        Option 1: 1->2->3: 2 steps.\n        Alternatively, we could go 1->4->1->2->3: which is 3 steps (but that's more, so we don't want that).\n\n   Step 2: from 3 to 2: \n        Since 3>2, we have to go from 3 to 4, then 4 to 1, then 1 to 2: that's 3 steps. \n        But wait, is there a shorter way? Actually, no, because the ring is one-way. \n\n   Step 3: from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n\n   Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n   However, the example output is 6.\n\n   But wait, the example says the sequence is: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. That is 6 moves.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one\" takes one unit. So we are counting the edges.\n\n   Now, let's compute for the second example: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        Output: 2\n\n   Steps: \n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 2 -> from 1 to 2: 1 step.\n        Second task: 3 -> from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n        Third task: 3 -> already at 3, so 0 steps.\n\n        Total: 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n   So the key is: we are allowed to stay at a house if the next task is at the same or a previous one, but because the ring is clockwise, we must account for the circularity.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not require to return to the start, just to complete all tasks.\n\n   We can model the journey as:\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current = 1\n\n        For each task location a_i:\n            if current <= a_i:\n                steps = a_i - current\n            else:\n                steps = n -",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ring road in a clockwise direction. The ring road consists of `n` houses numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order. Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete `m` tasks, each requiring her to be at specific house numbers in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that movement is restricted to the clockwise direction only. Therefore, the distance between two houses can be calculated based on their positions:\n   - If the current house is less than or equal to the target house, the distance is simply the difference between them.\n   - If the current house is greater than the target house, the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ring (house `n`) and then continuing from house 1 to the target house. This distance is `(n - current) + target`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We process each task in the given order, starting from house 1. For each task, we compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using the above logic and add this distance to the total time. We then update the current position to the task's house for the next iteration.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(m), where `m` is the number of tasks. This is optimal as each task must be processed at least once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for task in tasks:\n        if current <= task:\n            steps = task - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + task\n        total_time += steps\n        current = task\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n- **Processing Tasks**: Starting from house 1, for each task, the code calculates the shortest path in the clockwise direction. If the task is ahead of the current position, the distance is straightforward. If the task is behind, the path wraps around the ring from the current position to the end and then continues from the start to the task.\n- **Output**: The total time taken to complete all tasks is printed after processing each task.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the constraints of the circular movement, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
