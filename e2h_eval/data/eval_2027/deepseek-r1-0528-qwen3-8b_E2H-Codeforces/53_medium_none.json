    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and occurrences can overlap).\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check for each possible substring length (from the maximum possible down) whether there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. If the string is empty or has length 1, then the answer is 0 (since no duplicate substring of positive length exists).\n 3. Otherwise, we start from the maximum possible substring length (which is n-1, because if we have two same substrings, they must be of length L and we need at least two of them, so the entire string must be at least 2*L? Actually, the two occurrences can be anywhere, even overlapping, so the entire string length doesn't necessarily have to be 2*L. But note: we are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice. The maximum possible substring length is floor(n/2) if we require two non-overlapping? Actually, the problem says they can overlap. For example, in \"ababa\", substring \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2.\n\n However, note: the two occurrences can be any two (they don't have to be non-overlapping). So the maximum length of such substring cannot exceed floor((n+1)/2) ??? Let's think: \n In fact, the entire string might be of length n. The two occurrences of a substring of length L must be two contiguous segments of length L. The condition is that the two segments (which can overlap) must be identical.\n\n But note: the two occurrences can be the same segment? No, two different occurrences. Even if they are overlapping, they are two distinct starting indices.\n\n Example: \n   Input: 'zzz' -> output 2. Because the substring \"zz\" appears at index0 and index1.\n\n Approach:\n Let n = len(s)\n We'll consider substring lengths from min(n, ...) down to 1. Actually, the maximum length we can have for a substring that appears at least twice is floor(n/1) but wait: if we take the entire string, then we need two copies. However, if the entire string is duplicated, then the string must be of length at least 2*n. But wait, the two occurrences can overlap? Actually, the two occurrences must be two contiguous parts. So the entire string being duplicated would require two copies without overlapping? \n\n Actually, the problem does not require the two occurrences to be consecutive or non-overlapping. They can be anywhere. But note: the substring must be contiguous and appear at two different starting indices.\n\n However, the maximum length of a substring that appears twice is limited by the fact that if we have a substring of length L, then the two occurrences must start at two different indices i and j, and the substring s[i:i+L] must equal s[j:j+L]. The condition for the two occurrences is that they don't go beyond the string, so the starting index must be <= n - L.\n\n So we can iterate from L = min(n, ...) down to 1, and for each L, check if there exists at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice (with two different starting indices).\n\n But note: the two occurrences can be adjacent or even overlapping arbitrarily. However, we don't require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping.\n\n How to check for a fixed L?\n We can use a dictionary to record the substrings of length L and their starting indices. Then, if we find a substring that appears at least two times (with different starting indices), then L is a candidate.\n\n However, we want the longest L. So we can start from L_max = n-1 (because if we take the entire string, then we need two copies, which requires at least two copies of a substring of length n, but the entire string only has one occurrence of a substring of length n) and go down until we find an L that satisfies the condition.\n\n But wait: the entire string is of length n, so the maximum L for which we can have two distinct occurrences is actually n-1? Because if we take a substring of length n-1, then we have two possibilities: starting at index0 and index1. So we can have two substrings of length n-1: s[0:n-1] and s[1:n]. \n\n However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice. So we should start from the maximum possible L (which is n-1) and go down until we find an L for which there is at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: we might have a longer substring that appears twice if the string is long enough? Actually, the maximum L is n-1 because to have two distinct occurrences of a substring of length L, we must have two starting indices i and j (i < j) such that j <= n-L. The maximum L for which two distinct occurrences exist is when we have two consecutive starting indices: i and i+1, then the substring is s[i:i+L] and s[i+1:i+L+1]. This requires that the substring of length L starting at i and the substring of length L starting at i+1 are the same. And the condition is that the entire string must have at least two consecutive blocks of length L that are identical.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Let n = len(s)\n For L in range(n, 0, -1):   # from n down to 1\n   We look for two different starting indices i and j (i < j) such that j <= n-L and s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L]\n\n But wait: what if the two occurrences are not consecutive? We don't require consecutive, so we can use a dictionary to record all substrings of length L and their starting indices. Then if any substring appears at least two times, we break and return L.\n\n However, since the problem asks for the longest, we can start from the maximum L (which is n-1) and go downwards until we find one.\n\n But note: the maximum L might be less than n-1. For example, if the string is \"abcabc\", then the entire string is length 6, but the substring \"abc\" (length 3) appears twice. However, we are going from high to low, so we will first check L=5 (which fails because there's no substring of length 5 that appears twice: the two substrings of length 5 are \"abcab\" and \"bcabc\", which are different). Then L=4: similarly, \"abca\" and \"bcab\" are different, then L=3: \"abc\" appears twice (at index0 and index3). So we output 3.\n\n But note: the two occurrences of \"abc\" in \"abcabc\" are separated by one character, so they are not overlapping. That's allowed.\n\n However, the problem says the occurrences can overlap. So in \"ababa\", the substring \"aba\" (length3) appears at index0 and index2 (overlapping). So we must consider overlapping as well.\n\n But our method for fixed L: we are going to consider every substring of length L, so we are going to consider overlapping ones too.\n\n Steps for fixed L:\n   We can use a dictionary to store the substring and the list of starting indices, but we don't really need the list, we just need to know if there are at least two distinct starting indices.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a set to record the substring and also track the number of occurrences. However, we don't need to know the exact starting indices, just the count.\n\n But note: we are iterating from the maximum L downward, so as soon as we find an L for which there is a substring appearing at least twice, we output that L and exit.\n\n However, we must consider: what if there are multiple substrings of the same length? We don't care, we just need one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n Implementation for fixed L:\n\n   seen = {}\n   for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            # we already saw this substring, so we have at least two occurrences\n            print(L)\n            exit(0)\n        else:\n            seen[substr] = 1   # or just mark it as seen\n\n   But wait: what if we see the same substring again? We break as soon as we see a duplicate.\n\n However, note: we are storing the substring and the count. But the above code breaks as soon as we see the same substring again. But we are iterating from the beginning, and we are storing the substring we've seen. However, if we see a substring for the first time, we store it. Then when we see it again, we break.\n\n But wait, we are checking the same substring again. However, we are storing the substring and we don't care about the order. But note: we are iterating from left to right, so the first occurrence is stored and then the next occurrence is found.\n\n However, what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second occurrence, which is correct.\n\n But note: we are iterating from the maximum L downward. So we start with the largest L and then go down until we find one.\n\n But what if a larger L is found? Then we output that larger L. This is correct.\n\n However, there is a catch: when we consider a substring of length L, we are considering every contiguous substring of length L. But if we are using a dictionary, then we are storing the substring and we are checking for duplicates.\n\n But note: the same substring of length L might appear in two non-overlapping ways, but we are counting the same substring multiple times.\n\n Example: \"aaaa\", L=2: \n   substrings: \n      i=0: \"aa\" -> store\n      i=1: \"aa\" -> found duplicate -> output 2.\n\n But what if we have a string like \"abcde\", then for L=1: \n   We will see: 'a','b','c','d','e'. Each letter appears once. Then we move to L=0? But L starts from n down to 1, and we break when we find one.\n\n However, we are iterating from the maximum L (which is n-1) down to 1. So for \"abcde\", we check L=4,3,2,1. None of them will have duplicates? Then we output 0.\n\n But wait, the problem says the substring must appear at least twice. So if we don't find any, then the answer is 0.\n\n However, what about L=0? The problem says the substring must appear at least twice. A substring of length 0 is the empty string, but typically we don't consider that. The problem says the string is non-empty, but the substring must be of positive length? The examples: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] output [0,3,2]. \n\n The problem states: \"Output one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\"\n\n Note: the empty substring is everywhere and appears infinitely many times. However, the problem likely implies non-empty substring? Because the examples output 0 for 'abcd'. \n\n Let me read the problem statement: \"longest substring\". Typically, substring implies contiguous and non-empty? Actually, the empty substring is a substring, but the problem says \"at least twice\". However, the sample outputs: \n   'abcd' -> 0\n   'ababa' -> 3\n   'zzz' -> 2\n\n So they output 0 for a string with no repeated non-empty substring.\n\n Therefore, we are only considering positive-length substrings.\n\n But wait, the empty substring would always appear twice (actually more). Then why the answer for 'abcd' is 0? \n\n The problem says: \"the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". The empty substring is met at least twice (in fact, infinitely many times). Then the answer should be 0 for every string? \n\n However, the sample input 'abcd' gives 0, which matches. But then the problem must be considering the empty substring as valid? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"substring\". In some definitions, the empty string is included. However, the sample outputs: \n   'abcd' -> 0\n   'ababa' -> 3\n   'zzz' -> 2\n\n This implies that the empty substring is allowed? But then why is the answer for 'abcd' 0? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"longest substring\". The empty substring has length 0. But then the answer for any string should be 0, because the empty substring always appears at least twice.\n\n But wait, the sample output for 'abcd' is 0, which is correct. However, then why is the output for 'zzz' 2? That means we are not considering the empty substring? Or we are, but the problem is asking for the longest, and 2 is longer than 0, so we output 2.\n\n Actually, the problem says \"longest\", so if there is a non-empty substring that repeats, we output that length (which is >0) and ignore the empty substring.\n\n Therefore, we are to consider both empty and non-empty? But the problem says \"longest\", so the empty substring (length0) is the fallback if no positive-length substring repeats.\n\n However, the sample input 'abcd' has no positive-length substring that repeats, so the answer is 0 (the empty substring). But the sample input 'zzz' has a positive-length substring \"zz\" (length2) that repeats, so we output 2.\n\n But wait, in 'zzz', the empty substring is also present, but 2>0, so we output 2.\n\n So the algorithm should be:\n\n   We are to find the maximum length L (from 0 to n) such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   However, the empty substring (L=0) always appears at least twice. But we are to output the maximum L. So if we find a positive L, we output that. Otherwise, we output 0.\n\n But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so the empty substring is always present. But the problem expects:\n\n   'abcd' -> 0\n   'ababa' -> 3\n   'zzz' -> 2\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". The empty substring is the shortest. We are looking for the longest.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   We consider L from n down to 0 (including 0). We check for each L: is there a substring of length L that appears at least twice?\n\n   Then we output the maximum L for which the condition holds.\n\n   But note: if L=0, the condition holds (empty substring). But if there is a positive L that holds, then we output the maximum positive L.\n\n   However, we are iterating from the maximum L (n) downward. So we can break at the first L (starting from n) for which the condition holds, because we are going from high to low.\n\n   But wait, we want the maximum L. The maximum L for which the condition holds is the first one we meet when going from n down to 0.\n\n   However, what if a longer substring (say L1) satisfies the condition, and then a shorter one (L2) also satisfies, but we break at L1 and output L1? That's correct because we are looking for the maximum.\n\n   But note: the condition for a substring of length L is independent. It is possible that a longer substring does not appear twice, but a shorter one does. We are iterating from the longest (n) down to 0, so we break at the first L (largest) that satisfies the condition.\n\n   However, we must consider: the entire string (length n) can only appear once (unless the string is periodic and the entire string is repeated, but then the string would be longer). Actually, we are considering two distinct occurrences. The entire string can only start at index0. So no duplicate for the entire string.\n\n   Therefore, we start from L = n-1, then n-2, ... until 0.\n\n   But wait: what about the empty substring? We are including L=0. The problem says the string is non-empty, so we can include L=0.\n\n   However, the problem's examples output 0 for 'abcd', meaning that the empty substring is the answer because no positive-length substring repeats. But note: the empty substring is always present. \n\n   But the problem does not explicitly say that we are excluding the empty substring. So we must account for it.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"longest substring\". The empty substring has length 0. There might be a positive-length substring that repeats, then we output the positive length (which is longer). Otherwise, we output 0.\n\n   But note: the problem's sample outputs:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n        Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   For 'abcd': no positive-length substring repeats, so the answer is 0 (the empty substring is the only one that repeats, and it is the longest? Actually, no: the empty substring is the only one, but there are no positive-length ones. So the longest is 0.\n\n   However, wait: the empty substring is the only one that repeats? Actually, the empty substring repeats everywhere, but so do other substrings? Actually, the condition is: the substring must appear at least twice. The empty substring appears at every gap and at the boundaries, so definitely at least twice. But are there other substrings? \n\n   But the problem is: we are to find the longest substring (by length) that appears at least twice.\n\n   So if there is a substring of length 1 that appears twice, then we output 1 (if no longer substring appears twice) and not 0.\n\n   However, the example 'abcd' has no repeated substring of positive length, so the answer is 0.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n     Let n = len(s)\n     Let best = 0   # because the empty substring always works, so at least 0.\n\n     For L in range(n, 0, -1):   # from n down to 1\n        seen = {}   # dictionary for substrings of length L\n        found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                # we have seen this substring before, so we found a duplicate\n                best = L\n                found = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = True\n\n        if found:\n            break\n\n     Then output best.\n\n   But wait, what if we don't break in the inner loop? Then we continue to the next L (smaller). However, we are iterating from the largest L downward, and we break at the first L that has a duplicate. That L is the maximum L for which the condition holds.\n\n   However, what if a longer L doesn't have a duplicate, but a shorter one does? Then we break at the shorter one (but we are going from large to small, so we break at the first duplicate we find, which is the largest L that has a duplicate). \n\n   But note: we are iterating from n down to 1. So we check the largest L first. If we find a duplicate at L=n, then we output n and break. But the entire string of length n cannot be duplicated (because we only have one occurrence). So we skip L=n.\n\n   Then we check L=n-1, then n-2, etc.\n\n   Example 'zzz': n=3, then L=3: check substrings of length 3: only one substring \"zzz\", so no duplicate -> continue.\n        L=2: \n            i=0: substr=\"zz\"\n            i=1: substr=\"zz\" -> duplicate found. So best=2, break.\n\n   Example 'ababa': n=5, \n        L=5: one substring -> no duplicate.\n        L=4: substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: \n            i0: \"aba\"\n            i1: \"bab\"\n            i2: \"aba\" -> duplicate found (with i0). So best=3, break.\n\n   Example 'abcd': n=4, \n        L=4: no duplicate.\n        L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=2: \"ab\",\"bc\",\"cd\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate.\n\n        Then best remains 0.\n\n   However, we set best=0 initially. But wait, the empty substring is always present, so we should output 0. But note: our algorithm didn't account for the empty substring because we started from n down to 1.\n\n   We need to account for the empty substring. But the empty substring has length 0, and we are not checking L=0.\n\n   How to account for the empty substring? \n\n   We can set best=0 at the beginning, and if we don't find any positive-length substring that repeats, then we output 0.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the empty substring is allowed and it always appears at least twice. So the answer is at least 0.\n\n   However, we are breaking at the first positive L that has a duplicate. Then we output that positive L. If we don't break, we output 0.\n\n   This matches: \n        'abcd' -> 0\n        'ababa' -> 3\n        'zzz' -> 2\n\n   But wait, is the empty substring considered? The problem does not specify, but the sample output is 0 for 'abcd'. \n\n   However, note: the problem says \"longest substring\". The empty substring is the only one that repeats in 'abcd', so the longest is 0.\n\n   But what if the problem intended to exclude the empty substring? Then we would have to change the algorithm.\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \"longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". \n\n   In competitive programming, sometimes the empty substring is excluded. But the sample input 'abcd' outputs 0, which is the length of the empty substring.\n\n   Therefore, we are including the empty substring.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, but the substring can be empty.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"You're given a string of lower-case Latin letters.\" and the substring is defined by contiguous letters. The empty substring is contiguous? \n\n   In computer science, the empty string is considered a substring of every string.\n\n   So we are correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, but the substring can be empty.\n\n   However, the problem does not explicitly state that the substring must be non-empty. \n\n   Therefore, our algorithm:\n\n        Read the string s, let n = len(s)\n\n        best = 0   # because the empty substring (length0) is always present and appears at least twice.\n\n        # We consider positive-length substrings from n down to 1.\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            duplicate_found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    best = L\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = True\n\n            if duplicate_found:\n                break\n\n        print(best)\n\n   But wait, what if there are multiple substrings of the same length that repeat? We break at the first duplicate we find, which is acceptable because we are only interested in the length.\n\n   However, we are storing the substring in a dictionary and checking for duplicates. This is O(n) per L, and the total length is at most 100, so worst-case we do about 100 * 100 * 100 (for L from 100 down to 1, and for each L, we do n-L+1 iterations, and each substring operation is O(L)). But n<=100, so worst-case 100*100*100 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   But we can optimize by breaking early.\n\n   However, we can also use a set for the substrings of length L. But we are already doing that.\n\n   Another way: we can use a set for the substrings of length L and then check for duplicates. But we break as soon as we find one.\n\n   But note: we are storing the substring and then checking if we've seen it. This is efficient enough for n<=100.\n\n   However, let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"abcd\" -> n=4, we check L=4,3,2,1 and don't break, so best remains 0 -> output 0.\n\n   Example 2: \"ababa\" -> n=5, \n        L=5: one substring -> no duplicate.\n        L=4: two substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=3: \n            i0: \"aba\" -> store\n            i1: \"bab\" -> store\n            i2: \"aba\" -> found duplicate -> best=3, break -> output 3.\n\n   Example 3: \"zzz\" -> n=3,\n        L=3: one substring -> no duplicate.\n        L=2:\n            i0: \"zz\" -> store\n            i1: \"zz\" -> duplicate -> best=2, break -> output 2.\n\n   Example 4: \"aaa\" -> n=3,\n        L=3: \"aaa\" -> no duplicate (only one)\n        L=2: \n            i0: \"aa\", i1: \"aa\" -> duplicate -> output 2.\n\n   Example 5: \"a\" -> n=1, \n        We iterate from L=1 to 1: \n            i0: substring \"a\" -> no duplicate (only one occurrence) -> best remains 0.\n\n   Example 6: \"\" -> but the problem says non-empty string, so we don't need to handle.\n\n   Example 7: \"aa\" -> n=2,\n        L=2: \"aa\" -> no duplicate (only one occurrence) -> then L=1: \n            i0: \"a\", i1: \"a\" -> duplicate -> output 1.\n\n   But wait, \"aa\": the substring \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index1). So the longest substring that appears at least twice is \"a\", which has length 1.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"aa\" (length2) is the entire string and appears only once. So the answer is 1.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: occurrences can overlap. So in \"aa\", the substring \"a\" appears at index0 and index1, and these are two distinct occurrences (even though they are adjacent). \n\n   However, the problem does not require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping. Adjacent is allowed.\n\n   But note: the substring \"aa\" (length2) is the entire string, and we only have one occurrence. So that's correct.\n\n   However, what about the substring \"a\" (length1)? It appears twice, so we break at L=1.\n\n   But wait, we are iterating from L=2 down to 1. So we check L=2 first and then L=1. We break at L=1.\n\n   However, we must output the maximum L. In \"aa\", the maximum L is 1, because the substring of length2 does not repeat, but the substring of length1 does.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: what about the empty substring? The empty substring is of length0, and 1>0, so we output 1.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        best = 0\n\n        # If the string is empty, then n==0, but the problem says non-empty, so we assume n>=1.\n\n        # We consider L from n down to 1.\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            duplicate_found = False\n            # Generate all substrings of length L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    best = L\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = True\n\n            if duplicate_found:\n                break\n\n        print(best)\n\n   However, there is a possibility to optimize: if we find a duplicate, we break the outer loop. But we are already breaking.\n\n   But note: the worst-case scenario is when there is no duplicate, then we iterate for all L from n down to 1. The inner loop for L runs (n-L+1) steps, and we do that for each L from n to 1. The total operations is about sum_{L=1}^{n} (n-L+1) = O(n^2). And for each substring, we do a string comparison of length L. The worst-case total operations is O(n^3). For n=100, that is 100^3 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can use a different approach: check for each substring length from the top down, but we can use a set for each L. But we are already doing that.\n\n   But note: we can use a set for each L, but we are building a set for each L. We can avoid the set if we use a dictionary (as above) and break early.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a set and then check the length of the set. But that would require storing all substrings and then checking if the set size is less than the number of substrings. But that is more expensive because we have to store all and then check.\n\n   Our current method breaks as soon as we find a duplicate, so it is efficient in practice.\n\n   Let me test with a string that has no duplicate for any positive L, like \"abcd\": \n        n=4, we iterate L from 4 to 1, and for each L, we store all substrings and don't break until we finish the inner loop. Then we set best remains 0.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   One more edge: a string of all same characters, say \"aaaaa\" (n=5). \n        L=5: one substring -> no duplicate.\n        L=4: \n            substrings: \"aaaa\", \"aaaa\" (at i0 and i1) -> duplicate -> output 4.\n\n        But wait, the entire string \"aaaaa\" has two overlapping substrings of length4: \"aaaa\" at index0 and index1.\n\n        So the answer is 4.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is given as the first input line. We are reading from stdin.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the example input format: \n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is just showing the examples. We read one string.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So we read one line.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the example input is:\n\n        Input: \n          abcd\n          ababa\n          zzz\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So only one string per test case? \n\n   Actually, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input.\n\n   And the example input is given as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   But that is just the examples. The actual input is one string per run.\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Input\" and then \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   Therefore, we read one string.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a list of strings. Maybe the problem has multiple test cases? \n\n   Let me read the problem again: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular)\n\n   So we assume one test case per run.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   But wait, the example input format in the problem is shown as:\n\n        Input: \n          ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is confusing. Actually, the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\n   And the example input is given as a list. But that list contains three strings. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So the input is one string. \n\n   But the example input is shown as three strings. This might be a representation of multiple test cases. \n\n   Let me check the example output: ['0','3','2'].\n\n   This suggests that the input is multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular). \n\n   There's ambiguity. However, the problem says: \"competitive programming problem\", and typically problems may have multiple test cases. But the description says \"a string\".\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three strings, and the expected output is a list of three numbers.\n\n   So I suspect the problem is designed for multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says \"a string\", but the example input is multiple.\n\n   Let me re-read: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular) and then the example input is given as a list. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Input\" and then \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then \"Output\" and then one number.\n\n   But the example input is shown as a list. \n\n   After reading the problem statement again, it says: \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\"\n\n   This is just an example representation. The actual input is one string per test case, and there are multiple test cases? Or one test file with multiple test cases?\n\n   The problem does not specify. But the constraints say the string length is at most 100, and the string is non-empty.\n\n   However, the example output is given as a list of three numbers.\n\n   Clarification: the problem says \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular). So one string per input line. But then how are the test cases separated? \n\n   Looking at the example: \n        Input: \n            abcd\n            ababa\n            zzz\n\n   But wait, the example input is shown as a single list. \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives the example input and output. \n\n   I think the example input is meant to be three separate inputs, each on a new line. But the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning the first line of input is the string.\n\n   But then how do we know there are multiple test cases? \n\n   The problem statement does not specify. But the example output format is a list of numbers.\n\n   Since the problem is from a competitive programming context, and the example input is given as three test cases, I think we must read until EOF.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The first input line\", so one string per line, and we don't know how many.\n\n   But the constraints say the string length is at most 100, and the string is non-empty.\n\n   We can read multiple lines until EOF.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The first input line\", so maybe there is only one test case? \n\n   However, the example input is given as three strings. \n\n   Let me check the sample test 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3, and sample test 3: \"zzz\" -> output 2.\n\n   So the example input is three test cases.\n\n   How is the input provided? \n\n   The problem does not specify. But in many online judges, multiple test cases are given, and the first line is the number of test cases. But here, the problem does not mention that.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have been intended to have one test case, but the example input is shown as three to illustrate.\n\n   But the example output is a list of three numbers.\n\n   To be safe, we should consider the problem might have multiple test cases. \n\n   However, the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular) and then the example input is given as a list of three.\n\n   Since the problem is ambiguous, and the constraints say the string length is at most 100, we can read from stdin until there is no more input.\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", so perhaps there is only one line.\n\n   Let me assume one test case per run, as per the problem statement.\n\n   But the example input is provided as three strings. \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then it says:\n\n        Input\n        The first input line contains the string.\n\n        Output\n        Output one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n   And then the example:\n\n        Input\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        Output\n        ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   This example input is represented as a list, but the actual input is one string per line? \n\n   I think the example input is meant to be",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap. The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string from the longest to the shortest, and determining the first instance where a substring repeats.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters in a string that appears at least twice. The key observation here is that the empty substring (length 0) always meets this condition, but we are interested in finding the longest non-empty substring if it exists.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating from the longest possible substring length down to 1, we can efficiently check for the presence of repeating substrings. The first length at which a repeating substring is found will be the answer since we are checking from the largest to the smallest.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each possible substring length, generate all substrings of that length and use a dictionary to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, the current length is the answer.\n4. **Optimization**: The algorithm breaks early once the first valid substring length is found, ensuring efficiency. The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops and substring operations, but given the constraint (string length ≤ 100), this is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    best = 0\n\n    for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        duplicate_found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                best = L\n                duplicate_found = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = True\n                \n        if duplicate_found:\n            break\n            \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `best` is initialized to 0, representing the empty substring as the default answer.\n3. **Iterating Substring Lengths**: The loop runs from the string's length down to 1. For each length `L`, it checks all possible substrings of that length.\n4. **Tracking Substrings**: A dictionary `seen` keeps track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found more than once, `best` is set to `L`, and the loop breaks early.\n5. **Output Result**: The value of `best` is printed, which is the length of the longest repeating substring or 0 if no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the first valid length, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
