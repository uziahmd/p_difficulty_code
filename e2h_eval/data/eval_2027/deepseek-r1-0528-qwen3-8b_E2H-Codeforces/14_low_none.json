He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n But note: We are given m (required number of trailing zeros) and need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. So we can use binary search to find the range of n for which f(n) = m.\n\n Observation:\n   For a fixed m, there might be a contiguous set of n's that have the same number of trailing zeros? Actually, no: \n   The value of f(n) increases only when n is a multiple of a power of 5. But between two multiples, the function stays constant.\n\n   However, note: \n      f(4) = 0, f(5)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2, etc.\n\n   So for a given m, we want to find the smallest n1 such that f(n1) >= m and the largest n2 such that f(n2) <= m?\n   Actually, we are looking for n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   Steps:\n   1. Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (let's call it low_bound).\n   2. Then, we need to check if at low_bound, f(low_bound) == m. If not, then there is no n with f(n)=m? Actually, we need to adjust.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n      Let L be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, then the condition is that we require f(n) = m. But note that f(n) is non-decreasing and only jumps by more than one sometimes? Actually, the jump at n=5^k is k (because 5^k contributes k factors of 5). \n\n   However, note the problem: \n        Input m=1 -> output 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n   How does the function f(n) work?\n        f(1)=0, f(2)=0, f(3)=0, f(4)=0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2, ...\n\n   So for m=1, we have n from 5 to 9 (inclusive). \n\n   Therefore, the solution for a given m is to find:\n        Let A = the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1? Actually, we want the n's for which f(n)=m.\n\n   We can find:\n        n_min = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n        n_max = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1, then the numbers with f(n)=m are from n_min to n_max-1.\n\n   But wait: \n        For m=1: \n          n_min: smallest n with f(n)>=1 -> n_min=5.\n          Then we look for the smallest n with f(n)>=2 -> n_min2=10.\n          Then the numbers are [5,9] -> 5 numbers.\n\n   However, what if m is very large, say 100000? Then we cannot compute n_min by linear search because n_min might be very big.\n\n   We can use binary search to compute n_min for m and n_min for m+1.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Define a function count_trailing_zeros(n): returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n   2. Use binary search to find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n   3. Similarly, use binary search to find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n   4. Then the numbers n satisfying the condition are from n0 to n1-1, where:\n        n0 = smallest n with f(n) >= m\n        n1 = smallest n with f(n) >= m+1\n\n   5. Then the answer is the list of numbers from n0 to n1-1.\n\n   However, note: what if there is no n such that f(n)=m? Then the first binary search would give an n0 such that f(n0)=m, but then the second would give n1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which depends on the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the product. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is dictated by the number of factors of 5 in \\( n! \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at least \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, we use binary search. The same approach is applied to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at least \\( m+1 \\) trailing zeroes. The numbers \\( n \\) between these two bounds will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes in their factorial.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The binary search ensures that we efficiently locate the bounds without checking every number up to a potentially very large \\( n \\), making the solution feasible even for large values of \\( m \\) (up to 100,000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m + 100000\n    \n    def find_lower_bound(target):\n        left, right = 0, high\n        ans = right\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n            if zeros >= target:\n                ans = mid\n                right = mid - 1\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        return ans\n\n    n_min = find_lower_bound(m)\n    n_max = find_lower_bound(m + 1)\n    \n    numbers = list(range(n_min, n_max))\n    k = len(numbers)\n    result = [str(k)] + [str(x) for x in numbers]\n    print(\" \".join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by counting the number of times \\( n \\) can be divided by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **find_lower_bound(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n! \\) has at least `target` trailing zeroes. The binary search is performed between 0 and an upper bound (5*m + 100000), ensuring coverage for large values of \\( m \\).\n\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input value \\( m \\), determines the bounds \\( n_{\\text{min}} \\) and \\( n_{\\text{max}} \\) using the `find_lower_bound` function, and then generates the list of integers from \\( n_{\\text{min}} \\) to \\( n_{\\text{max}} - 1 \\). The result is printed as the count of these integers followed by the integers themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
