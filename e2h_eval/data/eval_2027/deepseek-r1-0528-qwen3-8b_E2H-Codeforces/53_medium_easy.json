    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Since the string length is small (<=100), we can do:\n\n Approach:\n 1. Let n = len(string)\n 2. We'll iterate over all possible starting points and then expand the substring length from that start.\n 3. We want to record the last occurrence (or occurrences) of each substring? But note: we need the same substring appearing at least twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a set or dictionary to record the substrings we've seen and their starting indices. But we don't actually need the indices, we just need to know if we have seen a substring of the same content.\n\n However, we are only interested in the maximum length. So we can do:\n\n For each length L from n down to 1:\n   For each starting index i such that i+L <= n:\n        substring = s[i:i+L]\n        Check if we have seen this substring before (but note: we might have seen it earlier in the string). But how to check without storing too many?\n\n But note: we are allowed to have overlapping occurrences. However, if we try from large L to small, the first duplicate we find for a given L is the answer.\n\n But wait, what if there are two different substrings of length L that both appear twice? Then we want the maximum L for which there's at least one substring that appears at least twice.\n\n However, we are looking for the longest substring (meaning the longest length) that appears at least twice.\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 1: \n   For L from n//2 down to 1 (actually from n down to 1) but wait, if the string is \"aaa\", then the whole string is length 3, but we can have \"aa\" twice. Actually, the entire string cannot appear twice unless the string is duplicated, but note: the problem says occurrences can overlap.\n\n But note: the entire string cannot be found again in the same string (unless the string is periodic with period dividing the length, but even then, the entire string is not a substring that appears twice if we require two distinct starting positions? Actually, the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two occurrences. The entire string as a substring must appear at least twice. That would require the string to be repeated. But wait, the substring can be anywhere. For example, \"ababa\": \n   substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2.\n\n However, the problem says: \"longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\".\n\n Let me clarify: In \"abcd\", the answer is 0. Because no substring (except the empty substring) appears twice? Actually, the empty substring appears everywhere, but typically we consider non-empty? However, the problem does not specify non-empty. But the example output for 'abcd' is 0. Also, the example input includes 'zzz' -> output 2.\n\n In the problem statement: \"longest substring\" — typically substring can be empty? But the examples: \n   Input: 'abcd' -> output 0. \n   Input: 'ababa' -> output 3 (because \"aba\" is of length 3 and appears twice? Actually, let's check: \n        ababa: \n          substring of length 3: \n            \"aba\" at index0 and index2 -> so yes, length 3.\n\n   But wait, the example output for 'ababa' is 3. \n\n   Also, 'zzz': \n        substrings of length 1: 'z' appears three times -> but we are looking for the longest. \n        substrings of length 2: 'zz' appears twice? \n            at index0: 'zz', index1: 'zz' -> so length 2 is valid.\n\n        Why is the answer 2? Because we are asked for the longest substring (by length) that appears at least twice. \n        The substring \"z\" (length1) appears 3 times, but we are looking for the longest. The substring \"zz\" (length2) also appears twice, and there is no substring of length3 that appears twice (only one occurrence of \"zzz\"). \n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n Therefore, we are to find the maximum L such that there exists a substring of length L that occurs at least two times (possibly overlapping).\n\n Steps:\n\n  We can iterate over lengths from n down to 1, and for each length, check every substring of that length and see if we have seen it before (in a previous occurrence). But note: we are scanning the entire string, and we are allowed to have overlapping. \n\n  However, we must not consider the same occurrence twice. For example, if we are at index i, then we don't want to consider the same substring from the same starting index again.\n\n  But note: we are iterating by starting index, so we can use a dictionary to record all the substrings we've encountered so far (from the beginning up to the current index). But wait, if we are scanning from left to right, then when we are at a new starting index, we can check the substring against the ones we've seen from indices < current start? Actually, we can do:\n\n  Let's create an empty dictionary: seen = {}\n  Then, we traverse the string with two loops: for length from n down to 1, and for start index from 0 to n - length.\n\n  But that would be inefficient because we are going from large length to small, and we break when we find the largest L.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n  Option 2: \n      We are going to consider all substrings and record the frequency of each substring. Then, we look for the maximum length of a substring that has frequency >= 2.\n\n  But note: the total number of substrings is O(n^2) and n<=100, so about 5000 substrings. This is acceptable.\n\n  Steps for Option 2:\n      Create a dictionary: substring_to_occurrences = {}\n      Or we can use a dictionary that maps substring -> list of starting indices? But we don't care about the indices, we just care about frequency.\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n          freq = {}  # key: substring, value: count\n\n      But wait: if we do that, we have to consider that the same substring appearing in two different parts is counted. However, we are going to iterate over every substring.\n\n      Then, we can:\n          for start in range(n):\n              for end in range(start+1, n+1):\n                  substr = s[start:end]\n                  freq[substr] = freq.get(substr, 0) + 1\n\n      Then, we want to find the maximum length of a substring that has frequency>=2.\n\n      However, note: we are counting every occurrence. But this counts overlapping occurrences. For example, in \"aaa\", \n          substrings of length1: 'a' appears 3 times -> count=3.\n          substrings of length2: 'aa' appears 2 times -> count=2.\n          substrings of length3: 'aaa' appears 1 time.\n\n      Then the maximum length with count>=2 is 2.\n\n      But wait: we are asked for the length of the substring. So for \"aaa\", the answer should be 2.\n\n      However, in the example \"zzz\", the answer is 2, which matches.\n\n      But what about \"ababa\":\n          We are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice. \n          The substring \"aba\" (length3) appears twice: at index0 and index2.\n          Are there any longer substring? \n            Length4: \n                \"abab\" -> appears once\n                \"baba\" -> appears once\n            Length5: \"ababa\" -> once.\n\n          So the answer is 3.\n\n      However, note: the example output for 'ababa' is 3.\n\n      But wait, what if we have a substring that appears more than twice? We still take the maximum length.\n\n      However, the above method counts every contiguous substring. Then we can:\n\n          max_length = 0\n          for substring, count in freq.items():\n              if count >= 2 and len(substring) > max_length:\n                  max_length = len(substring)\n\n          Then print(max_length)\n\n      But note: what if there is no duplicate? Then max_length remains 0. Example: \"abcd\" -> no substring appears twice (except the empty substring? but we didn't include empty). \n\n      However, the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters. And the example output for 'abcd' is 0.\n\n      But wait: what about the empty substring? The problem doesn't specify, but the example output is 0. Our method does not consider the empty substring (we start from start to end, with end>start). So our method doesn't consider the empty substring.\n\n      This matches: if no non-empty substring appears twice, then we output 0.\n\n      However, the problem does not explicitly say non-empty, but the examples suggest that 0 is the answer when no duplicate non-empty substring exists.\n\n      But note: the problem says \"substring\", and in many definitions, substring can be empty. However, the examples and the expected output 0 for \"abcd\" suggests that we are only considering non-empty substrings? Actually, the problem says \"at least twice\", and the empty substring appears everywhere, so if we included the empty substring, then we would always have a duplicate (actually infinitely many) and the answer would always be 0 (if we consider the empty substring, then the maximum length is 0). \n\n      However, the problem's example outputs: \n          ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> [0, 3, 2]\n\n      And the empty substring has length 0. So if we include the empty substring, then the answer for \"abcd\" is 0, which is correct. But for \"zzz\", we would have two possibilities: \n          substring \"\" (empty) -> length0, and substring \"z\" (length1) -> count3, and substring \"zz\" (length2) -> count2. \n      Then the maximum length is 2 (which is still correct). \n\n      However, the problem says \"longest substring\", and the empty substring is a substring. But the problem does not specify non-empty. \n\n      But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and the empty substring does appear at least twice (actually, multiple times). \n\n      But wait, the example input \"abcd\" gives 0. If we include the empty substring, then 0 is the answer. But if we don't, then we get 0 as well because there's no non-empty substring that appears twice. \n\n      However, the problem does not specify non-empty. But the example output for \"zzz\" is 2, which is greater than 0, meaning that the empty substring is not the answer we are looking for. But note: the problem asks for the longest substring. The empty substring is the shortest. \n\n      So if we are to include the empty substring, then the answer for \"abcd\" is 0 (the empty substring) and for \"zzz\" is 2 (because 2>0). \n\n      But wait, the problem says \"longest\". So we are to take the maximum length. The empty substring has length0, and we have a substring of length2, so 2 is the answer.\n\n      However, the problem does not specify non-empty, so we must consider the empty substring. But then, why is the answer for \"abcd\" 0? Because the empty substring is the only substring that appears at least twice. \n\n      But wait, the problem says \"longest\". The empty substring is the shortest, but we are looking for the longest. There might be no non-empty substring that appears twice, so the next candidate is the empty substring. However, the problem says \"at least twice\", and the empty substring does appear at least twice. \n\n      But the problem's sample outputs: \n          Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> Output: ['0','3','2']\n\n      Now, if we consider the empty substring, then the answer for \"abcd\" is 0 (because the empty substring is the only one that repeats). \n\n      However, the problem might be implying non-empty? Let me read the problem statement: \"longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". The term \"substring\" in many programming problems does not include empty, but sometimes it does. \n\n      Since the problem's example output for \"abcd\" is 0, and if we don't consider empty substring then we also output 0 (because no non-empty substring appears twice), we can do either. \n\n      But note: the problem says \"can be met in the string at least twice\". The empty substring is met at least twice. So if we consider empty, then the answer for \"abcd\" is 0. \n\n      However, the problem's sample test 2: \"ababa\" -> 3, which is the non-empty substring.\n\n      Since the problem does not explicitly forbid empty substring, and the examples are consistent with including the empty substring (because without it, \"abcd\" would also output 0, which is the same), we can decide:\n\n      The problem expects 0 for \"abcd\", and 3 for \"ababa\", and 2 for \"zzz\".\n\n      But note: if we include the empty substring, then we must account for it. However, the problem's example outputs are as provided.\n\n      However, there's a catch: the problem says \"These occurrences can overlap\", which is standard for substring matching.\n\n      Since the problem does not specify non-empty, we should include the empty substring. But then, the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice is the maximum between the maximum length of non-empty substring that appears at least twice and 0 (if there's none, then 0). \n\n      But wait, the empty substring has length0, and if there is a non-empty substring of length L (>=1) that appears at least twice, then the answer is L, because L>0.\n\n      So the algorithm:\n\n        We can do:\n          Let n = len(s)\n          freq = {}\n          # We are going to iterate over every substring (including the empty substring? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the example input \"abcd\" must output 0, which is the empty substring's length).\n\n          However, the problem says the string is non-empty, but the substring can be empty.\n\n          But note: the definition of substring: contiguous sequence of characters. The empty substring is a special case.\n\n          How do we generate the empty substring? \n            In our double loop, we start from start to end, but we require end>start? Actually, the empty substring would be when start==end. But the problem does not specify. \n\n          Let me check the problem: the input is non-empty, but the substring can be empty. \n\n          The problem does not say whether empty substring is considered. But the example output for \"abcd\" is 0, which is the length of the empty substring.\n\n          So we must consider the empty substring.\n\n          But then, we have to generate the empty substring. \n\n          However, the problem says \"substring\", and the empty substring is typically included.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note: the problem's examples and the fact that the empty substring is the fallback when no non-empty duplicate exists.\n\n          But the problem's sample test 2: \"ababa\" has a non-empty substring of length3 that appears twice, so we output 3.\n\n          How to handle:\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Consider two cases: \n                Case 1: There exists a non-empty substring that appears at least twice. Then we output the maximum length among those.\n                Case 2: Otherwise, output 0 (for the empty substring).\n\n          But note: the empty substring always appears (many times). So if we are to output the longest, then the empty substring (length0) is the smallest. So we are actually looking for the maximum length (largest L) such that there is a substring (possibly empty) that appears at least twice.\n\n          However, the empty substring is always present, so the answer is at least 0. But we are looking for the maximum length.\n\n          Therefore, we can simply:\n\n            Find the maximum length L (from 0 to n) such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n          How to compute that?\n\n          We can iterate L from n down to 0:\n\n            For each substring of length L, check if it appears at least twice (or once and we have another occurrence? Actually, we need at least two occurrences).\n\n          But note: for the empty substring (L=0), we have to consider: how many times does the empty substring appear? \n            The empty substring appears at every gap: for a string of length n, there are n+1 positions (including before the first and after the last). So definitely at least twice.\n\n          However, we are building a frequency dictionary for every substring (including the empty substring). \n\n          But wait, the problem says the string is non-empty, and we are reading from stdin.\n\n          Since the problem constraints are small (n<=100), we can do:\n\n            We'll consider all contiguous substrings, including the empty one.\n\n          How to generate the empty substring? \n            We can do:\n\n            for start in range(-1, n):   # start from -1 to n-1? Actually, let's define:\n\n            Alternatively, we can generate all substrings by:\n\n            for length in range(0, n+1):   # length from 0 to n\n                for start in range(0, n - length + 1):\n                    substr = s[start:start+length]\n\n            Then, for length0: substr = s[start:start+0] = \"\".\n\n          Then, we can count the frequency of every substring.\n\n          Then, we want the maximum length L such that the frequency of the substring (of that length) is at least 2.\n\n          However, note: the same substring of the same length can be generated from different starting indices. But we are counting every contiguous substring.\n\n          Then, we can:\n\n            max_duplicate_length = 0\n            for length in range(0, n+1):\n                # We don't need to iterate separately, we can use the dictionary we built.\n\n            But wait, we built the dictionary for every substring, so we can simply:\n\n            best_length = 0\n            for substring, count in freq.items():\n                if count >= 2 and len(substring) > best_length:\n                    best_length = len(substring)\n\n            print(best_length)\n\n          However, note: we are storing every substring, and there are O(n^2) substrings, which is acceptable for n<=100.\n\n          But wait, we are storing the same substring multiple times? Actually, no: the dictionary keys are unique. But note: we are iterating and updating the frequency by adding 1 for each occurrence. So the frequency we store is the total number of occurrences of that substring.\n\n          However, the same substring can appear in multiple ways and we are counting every contiguous occurrence.\n\n          But note: the problem allows overlapping. Our method counts overlapping occurrences.\n\n          Example: \"aaa\"\n            length0: \"\" -> count = 4 (since there are 4 gaps: before index0, between 0 and 1, between 1 and 2, after index2)\n            length1: \"a\" -> count = 3\n            length2: \"aa\" -> count = 2\n            length3: \"aaa\" -> count = 1\n\n          Then the maximum length with count>=2 is 2.\n\n          Example \"abcd\": \n            Only the empty substring has count>=2? Actually, no: the empty substring has count = 5 (gaps: 5 in a string of length4). But wait, we are generating the empty substring once per gap. \n\n          Actually, the empty substring is generated for each gap, so for a string of length n, there are n+1 empty substrings.\n\n          So the empty substring has count = n+1 (which is >=2 for n>=1). \n\n          But then, for \"abcd\", the answer would be 0? Because the empty substring has length0, and there is no non-empty substring that appears twice. \n\n          However, the problem states that the input is non-empty, and the empty substring is present, so we output 0.\n\n          But wait, the problem's example output for \"abcd\" is 0.\n\n          However, we must note: the problem says \"longest substring\", and the empty substring is the shortest. But if we have a non-empty substring that appears twice, we would output a positive integer.\n\n          But the problem's example \"abcd\" has no non-empty substring that appears twice, so the answer is 0 (the empty substring).\n\n          But is the empty substring considered a substring? The problem does not specify. \n\n          However, the problem's example output is 0, and our method produces 0 for \"abcd\", so we are consistent.\n\n          But wait, the problem says \"substring\", and in mathematics, the empty string is considered a substring. \n\n          Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, but we are including the empty substring.\n\n          Implementation:\n\n            We can do:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            n = len(s)\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n\n            # We'll iterate over every substring (including empty)\n            for start in range(0, n+1):   # start from 0 to n (inclusive) but note: when start==n, then we have an empty substring from n to n+0, but we don't go beyond n, so we adjust the end index.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n            for start in range(0, n+1):\n                for end in range(start, n+1):\n                    substr = s[start:end]\n                    freq[substr] += 1\n\n            Then, we find the maximum length for which the frequency is at least 2.\n\n            However, note: the empty substring is included.\n\n          But wait, the above nested loops: \n            start from 0 to n (inclusive) and end from start to n (inclusive). \n            Then the substring s[start:end] is from start to end-1? Actually, in Python, s[start:end] goes from index start to end-1.\n\n          But that's okay because when end=start, we get an empty substring.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            for length in range(0, n+1):\n                for start in range(0, n - length + 1):\n                    substr = s[start:start+length]\n\n          This is equivalent.\n\n          Since the problem size is small, we can use either.\n\n          Let's use:\n\n            n = len(s)\n            freq = {}\n            for length in range(0, n+1):\n                for start in range(0, n - length + 1):\n                    substr = s[start:start+length]\n                    freq[substr] = freq.get(substr, 0) + 1\n\n          Then, we do:\n\n            best = 0\n            for substr, count in freq.items():\n                if count >= 2 and len(substr) >= best:\n                    best = len(substr)\n\n            print(best)\n\n          However, note: we are iterating over all substrings, and the dictionary keys are the substrings. But the same substring can appear in multiple lengths? No, because a substring is defined by its content and length. But wait, two different substrings of different lengths are different. \n\n          But note: we are storing every substring (including the empty one) and we are counting the frequency of each distinct substring.\n\n          Example: \n            s = \"aaa\"\n            substrings:\n                length0: \"\" -> count=4\n                length1: \"a\" -> count=3\n                length2: \"aa\" -> count=2\n                length3: \"aaa\" -> count=1\n\n          Then the maximum length with count>=2 is 2.\n\n          Example \"ababa\":\n            We are going to have:\n                length0: \"\" -> count=6\n                length1: \"a\",\"b\",\"a\",\"b\",\"a\" -> \n                    \"a\": 3, \"b\":2\n                length2: \n                    \"ab\":2, \"ba\":2, \"ab\":2, \"ba\":2 -> wait, let me break it down:\n\n                Actually, we are generating:\n                    \"a\": at positions0,2,4\n                    \"b\": at positions1,3\n\n                Then for length2:\n                    \"ab\": from index0 to1, and index2 to3? Actually, \n                    index0: \"ab\"\n                    index1: \"ba\"\n                    index2: \"ab\"\n                    index3: \"ba\"\n\n                    So \"ab\":2, \"ba\":2\n\n                Then for length3:\n                    \"aba\": from index0 to2, index2 to4 -> but wait, index2 to4 is \"aba\" (if we take 3 characters from index2: s[2:5] -> \"aba\")\n                    Actually, the string is \"ababa\", so:\n                        index0: \"aba\"\n                        index1: \"bab\"\n                        index2: \"aba\"\n\n                    So \"aba\":2, \"bab\":1\n\n                Then for length4:\n                    \"abab\": index0 to3 -> \"abab\", index1 to4 -> \"baba\" -> no duplicates.\n\n                Then for length5: \"ababa\":1\n\n            Then the maximum length with count>=2 is 3 (\"aba\" appears twice).\n\n          This matches the sample.\n\n          However, wait: the substring \"aba\" of length3 appears at index0 and index2. So two occurrences.\n\n          But note: the problem says occurrences can overlap. Here, the two occurrences of \"aba\" in \"ababa\" are at index0 and index2, and they do not overlap? \n            First occurrence: [0,2] -> indices0,1,2\n            Second occurrence: [2,4] -> indices2,3,4 -> they share the middle 'a'. But that's allowed.\n\n          So the algorithm works.\n\n          But note: the worst-case number of substrings is (n+1)*n/2, which for n=100 is about 5050, which is acceptable.\n\n          Let's code accordingly.\n\n          However, note: we are storing the entire substring as a key. The maximum length of a substring is 100, and there are 26 letters, so the keys are strings of length up to 100. This is acceptable because 5050 keys is not too many.\n\n          Code:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            n = len(s)\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n\n            # We'll iterate for all lengths from 0 to n\n            # Alternatively, we can use nested loops: start and length, but the above way is clear.\n\n            # But note: the problem input is one string per line. The input format: first input line contains the string.\n\n            # Since the problem says the first input line, we can read one line.\n\n            # However, the example input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] — but that is just for examples. The actual input is one string.\n\n            # Actually, the problem says: \n            #   The first input line contains the string.\n\n            # So we read one line.\n\n            # But wait, the example input is given in a list? Actually, the problem says \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\" meaning these are separate test cases? \n\n            # Let me read the problem again: \n            #   \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n            # So it's one string per test run.\n\n            # But the example input format is shown as a list of strings. \n\n            # Actually, the problem says: \n            #   Input: \n            #       ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n            #   Output:\n            #       ['0','3','2']\n\n            # But note: this is a sample of multiple test cases. However, the problem says \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n            # Clarification: the problem is for one string. The example shows multiple test cases, but the input is one string.\n\n            # But wait, the problem statement is: \n            #   \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n            #   and then the problem description.\n\n            #   Then, the example input is given as a list, but the actual input is one string.\n\n            # Since the problem says \"The first input line\", we assume one string per run.\n\n            # However, the problem statement example includes multiple test cases. \n\n            # But the problem says: \n            #   \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\"\n\n            #   This is ambiguous. \n\n            # Let me check the original problem statement: \n            #   Actually, the problem says: \n            #       \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n            #   So we read one string.\n\n            # But the example output is a list of answers. \n\n            # I think the example input is provided as a list for illustration, but the actual input is one string.\n\n            # Therefore, we read one string.\n\n            # However, if the problem intended multiple test cases, then we would read until EOF. But the problem says the first input line.\n\n            # Given the constraints (non-empty string, length<=100), and the sample test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n            # But wait, the problem says \"competitive programming problem\", and sometimes they have multiple test cases. \n\n            # Let me re-read: \n            #   \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n            #   It doesn't say anything about multiple lines.\n\n            #   So we read one string.\n\n            # Therefore, we do:\n\n            # Read the string\n\n            # However, the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters.\n\n            # Code:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            n = len(s)\n\n            # We'll use a dictionary to count frequencies of every substring (including empty)\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n\n            # Iterate for all lengths from 0 to n\n            # Alternatively, we can use two nested loops: start index and end index (including empty)\n            # Let's do: for start in range(0, n+1):\n            #           for end in range(start, n+1):\n            #               substr = s[start:end]\n\n            # But note: this is the same as the length method.\n\n            for start in range(0, n+1):\n                for end in range(start, n+1):\n                    substr = s[start:end]\n                    freq[substr] += 1\n\n            best_length = 0\n            for substr, count in freq.items():\n                if count >= 2 and len(substr) > best_length:\n                    best_length = len(substr)\n\n            print(best_length)\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", so we require count>=2.\n\n          But wait, what if the same substring appears more than twice? Then we still take the same length.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Let me test with a simple example: \"aaa\" -> best_length=2, \"ababa\"->best_length=3, \"abcd\"->best_length=0.\n\n          But wait, in \"abcd\", the empty substring has count=5 (so >=2) and length0. Then we set best_length=0. Correct.\n\n          However, the problem says \"longest substring\", and the empty substring is the longest? No, the empty substring is the shortest. \n\n          But note: we are looking for the longest substring (i.e., maximum length) that appears at least twice.\n\n          In \"abcd\", the empty substring is the only substring that appears at least twice, so the longest (maximum length) substring that appears at least twice is the empty substring (length0). \n\n          But wait, the empty substring is the shortest. How can it be the longest? \n\n          Actually, we are looking for the maximum length. The empty substring has length0, and there is no substring of length>0 that appears at least twice. So the maximum length is 0.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"longest\", meaning the substring with the greatest length. \n\n          But what if there are two substrings: one of length0 (empty) and one of length1 (say \"a\")? Then the one with length1 is longer. \n\n          Example \"aaa\": \n            The empty substring has length0, and the substring \"a\" has length1 (appears 3 times) and \"aa\" has length2 (appears 2 times). Then the maximum length is 2.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n          But wait, the problem says \"These occurrences can overlap\", and our method counts overlapping occurrences, so it's correct.\n\n          However, note: the above double loop is O(n^2) in the length of the substring, but the total number of substrings is O(n^2) and n<=100, so maximum 101*101=10201 substrings (actually, the number of substrings is (n+1)*n/2, which is about 5050 for n=100). \n\n          But wait, the inner loop runs from start to n (inclusive) for each start, so the total number of substrings is (n+1)*n/2? Actually, no: the outer loop runs from 0 to n (n+1 values) and the inner loop from start to n (n-start+1 values). The total number is the sum_{start=0}^{n} (n-start+1) = (n+1) + n + ... + 1 = (n+1)*(n+2)/2.\n\n          For n=100, that's 5051 substrings, which is acceptable.\n\n          But wait, the problem says the string length doesn't exceed 100. So n<=100, and the maximum number of substrings is (101*102)//2 = 5151, which is acceptable.\n\n          We'll use the above code.\n\n          However, we can optimize by breaking early when we find a duplicate of a certain length, but since the problem size is small, we don't need to.\n\n          Let me run the code on the examples:\n\n          Example1: \"abcd\" -> output 0\n          Example2: \"ababa\" -> output 3\n          Example3: \"zzz\" -> output 2\n\n          But wait, for \"zzz\": \n            substrings of length0: \"\" -> count=4\n            length1: \"z\" -> count=3\n            length2: \"zz\" -> count=2\n            length3: \"zzz\" -> count=1\n\n            Then the maximum length with count>=2 is 2.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty, but we are reading from stdin. \n\n          We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n          One more edge: empty string? \n            The problem says non-empty, so we don't have to worry.\n\n          But note: the input guarantee: non-empty.\n\n          Code:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            n = len(s)\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n\n            # We are going to consider all substrings, including the empty one.\n            # We can use two nested loops: start from 0 to n, and end from start to n.\n            for start in range(0, n+1):\n                for end in range(start, n+1):\n                    substr = s[start:end]\n                    freq[substr] += 1\n\n            best_length = 0\n            for substr, count in freq.items():\n                if count >= 2 and len(substr) > best_length:\n                    best_length = len(substr)\n\n            print(best_length)\n\n          Let me test with a very short string: \"a\"\n\n          n=1\n          substrings:\n            start=0, end=0: \"\" -> count=1\n            start=0, end=1: \"a\" -> count=1\n            start=1, end=1: \"\" -> count=2\n            start=1, end=2: \"\" -> but wait, when start=1, end from 1 to 1: that's the empty substring at the end.\n\n          Actually, the empty substring at the beginning (before index0) and after index0? \n\n          The string \"a\" has:\n            gaps: \n                before index0: one gap for empty substring\n                between index0 and index1 (if we consider the string as having two gaps: [0:0], [0:1], [1:1]) -> wait, no.\n\n          In our code, for start=0, end=0: substring = s[0:0] = \"\" (first gap)\n          for start=0, end=1: substring = s[0:1] = \"a\"\n          for start=1, end=1: substring = s[1:1] = \"\" (second gap)\n\n          So the empty substring appears twice, so best_length=0.\n\n          But wait, the problem says the string is non-empty, and for \"a\", there is no non-empty substring that appears twice. So 0 is correct.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and the empty substring appears twice (in the gaps). \n\n          But what if the string is \"aa\"?\n\n          n=2\n          substrings:\n            start0: \n                end0: \"\" -> count1\n                end1: \"a\" -> count1\n                end2: \"aa\" -> count1\n            start1:\n                end1: \"\" -> count2\n                end2: \"a\" -> count2\n            start2:\n                end2: \"\" -> count3\n\n          Then the empty substring has count",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap. The solution involves examining all possible substrings of the input string, counting their occurrences, and determining the maximum length among those substrings that appear at least twice.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters (substring) in the input string that occurs at least twice. The substrings can overlap, meaning they can share some characters. The solution must efficiently handle all possible substrings, including the empty substring (though the problem guarantees a non-empty input string).\n\n2. **Intuition**: By generating all possible substrings of the input string, we can count how many times each substring appears. The key insight is that the longest substring appearing at least twice will be the solution. We need to consider all substrings, including overlapping ones, to ensure no valid candidate is missed.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Generate All Substrings**: For each possible starting index in the string, generate all substrings starting at that index with varying lengths.\n   - **Count Occurrences**: Use a dictionary to keep track of how many times each substring appears in the string.\n   - **Find Longest Valid Substring**: After processing all substrings, iterate through the dictionary to find the substring with the highest length that occurs at least twice.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves generating all substrings, which for a string of length `n` results in O(n^2) substrings. For each substring, operations like counting and storing are O(1) on average, making the overall complexity O(n^2), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 100`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for start in range(0, n + 1):\n        for end in range(start, n + 1):\n            substr = s[start:end]\n            freq[substr] += 1\n            \n    best_length = 0\n    for substr, count in freq.items():\n        if count >= 2 and len(substr) > best_length:\n            best_length = len(substr)\n            \n    print(best_length)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Frequency Dictionary**: A dictionary `freq` is used to store each substring as a key and its occurrence count as the value.\n3. **Generating Substrings**: Nested loops iterate over all possible starting and ending indices of the string. Each substring from the starting index to the ending index is extracted and its count in the dictionary is incremented.\n4. **Finding the Longest Substring**: After processing all substrings, the dictionary is scanned to find the substring with the highest length that appears at least twice. The length of this substring is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible substrings, ensuring that the longest repeating substring (allowing overlaps) is found. The solution handles edge cases, such as strings with no repeating non-empty substrings, by correctly identifying the empty substring as the answer (though the problem's constraints ensure the input is non-empty).",
