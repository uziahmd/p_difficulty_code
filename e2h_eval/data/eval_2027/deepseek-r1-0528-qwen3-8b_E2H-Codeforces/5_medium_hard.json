Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and two strings l and r (each of length n) containing lowercase Latin letters or '?'.\n\n We have to form as many pairs as possible. Each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors.\n Compatible means:\n   - If both are specific letters, they must be the same.\n   - If one is '?' and the other is a letter, that's okay (compatible).\n   - If both are '?', that's also okay.\n\n However, note: a boot can be used only once.\n\n Since n can be up to 150000, we cannot try all possibilities naively.\n\n Approach:\n\n We note that the problem has two parts:\n  1. Compute the maximum number of pairs.\n  2. Output the pairs.\n\n However, note that the example output does not necessarily list the pairs in sorted order (but the indices are from 1 to n).\n\n Let's break down the problem:\n\n Step 1: Identify the types of boots.\n\n We have two strings: l (left) and r (right). We can consider each boot by its color and whether it's fixed or not.\n\n We want to maximize the number of pairs. Note that a '?' can be matched with any color. Therefore, we can think of using:\n\n   - First, match as many fixed boots as possible (both fixed and matching) without using the '?' as wildcards.\n   - Then, use the '?' as wildcards to fill the remaining boots.\n\n But note: sometimes a '?' might be forced to act as a wildcard even if there is a fixed match? Actually, we want maximum pairs.\n\n However, we must remember: we are allowed to assign a '?' to any color. But the catch: if we use a '?' from the left to match a right boot that is also a '?', then we could potentially use that left '?' for a more beneficial match (if available) but wait: we are just counting maximum pairs. The goal is to maximize the count.\n\n Important: The problem says to output the pairs. So we need to assign exactly k pairs, and we want the maximum k.\n\n How to compute the maximum?\n\n We can think of:\n\n   Total pairs = ?\n\n   We have two sets: left and right.\n\n   We can form a bipartite graph where an edge exists between left boot i and right boot j if the colors are compatible.\n\n   Then we want the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\n But note: n can be up to 150000. We cannot run a general bipartite matching algorithm (like Hopcroft-Karp) because the graph is defined by compatibility which is very structured.\n\n However, note the structure: the compatibility condition is very simple. Also, the graph is defined by two strings.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use greedy matching and independent sets.\n\n Observation:\n\n   Let A = set of left boots, B = set of right boots.\n\n   There are two kinds of boots: fixed (with a letter) and wildcard (?) in each.\n\n   We can split the left boots into two groups: \n        L_fixed: those with a letter (not '?')\n        L_wild: those with '?'\n\n   Similarly, R_fixed: those with a letter, R_wild: those with '?'.\n\n   Now, within the fixed part:\n\n        For a fixed color c in L_fixed, we can only match with a right boot that is either c or '?' (but note: the right boot being '?' would be in R_wild, so we haven't considered fixed-to-wildcard yet).\n\n   However, note: the problem allows matching a fixed color with a wildcard. So actually, the fixed left boots can match with any right boot that is either the same fixed color or a wildcard.\n\n   Similarly, the wildcard left boots can match with any right boot (fixed or wildcard).\n\n   This is a bipartite graph with edges defined by:\n\n        For left boot i (color c_i) and right boot j (color d_j):\n            if c_i != '?' and d_j != '?' then we require c_i == d_j.\n            if c_i == '?' or d_j == '?', then the edge exists.\n\n   But note: the condition is symmetric and the wildcard can be matched with anything.\n\n   However, we can break the problem:\n\n   Step 1: Match as many fixed boots as possible without using wildcards. But wait: we can use wildcards to match fixed boots too, but we are trying to maximize the total.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n        Let M be the maximum matching.\n\n        We can first match the fixed boots that can only be matched by fixed boots (because if we use a wildcard for a fixed boot, then that wildcard might be needed for a non-matching fixed boot on the other side?).\n\n   However, note: the matching is between two sets. We have two fixed sets (left fixed and right fixed) and two wildcard sets.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Step 1: Count the fixed matches that don't involve wildcards.\n\n        But how? We can create a bipartite graph for fixed boots (ignoring wildcards) and then use wildcards for the rest.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a greedy approach:\n\n        We note that the entire bipartite graph is defined by:\n\n          Edge exists if (l[i] == r[j] OR l[i]=='?' OR r[j]=='?')\n\n        But note: if both are '?', then it's allowed.\n\n        We can use a two-step matching:\n\n          1. Match as many fixed boots as possible (both fixed) without using wildcards. Why? Because if we use a wildcard for a fixed boot, we might block a fixed boot that could have been matched by a wildcard elsewhere. But actually, we want maximum matching.\n\n        However, note: a fixed left boot can be matched with a fixed right boot (if same) or a wildcard. Similarly, a fixed right boot can be matched with a fixed left boot (if same) or a wildcard.\n\n        We can use a greedy matching that uses:\n\n          - First, match fixed boots that have the same color, but we have to be careful: if we use a wildcard for a fixed boot, we might get more overall pairs? Actually, the problem is: we want the maximum pairs. We can use wildcards to match any remaining boot.\n\n        But note: the problem is symmetric and the graph is dense? Actually, the graph is not complete: for two fixed boots, they are only connected if they are the same.\n\n        However, the structure is such that:\n\n          The edges from a fixed left boot (say 'a') go to:\n            - All right boots that are 'a'\n            - All right boots that are '?'\n\n          Similarly, edges from a wildcard left boot go to every right boot.\n\n        This is a very structured graph. We can use a two-phase matching:\n\n        Phase 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots of the same color.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to use wildcards to match fixed boots. However, using a wildcard for a fixed boot might prevent a wildcard from being used for a boot that doesn't have a fixed match. But we are maximizing the total.\n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n          Total pairs = (matches from fixed boots) + (matches from wildcards)\n\n        However, the wildcards can match both fixed and wildcard boots. And the fixed boots can be matched by either fixed or wildcards.\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n          Let's remove all the wildcards and see what fixed pairs we can form. Then use the wildcards to fill the gaps.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require that we use wildcards only for the unmatched ones. Actually, we can mix: for example, a fixed left boot might be matched with a wildcard right boot, and then a fixed right boot (that is the same color) might be matched with a wildcard left boot.\n\n        However, the maximum matching in bipartite graphs is independent of the order. We can use a greedy matching that uses:\n\n          - First, use wildcards to match with any unmatched boot (both fixed and wildcards) but we have to account for the fact that a wildcard can be used only once.\n\n        But note: the problem is to maximize the total pairs.\n\n        We can use the following idea:\n\n          We can form a graph and then use maximum matching. However, n is 150000, so we cannot use standard DFS-based matching (which is O(n^2)).\n\n        We need a more efficient method.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a greedy matching with two pointers and then use wildcards for the rest.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Count the frequency of each fixed color in the left and right, and also note the positions.\n\n          2. However, we have wildcards. We can do:\n\n          Let:\n\n            Let L_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?']\n            Let R_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?']\n\n          But note: we also have wildcards, which can be used arbitrarily.\n\n        Actually, we can use a two-step matching:\n\n          Step 1: Consider only the fixed boots (ignore wildcards). We can match two fixed boots (one from left and one from right) if they have the same color. We want to maximize the fixed matches.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to use wildcards to match fixed boots, but if we use a wildcard for a fixed boot, then we lose the opportunity to use that fixed boot to match another fixed boot. However, the goal is to maximize the total. \n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n          The maximum matching is at most n (since we have n left and n right). And the graph is very dense for wildcards.\n\n        Another idea: use a flow network? But n=150000, and the graph has up to 150000 nodes and about 300000 * (number of distinct colors) edges? Actually, the graph is defined by:\n\n          Left node i is connected to right node j if:\n            (l[i] == '?' and r[j] == '?') OR (l[i] != '?' and r[j] != '?' and l[i]==r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') OR (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?')\n\n        Actually, we can rewrite the condition as:\n\n          They are compatible if (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?') OR (r[j]=='?')\n\n        So the graph is:\n\n          Every left boot (whether fixed or wildcard) is connected to:\n            - All right boots that are the same fixed color (if fixed) OR all right boots (if wildcard).\n\n        Similarly for fixed right boots.\n\n        We can use a greedy matching:\n\n          We can first match the fixed boots that have no alternative (like a fixed left boot of color 'a' can only be matched by a right boot of color 'a' or '?'. But note: if there are multiple right boots of color 'a', we can choose any. However, we are trying to maximize the total.\n\n        Actually, we can use a two-phase algorithm:\n\n          Phase 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots (same color). We can use a dictionary to count the fixed colors in left and right.\n\n          However, we have to assign specific indices. We want to output the pairs.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a greedy matching with two pointers for each color.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Precompute the fixed part:\n\n            Let L_fixed = {}  # mapping: color -> list of indices (in the left string, but we will use the index in the array, but note: the input gives two strings and we have to output the indices (from 1-indexed))\n\n            Actually, we are going to store the indices (0-indexed) for left and right.\n\n          2. Then, we can do:\n\n            Step A: For each color c, let L[c] = list of left boot indices (0-indexed) that are fixed and have color c.\n                    R[c] = list of right boot indices (0-indexed) that are fixed and have color c.\n\n            Step B: Then, we can match as many fixed boots of color c as the minimum of |L[c]| and |R[c]|, but note: we are allowed to use wildcards to match the rest? Actually, no: we are only considering fixed-fixed matches here.\n\n            But wait: we are going to use wildcards for the rest. However, the problem is: we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n            However, we cannot use fixed boots for matching with wildcards arbitrarily because we have to account for the fact that wildcards can be used for multiple fixed boots? No, each boot is used once.\n\n            Actually, the maximum matching is the sum over colors of min(|L[c]|, |R[c]|) for fixed boots, plus the matching of the wildcards.\n\n            But note: the wildcards can be used to match the leftover fixed boots and the leftover wildcards.\n\n            However, the total pairs cannot exceed n.\n\n            How to compute:\n\n              Let total_fixed_matches = 0\n\n              We can create a graph for fixed boots: for each color c, we have a complete bipartite graph between L[c] and R[c]. Then, we can take min(|L[c]|, |R[c]|) for each color and sum them? But wait, no: we are allowed to match one fixed left with one fixed right, regardless of color. Actually, we are only matching same color.\n\n            Then, after matching the fixed boots (same color), we are left with:\n\n              Left remaining: \n                - The fixed boots that were not matched (for each color, we matched min(L[c], R[c]), so the unmatched fixed left boots for color c are max(0, |L[c]| - |R[c]|)) and also the wildcards (left wildcards and right wildcards).\n\n              Right remaining: similarly.\n\n            Then, the remaining graph is:\n\n              The remaining left boots (both fixed and wildcards) and remaining right boots (both fixed and wildcards) form a complete bipartite graph? Not exactly: the fixed boots still have their fixed color, but note: the condition is:\n\n                  (left_boot_color == right_boot_color) OR (left_boot_color=='?') OR (right_boot_color=='?')\n\n              But in the remaining graph, the fixed boots are still fixed (so they require a match of their color) and the wildcards are flexible.\n\n            Actually, we can use the wildcards to match the remaining fixed boots (if any) and then the remaining wildcards can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n            However, we are to maximize the total pairs.\n\n            Let:\n\n              Let F = total_fixed_matches (from matching same color in fixed boots)\n\n              Then, we have:\n\n                Left_remaining_fixed = {c: |L[c]| - min(|L[c]|, |R[c]|)} for each color c (only the positive part)\n                Right_remaining_fixed = {c: |R[c]| - min(|L[c]|, |R[c]|)} for each color c (only the positive part)\n\n              Then, we have:\n\n                Left_remaining_wild = number of left boots that are '?' minus the wildcards we used in matching fixed boots? Actually, we haven't used wildcards yet.\n\n            Actually, we haven't used any wildcards in the first phase. So:\n\n              Total fixed boots: n_fixed_left = n - len(L_wild) [but we don't have separate counts for fixed and wild]\n\n            Alternatively, we can think:\n\n              We have two sets:\n\n                Fixed_left = n - count(l, '?')\n                Fixed_right = n - count(r, '?')\n\n            But we did not match the wildcards in the first phase.\n\n            We can do:\n\n              Step 1: Match as many fixed boots as possible (ignoring wildcards). We can use a dictionary to store the fixed boots by color.\n\n              Then, the total fixed matches is the sum for each color c of min(L_fixed_count[c], R_fixed_count[c])\n\n              Then, we have:\n\n                Remaining left boots: \n                  - The unmatched fixed boots: for each color c, we have (L_fixed_count[c] - min(L_fixed_count[c], R_fixed_count[c])) for each color c.\n                  - Plus the wildcards (which are n - (n - count_l) = count_l_wild? Actually, we have to keep track of the indices.\n\n            But we need to output the actual pairs.\n\n        This becomes complicated.\n\n        Let me consider a simpler idea:\n\n          We are allowed to use wildcards arbitrarily. The entire bipartite graph is:\n\n            Each left boot (whether fixed or wildcard) is connected to all right boots that are either the same fixed color (if fixed) or any (if wildcard).\n\n          We can use a greedy matching:\n\n            Step 1: We'll try to match as many fixed boots as possible without using wildcards. But wait: sometimes using a wildcard for a fixed boot might allow us to form more pairs? Actually, no: because a fixed boot can be matched by a fixed boot of the same color, and that fixed boot is only available for that color. Using a wildcard for a fixed boot doesn't help if there is a fixed boot of the same color on the right? Actually, if we use a wildcard for a fixed left boot, then we are taking away a right boot (which might be a wildcard or fixed) that could have been used for another fixed boot.\n\n          Actually, we should use fixed boots to match fixed boots first because:\n\n            Example: \n              Left: \"a\", \"?\"\n              Right: \"a\", \"b\"\n\n            If we match the '?' (left) with the 'a' (right), then we have a pair (the wildcard) and then the fixed 'a' (left) cannot be matched with the fixed 'b' (right) because they are different. So we get 1 pair.\n\n            But if we match the fixed 'a' (left) with the fixed 'a' (right), then the wildcard (left) can be matched with the 'b' (right) because the wildcard is compatible with 'b'. Then we get 2 pairs.\n\n          Therefore, we should use fixed boots to match fixed boots first, and then use wildcards to match the remaining.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Create two arrays for left and right: we'll keep track of which boots are used.\n\n          Step 2: For each color (all 26 letters), we can try to match the fixed left boots of that color with fixed right boots of that color.\n\n          However, we don't know which fixed right boot to choose. We want to maximize the total, but note: we are going to use the wildcards for the rest.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let's create two lists:\n\n              left_list: for each left boot (index i), store (color, type) where type is 0 for fixed, 1 for wildcard.\n              Similarly, right_list.\n\n          Then, we can use a dictionary for fixed left and fixed right.\n\n          But we have to assign specific pairs.\n\n          We can use:\n\n            Use a dictionary for each color: for left fixed boots, we have a list of indices (and similarly for right). Then, for each color, we can match the fixed left boots of that color with the fixed right boots of that color (as long as we don't use the same index twice).\n\n          Then, we mark those left and right boots as used.\n\n          Step 3: Then, we have the remaining boots (both fixed and wildcards). In the remaining graph, we can use a greedy matching for the wildcards and the fixed boots that are unmatched.\n\n          But note: the remaining fixed boots (if any) can only be matched with a right boot that is the same color (if fixed) or a wildcard (if available). However, we have already used some wildcards? No, we haven't used any in step 2.\n\n          Actually, we have:\n\n            After step 2, we have:\n\n              Left_remaining: \n                 - Some fixed boots (unmatched) and all the wildcards (if any)\n              Right_remaining: \n                 - Some fixed boots (unmatched) and the wildcards (if any)\n\n          Now, the remaining graph is:\n\n            For a fixed left boot (color c): it can be matched with any right boot in the remaining set that is either color c or wildcard.\n            For a wildcard left boot: it can be matched with any right boot.\n\n          Similarly for the right.\n\n          Now, we can use a greedy matching for the wildcards and the remaining fixed boots.\n\n          However, note: we want maximum matching. The maximum matching we can form in the remaining graph is:\n\n            Let X = set of left_remaining (including fixed and wildcards)\n            Let Y = set of right_remaining (including fixed and wildcards)\n\n            But note: the graph is very dense. We can use a greedy algorithm that uses the wildcards to cover the fixed boots first, and then use the remaining wildcards arbitrarily.\n\n          But wait: we can also match two wildcards.\n\n          How to maximize the matching?\n\n            We can use the following:\n\n              We are allowed to match any two remaining boots (if they are compatible). Since the condition is very loose (only requiring the same color or wildcard), we can form a complete graph for the remaining boots? Actually, no: two fixed boots of different colors are not connected.\n\n          Actually, the condition is:\n\n            Two boots (left and right) are compatible if:\n               (left_color == right_color) OR (left_color == '?') OR (right_color == '?')\n\n          In the remaining graph, we have:\n\n            Left_remaining: a set of boots, each with a color (either a letter or '?')\n            Right_remaining: a set of boots, each with a color (either a letter or '?')\n\n          We can use a greedy matching that:\n\n            Step A: For each left boot (whether fixed or wildcard) in the remaining, we want to assign a right boot.\n\n            But note: we can use a matching algorithm that runs in O(n^2) which is too slow for n=150000.\n\n          We need an efficient way.\n\n        Alternative Insight:\n\n          The entire problem can be transformed into: we have two strings, and we want to find the maximum matching (each left boot with a right boot) such that the condition holds.\n\n          We can use a two-pointer-like approach for the fixed boots and then use the wildcards to cover the rest.\n\n        However, note: the problem is similar to matching in a bipartite graph with very specific edges.\n\n        Another idea: use a greedy matching by processing the wildcards and the fixed boots separately.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Count the fixed boots and the wildcards.\n\n          Step 2: For each color, match the fixed left boots of that color with the fixed right boots of that color (using a bipartite matching for each color). But note: we are allowed to match any fixed left boot of color c with any fixed right boot of color c.\n\n          Step 3: Then, we are left with:\n\n            Let U = set of unmatched left boots (both fixed and wildcard)\n            Let V = set of unmatched right boots (both fixed and wildcard)\n\n          Now, we can form a bipartite graph between U and V, but note: the condition is:\n\n            For a left boot i and right boot j:\n                if i is fixed (then we require r[j] == l[i] OR r[j]=='?')\n                if i is wildcard, then we require nothing (any r[j])\n\n          But note: the condition is symmetric. However, we can use the following:\n\n            The graph is defined by:\n\n              For a fixed left boot (color c): it is connected to all right boots in V that have color c or are wildcard.\n\n              For a wildcard left boot: it is connected to all right boots in V.\n\n          Similarly for the right side.\n\n          Now, we wish to compute the maximum matching in this graph. But note: the graph is very large (up to 150000 nodes) and we cannot do a DFS.\n\n        However, note: the graph is defined by the colors. We can use the following:\n\n          Let W = number of wildcard left boots.\n          Let Z = number of wildcard right boots.\n\n          And the fixed left boots (remaining) are for various colors.\n\n          We can use the following greedy:\n\n            We can use the wildcards to match the fixed boots that are left. Why?\n\n            For a fixed left boot (color c) in U, we can match it with:\n\n              - A right boot that is fixed and color c (if available) -> but we've already done that in step 2, so these are the unmatched fixed right boots. But wait, in step 2 we matched fixed boots of the same color. The unmatched fixed right boots are those that were not matched by any fixed left boot of the same color.\n\n            Now, we have:\n\n              In U: \n                 F_u = {c: count of unmatched fixed left boots of color c}\n                 W_u = count of unmatched wildcard left boots\n\n              In V:\n                 F_v = {c: count of unmatched fixed right boots of color c}\n                 W_v = count of unmatched wildcard right boots\n\n            Now, the fixed left boots of color c can be matched with:\n\n              - The fixed right boots of color c (if any) -> but we already did that, so there are none left (we did step 2).\n              - The wildcard right boots (if any) -> because wildcard is compatible.\n\n            Similarly, the wildcard left boots can be matched with:\n\n              - Any right boot (fixed or wildcard)\n\n            However, note: the fixed left boots (unmatched) can also be matched with fixed right boots of the same color that were not matched in step 2? Actually, no: because in step 2 we matched all possible fixed boots of the same color. So if there are unmatched fixed left boots of color c, then there are fewer fixed right boots of color c than fixed left boots of color c. But we can use the wildcard right boots to match the fixed left boots.\n\n            Similarly, we can use the wildcard left boots to match the fixed right boots.\n\n            So the problem reduces to:\n\n              We have:\n\n                Left: \n                  Type1: fixed boots (each has a color c) -> we have F_u (a multiset of colors)\n                  Type2: wildcard boots (each can match any)\n\n                Right:\n                  Type1: fixed boots (each has a color c) -> F_v\n                  Type2: wildcard boots\n\n            Now, we can use the wildcards to bridge the gap.\n\n            The total matching we can achieve is:\n\n              Let T = min(|U|, |V|)   [obviously, we cannot match more than the minimum of the two]\n\n            But we can break down:\n\n              We can first use the wildcards to match as many fixed boots as possible.\n\n            Specifically:\n\n              For the fixed left boots (color c) in U, we can match them with:\n\n                - The wildcard right boots (if available) OR\n                - The fixed right boots of color c (but we already did step 2, so the fixed right boots of color c are all matched? Actually, no: in step 2 we matched the fixed left boots with the fixed right boots. The unmatched fixed left boots of color c are the ones that were in excess. And the fixed right boots of color c that are unmatched are zero (because we matched min(L_fixed[c], R_fixed[c]), so if there were more left fixed boots, then the extra left fixed boots are unmatched and the right fixed boots are all matched).\n\n              Actually, step 2: we matched as many as possible for each color independently. So for color c, we matched min(L_fixed[c], R_fixed[c]). Therefore, the unmatched fixed left boots of color c = L_fixed[c] - min(L_fixed[c], R_fixed[c]) = max(0, L_fixed[c] - R_fixed[c])\n              Similarly, unmatched fixed right boots of color c = max(0, R_fixed[c] - L_fixed[c])\n\n            Now, in the remaining graph, the fixed left boots (unmatched) of color c cannot be matched by fixed right boots of color c (because there are none left). They can only be matched by wildcard right boots.\n\n            Similarly, the fixed right boots (unmatched) of color c cannot be matched by fixed left boots of color c (because there are none left). They can be matched by wildcard left boots.\n\n            Therefore, we can form:\n\n              Let X = total unmatched fixed left boots = sum_{c} max(0, L_fixed[c] - R_fixed[c])\n              Let Y = total unmatched fixed right boots = sum_{c} max(0, R_fixed[c] - L_fixed[c])\n\n            Now, we also have the wildcards.\n\n            The total matching from the second phase cannot exceed:\n\n              T1 = min(X, W_v)   [matching the unmatched fixed left boots (which require wildcard right boots) with wildcard right boots]\n              T2 = min(Y, W_u)   [matching the unmatched fixed right boots (which require wildcard left boots) with wildcard left boots]\n              T3 = min(W_u + W_v - T2, ...)   [but wait, the wildcards can also match each other]\n\n            Actually, the matching of the wildcards can be broken into:\n\n              We have W_u + W_v + X + Y boots in the bipartite graph? Actually, no: the bipartite graph has:\n\n                Left: X + W_u\n                Right: Y + W_v\n\n            And the graph is complete for the wildcards and the fixed boots are only connected to the wildcards (if the fixed boot's color is not present on the right for matching by fixed boot, which it isn't).\n\n            Actually, the fixed left boots (unmatched) are connected only to the wildcard right boots (and not to the fixed right boots, because the fixed right boots of the same color have been exhausted, and the fixed right boots of other colors are not compatible). Similarly, the fixed right boots (unmatched) are connected only to the wildcard left boots.\n\n            And the wildcards are connected to everything.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n              Step 3a: Use the wildcard right boots to match the unmatched fixed left boots (X) as much as possible: we can match min(X, W_v) from these.\n\n              Step 3b: Use the wildcard left boots to match the unmatched fixed right boots (Y) as much as possible: we can match min(Y, W_u_after_step3a) where W_u_after_step3a = W_u - min(Y, W_u)  [but wait, we are not using wildcard left boots for fixed right boots yet?] Actually, we can interleave.\n\n            Actually, we can use the wildcards to cover both:\n\n              The total matching from the second phase is:\n\n                Let A = X   (unmatched fixed left boots)\n                Let B = Y   (unmatched fixed right boots)\n\n                Then, we have:\n\n                  We can match at least min(A+B, W_u+W_v)  ?\n\n            But note: the graph is bipartite and the connections are:\n\n                Left: \n                  Group1: A (fixed left) -> only connected to wildcard right (W_v)\n                  Group2: W_u (wild left) -> connected to all (both fixed right and wildcard right)\n\n                Right:\n                  Group1: B (fixed right) -> only connected to wildcard left (W_u)\n                  Group2: W_v (wild right) -> connected to all (both fixed left and wildcard left)\n\n            We can model this as:\n\n                We have two sets: left (A+W_u) and right (B+W_v)\n\n                The edges:\n\n                  From A to W_v (complete bipartite)\n                  From W_u to B+W_v (complete bipartite)\n                  From B to W_u (complete bipartite)\n\n            We wish to find the maximum matching.\n\n            We can use the following:\n\n                First, we can match:\n\n                  Part1: Match as many A as possible with W_v: that gives m1 = min(A, W_v)\n\n                  Then, update: \n                    A' = A - m1\n                    W_v' = W_v - m1\n\n                  Then, match as many B as possible with W_u: but now the available wildcard left boots are still W_u (because we haven't used any for matching A) -> m2 = min(B, W_u)\n\n                  Then, update:\n                    B' = B - m2\n                    W_u' = W_u - m2\n\n                  Then, the remaining graph is:\n\n                    Left: A' + W_u'\n                    Right: B' + W_v'\n\n                  Now, the edges are:\n\n                    From A' to W_v' (complete) -> but we already used W_v' for matching A, so there is no edge from A' to the remaining W_v'? Actually, we used all of W_v' for A.\n\n                    From W_u' to B' and W_v' (complete) -> but note: W_v' is empty (since we used all for A) and B' is the unmatched fixed right boots.\n\n                  Now, we have:\n\n                    Left: A' (only connected to nothing? because W_v' is gone) and W_u' (connected to B')\n                    Right: B'\n\n                  So the only edges are from W_u' to B'. We can match min(W_u', B').\n\n                  Then, total matching in the second phase is: m1 + m2 + min(W_u', B')\n\n            However, is this optimal? \n\n            Alternatively, we can also consider:\n\n                We have two types of edges:\n\n                  Type1: A to W_v (each A requires a W_v)\n                  Type2: B to W_u (each B requires a W_u)\n                  Type3: W_u to W_v (each W_u to W_v)\n\n                We wish to maximize the matching.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to use the wildcards arbitrarily. The maximum matching is:\n\n                Let T = min(|U|, |V|)   [but we have two types of nodes]\n\n            Actually, the entire bipartite graph is:\n\n                Left: (A + W_u) nodes\n                Right: (B + W_v) nodes\n\n                Edges: \n                  Complete from A to W_v.\n                  Complete from W_u to B and W_v.\n                  Complete from B to W_u.\n\n            This is a complete bipartite graph except for the A to non-W_v part (except W_v) and B to non-W_u part (except W_u). But note: A is not connected to B or to W_u, and B is not connected to A or to W_v.\n\n            So we can break the matching into three independent parts? Not exactly.\n\n            We can use a flow formulation, but note: the graph is not arbitrary: the connections are only:\n\n                A -> W_v\n                B -> W_u\n                W_u -> B, W_v\n                W_v -> A, B\n\n            Actually, the graph is not complete, but it is defined by these rules.\n\n            The maximum matching is:\n\n                We can use the following:\n\n                  Let x = number of matches from A to W_v (cannot exceed A and W_v)\n                  Let y = number of matches from B to W_u (cannot exceed B and W_u)\n                  Let z = number of matches from W_u to W_v (cannot exceed W_u - y and W_v - x)\n\n                But note: the wildcards are shared: if we use a wildcard left boot, it can be used for either B or W_v. Similarly, a wildcard right boot can be used for either A or B.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following greedy:\n\n                We have two kinds of fixed boots (A and B) and two kinds of wildcards (W_u and W_v).\n\n                We can use the wildcards to match the fixed boots and then use the remaining wildcards to match each other.\n\n                The total matching is:\n\n                  Let m = min(A+B, W_u+W_v)   [since the total number of boots is A+B+W_u+W_v, but we are matching one-to-one]\n\n                But wait, is that always true? \n\n                Example: \n                  A=2, B=0, W_u=0, W_v=1 -> total boots: 2+0+0+1 = 3, so maximum matching is 1 (min(2,1)=1). But note: the two fixed boots (A) are only connected to W_v. So we can match one fixed boot with W_v, and the other fixed boot cannot be matched (because no W_v left). So total matching is 1, which is min(A+W_u, B+W_v)? Actually, no: we cannot match the fixed boots with W_u (because W_u=0) and vice versa.\n\n                Actually, the maximum matching is:\n\n                  We can match:\n\n                    From A to W_v: up to min(A, W_v)\n                    From B to W_u: up to min(B, W_u)\n                    From the remaining wildcards (if any) to each other: min(W_u - min(B, W_u), W_v - min(A, W_v))   [but wait, after matching A and B, we have some wildcards left]\n\n                Then, the total matching is:\n\n                  matching = min(A, W_v) + min(B, W_u) + min(W_u - min(B, W_u), W_v - min(A, W_v))\n\n                But wait, is that correct? \n\n                Example: A=2, B=0, W_u=0, W_v=1: \n                  min(A, W_v)=1, min(B, W_u)=0, min(0-0, 1-1)=0 -> total=1, correct.\n\n                Example: A=0, B=2, W_u=1, W_v=0: \n                  min(0,0)=0, min(2,1)=1, min(1-1, 0-0)=0 -> total=1, correct.\n\n                Example: A=1, B=1, W_u=1, W_v=1:\n                  min(1,1)=1, min(1,1)=1, then min(1-1, 1-1)=0 -> total=2, correct.\n\n                Example: A=1, B=1, W_u=0, W_v=0: \n                  total=0, correct.\n\n                Example: A=1, B=1, W_u=2, W_v=2:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that a specific color matches another specific color, or an indefinite color ('?') matches any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves matching two sets of boots (left and right) based on color compatibility. Each boot can be part of at most one pair. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs efficiently given the constraints (n can be up to 150,000).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution can be broken down into two main phases:\n   - **Phase 1**: Match fixed boots (those with specific colors) with other fixed boots of the same color. This is done by counting the occurrences of each color in both left and right boots and matching them as much as possible without using wildcards.\n   - **Phase 2**: Use the remaining wildcards and unmatched boots to form additional pairs. Wildcards can match any color, so they are used to match the remaining fixed boots and then paired among themselves if necessary.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Phase 1** uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each color in both left and right boots. For each color, it matches the minimum of the counts from left and right boots.\n   - **Phase 2** calculates the remaining unmatched fixed boots and wildcards. It then uses wildcards to match these remaining fixed boots and finally pairs the leftover wildcards.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once during the counting phase and once during the matching phase, resulting in an O(n) time complexity, which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed = []\n    left_wild = []\n    right_fixed = []\n    right_wild = []\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] == '?':\n            left_wild.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            left_fixed.append((l_str[i], i+1))\n            \n    for i in range(n):\n        if r_str[i] == '?':\n            right_wild.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            right_fixed.append((r_str[i], i+1))\n            \n    fixed_left_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for color, idx in left_fixed:\n        fixed_left_dict[color].append(idx)\n        \n    fixed_right_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for color, idx in right_fixed:\n        fixed_right_dict[color].append(idx)\n        \n    total_fixed_matches = 0\n    matched_left = set()\n    matched_right = set()\n    \n    for color in fixed_left_dict:\n        if color in fixed_right_dict:\n            left_list = fixed_left_dict[color]\n            right_list = fixed_right_dict[color]\n            min_val = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            total_fixed_matches += min_val\n            left_list[:min_val] = [x for _, x in sorted(zip(left_list, range(min_val)))]\n            right_list[:min_val] = [x for _, x in sorted(zip(right_list, range(min_val)))]\n            matched_left.update(left_list[:min_val])\n            matched_right.update(right_list[:min_val])\n            \n    left_remaining_fixed = []\n    for color, indices in fixed_left_dict.items():\n        for idx in indices:\n            if idx not in matched_left:\n                left_remaining_fixed.append((color, idx))\n                \n    right_remaining_fixed = []\n    for color, indices in fixed_right_dict.items():\n        for idx in indices:\n            if idx not in matched_right:\n                right_remaining_fixed.append((color, idx))\n                \n    A = len(left_remaining_fixed)\n    B = len(right_remaining_fixed)\n    W_u = len(left_wild)\n    W_v = len(right_wild)\n    \n    m1 = min(A, W_v)\n    m2 = min(B, W_u)\n    m3 = min(W_u - m2, W_v - m1)\n    \n    total_pairs = total_fixed_matches + m1 + m2 + m3\n    \n    print(total_pairs)\n    \n    output_lines = []\n    output_lines.append(str(total_pairs))\n    \n    for color, idx in left_remaining_fixed:\n        if m1 > 0:\n            m1 -= 1\n            for j in right_wild:\n                if j not in matched_right:\n                    output_lines.append(f\"{idx} {j}\")\n                    matched_right.add(j)\n                    break\n                    \n    for color, idx in right_remaining_fixed:\n        if m2 > 0:\n            m2 -= 1\n            for j in left_wild:\n                if j not in matched_left:\n                    output_lines.append(f\"{j} {idx}\")\n                    matched_left.add(j)\n                    break\n                    \n    for i in range(W_u):\n        if i+1 in left_wild:\n            if m3 > 0:\n                m3 -= 1\n                for j in right_wild:\n                    if j not in matched_right and (i+1) not in matched_left:\n                        output_lines.append(f\"{i+1} {j}\")\n                        matched_left.add(i+1)\n                        matched_right.add(j)\n                        break\n                    elif j not in matched_right:\n                        output_lines.append(f\"{i+1} {j}\")\n                        matched_left.add(i+1)\n                        matched_right.add(j)\n                        break\n                        \n    for j in range(1, len(right_wild)+1):\n        if j not in matched_right and j not in matched_left:\n            for i in range(1, len(left_wild)+1):\n                if i not in matched_left and i not in matched_right:\n                    output_lines.append(f\"{i} {j}\")\n                    matched_left.add(i)\n                    matched_right.add(j)\n                    break\n                    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(output_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots `n` and the two strings representing left and right boots.\n2. **Categorizing Boots**: Boots are categorized into fixed (specific colors) and wildcards ('?'). Indices are stored for later reference.\n3. **Fixed Boots Matching**: For each color, the algorithm matches the minimum of left and right fixed boots. These matches are recorded, and unmatched fixed boots are noted.\n4. **Wildcard Utilization**: The remaining unmatched fixed boots are matched using wildcards. Wildcards are first used to match these fixed boots, and any leftover wildcards are paired together.\n5. **Output**: The total number of pairs and the specific pairs (left and right boot indices) are printed. The pairs are constructed by ensuring no boot is reused.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging fixed boots first and then utilizing wildcards optimally, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
