The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting from i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring is the border of that inner rectangle, and it has a width of 1 cell.\n\n The number of cells in the i-th ring is the perimeter of the inner rectangle (but note: the inner rectangle must be at least 1x1 to have a border? Actually, the problem states that k is limited by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we don't get negative or zero dimensions.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n\n For the first ring (k=1):\n   inner rectangle: w0 = 3, h0 = 3.\n   The border of a 3x3 rectangle: \n        top row: 3 cells\n        bottom row: 3 cells\n        left and right: each has 1 cell in the middle (because top and bottom already counted the corners) so total for left and right: 2 * (3 - 2) = 2 * 1 = 2\n   So total = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the perimeter of the rectangle (which is 2*(width + height)) but then subtract the four corners because they are counted twice? \n Actually, if we use the standard formula for the border of a rectangle (with one-cell width) then:\n   total cells = 2 * (width + height)   [but wait, this counts each corner once? Let me break down]\n\n Actually, the standard way to compute the number of cells in a rectangular border (without subtracting corners) is:\n   top and bottom: each has 'width' cells? But wait, the entire border: \n   top: width\n   bottom: width\n   left: height - 2 (because top and bottom rows are already covered)\n   right: height - 2\n\n So total = width*2 + height*2 - 4 (because the four corners are included in both top/bottom and left/right) but then we subtracted too much?\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the border has 2*(width + height) - 4, because the four corners are shared.\n\n Example: 3x3: 2*(3+3) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8. Correct.\n\n But wait, let me check with a 5x5 (second ring in the example would be 5x5 for k=2? Actually, for k=2: the inner rectangle is (w-4*(2-1)) x (h-4*(2-1)) = (7-4)=3 and (9-4)=5? Actually, the example input is \"7 9 2\", so let me see:\n\n Example 2: Input \"7 9 1\" -> Output 28.\n   For k=1: \n        width = 7, height = 9\n        Perimeter = 2*(7+9) - 4 = 2*16 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28.\n\n Example 3: Input \"7 9 2\" -> Output 40.\n   For k=2: \n        width = 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4 = 3\n        height = 9 - 4*(2-1) = 9-4 = 5\n        Perimeter = 2*(3+5) - 4 = 2*8 - 4 = 16-4 = 12, but wait that doesn't give 40.\n\n Wait, there's a misunderstanding. The problem says: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n But note: the entire gilding is the union of k rings. Each ring is the border of the inner rectangle at that step.\n\n However, the example output for \"7 9 2\" is 40. \n\n How do we get 40?\n   First ring (k=1): inner rectangle 7x9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 28.\n   Second ring (k=2): inner rectangle 3x5 -> 2*(3+5)-4 = 12.\n   Then total = 28 +",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate. The first ring goes along the outer edge, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that each ring corresponds to the border of a rectangle that is progressively smaller by 4 cells in both dimensions (2 cells on each side) for each subsequent ring. The number of cells in each ring is given by the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle minus the four corners (since they are counted twice if we simply add the top, bottom, left, and right sides).\n\n2. **Formula Derivation**: For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). The number of cells in this ring is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{cells} = 2 \\times (\\text{width} + \\text{height}) - 4\n   \\]\n   This formula accounts for the four sides of the rectangle while subtracting the four corners to avoid double-counting.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each ring from 1 to k, calculating the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, and summing up the cells required for all rings. The constraints ensure that the dimensions remain positive and valid for each ring.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        width = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        height = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if width <= 0 or height <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * (width + height) - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_cells` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total number of cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Calculate Dimensions**: The width and height of the inner rectangle for the current ring are derived by subtracting 4*(i-1) from the original width and height.\n   - **Check Validity**: If at any point the dimensions become non-positive, the loop breaks as further rings would not be valid.\n   - **Compute Ring Cells**: The number of cells in the current ring is computed using the formula `2*(width + height) - 4`.\n   - **Accumulate Total**: The computed cells for the current ring are added to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging geometric properties and ensures correctness by validating each ring's dimensions before computation.",
