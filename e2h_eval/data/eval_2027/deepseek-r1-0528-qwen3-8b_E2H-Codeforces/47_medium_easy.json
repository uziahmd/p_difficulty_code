    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. If multiple k yield the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\n Observation:\n Let d = (a+k) and e = (b+k). Then note that (a+k) - (b+k) = a - b is fixed for all k.\n\n Also, note that LCM(d, e) = |d * e| / GCD(d, e)\n\n But since d and e are positive (k>=0, and a,b>=1), we can write:\n   LCM(d, e) = (d * e) / GCD(d, e)\n\n However, we can also note that the difference between d and e is fixed: d - e = a - b (if a>=b, then d>=e, else if a<b then d<e).\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the problem in terms of divisors. Since the difference (a-b) is fixed, we can set g = GCD(a+k, b+k). Then g must divide (a-b) because:\n\n   g divides (a+k) and (b+k), so it divides any linear combination: \n        g divides (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b.\n\n Therefore, the absolute value of g must be a divisor of |a-b|. However, note that if a == b, then we have d = e = a+k, so GCD(d,e)=d, and LCM(d,e)=d. Then we want to minimize d (which is a+k). The smallest k is 0.\n\n So the key steps:\n\n 1. If a == b, then answer is 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, let D = |a-b|. Then the GCD of (a+k) and (b+k) must divide D. Therefore, the possible GCDs are the divisors of D.\n\n 3. Now, note that for each divisor g of D (with g being positive, since GCD is positive), we can consider equations:\n\n        a + k ≡ 0 (mod g)\n        b + k ≡ 0 (mod g)\n\n    This implies k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g. But note that (-a) mod g = (-b) mod g? Actually, from the condition that g divides (a-b), we have:\n\n        (-a) mod g = (-b) mod g   because (a-b) is divisible by g, so (-a) + (b) is divisible by g, i.e., (-a) ≡ (b) mod g, but wait: actually, we require:\n\n        k ≡ (-a) mod g   and k ≡ (-b) mod g.\n\n    And since g divides (a-b), we have a ≡ b (mod g). Therefore, (-a) ≡ (-b) (mod g). So the two congruences are consistent.\n\n 4. For a divisor g (positive divisor) of D, we are looking for the smallest non-negative k such that:\n\n        k ≡ (-a) mod g   (and equivalently k ≡ (-b) mod g)\n\n    That is, k = (g - (a mod g)) % g, but note: if a mod g is 0 then k=0, otherwise k = g - (a mod g). However, note that we are working modulo g, and we can also write:\n\n        k ≡ (-a) mod g   =>   k ≡ (g - (a mod g)) mod g\n\n    But note: if we define r = a % g, then we want k to be the smallest non-negative solution. The smallest k is:\n\n        k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n\n    However, note: if a % g == 0, then (g - 0) % g = 0, which is correct.\n\n    But wait: what if a % g is not zero? Then we have k0 = g - (a % g). However, note that k must satisfy both conditions and the modulus condition. Since a ≡ b (mod g), the same k0 will work for b.\n\n 5. But note: k must be at least as large as the maximum of the residues? Actually, we are looking for the smallest non-negative k that satisfies the congruence. The solution k0 is the smallest non-negative solution modulo g.\n\n 6. However, note that k must be chosen such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). And we are iterating over divisors of D. But note: the divisor g must be positive and we are considering all divisors. But wait, there's a catch: the divisor g we consider must be a divisor of D, but note that the actual GCD might be larger than g? Actually, no: the GCD must divide D, so we consider all divisors. However, the LCM formula uses the GCD, so we are effectively considering that the GCD might be a divisor of D, but it might not be exactly g. However, note: if we fix g, then we are setting the condition that the GCD divides g? Actually, we are setting the condition that the GCD must divide D, and we are testing for a particular divisor g. But note: the actual GCD might be any divisor of D, and we are going to consider every divisor.\n\n 7. However, note: the equation above gives the minimal k for which g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). But the actual GCD might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: the GCD must divide D, and we are considering every divisor. But wait: if the GCD is h, then h divides D, and we are testing h as one of the divisors.\n\n 8. But note: the LCM expression is ( (a+k)*(b+k) ) / GCD(a+k, b+k). We are not directly controlling the GCD, but we are considering that the GCD must be a divisor of D.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the LCM of two numbers is minimized when the product divided by the GCD is minimized. However, we cannot iterate over all k from 0 to ... because k might be very large (since a,b up to 10^9). Instead, we use the divisors of D.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let D = abs(a-b)\n\n   If D == 0: then a==b, output 0.\n\n   Otherwise, we consider all divisors of D (both positive and negative? but note: GCD is positive, so we consider positive divisors). Actually, we consider positive divisors.\n\n   For each positive divisor g of D:\n\n        We want to find the smallest k (non-negative) such that g divides (a+k) and (b+k). Since g divides (a-b) (because g divides D), we can write:\n\n            k ≡ (-a) mod g   => k0 = (g - a % g) % g\n\n        Then, for this k0, we compute:\n\n            n1 = a + k0\n            n2 = b + k0\n            g0 = gcd(n1, n2)\n            lcm_candidate = (n1 * n2) // g0\n\n        But wait: note that g0 might not be g? Actually, g divides D, and we set k0 so that g divides n1 and n2. However, the GCD might be greater than g. But note: the GCD must divide D, and g is a divisor of D, so the GCD is a multiple of g? Not necessarily: the GCD could be a divisor of D, and we are testing a particular divisor. However, we are going to consider every divisor, and the actual GCD might be a divisor that we haven't considered? \n\n        Actually, we are missing something: the GCD might be any divisor of D, and we are testing each divisor. But note: the condition for k0 is that g divides both n1 and n2. The actual GCD is the greatest common divisor, which might be a multiple of g? Actually, no: if g divides both, then the GCD must be at least g. But we don't know. \n\n        However, note: we are only concerned with minimizing the LCM. The LCM is (n1*n2)/gcd(n1,n2). So we cannot assume the GCD is g.\n\n        Alternative idea: we know that the GCD must divide D. So the GCD is a divisor of D. We can iterate over all divisors g (positive) of D, and for each divisor g, we compute the minimal k0 (the smallest non-negative k that satisfies the condition for g) and then compute the GCD of (a+k0) and (b+k0). Then use that to compute the LCM. Then compare.\n\n        But note: the same k might be generated by multiple divisors? And we are trying to find the minimal LCM and then the minimal k.\n\n        However, the total number of divisors of D is about O(sqrt(D)), and D can be up to 10^9, so sqrt(D) is up to 10^4.5, which is acceptable.\n\n 9. But wait: there's a catch. The divisor g we consider must be a divisor of D, but note that the condition for k0 is that k0 ≡ (-a) mod g. However, note that the GCD of (a+k0) and (b+k0) must divide D, but it might be any divisor. However, we are generating k0 for each divisor g. Then we compute the actual GCD (say g0) and then the LCM.\n\n 10. However, note: the LCM depends on the actual GCD, not just g. Therefore, we must compute the GCD for the candidate k0.\n\n 11. Algorithm:\n\n      candidates = []   # list of (lcm_value, k)\n\n      Step 1: Factorize D (if D != 0) to get all divisors? Or iterate from 1 to sqrt(D) to get divisors.\n\n      Step 2: For each divisor g (positive) of D:\n\n          k0 = (g - a % g) % g   [This gives the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k0) % g == 0]\n\n          Then, we compute:\n\n              n1 = a + k0\n              n2 = b + k0\n\n          Then, g0 = gcd(n1, n2)\n\n          Then, lcm_val = (n1 * n2) // g0\n\n          Then, store (lcm_val, k0) as a candidate.\n\n      Step 3: We must consider that k0 might be the same from different divisors? Then we take the candidate with the smallest LCM, and if two have the same LCM, take the smallest k.\n\n 12. But wait: is it sufficient to consider only divisors of D? What if the GCD is a divisor of D, but we don't consider it? Actually, we are iterating over all divisors, so we will consider every divisor. However, note that the condition for k0 is derived from the divisor g, but the actual GCD might be a divisor of D that is not g? How does that relate?\n\n      Example: \n          a=6, b=10 -> D=4, divisors: [1,2,4]\n\n          For g=1: k0 = (1 - 6%1) % 1 -> 6%1 is 0, so k0=0. Then n1=6, n2=10, GCD(6,10)=2, LCM=30.\n          For g=2: k0 = (2 - 6%2) % 2 -> 6%2=0, so k0=0. Then same as above, but then we compute the same thing. So duplicate k0? \n\n      Actually, we can avoid duplicates by using a set for k0, but note: different divisors might lead to the same k0.\n\n      However, we are storing (lcm_val, k0). We want the minimal LCM and then the minimal k.\n\n 13. But note: there's an alternative: we are only getting k0 that are solutions for some divisor. However, is it possible that the minimal LCM occurs at a k that is not generated by any divisor of D? \n\n      Remember: the GCD must divide D. Therefore, for the optimal k, the GCD (let's call it g0) must divide D. Then, by the condition, k must satisfy k ≡ (-a) mod g0. So the minimal k for that g0 is k0 as computed. Therefore, we are covering all possibilities.\n\n 14. However, note: the divisor g we consider must be positive and divides D. But note: what if D is negative? We defined D = abs(a-b), so it is non-negative. If D=0, we handled separately.\n\n 15. But wait: what if a and b are negative? The problem states a,b>=1, so we don't have negatives.\n\n 16. Implementation:\n\n      Step 0: Read a, b.\n\n      Step 1: If a == b, print 0.\n\n      Step 2: Let D = abs(a-b)\n\n      Step 3: Find all divisors of D.\n\n      Step 4: For each divisor g (positive divisor) of D:\n\n          k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n          Then, n1 = a + k0, n2 = b + k0.\n\n          Then, g0 = gcd(n1, n2)\n\n          Then, lcm_val = (n1 * n2) // g0\n\n          Then, store candidate (lcm_val, k0)\n\n      Step 5: Additionally, note: k0 might be 0, but also we must consider the possibility that the minimal k might be 0 even if D!=0? Yes, but our method includes g=1 (always a divisor) and then k0=0 is included.\n\n      Step 6: But wait: what if k0 is negative? Our computation: (g - (a % g)) % g: the modulus operation ensures non-negativity. However, note: in Python, a % g is always in [0, g-1]. Then (g - (a % g)) is in [1, g] and then % g makes it in [0, g-1]. So k0 is non-negative.\n\n      Step 7: However, note: the condition we are enforcing is that g divides (a+k0) and (b+k0). But the actual GCD might be larger than g, so the LCM might be smaller? Actually, the LCM is (n1*n2)/g0, and g0 is the GCD. If the GCD is larger, then the denominator is larger, so the LCM becomes smaller. Therefore, we are not guaranteed that the candidate with divisor g gives the minimal LCM. But we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering all possibilities.\n\n      However, note: the same k0 may appear for multiple divisors. Then we are computing the same (n1, n2) multiple times. We can avoid that by storing the candidate k0 and then only compute the LCM once per distinct k0? But note: the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors, and then the LCM would be the same. So we can use a set for k0.\n\n      Alternatively, we can iterate over divisors and then record the best candidate by k0. But note: we are storing (lcm_val, k0). We want the candidate with the smallest lcm_val, and if tie the smallest k0.\n\n      However, note: we are iterating over divisors and we are computing the LCM for the same k0 multiple times (if k0 is repeated). We can use a dictionary or set to record the LCM for a given k0? But wait, we are generating k0 from divisors, and the same k0 may come from different divisors, but then the LCM is the same because n1 and n2 are the same. So we can do:\n\n          candidate_k = {}  # mapping from k0 to (lcm_val, k0) but we want to avoid duplicates.\n\n      But note: we are required to output the smallest k0 that minimizes the LCM. So we can:\n\n          best_lcm = None\n          best_k = None\n\n          For each divisor g, compute k0 and the LCM.\n\n          Then update:\n\n            if best_lcm is None or lcm_val < best_lcm or (lcm_val == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n                best_lcm = lcm_val\n                best_k = k0\n\n      However, note: we are iterating over divisors, but the same k0 might be generated by multiple divisors. Then we are updating with the same k0 multiple times, but that's okay.\n\n      But wait: is it possible that two different divisors lead to two different k0 that yield the same LCM? Then we want the smallest k0. But note: we are updating by k0 only when the LCM is equal and k0 is smaller. However, if we get the same LCM from two different k0, then we want the smallest k0.\n\n      However, we are iterating over divisors and we are storing the candidate (lcm_val, k0). We are comparing by lcm_val first and then k0.\n\n 17. But wait: there's an issue. The divisor g must be a divisor of D, but note that the LCM formula uses the actual GCD (g0) which might be larger than g. Therefore, we are computing the LCM correctly.\n\n 18. However, note: we are not considering all k. We are only considering k0 that are the minimal k for each divisor. But note: for a fixed divisor g, the condition is periodic: k must be congruent to k0 modulo g. Therefore, the next k would be k0 + t*g (t>=0). But we are only taking the smallest k0 (non-negative). Therefore, we are only considering the minimal k for each divisor.\n\n 19. But note: the minimal k might be 0, and we are including that. However, what if the minimal LCM is achieved by a k that is not the minimal k for any divisor? \n\n      Example: Let a=2, b=4, then D=2, divisors=[1,2].\n\n        g=1: k0 = (1 - 2%1)%1 -> 2%1 is 0, so k0=0. Then n1=2, n2=4, GCD=2, LCM=(2*4)//2=4.\n\n        g=2: k0 = (2 - 2%2)%2 -> 2%2=0, so k0=0. Same.\n\n        But what if k=1? Then n1=3, n2=5, GCD=1, LCM=15 -> worse.\n\n        k=2: n1=4, n2=6, GCD=2, LCM=12 -> worse.\n\n        So the minimal k is 0.\n\n      Another example: a=2, b=3, then D=1.\n\n        Divisors: [1]\n        k0 = (1-2%1)%1 = (1-0)%1 = 0.\n        Then n1=2, n2=3, GCD=1, LCM=6.\n\n        What if k=1? Then n1=3, n2=4, LCM=12 -> worse.\n\n        k=2: n1=4, n2=5, LCM=20 -> worse.\n\n        So 0 is the answer.\n\n 20. But wait, what if the minimal k is not 0? Consider the example from the problem: \"6 10\", which outputs 2.\n\n        a=6, b=10, D=4, divisors=[1,2,4]\n\n        g=1: k0 = (1-6%1)%1 -> 6%1=0 -> k0=0 -> n1=6, n2=10, GCD=2, LCM=30.\n\n        g=2: k0 = (2-6%2)%2 -> 6%2=0 -> k0=0 -> same as above.\n\n        g=4: k0 = (4-6%4)%4 -> 6%4=2 -> k0 = (4-2)%4 = 2.\n\n        Then n1=8, n2=12, GCD=4, LCM=(8*12)//4=24.\n\n        Then we compare: \n            k0=0: LCM=30\n            k0=2: LCM=24 -> better.\n\n        So we output k0=2.\n\n 21. So the algorithm works for the example.\n\n 22. However, note: the divisor set must include all divisors of D. We must factor D to get all divisors.\n\n 23. But note: what if D=0? We already handled a==b.\n\n 24. There's one more issue: the divisor g must be positive. We are only considering positive divisors.\n\n 25. Code for getting divisors:\n\n        def get_divisors(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return []   # but D=0 is handled separately, so n>=1 here.\n            divisors = set()\n            i = 1\n            while i*i <= n:\n                if n % i == 0:\n                    divisors.add(i)\n                    divisors.add(n//i)\n                i += 1\n            return divisors\n\n 26. Then, for each divisor g in divisors, we compute k0.\n\n 27. But note: the divisor g must be positive, and we are generating positive divisors.\n\n 28. However, note: the divisor set includes all positive divisors.\n\n 29. But wait: what if the divisor g is greater than D? No, because divisors are factors of D.\n\n 30. One more edge: D might be very large (up to 10^9). The divisor enumeration is O(sqrt(D)), which is acceptable for 10^9 (sqrt(10^9) is about 31622, which is acceptable in a tight loop in C++ but in Python we must be cautious). However, worst-case D is a highly composite number, but the divisor count is still O(sqrt(D)) in the loop.\n\n 31. But note: worst-case D is a number with about 1344 divisors (like 963761198400 has 1344 divisors). Then the loop runs 1344 times, which is acceptable.\n\n 32. However, there's a catch: the computation of gcd for numbers that can be up to 10^9 (a+k0, b+k0). The Euclidean algorithm for two numbers up to 10^9 is efficient (O(log(min(n1, n2)))).\n\n 33. But note: k0 can be as large as g (which is at most D, which is 10^9). Then n1 and n2 can be up to 10^9 + 10^9 = 2e9, which is acceptable for gcd and multiplication (for LCM) in Python.\n\n 34. However, the product n1*n2 can be as large as (2e9)^2 = 4e18, which is acceptable in Python (integers in Python are arbitrary precision, but we are doing division by the GCD, which is at least 1, so the LCM is at most 4e18, which is within the range of Python integers).\n\n 35. But note: we must avoid overflow? Actually, in Python, integers are big, but the problem constraints say a,b up to 10^9, and k0 is at most 10^9 (if g is 10^9, then k0 = (10^9 - a % (10^9)) % (10^9) which is at most 10^9). Then n1 and n2 are at most 2e9, so the product is 4e18, which is acceptable in Python but might be slow? Actually, we are doing this for at most 1344 divisors, so 1344 * (cost of gcd and one multiplication) is acceptable.\n\n 36. However, note: the modulus operation for a % g: a and g can be up to 10^9, so modulus is fast.\n\n 37. But wait: what if a and b are very large? Then a % g is done for divisors g (which are divisors of D, and D is |a-b|, which is up to 10^9). So a and g are both up to 10^9, modulus is O(1).\n\n 38.

Actually, because (a-b) is divisible by g, then (a % g) == (b % g). So if (a+k0) % g == 0, then (b+k0) % g = (b % g + k0 % g) % g. But note: k0 is chosen so that (a+k0) % g = 0, and since a ≡ b (mod g), then (b+k0) % g = (a % g + k0) % g = (remainder + k0) % g. But k0 = g - remainder, so (remainder + k0) % g = (remainder + g - remainder) % g = g % g = 0.\n\n            n1 = a + k0\n            n2 = b + k0\n\n            # However, note: if k0 is negative? We ensured k0 is non-negative.\n\n            # Now, compute the actual GCD of n1 and n2\n            current_gcd = math.gcd(n1, n2)\n            current_lcm = (n1 * n2) // current_gcd\n\n            # Update the best candidate\n            if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n                best_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k0\n\n        # But wait: what if the divisor set did not cover the entire possibility? We argued that the GCD must divide D, so we covered all possibilities.\n\n        print(best_k)\n\n 39. However, wait: there is a possibility that k0 might be negative? We computed k0 as (g - remainder) % g, but the modulus operation ensures non-negativity. However, note: our computation for remainder is a % g, which is non-negative, and then we set k0 = (g - remainder) % g. But if remainder==0, we set k0=0. Otherwise, k0 = g - remainder, which is positive and less than g. Then we take modulus g, but modulus g of a number in [1, g-1] is the same number. So we can just do:\n\n        k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g\n\n    This is equivalent to:\n\n        if a % g == 0: k0=0\n        else: k0 = g - (a % g)\n\n    But note: the modulus operation at the end is redundant because g - (a%g) is already in [0, g-1]. However, we did the modulus to be safe.\n\n 40. However, there's a catch: what if a % g is 0? Then k0=0, which is correct.\n\n 41. But wait: what if g is 0? We are iterating over divisors, and divisors are positive and non-zero (since D>=1). So no.\n\n 42. But wait: the example \"5 10\" -> D=5, divisors=[1,5]\n\n        a=5, b=10.\n\n        g=1: k0 = (1-5%1)%1 -> 5%1=0, so k0=0. Then n1=5, n2=10, GCD=5, LCM=10.\n\n        g=5: k0 = (5-5%5)%5 -> 5%5=0, so k0=0. Same.\n\n        But the example output is 0.\n\n        However, the example input is \"5 10\", and the example output is \"0\". So that matches.\n\n 43. But wait, the example \"21 31\" -> output 9.\n\n        a=21, b=31, D=10, divisors=[1,2,5,10]\n\n        g=1: k0= (1-21%1)%1 -> 0, then n1=21, n2=31, GCD=1, LCM=651.\n\n        g=2: k0= (2-21%2)%2 -> 21%2=1, so k0=2-1=1. Then n1=22, n2=32, GCD=2, LCM=(22*32)//2=352.\n\n        g=5: k0= (5-21%5)%5 -> 21%5=1, so k0=4. Then n1=25, n2=35, GCD=5, LCM=(25*35)//5=175.\n\n        g=10: k0= (10-21%10)%10 -> 21%10=1, so k0=9. Then n1=30, n2=40, GCD=10, LCM=(30*40)//10=120.\n\n        Then we compare: \n            k0=0: 651\n            k0=1: 352\n            k0=4: 175\n            k0=9: 120 -> minimal.\n\n        So we output 9.\n\n 44. Therefore, the code should work.\n\n 45. However, note: there's an alternative solution that considers the divisors without iterating over all divisors. But we are iterating over all divisors, which is acceptable.\n\n 46. But wait: what if the minimal k is not found by one of these divisors? We argued that the GCD must divide D, so k must be congruent to (-a) mod g for the actual GCD g (which divides D). Therefore, we are covering the minimal k for each divisor.\n\n 47. One more issue: the divisor set must be complete. Our divisor enumeration is complete.\n\n 48. However, note: the divisor enumeration function must be efficient for D up to 10^9.\n\n 49. Let me test with D=10^9. The while loop runs from i=1 to i=sqrt(10^9) which is about 31622, which is acceptable.\n\n 50. But note: the input numbers a and b can be as large as 10^9, but D is |a-b|, so D can be up to 10^9.\n\n 51. Let me test with a=10**9, b=1, then D=999999999.\n\n        We need to factor 999999999 and get all divisors. The number of divisors is not too high (maybe around 1344 as mentioned) so it's acceptable.\n\n 52. However, the divisor enumeration for a number as large as 10^9 might take a few seconds, but the problem constraints say that the input numbers are up to 10^9, and we are only doing one factorization.\n\n 53. But note: the problem says \"Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer\", meaning the intended solution is mathematical and efficient.\n\n 54. There is an alternative solution: note that the condition (a+k) and (b+k) having a GCD g means that g divides (a-b). Then the minimal k for divisor g is k0 = (g - (a % g)) % g. Then the LCM is ((a+k0)*(b+k0)) / g0, but g0 is the GCD of (a+k0) and (b+k0). However, note that the GCD might be a multiple of g. But we are iterating over all divisors, so we are covering.\n\n 55. However, there is an optimization: we don't need to consider divisors that are greater than D? Actually, we are, and they are included.\n\n 56. But wait: what if the divisor g is greater than D? It cannot be because divisors are factors of D.\n\n 57. One more corner: what if D is 1? Then divisors=[1], then k0=0, then we compute the LCM.\n\n 58. Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"6 10\" -> k0=2, output 2. Correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"21 31\" -> k0=9, output 9. Correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"5 10\" -> k0=0, output 0. Correct.\n\n 59. But wait: the example \"21 31\" was tested above and worked.\n\n 60. However, note: the divisor set for D=10 is [1,2,5,10]. We considered all.\n\n 61. But wait: the divisor set for D=10^9 might be large, but the number of divisors is not exponential. Worst-case is highly composite numbers, but 10^9 is not that bad.\n\n 62. However, note: the divisor enumeration loop runs in O(sqrt(D)), which is acceptable for D=10^9 (about 31622 iterations).\n\n 63. But note: we are doing a modulus operation and a gcd computation for each divisor. The gcd computation for numbers up to 2e9 is O(log(2e9)) which is about 30 steps. So total operations: about 31622 * (logarithmic cost) which is acceptable.\n\n 64. Let me code accordingly.\n\n 65. However, wait: there's a potential pitfall. The divisor g must be positive, and we are iterating over positive divisors.\n\n 66. Also, note: the divisor set must not include 0. Since D>=1, divisors are positive and >=1.\n\n 67. Code:\n\n      import math\n\n      def main():\n          data = input().split()\n          if not data:\n              return\n          a = int(data[0])\n          b = int(data[1])\n\n          if a == b:\n              print(0)\n              return\n\n          D = abs(a - b)\n\n          # Get all divisors of D\n          divisors = set()\n          i = 1\n          # We'll iterate from 1 to the integer square root of D.\n          # But note: if D is 0, but we handled a==b, so D>=1.\n          while i * i <= D:\n              if D % i == 0:\n                  divisors.add(i)\n                  divisors.add(D // i)\n              i += 1\n\n          best_lcm = None\n          best_k = None\n\n          for g in divisors:\n              # Compute k0 for divisor g\n              remainder = a % g\n              k0 = (g - remainder) % g   # This is the minimal non-negative k for which (a+k0) % g == 0.\n\n              n1 = a + k0\n              n2 = b + k0\n\n              # But note: the GCD of n1 and n2 might be larger than g, but that's okay because we are computing the actual LCM.\n              current_gcd = math.gcd(n1, n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find a non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the difference between \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is constant for all \\( k \\), i.e., \\( (a + k) - (b + k) = a - b \\). This means any common divisor of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must also divide \\( a - b \\). \n\n2. **Insight**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must be a divisor of \\( |a - b| \\). Therefore, we can consider all positive divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) to determine possible values of \\( k \\) that could minimize the LCM.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Case 1**: If \\( a = b \\), the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is simply \\( a + k \\). The minimal value occurs when \\( k = 0 \\).\n   - **Case 2**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), compute all positive divisors of \\( D = |a - b| \\). For each divisor \\( g \\), compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\). This \\( k \\) is given by \\( k = (g - (a \\% g)) \\% g \\).\n   - **LCM Calculation**: For each computed \\( k \\), calculate the LCM of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). Track the minimal LCM and the corresponding smallest \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves factorizing \\( D = |a - b| \\), which takes \\( O(\\sqrt{D}) \\) time. Given \\( D \\) can be up to \\( 10^9 \\), the square root is \\( 31622 \\), making the approach feasible within typical time constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    D = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= D:\n        if D % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(D // i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    best_lcm = None\n    best_k = None\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        remainder = a % g\n        k0 = (g - remainder) % g\n        \n        n1 = a + k0\n        n2 = b + k0\n        \n        current_gcd = math.gcd(n1, n2)\n        current_lcm = (n1 * n2) // current_gcd\n        \n        if best_lcm is None or current_lcm < best_lcm or (current_lcm == best_lcm and k0 < best_k):\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k0\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from standard input.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), it immediately outputs \\( 0 \\) since the minimal LCM is achieved when \\( k = 0 \\).\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), it calculates all positive divisors of \\( D = |a - b| \\) by iterating up to the square root of \\( D \\).\n4. **Finding Optimal \\( k \\)**: For each divisor \\( g \\), it computes the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) such that both \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are divisible by \\( g \\).
