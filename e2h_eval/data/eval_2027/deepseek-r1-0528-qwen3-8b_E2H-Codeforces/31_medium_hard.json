Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, and then a list of n integers (the found cards) in the second line.\n\n The problem: We have infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x. We found n cards (with numbers that are in the range [-x, x]). We want to choose the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum of all the cards (found ones plus the chosen ones) is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to make the total sum zero by adding some cards (each card can be any integer between -x and x). We are allowed to use as many as we want of each.\n\n Observation:\n   We are allowed to choose any card value from -x to x. So, the goal is to cover the deficit (if S is positive, we need negative numbers; if S is negative, we need positive numbers) with the fewest cards.\n\n However, note that we might not need to add only one type of card. But note the following:\n\n   Since we can use any integer in [-x, x], the most we can change the sum with one card is by using ±x (if x is positive). \n\n 3. Let deficit = -S (if S is positive, then we need to reduce the sum by S, so we need to add negative numbers; if S is negative, we need to add positive numbers).\n\n 4. But note: we might also consider that sometimes we can use multiple cards to adjust the sum. However, the problem is to minimize the number of cards.\n\n 5. We can think greedily: \n    - If S is already 0, then answer is 0.\n    - Otherwise, we need to cover the absolute deficit (|S|) with the minimum number of cards, where each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value, but note: we can choose positive or negative).\n\n However, wait: we are allowed to choose any integer in [-x, x]. So the maximum absolute change per card is x.\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose any combination. The problem is similar to: what is the minimum number of terms (each term being an integer between -x and x) such that their sum is -S (if S is positive) or S (if S is negative)? Actually, the deficit is |S|, so we need to form a sum of T = -S (if S>0) or T = -S (which would be positive if S is negative) — actually, in both cases, we need to form a sum of -S (which is positive if S is negative, and negative if S is positive). Alternatively, we can say we need to form a sum of D = -S (so D is positive if S was negative, and negative if S was positive). Actually, we can take absolute value and consider the magnitude.\n\n Let D = abs(S). Then we need to represent D (or -D) as the sum of k cards, where each card's absolute value is at most x, and we can use positive and negative arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So we can use positive and negative to cancel out, but the goal is to achieve exactly -S (the opposite of the current sum). But note: we can also use negative cards to reduce a positive S, or positive cards to increase a negative S.\n\n But here's an alternative way: we can also use both positive and negative cards? Actually, no, because we are trying to get the total sum to zero. Currently we have sum S. We need to add a set of cards whose sum is -S.\n\n However, we are allowed to choose any cards. So we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Case 1: If S is positive, we need to add a set of cards that sum to -S (negative). We can use negative cards and/or positive cards? Actually, we can mix, but note: if we use a positive card, then we are increasing the total sum further (which is already positive) and then we have to compensate with even more negative cards. That doesn't help. Similarly, if S is negative, we need to add a set of cards that sum to -S (positive), and using negative cards would make it worse.\n\n Therefore, we should only use cards that have the opposite sign of S.\n\n However, wait: what if we use a mix? Actually, we can use a mix but the net effect must be -S. But if we use one positive card, then we have to use more negative cards to counteract it. But that would require more than just the minimal number of cards? Because the minimal number of cards would be achieved by using the largest absolute value cards (i.e., x) of the opposite sign.\n\n Actually, the minimal number of cards is achieved by using the opposite sign (because if we use the same sign, we are making the deficit bigger). So:\n\n   Let D = abs(S)\n\n   Then, we need to cover D with cards of value at least -x (if S is positive) or at most x (if S is negative). But actually, we are going to use the opposite sign, so:\n\n     For positive S: we need to use negative cards. Each negative card can be at least -x, so the maximum reduction per card is x.\n\n     For negative S: we need to use positive cards. Each positive card can be at most x, so the maximum increase per card is x.\n\n In fact, we can rephrase: we need to cover D (a positive number) by having a sum of negative cards (if S positive) or positive cards (if S negative). The minimal number of cards k must satisfy: k * x >= D.\n\n But wait, we can use a mix of positive and negative? Actually, no: because we are only concerned with the total sum. But note: we are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. However, if we use a mix, then the net effect is that the positive part and negative part must cancel out to give -S (or the opposite). However, the entire set of added cards must sum to -S.\n\n But note: we are not constrained to use only one sign. However, if we use one positive and one negative, then the net effect is (positive - negative) and that might not be as good as using two negatives (if we are trying to reduce a positive S). Actually, the key is: we are free to choose any integers, but the minimal number of cards is achieved by using the maximum absolute value.\n\n However, consider: if we are allowed to use both positive and negative, then we can use two cards: one positive and one negative, but the net effect is positive - negative. This can be useful if we need a small adjustment? Actually, no, because we can use two cards of the same sign to achieve a larger absolute change. \n\n Actually, the problem is: we want to minimize the number of cards to achieve a total sum of -S.\n\n Since each card can be any integer between -x and x, the best card to use for covering a deficit is the one with the largest absolute value (i.e., x) in the direction we need.\n\n However, there is a catch: sometimes we cannot use a fractional card. We can use multiple cards. The minimal number k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= D (if we use the same sign throughout) and then we can adjust by one card if necessary? Actually, we can use the same sign, so:\n\n   k_min = ceil(D / x)\n\n But wait, what if D is 0? Then k_min=0.\n\n However, let me test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n   n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> S = (-1+1+2)=2.\n   D = 2.\n   k_min = ceil(2/2) = ceil(1)=1 -> output 1. Matches.\n\n Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n   n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> S = -4.\n   D = 4.\n   k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2 -> output 2. Matches.\n\n But wait, what if we can use both positive and negative? Consider: maybe we can use fewer cards by using a mix? \n\n Example: Let S = 5, x=3. Then D=5.\n   Using same sign: we would use negative cards. We need to cover 5. With k=ceil(5/3)=2, but 2 cards of -3 would give -6, which is too much. Then we have to use one card of -2 (so total -6 + 2 = -4, which isn't 5). Wait, no: we are adding two cards: two cards of -3 gives -6, which is too low (we need -5). Then we could use one card of -2 and one card of -3? Then total is -5, which is correct. But that's still 2 cards.\n\n Alternatively, we can use three cards: but wait, 2 cards of -3 and one card of +1? Then total is -5, but that's 3 cards, which is worse.\n\n Actually, note: the condition is that we can use any integer from -x to x. So to get -5, we can use two cards: one card of -3 and one card of -2, which is 2 cards.\n\n But wait: how do we know that 2 cards are enough? Because the maximum absolute value is 3, so the maximum negative we can get with 2 cards is -6 (by two -3's). But we only need -5, so we can use two cards: one -3 and one -2 (which is within the range). So the minimal k is indeed ceil(D/x) if we are restricted to same sign? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that there exists an integer solution for:\n\n   a1 + a2 + ... + ak = -S   (where each ai is in [-x, x])\n\n But note: we are free to choose any integers. We don't have to use the same sign. However, using different signs might allow us to use fewer cards? \n\n Let me think: we want to achieve a total of -S (which is positive if S is negative, and negative if S is positive). Without loss of generality, let T = -S (so we want to achieve T, and T can be positive or negative). Actually, we can assume T is positive by symmetry (if T is negative, we can flip the signs of all cards). So assume T is positive.\n\n Now, we can use both positive and negative cards. The constraint is that the sum of the k cards must be T (positive). But note: we can use negative cards as well. However, if we use a negative card, we have to compensate by having a larger positive card. This might require more cards? \n\n Actually, the minimal k must be at least ceil(T / x) because the maximum positive contribution from k cards is k*x. Similarly, the maximum negative contribution is k*x (in absolute value). But we need to achieve T, so we must have k*x >= T.\n\n However, is that sufficient? \n\n Example: T=5, x=3, k=ceil(5/3)=2. Then we need to check if we can represent 5 as a sum of two numbers, each in [-3,3]? The maximum we can get with two positive cards is 6. But we can also use negative cards? Actually, we can use two positive cards: 3+2=5, but wait, 2 is allowed because x=3. Or we can use 3+3 = 6, then we have 6, which is greater than 5, but we cannot use a negative card to reduce the total? Actually, we are forced to use exactly two cards. Then the possibilities are: (3,2) or (2,3) or (3,3) etc. But (3,2) is acceptable because 2 is in [-3,3]. So yes, k=2 is sufficient.\n\n Another example: T=7, x=3. Then k_min = ceil(7/3)=3. But can we represent 7 with two cards? Maximum two cards: 3+3=6 <7, so no. Then we need three cards: 3+3+1=7, and 1 is in [-3,3]. So k=3.\n\n But wait, what if T=4, x=3. Then k_min = ceil(4/3)=2. Two cards: 3+1=4, so yes.\n\n However, consider T=6, x=3: k_min=ceil(6/3)=2. Two cards: 3+3=6 -> valid.\n\n Now, what about T=0? Then k_min=0.\n\n But note: the problem says we have found n cards, and we are allowed to use the infinite set. So we can use any number of additional cards.\n\n However, wait: what if we can use negative cards as well? Then we can also use negative cards to help? Actually, we are trying to achieve T (positive). Using a negative card would require even more positive cards to compensate. So why would we use a negative card? \n\n Example: T=1, x=3. We can use one card: 1 (positive). Alternatively, we can use two cards: 4 and -3? But wait, 4 is not allowed because x=3. So we can't use 4. Then we must use one card.\n\n Example: T=2, x=3: one card: 2.\n\n Example: T=5, x=3: two cards: 3+2.\n\n Example: T=7, x=3: three cards: 3+3+1.\n\n But wait, can we use negative cards in the representation? \n\n Example: T=1, x=3: \n   We can use one positive card: 1.\n   Alternatively, we can use two cards: 4 and -3? -> but 4 is not allowed (since x=3, so cards must be in [-3,3]). So no.\n\n Example: T=4, x=3: \n   One card: we can't because 4 is not in [-3,3] (it's positive and exceeds 3). \n   Two cards: 3+1 -> valid.\n\n Example: T=5, x=3: two cards: 3+2 -> valid.\n\n Example: T=6, x=3: two cards: 3+3 -> valid.\n\n Example: T=7, x=3: three cards: 3+3+1 -> valid.\n\n But now, consider T=1, x=3: one card is enough.\n\n However, what if T=2, x=1? Then we need to achieve 2 with cards of absolute value at most 1. \n   k_min = ceil(2/1)=2. \n   Then two cards: 1+1=2 -> valid.\n\n Example: T=3, x=1: ceil(3/1)=3, then 1+1+1=3.\n\n Example: T=3, x=2: ceil(3/2)=2, then 2+1=3 -> valid.\n\n But wait, what if T=3, x=2: can we use two cards? Yes.\n\n However, there is a catch: the above reasoning (k_min = ceil(T/x)) is always sufficient? \n\n Why? Because if we have k = ceil(T/x) cards, then the maximum positive sum we can get is k*x. Since k*x >= T, we can assign the cards appropriately (by using as many x as needed and then adjusting with a smaller positive number). \n\n But note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So when we are trying to get a positive T, we can use k cards, each at most x, and we want to know if we can form T.\n\n However, we are not limited to positive cards only. But we can also use negative cards. But why would we use negative cards? \n\n Actually, we don't need to. Because if we use negative cards, we are reducing the total, so we need to compensate with even more positive cards, which would require more cards. Therefore, the minimal number of cards is achieved by using only positive cards (if T is positive) or only negative cards (if T is negative). \n\n But wait, what if we use negative cards to fill the gap? \n\n Example: T=5, x=3. \n   Option1: use two positive cards: 3+2=5 -> 2 cards.\n   Option2: use one positive card and one negative card: 4 + (-3) = 1, which is not 5. Or 3 + (-1)=2, not 5. Doesn't work.\n\n Example: T=4, x=3. \n   We can't use one card because 4 is not allowed (exceeds x=3). \n   Then two cards: two positive: 3+1=4 -> works.\n\n Example: T=7, x=3: \n   Three positive: 3+3+1=7.\n\n What if we try to use negative cards? \n   We need to achieve 7. Suppose we use two positive cards and one negative card: 3+3+(-1)=5, which is less than 7. Then we would need to use more positive cards. Actually, we can use four cards: 3+3+3+(-2)=7? But then we used four cards, which is worse than three.\n\n Therefore, it is never beneficial to use negative cards when we are trying to achieve a positive T. Similarly, for negative T, we would use only negative cards.\n\n So the problem reduces to: we need to cover the absolute value of the deficit (D = abs(S)) with the minimum number of cards, each contributing at most x (in absolute value, and in the opposite direction). And the minimal number is ceil(D / x).\n\n However, wait: what if D is 0? Then ceil(0/x)=0. Correct.\n\n But note: the deficit D is the absolute value of the current sum. \n\n However, wait: what if we have a deficit of 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n But what if the current sum is 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n However, consider the possibility that we might be able to use fewer cards by using a mix of positive and negative cards? \n\n Example: Let S = 0, then we need 0. So no card.\n\n Example: Let S = 1, x=2. Then D=1, ceil(1/2)=1. One card: -1 (if we are allowed to use negative cards) because we need to add -1 to get 0. But wait, we can also use two cards: 1 and -1? Then the total becomes 0. But that would be two cards, which is worse.\n\n But wait, the problem says: we can choose any card from the infinite set (any integer from -x to x). So we can choose a single card of -1, which is allowed because 1<=2. So the minimal number is 1.\n\n But note: we are only concerned with the minimal number of cards.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and x, then the list of n integers.\n   Step 2: Compute S = sum(list)\n   Step 3: Let D = abs(S)\n   Step 4: If D==0, print 0.\n            Else, compute k = ceil(D / x). But note: since we can use fractions, we can do:\n\n            k = (D + x - 1) // x   [This is integer ceiling division]\n\n   However, wait: what if D is not divisible by x? \n\n   Example: D=5, x=3: (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 (since 7//3=2 in integer division). Correct.\n\n   But note: we are using integer arithmetic. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        k = (D // x) \n        if D % x != 0:\n            k += 1\n\n   However, we have to be cautious: if D==0, then k=0.\n\n But wait: is this always the minimal k? \n\n   We need to represent D (positive) as the sum of k cards, each card being an integer in [-x, x] (but we are using the opposite sign, so we are using negative cards for positive D and vice versa). However, we are using the opposite sign, so for positive D we are using negative cards, but the absolute value of the card is at most x. \n\n   However, note: we are not forced to use the same sign for all? Actually, we can use a mix of positive and negative, but we showed that using the opposite sign only is optimal. \n\n   But wait, what if we have a deficit that is not a multiple of x? For example, D=1, x=2: we use one card of -1 (which is allowed) and that's it.\n\n   However, the above formula: ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1, so k=1.\n\n   How does the formula work for D=1, x=2?\n        k = ceil(1/2) = 1.\n\n   But note: the condition k*x >= D must hold. For k=1: 1*2>=1 -> true.\n\n   However, we are allowed to use a card of -1, which is in the range [-2,2]. So we can use one card.\n\n   But wait, the above reasoning for the minimal k was based on the idea that we can use the maximum absolute value (x) to cover the deficit. However, we don't necessarily have to use the maximum absolute value. We can use any value in [-x,x]. \n\n   The key is: the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= D, because we can use k cards, each of value at least -x (if we are covering a positive deficit by negative cards, then we are bounded by the negative side) but wait, no: we are covering a positive deficit (meaning we need to subtract D) by negative cards. Each negative card can be as large as -x (so the worst is we can only subtract x per card). Therefore, the total subtraction is at most k*x, and we need at least D. So k*x >= D.\n\n   Similarly, if we are covering a negative deficit (so we need to add positive cards) then each positive card can be at most x, so the total addition is at most k*x, and we need at least D (absolute value). So again, k*x>=D.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= D.\n\n   We can write: k = ceil(D / x)   [if D>0]\n\n   However, note: if D==0, then k=0.\n\n   But wait: what if D is very large? Our x is up to 1000 and D is the absolute value of the sum of n (at most 1000) cards, each at most x (1000) in absolute value. So the maximum D is 1000*1000 = 1000000. Then k = ceil(1000000 / 1000) = 1000.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. But note that we are only using the opposite sign. For example, if D=5 and x=3, then k=ceil(5/3)=2, and we can use two negative cards: -3 and -2, which is allowed because -2 is in [-3,3]. \n\n   But what if D=5 and x=2? Then k=ceil(5/2)=3. Then we need to cover 5 with three negative cards (each at least -2). The total negative we can get is -6, which is less than -5. Then we can use three negative cards: -2, -2, -1 -> total -5. So it works.\n\n   How do we know that with k=ceil(D/x) we can always form the deficit? \n\n   We need to form a total of -D (if we are covering a positive deficit) with k cards, each card between -x and 0 (if we are covering a positive deficit). But wait, we can use any integer from -x to x. However, we are free to choose any. The condition is that the sum of the k cards must be -D.\n\n   We can use the following greedy: use as many -x as possible, then adjust with one card.\n\n   Specifically, let k = ceil(D/x). Then we can use floor((D-1)/x) cards of -x, and then one card of -(D - floor((D-1)/x)*x). \n\n   But note: D - floor((D-1)/x)*x is the remainder, and since k*x>=D, the remainder will be in [0, x]. Actually, the remainder is D mod x, but we subtracted floor((D-1)/x)*x, which is the same as floor(D/x)*x if D is divisible by x, or (floor(D/x)-1)*x + x if not? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      Let k = ceil(D/x)\n      Then, we can use k-1 cards of -x, and one card of -(D - (k-1)*x)\n\n   But note: (k-1)*x = floor((D-1)/x)*x? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, we have k = ceil(D/x) = (D+x-1)//x (in integer division).\n\n   Then, (k-1)*x < D <= k*x.\n\n   Then, the remaining amount is D - (k-1)*x, which is between 1 and x (if D is not divisible by x, then D - (k-1)*x = D mod x + (k-1)*x? Actually, no: \n\n   Let me define: \n        k = (D+x-1)//x   [ceiling division]\n\n   Then, (k-1)*x < D <= k*x.\n\n   Then, the remaining amount R = D - (k-1)*x is in the range [1, x] (if D is not divisible by x, then R is the remainder and is in [1, x-1]; if D is divisible by x, then R = x? Actually, if D is divisible by x, then k = D/x, and (k-1)*x = D-x, so R = x. But wait, then we are using k-1 cards of -x and one card of -x, so total k cards of -x. Then the last card is -x, which is allowed.\n\n   However, in the case of D divisible by x, we can use k cards of -x. Then the last card is -x, so R=x, and we use one card of -x. \n\n   But wait, if D is divisible by x, then k = D/x, so we can use k cards of -x. Then the last card is -x, which is allowed.\n\n   Now, if D is not divisible by x, then R is in [1, x-1] (because D = (k-1)*x + R, and R < x). Then we need a card of -R. Is -R in the range? Yes, because R is at least 1 and at most x-1, so -R is between -x+1 and -1, which is in [-x,0] (so allowed).\n\n   Therefore, the representation is always possible.\n\n   Conclusion: the minimal number of cards is k = ceil(|S| / x) if S != 0, and 0 if S==0.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have a deficit that is negative? Actually, we defined D = abs(S). So if S is negative, then D = -S (positive) and we use the same formula.\n\n   But note: the problem says we can use any integer from -x to x. The above reasoning holds for both positive and negative deficits because we can use the opposite sign.\n\n   Therefore, code:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total = sum(cards)\n        if total == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            D = abs(total)\n            # Calculate k = ceil(D / x)\n            # Using integer arithmetic: \n            #   k = (D + x - 1) // x   [ceiling division]\n            k = (D + x - 1) // x\n            # But wait: if D==0, then k=0, but we already handled D==0 (total==0).\n            print(k)\n\n   However, wait: the example inputs:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> total=2, D=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> total=-4, D=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, there is a known issue: the ceiling division formula (a+b-1)//b works for positive a and b. Here, D and x are positive (x>=1, D>=0). But if D==0, we handled separately.\n\n   However, let me test with D=0: \n        if total==0: print(0) -> so we don't go to the else.\n\n   But wait, what if x=0? The problem states x>=1, so we are safe.\n\n   However, wait: what if the deficit D is very large? The formula still holds.\n\n   But wait, consider: what if we have a deficit that is negative? Actually, we use D=abs(total) so it's positive.\n\n   However, there's a catch: what if we have a deficit that is not a multiple of x, but we can use a mix of positive and negative cards to get the deficit with fewer cards? \n\n   Let me reconsider: we showed that using only the opposite sign is optimal and minimal. And the minimal k is ceil(D/x). \n\n   But wait, consider the following scenario:\n\n        We need to cover a deficit of 1, with x=1. Then k=ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n        What if we have a deficit of 1, with x=2? Then k=ceil(1/2)=1. Correct.\n\n        What if we have a deficit of 2, with x=1? Then k=ceil(2/1)=2. Correct.\n\n        What if we have a deficit of 3, with x=2? Then k=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Then we need two cards. Can we do it?\n\n        We need to cover 3 (absolute value). We can use two cards: one of -2 and one of -1 -> total -3. So two cards. Correct.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a deficit of 3, and x=3? Then k=ceil(3/3)=1. One card: -3. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the above reasoning is based on the fact that we can use the opposite sign. But what if we are allowed to use both positive and negative? \n\n   Consider: deficit=5, x=4. Then k=ceil(5/4)=2. Then we can use two cards: -4 and -1 -> total -5. Correct.\n\n   But what if we use one card: the maximum negative we can use is -4, which is not enough. So two cards is minimal.\n\n   Another example: deficit=5, x=3: k=ceil(5/3)=2. Then two cards: -3 and -2 -> -5. Correct.\n\n   However, wait: what if we use three cards for deficit=5, x=3? Then we can use three cards: -3, -3, +1? Then total is -5. But that's three cards, which is more than two. So two is minimal.\n\n   But wait, what if we have a deficit of 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n   But wait, there's another possibility: we might be able to use the found cards and then use some cards that cancel each other? \n\n   Actually, no: because the problem is: we have found n cards (with sum S). We need to add k cards (from the infinite set) so that the total sum is 0. The cards we add can be any integers in [-x, x]. We are minimizing k.\n\n   The above reasoning is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement says \"the minimum number of cards does he need to find\". And we are computing k = ceil(|S|/x). \n\n   But note: the example in the problem: \n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> total=-4, so deficit=4, k=ceil(4/3)=2.\n\n   However, what if we consider: maybe we don't need to use the same sign? \n\n   Example: deficit=4 (meaning we need to add 4 to the current sum to get 0). We can use two cards: one card of 3 and one card of 1 -> total 4. That is two cards. Or two cards: 2 and 2. Also two cards.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: the cards we add can be any integer from -x to x. So we can use positive or negative. \n\n   However, if we use positive cards to cover a negative deficit, then we are adding positive numbers to a negative total. But the deficit is defined as the absolute value. \n\n   Actually, the deficit is the absolute value of the current sum. But the direction matters. \n\n   Let me reframe: \n\n        Let S = current sum.\n\n        We need to add k cards such that the new sum is 0, i.e., the sum of the k cards is -S.\n\n        The minimal k is the minimal number of integers (each in [-x,x]) that sum to -S.\n\n        This is equivalent to: we need to cover the absolute value D = |S| by a sum of k integers, each between -x and x, and the sign of the sum must be the opposite of S.\n\n        But note: we can use negative cards to cover a positive S? Actually, no: if S is positive, we need to add negative numbers to bring the sum down. Similarly, if S is negative, we need positive numbers. However, we can use a mix? \n\n        Example: S=1 (positive). Then we need to add cards that sum to -1. We can use one card: -1. Or two cards: -2 and 1? Then the total is -1. But that uses two cards, which is worse.\n\n        So the minimal k is still ceil(|S|/x) because the maximum absolute value we can subtract (if S is positive) is x per card.\n\n   However, wait: what if we use a mix for S=0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"the minimum number of cards does he need to find\"\n\n   After careful thought, I think the above solution is correct.\n\n   But wait, there's a known issue: the problem says the initial set has infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x. So we are allowed to use any integer in that range.\n\n   However, consider: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n   But wait, what if the deficit is not 0, but we can use a mix of positive and negative cards to cover the deficit with fewer cards? \n\n   Example: Let S=3, x=2. Then D=3, ceil(3/2)=2. We can use two cards: -2 and -1 -> total -3. Or we can use two cards: 2 and -5? -> but wait, 2 and -5 is not allowed because -5 is not in [-2,2]. \n\n   Example: Let S=4, x=3. Then ceil(4/3)=2. We can use two cards: -3 and -1 -> total -4.\n\n   But consider: S=5, x=3. Then ceil(5/3)=2. We can use two cards: -3 and -2 -> total -5.\n\n   Now, consider a different example: S=2, x=3. Then ceil(2/3)=1. We can use one card: -2.\n\n   However, what if S=2, x=1? Then ceil(2/1)=2. We can use two cards: -1 and -1.\n\n   But wait, what if S=2, x=2? Then ceil(2/2)=1. One card: -2.\n\n   It seems consistent.\n\n   However, wait: what if S=2, x=3? Then k=ceil(2/3)=1. We can use one card: -2 (which is in [-3,3]), so correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, x = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(arr)\n        if s == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            deficit = abs(s)\n            # Calculate the minimal number of cards: ceil(deficit / x)\n            # Using",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the sum of the found cards must be balanced by the sum of the additional cards. If the current sum of the found cards is `S`, then the additional cards must sum to `-S`. The challenge is to find the smallest number of cards such that their sum is exactly `-S`, with each card's value constrained between -x and x.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the absolute value of the current sum (`D = |S|`). The maximum absolute value each card can contribute is `x`, so the minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of `D / x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` towards reducing the deficit (if `S` is positive) or increasing the sum (if `S` is negative).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Calculate the total sum `S` of the found cards.\n   - If `S` is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the absolute value `D` of `S`.\n   - The answer is the ceiling of `D / x`, which can be computed using integer arithmetic: `(D + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(arr)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        deficit = abs(total)\n        k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum `total` of the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Deficit Calculation**: If the sum is non-zero, the absolute value of the sum (`deficit`) is taken to determine the magnitude that needs to be balanced by the additional cards.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards required is calculated using ceiling division. This is done by `(deficit + x - 1) // x`, which effectively rounds up the division result to the nearest integer.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of cards needed to balance the sum to zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the constraints and properties of integer division to determine the solution with optimal performance.",
