            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers or one integer and an 'R'\n The next line is a string representing a non-negative integer in base `a` (which may have leading zeros, but the length is at most 1000)\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base `a` to an integer (base 10) and then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n    Note: The problem says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n 2. Otherwise, convert the number from base `a` to base 10, then from base 10 to base `b` (with digits beyond 9 represented by letters).\n\n However, note: the input number c is given in base a as a string (which might be base 10, but also base 25). Also, the base a is between 2 and 25, so digits can be from '0' to '9' and then 'A' to ... (but wait, the input representation: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — wait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, the example input has numbers like '1111001' which is base 2. Let me re-read: the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000.\n\n Important: The input number is given in base a. The digits in the string for base a can be from '0' to the digit representing (a-1). Since a is up to 25, we might have digits beyond '9'. The problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — but note that the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be valid in base a.\n\n How to convert the input string to an integer (base 10)?\n   We can do: \n        num = 0\n        for each char in the string:\n            digit_value = int(char) if char is a digit and the value is less than a, but wait, what if the base is 11 and we have an 'A'? Then we map 'A' to 10, etc.\n\n   But note: the input string is in base a, and a is from 2 to 25. The string may have digits from '0' to '9' and then from 'A' to the letter representing (a-1). However, the problem says the input is a non-negative integer in base a.\n\n   However, there's a catch: the input might have leading zeros.\n\n   Steps for converting base a string to base 10:\n\n        value = 0\n        for each character in the string:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                digit = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n            value = value * a + digit\n\n   But wait: the problem says the number might be very long (length up to 1000) and base a up to 25, so the number in base 10 might be huge (like up to 25^1000). However, the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 300010, so in that case we don't have to worry about huge numbers. But in the other case, the number might be very big (up to 10^15^10? Actually, wait: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — that doesn't make sense. Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\". This is ambiguous. But note: the example input includes \"2 2\\n1111001\", which is a string of 7 digits in base 2. That number is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 127+1=128? Actually, wait: base 2, so 1111001 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of converting to the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to a base-10 integer, and then converting that integer to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to determine the source base `a` and the target base `b`, which can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line contains the number in base `a` as a string.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input string from base `a` to a base-10 integer. This involves processing each character of the string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value by considering the base `a`.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - If the target base `b` is an integer (not 'R'), convert the base-10 integer to base `b`. Digits beyond 9 are represented by letters starting from 'A'.\n   - If the target base is 'R', convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral. The Roman numeral conversion requires handling specific rules for subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4) and constructing the numeral by iterating through the values from highest to lowest.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    a = int(first_line[0])\n    b_char = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n    \n    n = 0\n    for char in num_str:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            digit_val = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            digit_val = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        n = n * a + digit_val\n        \n    if b_char == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n            while n >= value:\n                res.append(symbol)\n                n -= value\n        print(''.join(res))\n    else:\n        b = int(b_char)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        while n:\n            n, r = divmod(n, b)\n            if r < 10:\n                digits.append(str(r))\n            else:\n                digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n                \n        result = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The script reads the input lines, parsing the source and target bases along with the number string.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The number string is converted from base `a` to a base-10 integer by processing each character. Each character's value is determined by its digit or letter representation, and the total value is built iteratively.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the base-10 integer is converted to Roman numerals by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values from a predefined list and appending their corresponding symbols to the result.\n4. **Standard Base Conversion**: For standard base conversion, the base-10 integer is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders converted to their respective digits (using letters for values greater than 9). The digits are collected in reverse order and then reversed to form the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and the special case of Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
