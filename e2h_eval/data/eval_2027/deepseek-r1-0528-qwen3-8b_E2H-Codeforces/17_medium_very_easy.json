He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1, and that these are the prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n However, note: the input gives 2n-2 lines, with two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. The problem is: we don't know which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\n Approach:\n Since the string s has length n, any prefix must have length in [1, n-1] and similarly for suffixes.\n\n Observation: \n For a fixed length L (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings of length L. One of them must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\n But note: the entire set of prefixes and suffixes of s must be consistent. That is, if we assign one string as a prefix and the other as a suffix for each length, then the overlapping parts must match.\n\n However, the problem says: \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's consider: we have two strings of length 1, two of length 2, etc. We know that the full string s of length n must start with the chosen prefix of length 1 and end with the chosen suffix of length 1.\n\n Moreover, for two consecutive lengths, say 1 and 2: the prefix of length 2 must start with the prefix of length 1. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with the suffix of length 1.\n\n But wait: the problem doesn't require that we reconstruct the string s, only to assign each given string as either 'P' or 'S'. And the number of 'P' and 'S' must be equal (each n-1, so total 2n-2).\n\n How about:\n\n Step 1: Group the 2n-2 strings by their lengths. There will be groups for each length from 1 to n-1, each group having two strings.\n\n Step 2: We know that the entire string s must satisfy:\n   s[0:1] = one of the length-1 strings (prefix)\n   s[-1:] = one of the length-1 strings (suffix)\n\n   Also, for length L, the prefix must be s[0:L] and the suffix must be s[n-L:n]. \n\n Now, note: the problem says that there is at least one string that is consistent.\n\n How to assign? We can try to build the string s from the assignments. However, we don't need to output the string s, but an assignment (a string of 'P' and 'S') for the input order.\n\n Important: The input order is arbitrary. So we have to output the assignment in the same order as the input.\n\n Idea: \n Since the problem guarantees that there is at least one solution, we can use the following:\n\n Let the input be stored in a list `lines` (after reading n and the next 2n-2 lines).\n\n We can do:\n\n   Read n, then 2n-2 lines.\n\n   We have to assign to each line either 'P' or 'S'.\n\n Conditions for consistency: \n   Let the assignment string be T (of length 2n-2). Then we must choose exactly n-1 'P' and n-1 'S'.\n\n   Moreover, for the string to exist, the chosen prefix of length L must be compatible with the chosen prefix of length L+1 (if we choose two different strings for two consecutive lengths) and similarly for suffixes.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all possibilities (which would be too many).\n\n Another idea: use the fact that the entire string s must be built from the prefixes and suffixes. In particular, the prefix of length n-1 must be s[0:n-1], and the suffix of length n-1 must be s[1:n]. Therefore, the prefix of length n-1 must end with the first character of the suffix of length n-1? Actually, no. But they share the middle part.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n\n   Let P_L be the chosen prefix of length L and S_L be the chosen suffix of length L.\n\n   Then, for the string s to exist, we must have:\n        s[0:L] = P_L\n        s[n-L:n] = S_L\n\n   And also, for the entire string to be consistent, the prefix of length L must be the first L characters of the prefix of length L+1 (if we choose the prefix of length L+1 as P_{L+1}), and the suffix of length L must be the last L characters of the suffix of length L+1 (if we choose the suffix of length L+1 as S_{L+1}).\n\n But note: the problem does not require us to find the actual string, just an assignment.\n\n However, we can use the following:\n\n   We know that the entire set of prefixes and suffixes must form a string s of length n. This implies that:\n\n   - The two strings of length 1: one is the prefix and one is the suffix.\n\n   Consider the two strings of length 1: say a and b.\n   Then, the prefix of length 1 must be one of them, and the suffix of length 1 must be the other.\n\n   Now, look at the two strings of length 2: say c and d.\n\n   Condition: \n     If we choose the prefix of length 1 as 'a', then the prefix of length 2 must start with 'a'. Similarly, if we choose the suffix of length 1 as 'b', then the suffix of length 2 must end with 'b'.\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify which one is which. However, we are allowed to output any valid assignment.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. We can start by assigning the two strings of length 1 arbitrarily? But then we have to check the rest.\n\n   However, note the guarantee: the strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   We know that the entire string s must satisfy that the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L share the condition that the prefix of length L is the first L characters and the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n   Moreover, the entire string s is of length n. Therefore, the prefix of length n-1 must be the string s without the last character, and the suffix of length n-1 must be the string s without the first character.\n\n   Then, we have: \n        s = P_{n-1} + [last character] = [first n-1 characters] and also s = [first character] + S_{n-1}\n\n   Then, the last character of P_{n-1} must equal the first character of S_{n-1}? Not necessarily: because the entire string is built from the two sets.\n\n   Actually, from the two sets, we can build the entire string:\n\n        Let the chosen prefix for length 1 be A1, and for length 2 be A2, ... , for length n-1 be A_{n-1}.\n        Then s = A_{n-1} + (some last character) and also s = (some first character) + S_{n-1}.\n\n        But we also have that the prefix of length 1 is the first character of s, and the suffix of length 1 is the last character of s.\n\n        Therefore, the first character of s is the chosen prefix of length 1, and the last character of s is the chosen suffix of length 1.\n\n        Now, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1] and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n]. So we must have:\n            s[0:n-1] = A_{n-1}\n            s[1:n] = S_{n-1}\n\n        Then, the last character of A_{n-1} (which is s[n-2]) must be the same as the first character of S_{n-1}? Actually, no: because the entire string s is determined by the two sequences.\n\n        Actually, the entire string s must be:\n            s = A_{n-1} + (last char) \n            and also s = (first char) + S_{n-1}\n\n        But note: the first char is A1 (the chosen prefix of length 1) and the last char is the chosen suffix of length 1 (call it B1).\n\n        Then, the prefix of length n-1 must end with the last character of the entire string? No, the entire string ends with the suffix of length 1, which is the last character.\n\n        However, the prefix of length n-1 is the entire string without the last character. Therefore, the last character of the prefix of length n-1 must be the second last character of the entire string.\n\n        Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 must start with the first character of the entire string (because the entire string without the first character is the suffix of length n-1).\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n            s = A_{n-1} + B1   (where B1 is the chosen suffix of length 1)\n\n            and also s = A1 + S_{n-1}\n\n        Then, the first n-1 characters (A_{n-1}) must be equal to A1 + ... (n-2 more characters). \n\n        Actually, we can build the entire string from the two sets of prefixes and suffixes. But note: the problem doesn't require us to output s, only to assign the labels.\n\n   However, we can use the following:\n\n   Since we have two strings for each length, and the entire string s must be consistent, we can use the following:\n\n   Let's denote:\n        Let the two strings of length L be X and Y.\n\n   Then, one of them must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\n   But note: the entire string s must have the property that the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L are connected via the entire string.\n\n   Specifically, the prefix of length L must be the first L characters of s, and the suffix of length L must be the last L characters of s.\n\n   Then, the entire string s is of length n, so the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L must satisfy:\n\n        s[0:L] = prefix_L\n        s[n-L:n] = suffix_L\n\n   And the remaining part (the middle) must be consistent.\n\n   However, we don't know which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix.\n\n   We can use the following algorithm:\n\n   1. Read n and the list of 2n-2 strings.\n\n   2. Group the strings by their lengths.\n\n   3. We know that the entire string s must have the first character (from the two length-1 strings) and last character (the other length-1 string). Then, for length 2, we have two strings. The prefix of length 2 must start with the chosen first character. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 must end with the chosen last character.\n\n   4. Then, we can use the following: for each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two candidates: one must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\n   5. But how to decide? \n\n      We can start from the entire string being built from the two sets. However, note that we are free to choose any assignment as long as there exists at least one string s that fits.\n\n      Another idea: since the problem is small (n up to 100, but the total strings are 2n-2=198, and each length from 1 to 99, so we have 99 groups, each with two strings) we can try to use the following:\n\n      We know that the two strings of length 1 are the first and last characters. Then, we can fix the two length-1 strings: one must be the prefix and the other the suffix.\n\n      Then, for each length L, we have two strings. We must choose one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n      Conditions for the entire string to exist:\n\n          Let the chosen prefix for length L be p_L and the chosen suffix for length L be s_L.\n\n          Then, the entire string s must satisfy:\n              s[0:L] = p_L\n              s[n-L:n] = s_L\n\n          Additionally, the entire string must be consistent with the previously chosen prefixes and suffixes.\n\n      However, we don't know the entire string until we assign all. But note the condition for the entire string: the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L must be such that the prefix of length L is the first L characters and the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n      Moreover, the prefix of length L must be the prefix of the prefix of length L+1 (if we choose a longer prefix). Similarly, the suffix of length L must be the suffix of the suffix of length L+1.\n\n      But note: the problem does not require to build the entire string, but to output an assignment.\n\n      Since there are multiple solutions, we can use a greedy approach:\n\n        Step 1: Group by length.\n\n        Step 2: For each length L, we have two strings: A and B.\n\n        Step 3: Check which one can be a prefix and which one a suffix by looking at the already assigned ones?\n\n        But wait: we haven't assigned any yet.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        We know that the entire string s must be such that the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L must be consistent with the entire string.\n\n        Consider the two strings of length L. They must be used as either a prefix or a suffix.\n\n        Condition for the entire string to exist: the two strings of length L must be such that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Then, the prefix of length L must be the first L characters and the suffix of length L must be the last L characters.\n\n        Then, the entire string s must have the first L characters and the last L characters.\n\n        But note: the entire string is of length n. Then, the condition for the entire string to exist is that the two strings of length L must be such that:\n\n          If we choose A as prefix and B as suffix, then the entire string s must be of the form: A + (some middle part) and also s = (some middle part) + B.\n\n          Additionally, the prefix of length L+1 must be A extended by one character, and the suffix of length L+1 must be B extended by the same character at the beginning? Actually, no: the suffix of length L+1 is the last L+1 characters, so it must end with B.\n\n        However, we are not building the entire string.\n\n      Another idea: use the fact that the entire string s must be built from the two sets. Then, the prefix of length n-1 must be s[0:n-1] and the suffix of length n-1 must be s[1:n]. Then, the entire string s must be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character, and also the first character plus the suffix of length n-1.\n\n        So, let P = prefix of length n-1, and S = suffix of length n-1. Then, s = P + c, and also s = d + S, and the first character d must be the first character of P, and the last character c must be the last character of S.\n\n        Therefore, we must have:\n            P[0] = d, and S[-1] = c, and also the entire string s must be consistent.\n\n        Moreover, the two length-1 strings must be the first character d and the last character c.\n\n        Then, we can use:\n\n          The two length-1 strings must be {d, c}. \n\n        Similarly, the two length-2 strings: one is the prefix of length 2 (which is the first two characters) and the other is the suffix of length 2 (which is the last two characters). \n\n        Condition for the two length-2 strings: \n          The prefix of length 2 must start with d, and the suffix of length 2 must end with c.\n\n        But note: the entire string s has the form: [d, x, ... , y, c] (with length n). Then, the prefix of length 2 is [d, x] and the suffix of length 2 is [y, c] (the last two characters). \n\n        However, the problem does not require to build the entire string, but to assign the labels.\n\n      Proposed plan:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the 2n-2 strings.\n\n        Step 2: Group the strings by their length.\n\n        Step 3: We know that the two strings of length 1 must be the first character and the last character of the entire string.\n\n        Step 4: We can use the following: For each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two strings. We need to assign one as 'P' and one as 'S'. \n\n        Step 5: How to decide? \n\n          We know that the entire string s must satisfy:\n\n            s[0] = the chosen prefix of length 1\n            s[-1] = the chosen suffix of length 1\n\n          Then, for the two strings of length L, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. \n\n          Condition for the prefix of length L: \n            It must start with the chosen prefix of length 1, and if L>1, it must be consistent with the prefix of length L-1 (if we had chosen one) but we don't know the entire prefix chain.\n\n          However, note: the entire string s is fixed. The prefix of length L is the first L characters. Therefore, the prefix of length L must be the prefix of the prefix of length L+1 (if we choose a longer prefix). But we don't know the longer one.\n\n        Alternative Insight (simpler):\n\n          Since the problem states that there is at least one string consistent, we can use the following:\n\n          Let the two strings of length L be A and B.\n\n          We can consider: which one is more likely to be a prefix? \n\n          Condition: The prefix of length L must be the first L characters of the entire string. The entire string is of length n, so the next part (if we consider a prefix of length L+1) must extend from A. Similarly, the suffix of length L must be the last L characters.\n\n          But note: we don't know the entire string.\n\n        After reading the problem again: \"Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it\". So we can output any assignment that leads to at least one string.\n\n        We can try:\n\n          Start by assuming that one of the two strings of length 1 is the prefix and the other is the suffix. Then, for each length L from 2 to n-1, we choose the string that matches the condition from the previous length.\n\n        However, we must assign for all 2n-2 strings.\n\n        Another idea: use the fact that the entire string must be consistent from both ends.\n\n        Since the two sets (prefixes and suffixes) are given, we can build a candidate string s as follows:\n\n          Let the two length-1 strings be a and b. Without loss of generality, we can choose one as the prefix and the other as the suffix.\n\n          Then, for each length L, we have two strings. The prefix of length L must be the prefix of length L-1 extended by one character. Similarly, the suffix of length L must be the suffix of length L-1 extended by one character at the beginning? Actually, no: the suffix of length L is the last L characters, so it is built by taking the suffix of length L-1 and appending one character at the end? \n\n          Actually, no: the suffix of length L is the last L characters, so if we have the entire string s, then the suffix of length L is the substring starting at index n-L to the end.\n\n          But note: the entire string s is built from the prefixes. We don't have the entire string.\n\n        Let me change the perspective:\n\n          We are going to assign each string to either 'P' or 'S'. The condition for the entire string to exist is:\n\n            There exists a string s of length n such that:\n               For every length L from 1 to n-1, if we assigned the string x to be a prefix, then s[0:L] = x, and if we assigned the string x to be a suffix, then s[n-L:n] = x.\n\n          We don't care which s, as long as one exists.\n\n        How to assign? \n\n          We know that the two strings of length 1 must be the first and last characters. Then, the entire string s must have first character = the chosen prefix of length 1, and last character = the chosen suffix of length 1.\n\n          Then, for the two strings of length 2: \n            The prefix of length 2 must start with the first character, and the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character.\n\n          Then, for the two strings of length 3: \n            The prefix of length 3 must start with the first character, and the suffix of length 3 must end with the last character.\n\n          But wait: the problem does not require the entire string to be built from the same set? Actually, the set of prefixes and suffixes are fixed.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the two strings of each length are the prefixes and suffixes of the string s.\n\n        Then, the entire string s must satisfy that the prefix of length L is one of the two strings of length L, and the suffix of length L is the other.\n\n        We can use a greedy matching from the two ends.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Group the strings by length.\n\n          Step 2: For length 1, we have two strings: a and b.\n\n          Step 3: We can arbitrarily assign one as prefix and the other as suffix. Then, for each length L from 2 to n-1:\n\n                  For the two strings of length L, one must be a prefix and one must be a suffix.\n\n                  Condition for prefix: the prefix of length L must be the prefix of length L-1 (if we had a prefix of length L-1) extended by one character? Actually, no: the prefix of length L must be the entire first L characters. But we don't know the entire string.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          Since the entire string s must be consistent, the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L must be such that the prefix of length L is the first L characters and the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n          Then, the entire string s must be:\n\n                s = (prefix of length n-1) + (last character) = (first n-1 characters) and also s = (first character) + (suffix of length n-1)\n\n          But we know the first character (from length-1) and the last character (from length-1). Then, the entire string s is determined by the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1, and they must satisfy:\n\n                Let P = prefix of length n-1, and S = suffix of length n-1.\n\n                Then, P must be the first n-1 characters, and S must be the last n-1 characters.\n\n                Then, the entire string s = P + (last character) and s = (first character) + S.\n\n                Therefore, we must have: \n                    P + (last character) = (first character) + S.\n\n                Then, the first character of S must be the first character of P, and the last character of P must be the last character (which is the last character of S, because S is the last n-1 characters, so the last character of S is the last character of s).\n\n                Actually, the entire string s = P + last_char = first_char + S.\n\n                Then, we have: \n                    P[0] = first_char, and S[-1] = last_char.\n\n                Moreover, the two strings of length n-1 must satisfy this.\n\n          But note: we don't know which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix for length n-1.\n\n          We can use this condition for length n-1 to choose between the two strings of length n-1.\n\n          Similarly, for the other lengths, we can use the condition that the prefix of length L must start with the chosen first character (if we fix the first character) and the suffix of length L must end with the chosen last character.\n\n          However, wait: the problem does not fix the first character and the last character arbitrarily. They are given by the two length-1 strings, and we must assign one of them as the prefix and the other as the suffix.\n\n          So, we have two possibilities for the first and last character.\n\n          Since the problem allows any solution, we can try both? But n can be up to 100, and the total strings are 198, so trying both might be acceptable? Actually, 2 possibilities, then for each length from 2 to n-1 we have 2 possibilities, so total 2^(n-1) possibilities. n-1 is up to 99 -> 2^99 which is too many.\n\n        Therefore, we must use a smarter way.\n\n        Insight: The entire string s must be consistent with the entire set of prefixes and suffixes. \n\n        We can build the entire string s by combining the chosen prefix of length n-1 and the chosen suffix of length n-1, and then check the inner parts? But we don't know the entire set.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          We know the two strings for each length. We can try to build the entire string from the two sets by using the fact that the prefix of length L must be the first L characters and the suffix of length L must be the last L characters.\n\n          Then, the entire string s must be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character, and the last character is the chosen suffix of length 1.\n\n          Similarly, the entire string s must be the chosen prefix of length 1 plus the suffix of length n-1.\n\n          Then, the condition for the entire string is:\n\n              Let P = prefix of length n-1, and S = suffix of length n-1, and let a = chosen prefix of length 1, b = chosen suffix of length 1.\n\n              Then, s = P + b = a + S.\n\n              Therefore, we must have:\n                  P + b == a + S   (as strings)\n\n          Then, we can use this condition to choose the two strings for length n-1.\n\n          Similarly, for the other lengths, we can use the condition that the prefix of length L must be the first L characters of the entire string, and the suffix of length L must be the last L characters.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Group by length.\n\n          Step 2: From the two strings of length 1, choose one as the prefix (call it a) and the other as the suffix (call it b). Then, we have two possibilities.\n\n          Step 3: For each possibility (two possibilities), try to determine the entire string s by:\n\n                  s = a + S_{n-1}   (where S_{n-1} is the suffix of length n-1, and also s = P_{n-1} + b)\n\n                  Condition: a + S_{n-1} = P_{n-1} + b.\n\n                  Then, we must have:\n                      a + S_{n-1} == P_{n-1} + b.\n\n                  Then, we can choose the two strings of length n-1 as the ones that satisfy this equation.\n\n          But note: we have two strings for length n-1: let them be X and Y.\n\n          Then, we must choose one as P_{n-1} and the other as S_{n-1} such that:\n\n              a + Y == X + b   OR   a + X == Y + b.\n\n          Then, once we choose the correct one for length n-1, we can use that to determine the entire string s.\n\n          Then, for the other lengths (from 2 to n-2), we can determine the assignment by:\n\n              For a given length L, we have two strings: A and B.\n\n              The entire string s must be consistent: the prefix of length L must be the first L characters of s, and the suffix of length L must be the last L characters of s.\n\n              Then, we must have:\n\n                  A == s[0:L] and B == s[L:n]   OR   B == s[0:L] and A == s[L:n]\n\n              But we know s from the above step? Actually, we built s from the length n-1 and the fixed first character and last character.\n\n          However, we did not know s until we chose the length n-1.\n\n          So, for a fixed assignment for length 1 and length n-1, we can build s uniquely:\n\n              s = a + S_{n-1}   (and also s = P_{n-1} + b)\n\n          Then, for each length L from 2 to n-2, we can check:\n\n              The two strings for length L: one must be s[0:L] and the other must be s[n-L:n].\n\n          Then, we can assign the one that equals s[0:L] as 'P' and the one that equals s[n-L:n] as 'S'.\n\n          Then, we can output the assignment for the entire list.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let the input be stored in a list `arr` of strings.\n\n          Step 1: Read n and the next 2n-2 lines.\n\n          Step 2: Group the strings by length.\n\n          Step 3: Let groups = {}\n          for i in range(2*n-2):\n              l = len(arr[i])\n              groups.setdefault(l, []).append(arr[i])\n\n          Then, we know the groups for lengths 1 to n-1.\n\n          Step 4: Let the two strings of length 1 be [a, b]. We have two choices for (a,b): (prefix, suffix) or (suffix, prefix). Actually, wait: the two length-1 strings: one must be the prefix and the other the suffix. But note: the entire string s has first character from the prefix and last character from the suffix.\n\n          So, we try both:\n\n            Possibility 1: \n                prefix1 = a, suffix1 = b.\n\n            Possibility 2:\n                prefix1 = b, suffix1 = a.\n\n          Then, for each possibility, we try to determine the assignment for all lengths.\n\n          For a fixed possibility (say prefix1 = a, suffix1 = b):\n\n            We need to choose the two strings for length n-1: let the two strings be X and Y.\n\n            Then, we require that: \n                s = a + S_{n-1} = P_{n-1} + b.\n\n            Then, S_{n-1} = s[-n+1:] and P_{n-1} = s[:n-1].\n\n            But s = a + S_{n-1} = P_{n-1} + b.\n\n            Then, the length of s is n, so S_{n-1} has length n-1, and P_{n-1} has length n-1.\n\n            Then, we have:\n\n                a + S_{n-1} = P_{n-1} + b   => S_{n-1} = P_{n-1}[1:] + b   ??? \n\n            Actually, let's break down:\n\n                s = a + S_{n-1}   -> s has length 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n                s = P_{n-1} + b   -> s has length (n-1) + 1 = n.\n\n                Then, the entire string s must be the same.\n\n                So, the first character is 'a', the last character is 'b', and the substring from index 1 to n-1 is S_{n-1} (which is the chosen suffix of length n-1) and also the substring from index 0 to n-2 is P_{n-1} (the chosen prefix of length n-1).\n\n                Then, the condition is:\n\n                    a + S_{n-1} == P_{n-1} + b.\n\n            Therefore, we must choose one of the two strings of length n-1 as S_{n-1} and the other as P_{n-1} such that:\n\n                Option 1: Let P = X, S = Y.\n                    Then, a + Y == X + b.\n\n                Option 2: Let P = Y, S = X.\n                    Then, a + X == Y + b.\n\n            Then, we pick the option that holds.\n\n          If neither holds, then this possibility is invalid. But the problem guarantees that there is at least one solution.\n\n          Then, once we have the assignment for length 1 and length n-1, we can build the entire string s = a + S_{n-1} (or P_{n-1} + b, they are the same).\n\n          Then, for each length L from 2 to n-2:\n\n            We have two strings: A and B.\n\n            Then, the entire string s must have:\n\n                s[0:L] = one of them, and s[n-L:n] = the other.\n\n            So, we check:\n\n                If A == s[0:L] and B == s[n-L:n], then we assign A as 'P' and B as 'S'.\n\n                Else if B == s[0:L] and A == s[n-L:n], then we assign B as 'P' and A as 'S'.\n\n            If neither, then this possibility is invalid.\n\n          Then, if we have found an assignment for all lengths, we output the assignment string (in the input order).\n\n          We do this for the two possibilities (for length 1). If one possibility works, we output that. Otherwise, the other.\n\n        But note: the input order is arbitrary. We must output the assignment in the same order as the input.\n\n        How to keep track of the input order?\n\n          We can store the original list of strings and their index.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We are grouping by length, so we lose the original order.\n\n          We need to output an answer string of length 2n-2 (each character is either 'P' or 'S').\n\n          We can:\n\n            Create an array `ans` of length 2n-2, initially None for each.\n\n            Then, when we assign a string (at a particular length) as 'P' or 'S', we know the index of that string in the input.\n\n          Steps to keep the input order:\n\n            Let `input_strs` be the list of 2n-2 strings.\n\n            Let `groups` be a dictionary mapping length -> list of two strings.\n\n            But we need to know the original index of each string.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We'll create a list `assignment` of length (2n-2) with None.\n\n            Then, for each string in the input, we remember its index.\n\n            Then, when we assign a label to a string, we set `assignment[index] = 'P' or 'S'`.\n\n          However, we are grouping by length. We can store the index along with the string.\n\n          Revised plan:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and the list of 2n-2 strings, and store them with their index.\n\n            Step 2: Group by length, but keep the index.\n\n            groups = defaultdict(list)\n            for idx, s in enumerate(input_strs):\n                groups[len(s)].append( (idx, s) )\n\n            Then, we have groups for lengths 1 to n-1, each group has two elements.\n\n            Step 3: Let the two strings of length 1 be (i1, a) and (i2, b).\n\n            Possibility 1: assign a as prefix, b as suffix.\n\n            Then, for length n-1: two strings (j1, X) and (j2, Y). Check:\n\n                Option 1: a + Y == X + b -> then assign X as prefix (so mark j1 as 'P') and Y as suffix (mark j2 as 'S')\n                Option 2: a + X == Y + b -> then assign Y as prefix (mark j2 as 'P') and X as suffix (mark j1 as 'S')\n\n            Then, build s = a + Y (if Option1) or s = a + X (if Option2). Actually, we don't know which one is which, but we can build s from the chosen prefix and suffix of length n-1.\n\n            Actually, if we choose Option1: then P = X, S = Y -> then s = X + b = a + Y.\n\n            Similarly, Option2: then s = Y + b = a + X.\n\n            Then, for each length L from 2 to n-2:\n\n                The two strings for length L: (k1, A) and (k2, B)\n\n                Then, check:\n\n                    If A == s[0:L] and B == s[n-L:n]:\n                        Then, assign A as 'P' (so set assignment[k1] = 'P') and B as 'S' (set assignment[k2] = 'S').\n\n                    Else if B == s[0:L] and A == s[n-L:n]:\n                        Then, assign B as 'P' and A as 'S'.\n\n            Then, we have an assignment for all strings.\n\n            Then, we output a string of length 2n-2: for i from 0 to 2n-2, output 'P' if assignment[i] is 'P', else 'S'.\n\n            But note: the possibility might fail for some lengths. Then we try the other possibility.\n\n          However, what if both possibilities for length 1 work? Then we can choose any.\n\n        But note: the problem",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether each given string in the input is a prefix or a suffix of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves grouping the strings by their lengths and then using the properties of prefixes and suffixes to assign labels ('P' or 'S') to each string. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since the problem guarantees that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, we can process each group separately.\n2. **Handling Length 1 Strings**: The two strings of length 1 must be the first character (prefix) and the last character (suffix) of the unknown string `s`. We consider both possible assignments (i.e., which string is the prefix and which is the suffix).\n3. **Determining Length `n-1` Strings**: For the strings of length `n-1`, we use the condition that the entire string `s` must satisfy `s = prefix + suffix[-1]` and `s = prefix[:-1] + suffix`. This helps us choose between the two strings of length `n-1`.\n4. **Building the String `s`**: Once the prefix and suffix of length `n-1` are chosen, we can construct the entire string `s` as the combination of the chosen prefix and suffix.\n5. **Assigning Labels for Other Lengths**: For strings of lengths between 2 and `n-2`, we check if they match the corresponding prefix or suffix of `s` derived from the constructed string. If they do, we assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    total_strings = 2 * n -

The first line specifies the length `n` of the unknown string.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to facilitate processing.\n3. **Prefix-Suffix Assignment**: For the strings of length 1, we consider both possible assignments (one as prefix and the other as suffix).\n4. **Constructing the Unknown String**: Using the chosen prefix and suffix of length `n-1`, we construct the candidate string `s` and verify its consistency with the given strings.\n5. **Label Assignment**: For strings of other lengths, we check if they match the corresponding prefix or suffix of the constructed string and assign labels accordingly.\n6. **Output**: The labels for all input strings are concatenated into a single string and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible assignments by leveraging the properties of prefixes and suffixes, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
