The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of rounds where Nikephoros loses and where Polycarpus loses.\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that the sequences A and B are cyclic. Let m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n In round i (0-indexed), Nikephoror uses A[i % m] and Polycarpus uses B[i % k].\n\n We are to count:\n   - The number of rounds where Nikephoros loses: \n        (A[j], B[l]) such that (A[j] == 'R' and B[l] == 'S') OR\n        (A[j] == 'S' and B[l] == 'P') OR\n        (A[j] == 'P' and B[l] == 'R')\n     But note: in a round, if the two items are the same, it's a draw (no one loses). Otherwise, the rules above determine the winner.\n\n However, note: in each round, there is exactly one outcome. We are only concerned with the losses for each player.\n\n Actually, we can break down the rounds:\n\n   For a given round i (0-indexed):\n      Let a = A[i % m]\n      Let b = B[i % k]\n\n      Then, if a beats b, then Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses (so one red spot for Polycarpus).\n      If b beats a, then Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus wins (so one red spot for Nikephoros).\n      If they are the same, then no red spot.\n\n So, we need to count:\n   red_spots_Nikephoros = number of rounds where b beats a (i.e., when Polycarpus wins)\n   red_spots_Polycarpus = number of rounds where a beats b (i.e., when Nikephoros wins)\n\n But note: the problem asks for the number of red spots on both players.\n\n How to count without iterating over n rounds?\n\n Idea: We can consider the periodicity of the combined sequence. The round index i will have:\n   a_i = A[i % m]\n   b_i = B[i % k]\n\n The entire sequence of rounds is periodic with period LCM(m, k) (if we consider the pair (a_i, b_i)).\n However, note that m and k are at most 1000, so the LCM might be up to 10^6, which is acceptable for precomputation?\n But n can be up to 2e9, and LCM(m,k) might be as large as m*k (which is 1e6) so we can do:\n\n   total_rounds = n\n   Let T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) / GCD(m, k)\n\n Then, we can compute the number of full cycles of length T, and then the remaining rounds.\n\n However, note: the two sequences are independent and the round i depends on (i % m, i % k). The state (i % m, i % k) has period T = LCM(m,k). \n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute the LCM of m and k.\n\n   Step 2: Precompute an array for one cycle of T rounds, but T can be up to 10^6 (if m=1000, k=1000, then LCM(1000,1000)=1000, but worst-case is when m and k are coprime, then T = m*k, which is 1e6). This is acceptable.\n\n   Step 3: Count in one cycle T, the number of rounds where:\n        Condition1: (a, b) leads to a win for Nikephoros (so b wins) -> that means:\n            (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then Polycarpus loses? Actually, wait:\n\n        Let me define clearly:\n\n            In a round, if the outcome is that Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n            If the outcome is that Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n        So, for a given (a, b):\n\n            if a == b: draw -> 0 red spots for both.\n\n            else:\n                if (a, b) is one of the winning pairs for a (i.e., a beats b) then:\n                    a beats b: \n                        a='R', b='S' -> a wins -> so Polycarpus loses (so one red spot for Polycarpus) -> condition: (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the result without simulating each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The key observation is that the sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds respectively, so the combined sequence repeats every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of processing each of the `n` rounds one by one, we can leverage the periodic nature of the sequences. We precompute the outcomes for one full cycle of `T` rounds. Then, we calculate how many full cycles fit into `n` rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences (`m` and `k`) to determine the period `T`.\n   - **Cycle Processing**: For each round in one cycle (from 0 to `T-1`), determine the moves from both sequences and count the wins for each player.\n   - **Efficient Counting**: Use integer division to find the number of full cycles in `n` rounds and multiply the cycle counts by the respective win counts. For the remaining rounds, simulate the outcomes directly.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes `T` rounds once, where `T` is the LCM of `m` and `k`. Since `m` and `k` are at most 1000, `T` can be up to 1,000,000, which is manageable. The overall complexity is O(T + n), but effectively O(T) since `T` is bounded by 1,000,000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    wins_nike = 0\n    wins_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n           (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            wins_nike += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'R') or \\\n             (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n             (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'S'):\n            wins_poly += 1\n            \n    num_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    nike_spots = num_cycles * wins_nike\n    poly_spots = num_cycles * wins_poly\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A_str[i % m]\n        b_char = B_str[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n           (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R'):\n            nike_spots += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'R') or \\\n             (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n             (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'S'):\n            poly_spots += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{nike_spots} {poly_spots}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is zero, it immediately outputs \"0 0\" since no rounds mean no red spots.\n3. **Period Calculation**: The period `T` is calculated as the LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B`.\n4. **Cycle Processing**: For each round in one period `T`, the code checks the outcome based on the current moves from both sequences. It counts how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus win within one cycle.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total wins for each player are computed by multiplying the wins per cycle by the number of full cycles (`n // T`) and then adding the wins from the remaining rounds (`n % T`).\n6. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
