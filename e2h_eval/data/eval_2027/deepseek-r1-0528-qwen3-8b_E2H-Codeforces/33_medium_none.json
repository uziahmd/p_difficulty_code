    "thought": "\n We are allowed to use each element in s at most once, and we can choose any positions in a to replace with the digits from s (each s digit used at most once). The goal is to maximize the number.\n\n Observation:\n Since we can choose any positions, we want to replace the leftmost digits first because they have higher significance. However, note that sometimes replacing a digit with a smaller one might be necessary if we run out of larger digits for more significant positions? Actually, we want to assign the largest available digits from s to the leftmost positions, but we must consider that we cannot break the order of replacements arbitrarily? \n\n But note: we are allowed to choose any positions arbitrarily (like independent swaps). So we can think of it as:\n\n We have two strings: \n   a: the original number (string of digits)\n   s: a string of digits (each digit is a candidate for replacement)\n\n We can use each digit in s at most once.\n\n Strategy:\n\n We want to maximize the number. We can only change a digit if we have a digit from s that we haven't used. We can choose which positions to change and which digits from s to use.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to try to assign the best available digits from s to the most significant positions (from left to right) to maximize the number.\n\n However, note: we are not forced to use the entire sequence s. We can choose which operations to perform.\n\n Important: The problem does not require using all digits in s.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We have two main ideas:\n\n Idea 1: We can sort the available digits in s (but note: we cannot break the condition that each digit is used at most once). However, we are allowed to use at most one replacement per digit in s.\n\n Idea 2: We want to replace some digits in a. We are allowed to replace any set of positions. The catch: we can only use the digits from s.\n\n How to maximize?\n - We want the leftmost digit to be as large as possible. But if the leftmost digit is already high, then maybe we don't need to replace it. However, if we can get a larger digit for the leftmost, we should.\n\n However, note: we cannot change the order of the digits arbitrarily. We can only replace existing digits. So the positions remain fixed.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can consider:\n\n 1. We have a multiset (or sorted list) of the digits in s. But note: we cannot use a digit more than once.\n\n 2. We traverse from the most significant digit (leftmost) to the least significant. For each position, we want to check if we can replace the current digit with a larger one from s, without using the same digit twice.\n\n However, there's a twist: sometimes we might want to save a big digit for a later position? Actually, no: because the leftmost digit has the highest weight. But consider: if we have two replacements: one for the first digit and one for the second. If we use the largest digit for the first, then the second becomes the next most significant. So we do:\n\n Step-by-step:\n\n - We'll collect the digits in s and sort them in descending order? Or ascending? Actually, we want to use the largest available digits first for the most significant positions.\n\n But note: we are allowed to skip using a digit. So we don't have to use all.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n 1. Convert the input number 'a' to a list of characters (so we can modify if needed).\n 2. Let s_str = the given string of digits (each character is a digit).\n\n 3. We want to replace some digits in a. We can choose any set of positions. The goal is to maximize the resulting number.\n\n 4. We can think greedily: we want to replace the leftmost digit that we can make bigger, and then move to the next.\n\n However, we have a limited set of replacement digits.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can create a list (or multiset) of the available replacement digits. Then, for each position (from left to right) we consider:\n\n   - What is the current digit? Let it be d.\n   - We want to see if we can replace this digit with a digit from our multiset that is greater than d. But if we do, we remove that digit and continue.\n\n But wait: what if we don't replace this digit? Maybe we want to save a very big digit for a later position? Actually, no: because if we have a chance to make the current digit bigger, we should take it because the leftmost digit is more important.\n\n However, what if the current digit is already high? Then we might not want to replace it with a lower digit. But we are only considering replacing if we have a digit that is strictly greater? Actually, we don't have to replace if we don't find a better digit.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use at most one replacement per digit in s, and we can choose which ones to use.\n\n However, here's a catch: we might have multiple digits in s that are larger than the current one. We should use the smallest larger digit available? Why? Because we want to save the larger ones for potentially more beneficial replacements (if we can get an even larger digit in a less significant position by saving a bigger one, but actually no: the leftmost is more important). \n\n Actually, we want to use the minimal improvement that still increases the digit? No, we want to use the smallest digit that is larger than the current one so that we reserve the larger ones for later (which might be needed for a position that is currently lower and we can't improve by a small amount). \n\n Example: \n   a = \"123\"\n   s = \"987\"\n\n   We have three replacements: [9,8,7]. We can only use one per position.\n\n   We start at the first digit '1'. We can replace it with 9,8, or 7. But if we replace with 7, then we leave 9 and 8 for the next digits. Then for the second digit, we have '2' and we can replace with 9 or 8. Then for the third, we have 3 and we can replace with the remaining.\n\n   However, we want the maximum number. The maximum number we can get is by replacing the first digit with 9, then the second with 8, then the third with 7 -> 987.\n\n   Alternatively, if we use the smallest replacement that is greater than the current digit, then for the first digit we would use 7 (because 7 is the smallest digit in s that is >1). Then the second digit: current is 2, the available digits are [9,8] (we removed 7). The smallest digit greater than 2 is 8. Then third digit: 3, smallest digit greater than 3 is 9. Resulting number: 789.\n\n   But 987 is larger than 789. So we don't want to use the smallest replacement. We want to use the largest replacement? Then for the first digit: use 9. Then for the second: use 8. Then for the third: use 7. Then we get 987.\n\n   However, consider: what if we have two replacements that are large, but we have a position that is very low and we don't have a large digit for it? Actually, we want to use the largest available digit for the most significant position that can be improved.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to skip a replacement. So we don't have to replace a digit if we don't have a good candidate.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: we might have a situation where we have two replacements: one very large and one medium. We use the large one for the first digit, then the medium for the second, etc.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Sort the replacement digits (s) in descending order? Actually, we want to consider the best candidates first.\n\n   But wait, we are going to use a greedy from left to right:\n\n     For each position i (from 0 to n-1):\n        We look for the largest digit in the multiset that is greater than the current digit. Why largest? Because we want to reserve the small improvements for when we don't have a good candidate? Actually, no: we want to use the best (largest) digit we have for the current position if we can, so that we don't waste a big digit on a later position.\n\n   However, if we use the largest digit available for the current position, then we might break the possibility of having a very good candidate for a later position that is even more significant? Actually, no: the leftmost is the most significant. Using a large digit now is better than saving it for a later position.\n\n   But wait: what if the current digit is already high? Then we don't need to replace, so we leave it.\n\n   However, consider: we are trying to maximize the number. The number is determined by the leftmost digit first. So we want the leftmost digit to be as high as possible.\n\n   Therefore, we should use the largest digit available that is greater than the current digit. Why not the smallest? Because we don't care about the magnitude of the improvement beyond making the digit larger. We just need to make the digit larger. And then we remove that digit and move on.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use at most one replacement per position. So we can only replace a digit once.\n\n   However, there is a catch: if we use a very large digit for the current position, then we might not have enough large digits for the subsequent positions. But the subsequent positions are less significant, so having a slightly lower digit is acceptable.\n\n   Example: \n        a = \"1999\"\n        s = \"9876\"\n\n        We have four digits in s: [9,8,7,6]\n\n        First digit: '1'. We can replace with 9 -> then we get 9999. Then we don't need the rest.\n\n        But if we don't use the 9 for the first digit, then we use 9 for a later digit? Then the first digit remains 1, which is worse.\n\n        So we use the 9 for the first digit.\n\n        Now, what if we have:\n        a = \"1999\"\n        s = \"8765\"\n\n        Then we cannot get a 9 for the first digit. The best we can do is replace the first digit with 8 -> 8999.\n\n        But wait, what if we don't replace the first digit? Then we can replace a later digit? That would give 1999 (the original) which is worse than 8999.\n\n        So the algorithm for each position:\n\n          - We want to know: is there any digit in s that is greater than the current digit?\n          - If yes, then we choose the largest digit in s that is greater than the current digit, because we want to maximize the current digit.\n\n        However, we must consider: what if we have multiple digits in s that are greater? We use the largest one because we want the current digit to be as large as possible.\n\n        But then, we remove that digit and proceed.\n\n   However, there is an alternative: we might have a situation where we have a very large digit that we want to use for a later position because the current digit is already high. But that is not beneficial: we are going to compare the entire number. The leftmost digit is the most important.\n\n   But consider: what if we have two replacements: one very large and one just above the current digit. We use the large one for the current digit. Then the next digit is unchanged. But if we use the small one for the current digit, then we have the large one for the next digit, which is the next significant. However, the next digit is less significant. \n\n   Example: \n        a = \"1234\"\n        s = \"98\"\n\n        Possibility 1: Use 9 for the first digit -> \"9234\"\n        Possibility 2: Use 8 for the first digit -> \"8234\", then use 9 for the second digit -> \"8934\"\n\n        Which is larger? 9234 vs 8934 -> 9234 is larger.\n\n   So we want to use the largest digit available for the current digit.\n\n   But wait, what if we don't use the largest digit for the current digit because we can use a smaller digit and then use the largest for a later digit that is more critical? Actually, no: the current digit is more critical.\n\n   However, consider a different example:\n\n        a = \"192\"\n        s = \"98\"\n\n        Option 1: Use the 9 for the first digit: \"992\"\n        Option 2: Use the 9 for the second digit: \"192\" -> becomes \"192\" (if we don't use the 9 for the first) but wait, we can also use the 8 for the first and 9 for the second: \"892\"\n\n        Now, compare:\n            \"992\", \"892\", and the original \"192\".\n\n        The maximum is \"992\".\n\n        But how do we get \"992\"? We use the 9 for the first digit.\n\n   So the greedy from left to right using the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit is correct.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to skip a replacement. So if we don't have any digit in s that is greater than the current digit, we leave the digit as is.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a digit in s that is equal to the current digit? We don't have to use it, and we don't want to because it doesn't increase the digit. So we ignore.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. Read the integer a as a string (let's call it `num_str`)\n     2. Read the sequence s as a string (call it `replacements`)\n\n     3. We will create a multiset (or simply a sorted list) of the replacement digits. But note: we can use each only once.\n\n     4. We want to process the digits from left to right.\n\n     5. For each digit in `num_str` (from left to right):\n          - Check if there exists any digit in the multiset that is greater than the current digit.\n          - If there is, then we choose the largest such digit (to maximize the current digit) and remove it from the multiset.\n\n     6. But wait: is that sufficient? Consider that we might have multiple occurrences of the same digit. We must account for duplicates.\n\n     However, we have to use distinct digits from s (each element of s is used at most once). So we can use a multiset (or frequency dictionary) for s.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n     We can sort the replacement string in descending order and then use a pointer or a priority queue? But note: we are going to remove digits as we use them.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use a frequency array for digits from '0' to '9'.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        freq = [0]*10\n        for char in s:\n            digit = int(char)\n            freq[digit] += 1\n\n        Then, we traverse the digits of `num_str`:\n\n        But note: we are going to use the largest digit available that is greater than the current digit. So we can iterate from 9 down to current_digit+1.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n          candidate = None\n          for d in range(current_digit+1, 10):\n              if freq[d] > 0:\n                  # Then we can use one occurrence of d\n                  candidate = d\n                  break\n\n          If candidate is found, then we replace the current digit with candidate, and decrement freq[candidate].\n\n        But wait: is that the largest? Yes, because we start from 9 and go down until we find one.\n\n        However, we are iterating from high to low, so the first candidate we find is the largest.\n\n        But note: we must use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. This method does that.\n\n        Example: current_digit=1, then we check from 9 down to 2. The first available digit from 9 to 2 is the largest.\n\n        However, we must consider that we are allowed to use the same digit multiple times? No, because the frequency counts the number of times the digit appears in s.\n\n        But note: the problem says each element in s can be used at most once.\n\n        This method uses one occurrence of the digit d (if available) and then breaks.\n\n        But is that efficient? The length of s is up to 10^5, and the outer loop goes up to 10^5 (digits in a). And for each digit in a, we iterate from 9 down to (current_digit+1) which is at most 9 iterations. So total 10^5 * 9 = 900000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can optimize by precomputing the available digits and updating the frequency.\n\n        But note: we are going to use the largest digit available. We can also maintain a sorted list of available digits (but then removal is O(n)).\n\n        Alternatively, we can pre-sort the replacement digits and then use a Fenwick tree or segment tree? But 9 is small, so we can just use the frequency array.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          num_str = input().strip()\n          s_str = input().strip()\n\n          # Build frequency array for s_str\n          freq = [0]*10\n          for char in s_str:\n              d = int(char)\n              freq[d] += 1\n\n          # We'll convert num_str to list of characters so we can modify\n          num_list = list(num_str)\n\n          # Traverse each digit in the number\n          for i in range(len(num_list)):\n              # Convert current digit to int\n              current_digit = int(num_list[i])\n\n              # We look for the largest digit d (from 9 down to current_digit+1) that has frequency > 0.\n              candidate_found = False\n              candidate_digit = None\n              for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n                  if freq[d] > 0:\n                      candidate_digit = d\n                      candidate_found = True\n                      break\n\n              if candidate_found:\n                  # Replace the current digit with candidate_digit\n                  num_list[i] = str(candidate_digit)\n                  # Decrement the frequency of candidate_digit\n                  freq[candidate_digit] -= 1\n\n          # Then, we output the string formed by num_list\n\n        But wait: what if we have multiple digits in s that are the same? We are decrementing the frequency, so we account for duplicates.\n\n        However, consider: we might have the same digit appearing multiple times. Our frequency array counts the frequency. And we are using one occurrence per replacement.\n\n        Example: s = \"111\", then freq[1]=3. Then if we use one 1, we set freq[1] to 2.\n\n        But note: we are only replacing if the candidate_digit is greater than the current_digit. So if the current_digit is 1, then we are looking for digits from 2 to 9. So the 1's won't be used for replacement in that case.\n\n        However, what if we have a digit in s that is less than the current_digit? We don't use it. But note: we are only replacing if we find a digit greater than the current_digit.\n\n        But wait: what if we have the option to replace a digit with a smaller one? The problem does not allow that because we are maximizing. We only consider replacements that lead to an increase.\n\n        However, there is a catch: sometimes we might have a situation where we can improve a later digit by using a digit that is less than the current_digit? Actually, no: because if we use a digit that is less than the current_digit, then we are making the number smaller. We are only allowed to do replacements that are beneficial.\n\n        But note: the problem says we are allowed to use not all elements from s. So we can skip any replacement.\n\n        However, the above algorithm only replaces a digit if we have a digit in s that is strictly greater. That is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a digit in s that is equal to the current_digit? We don't use it. And that is correct because replacing with an equal digit doesn't change the number.\n\n        However, what if we have a situation where we don't have a digit greater than the current_digit, but we have a digit that is less? We skip.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require to use all, so we are skipping non-beneficial replacements.\n\n        However, there is an alternative: sometimes we might want to use a digit that is less than the current_digit? Only if we are forced to? Actually, no. We are trying to maximize the number. So we never use a digit that is less than or equal to the current_digit because:\n\n          - If equal, then no change.\n          - If less, then we are decreasing the digit, which is bad.\n\n        Therefore, we only consider digits strictly greater.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two positions: the first digit is 1, and the second digit is 9. And s = \"98\". Then:\n\n          For the first digit: we can replace 1 with 9 -> becomes 99, then we use the 8 for nothing (since the second digit is 9 and we don't have a digit greater than 9). Then the result is 99.\n\n          Alternatively, we could replace the first digit with 8 and the second digit with 9 -> 89, which is worse.\n\n        So the algorithm is correct.\n\n        However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n          Input: \n            a = \"1024\"\n            s = \"010\"\n\n          Expected Output: \"1124\"\n\n          Let's break down:\n\n            num_str = \"1024\"\n            s_str = \"010\"\n\n            Frequency for s_str: \n                '0': 2, '1': 1\n\n            Process each digit:\n\n              i=0: current_digit = 1\n                 We look for digits from 9 down to 2: none found. So we leave it as '1'.\n                 Frequency unchanged.\n\n              i=1: current_digit = 0\n                 Look for digits from 9 down to 1: we find 1 (freq[1] is 1). So we replace with '1', and set freq[1] to 0.\n                 Now the number becomes \"1124\"\n\n              i=2: current_digit = 2\n                 Look for digits from 9 down to 3: none (because we have only 0's and 1's left, but we used the 1). So we leave it.\n\n              i=3: current_digit = 4 -> no digit greater than 4.\n\n            Output: \"1124\" -> matches.\n\n        Example 2:\n          Input:\n            a = \"987\"\n            s = \"1234567\"\n\n          Expected Output: \"987\"\n\n          Frequency for s: digits 1 to 7, each one time.\n\n          Process:\n\n            i0: current_digit=9 -> look for digits from 9 down to 10: none (because 9 is the highest, and we are looking for >9). So no replacement.\n\n            Similarly for 8 and 7: no replacement.\n\n          Output: \"987\"\n\n        But wait, what if we have:\n\n          a = \"123\"\n          s = \"987\"\n\n          Expected: \"987\"\n\n          Process:\n\n            i0: current_digit=1 -> look for 9,8,7: the largest is 9. Replace first digit with 9, update freq: 9:0, 8:1, 7:1.\n            i1: current_digit=2 -> look for 9,8,7: the largest available is 8. Replace second digit with 8, update freq: 8:0, 7:1.\n            i2: current_digit=3 -> look for 9,8,7: the largest available is 7. Replace third digit with 7.\n\n          Result: \"987\"\n\n        But wait: what if we have:\n\n          a = \"123\"\n          s = \"789\"\n\n          Then we get the same: \"987\"\n\n        Another example:\n\n          a = \"123\"\n          s = \"9876\"\n\n          Then:\n\n            i0: 1 -> use 9 -> becomes 9, s becomes [8,7,6]\n            i1: 2 -> use 8 -> becomes 8, s becomes [7,6]\n            i2: 3 -> use 7 -> becomes 7, s becomes [6] -> but we don't use 6 because 6<3? Actually, we don't use it because we are only replacing if the replacement digit is greater. But 7>3 so we use 7.\n\n          Result: \"987\"\n\n        But what if:\n\n          a = \"123\"\n          s = \"6789\"\n\n          Then:\n\n            i0: 1 -> use 9 -> \"9\", s: [6,7,8]\n            i1: 2 -> use 8 -> \"8\", s: [6,7]\n            i2: 3 -> use 7 -> \"7\", s: [6]\n\n          Result: \"987\"\n\n        However, consider:\n\n          a = \"123\"\n          s = \"911\"\n\n          Then:\n\n            i0: 1 -> we can use 9 -> becomes 9, s: [1,1]\n            i1: 2 -> we look for digits from 3 to 9: none (because we have only 1's). So we leave 2.\n            i2: 3 -> we look for digits from 4 to 9: none.\n\n          Result: \"923\"\n\n        But wait, what if we use the 1's for the second and third digits? We cannot because 1 is less than 2 and 3. So we don't use them.\n\n        However, what if we have:\n\n          a = \"123\"\n          s = \"119\"\n\n          Then:\n\n            i0: 1 -> we can use 9 -> becomes 9, then s: [1,1]\n            i1: 2 -> no digit greater than 2 (only 1's) -> leave 2.\n            i2: 3 -> no digit greater than 3.\n\n          Result: \"923\"\n\n        But what if we don't use the 9 for the first digit? Then we can use the 1's for the second and third digits? But that would be:\n\n          Without using the 9: \n            First digit: 1 (use one 1) -> then second digit: 2 -> use the other 1 -> 1 becomes 1, then third digit: 3 -> no digit. -> 113, which is worse than 923.\n\n        So the algorithm is correct.\n\n        However, note: we are always using the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. But what if we have multiple digits that are greater, but we don't use the largest one? Then we wouldn't get the maximum number.\n\n        But our algorithm uses the largest one because we iterate from 9 down to current_digit+1 and take the first available.\n\n        One more edge: leading zeros.\n\n        The problem states: the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros. And the output shouldn't contain any leading zeros.\n\n        In our algorithm, we are replacing digits. However, we are replacing from left to right. Since we are replacing the first digit only if we have a digit greater than the first digit, and if we replace the first digit with a digit, note that the original first digit is not zero (given). Also, the replacement digit is from s, which is given as digits (could be zero). But if we replace the first digit with zero, then we get a leading zero? \n\n        Example: \n          a = \"10\", s = \"0\"\n\n          Then: \n            i0: current_digit=1 -> we look for digits from 2 to 9: none. So we leave it as 1.\n            i1: current_digit=0 -> we look for digits from 1 to 9: we have 0 in s, but 0 is not greater than 0. So we leave it.\n\n          Result: \"10\", no leading zero.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n          a = \"0\", but the problem states that a doesn't contain leading zeros. So a is at least 1 digit and the first digit isn't zero.\n\n        However, what if we replace the first digit with zero? Then we would have a leading zero. But our algorithm only replaces a digit if we have a digit greater than the current one. So if the current digit is 1 and we have a 0, we don't replace because 0<1. Similarly, if the current digit is 0 (which shouldn't happen because a doesn't have leading zeros and we are at the first digit) then we don't replace because we are only replacing with digits greater than 0.\n\n        But note: the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros, so the first digit is not zero.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        However, what if we have:\n\n          a = \"10\", and s = \"0\" -> we don't replace the first digit, and we don't replace the second digit (because 0 is not greater than 0). So result is \"10\", which is correct.\n\n        But what if:\n\n          a = \"19\", s = \"0\"\n\n          Then: \n            i0: 1 -> no digit greater than 1 (we have 0, but 0<1) -> leave as 1.\n            i1: 9 -> no digit greater than 9 -> leave as 9.\n          Result: \"19\"\n\n        One more: \n\n          a = \"19\", s = \"02\"\n\n          Then: \n            i0: 1 -> we can use 2 (since 2>1) -> becomes 2, then s: [0]\n            i1: 9 -> no digit greater than 9 -> leave as 9.\n          Result: \"29\"\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Code Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n\n          num_str = input().strip()\n          s_str = input().strip()\n\n          # Build frequency array for s_str\n          freq = [0] * 10\n          for char in s_str:\n              d = int(char)\n              freq[d] += 1\n\n          num_list = list(num_str)\n\n          # Traverse each digit in num_list\n          for i in range(len(num_list)):\n              current_digit = int(num_list[i])\n              # We are going to look for the largest digit d (from 9 down to current_digit+1) that has freq[d] > 0.\n              candidate = None\n              # We iterate from 9 down to current_digit+1\n              for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n                  if freq[d] > 0:\n                      candidate = d\n                      break\n\n              if candidate is not None:\n                  # Replace the current digit with candidate\n                  num_list[i] = str(candidate)\n                  # Decrement the frequency of candidate\n                  freq[candidate] -= 1\n\n          # Output the result\n          print(''.join(num_list))\n\n        But wait: what if we have a digit in s that is greater than the current_digit, but we break after the first candidate (which is the largest)? That is correct.\n\n        However, note: we are iterating from 9 down to current_digit+1, so the first candidate we meet is the largest.\n\n        But what if there are multiple candidates? We break after the first, so we use the largest.\n\n        This is the intended behavior.\n\n        Let me test with:\n\n          a = \"123\", s = \"998\"\n\n          Then: \n            i0: current_digit=1 -> we look from 9 down to 2: we find 9 (freq[9]=2) -> use 9, then freq[9] becomes 1.\n            i1: current_digit=2 -> we look from 9 down to 3: we find 9 (now available) -> use 9, then freq[9]=0.\n            i2: current_digit=3 -> we look from 9 down to 4: no candidate.\n\n          Result: \"993\", which is correct.\n\n        However, what if:\n\n          a = \"123\", s = \"9876\"\n\n          Then: \n            i0: 1 -> use 9 -> \"9\", s: [8,7,6]\n            i1: 2 -> use 8 -> \"8\", s: [7,6]\n            i2: 3 -> use 7 -> \"7\", s: [6] -> result \"987\"\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a digit that is greater than the current_digit, but we don't use it because we break too early? No, we are iterating from 9 down, so we use the largest.\n\n        However, the above code uses the largest available digit that is greater than the current_digit. But note: we are breaking at the first candidate, and we are iterating from high to low, so that candidate is the largest.\n\n        But what if we have two different digits, say 8 and 9, and we are at current_digit=1. Then we use 9, which is correct.\n\n        One more: \n\n          a = \"123\", s = \"1119\"\n\n          Then: \n            i0: 1 -> we look for digits from 9 down to 2: we have 9 (freq[9]=1) -> use 9, then freq[9]=0, and the 1's are still there (but we don't use them because we break at 9).\n            Then the rest: no more 9, but we have 1's: so we don't use them.\n\n          Result: \"923\"\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: we are not using the 1's because they are not greater than 1 (they are equal, and we require strictly greater). So we skip.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Note: The problem says the input integers a and s can be up to 10^5 in length. Our inner loop runs at most 9 steps per digit, so total 9 * 10^5 = 900000, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        But wait: what if the replacement string s is empty? Then we don't do any replacement.\n\n        Example: \n          a = \"123\", s = \"\" -> freq is zeros, so no replacement.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Code:\n\n        IMPORTANT: We must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \n          Input: \n            \"1024\"\n            \"010\"\n\n          Output: \"1124\"\n\n        Example 2:\n          Input:\n            \"987\"\n            \"1234567\"\n\n          Output: \"987\"\n\n        But wait, the example input was given as:\n\n          ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n        Actually, the problem says:\n\n          The first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s.\n\n        So we read two lines.\n\n        However, the example input format: \n\n          Input:\n            1024\n            010\n\n        But the example output:\n\n          ['1124', '987']\n\n        So the code:\n\n          num_str = input().strip()\n          s_str = input().strip()\n\n        Then process.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n          Input: \n            \"1024\"\n            \"010\"\n\n          Output: \"1124\"\n\n        Example 2:\n          Input:\n            \"987\"\n            \"1234567\"\n\n          Output: \"987\"\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n          ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n        This is two separate examples. We are writing a script that reads from stdin.\n\n        We assume the input is two lines.\n\n        Code:\n\n        However, note: the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. So we don't have to worry about leading zeros in the input.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n\n        But wait: performance. The inner loop runs at most 9 steps per digit, and the length of a is up to 10^5, so 900000 iterations, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        One more edge: what if the replacement string s has a digit that is greater than 9? But the problem says the digits in s are digits (0-9). So we are safe.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Note: We must use sys.stdin if we want to handle large inputs? But the problem says the numbers can be up to 10^5 digits. The input reading with input() should be fine because the digits are stored as strings.\n\n        However, if the input is large (10^5 characters for a and 10^5 for s), then building the frequency array for s is O(m) which is 10^5, and then the main loop is O(n) with inner loop",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing some of its digits with digits from a provided sequence, using each digit in the sequence at most once. The key insight is that the leftmost digits have the highest significance, so we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits with the largest possible digits from the sequence to achieve the maximum value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing two inputs: the original number (as a string) and a sequence of digits (also as a string). Each digit in the sequence can be used at most once to replace a digit in the original number. The goal is to perform these replacements such that the resulting number is maximized.\n2. **Intuition**: To maximize the number, we should focus on the leftmost digits first. For each digit in the original number, starting from the left, we look for the largest digit in the sequence that is greater than the current digit. If found, we replace the current digit with this largest digit and remove the used digit from the sequence.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Array**: We use a frequency array to keep track of the available digits in the sequence. This allows efficient lookup and updates.\n   - **Greedy Replacement**: For each digit in the original number (from left to right), we search the frequency array for the largest digit greater than the current digit. If found, we replace the digit and decrement the frequency of the used digit.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit in the original number once, and for each digit, it checks up to 9 possible digits (from 9 down to the current digit + 1). Thus, the time complexity is O(n * 9) = O(n), where n is the length of the original number, making it efficient for large inputs (up to 10^5 digits).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    num_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    freq = [0] * 10\n    for char in s_str:\n        d = int(char)\n        freq[d] += 1\n            \n    num_list = list(num_str)\n    \n    for i in range(len(num_list)):\n        current_digit = int(num_list[i])\n        candidate = None\n        for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n            if freq[d] > 0:\n                candidate = d\n                break\n                \n        if candidate is not None:\n            num_list[i] = str(candidate)\n            freq[candidate] -= 1\n            \n    print(''.join(num_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The original number and the sequence of digits are read as strings.\n2. **Frequency Array Initialization**: A frequency array of size 10 (digits 0-9) is initialized to zero. Each digit from the sequence is counted and stored in the array.\n3. **Processing Digits**: For each digit in the original number (processed from left to right), the algorithm checks for the largest digit in the sequence that is greater than the current digit. If such a digit is found, it replaces the current digit and decrements the count of the used digit in the frequency array.\n4. **Output**: The modified list of digits is joined into a string and printed, representing the maximum possible number after all beneficial replacements.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number by leveraging a greedy strategy and a frequency array for quick access to replacement digits, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
