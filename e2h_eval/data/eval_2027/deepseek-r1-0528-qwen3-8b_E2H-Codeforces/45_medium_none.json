There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n The tournament is knockout. We are to find the maximum number of games the winner can play, under the rule:\n   Two players can play against each other only if the number of games one has played differs by at most one from the other.\n\n In a knockout tournament, the total number of games is fixed (n-1) but the structure matters.\n\n However, note: the winner must win all his games. The problem is asking for the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Let's think:\n\n How can we arrange the tournament grid to maximize the winner's games?\n\n Observation:\n In a standard single-elimination tournament, the winner plays in log2(n) games (if n is a power of two). But we can have a different arrangement.\n\n The rule about the number of games played being at most one apart is similar to having two groups: one with k games and the other with k-1 or k or k+1? Actually, the condition is that two players can play if their game counts differ by at most one.\n\n We can model the tournament as building a binary tree (each match produces a winner and a loser) and we want the root (the winner) to have as many games as possible.\n\n Another way: consider the entire tournament. The winner must defeat k opponents. But note: the tournament starts with n players, and each game eliminates one. So the winner must defeat exactly k players, and the total number of eliminations is n-1.\n\n However, the constraint on the number of games per player (the condition) forces a structure.\n\n Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required to have one player win k games under the given rule.\n\n Consider: \n   To win 0 games: 1 player (already the winner)\n   To win 1 game: need at least 2 players (play one game)\n\n How to build for k games?\n   After the first game, the winner has 1 game and the opponent is eliminated. Then, to win the second game, the winner must play another game. But the condition says that the next opponent must have played either 0 or 1 game already.\n\n   We can think of it as: we are going to build a bracket where the winner plays one game at a time, and the number of games he has played increases by one each time.\n\n   However, we also have the freedom to set up the entire tournament arbitrarily (as long as the condition holds). \n\n   Alternatively, we can use recursion:\n\n   Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed so that one of them can win k games.\n\n   Then, to win k games, the last game is the k-th game. Before that game, the winner must have won k-1 games, and the opponent must have won some games. According to the rule, the opponent can have k-1 or k-2 games (because the winner then becomes k, so the opponent must have k-1 or k-2). But wait, the condition is that the two players must have numbers of games that differ by at most one. When they play the k-th game, the winner has k-1 and the opponent must have either k-2 or k-1.\n\n   Actually, the opponent must have played either k-2 or k-1 games (so that after the game, the winner will have k and the opponent is eliminated). But note: the opponent's record is the number of games they have won (since they are still in the tournament until they lose).\n\n   Now, how do we form the opponent for the k-th game? The opponent must have come from a subtree that has been arranged to have a winner with either k-1 or k-2 wins.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of players for a winner to have k games is:\n        F(k) = 1 + min(F(k-1), F(k-2)) * 2   ??? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, we need two subtrees: one for the winner (which takes F(k-1) players to get the winner to k-1 wins) and one for the opponent (which must have a winner with either k-1 or k-2 wins, but the minimal one is F(k-1) and F(k-2)). However, the opponent must have been the winner of a subtree that produces a player with at least k-2 wins (so that the condition holds: |k-1 - (opponent's wins)| <= 1). But we want to minimize the total players.\n\n   We can set up the recurrence as:\n\n        F(0) = 1\n        F(1) = 2\n\n        For k>=2:\n        Option 1: Opponent has k-1 wins. Then we need two subtrees: one of size F(k-1) for the winner and one of size F(k-1) for the opponent. But wait, the opponent is the winner of a subtree that has k-1 wins, so the entire subtree for the opponent requires F(k-1) players. Similarly, the winner's previous games require a subtree that leads to k-1 wins, which is F(k-1) players. Then the total is F(k-1) [for the winner] + F(k-1) [for the opponent] = 2 * F(k-1).\n\n        Option 2: Opponent has k-2 wins. Then the opponent's subtree requires F(k-2) players. The winner's previous games require F(k-1) players. Then the total is F(k-1) + F(k-2).\n\n        However, note: the same winner goes through the entire process. Actually, the entire tournament is built by having the winner and the opponent, and then the rest. But the winner's path is independent of the opponent's path? Actually, no: the winner must have played k-1 games, so we need a subtree of size F(k-1) for the winner's previous wins. And the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2, so we need a subtree of size either F(k-1) or F(k-2). Then the total players is the sum of the two subtrees (since they are disjoint) plus one (the final game)? Actually, no: the two subtrees are separate, and the winner is the root. But the winner is already accounted for in the F(k-1) subtree? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n        The entire tournament is a complete binary tree (with the winner at the root). The left child of the root is the winner of the subtree that leads to the k-1 wins (or k-2 wins) and the right child is the opponent. \n\n        Actually, we can build:\n\n          To have the winner win k games, we need:\n            - The winner must have won k-1 games (so we need a subtree that gives the winner k-1 wins, which requires F(k-1) players).\n            - The opponent must have won either k-1 or k-2 games (so we need a subtree that gives an opponent with k-1 wins, which is F(k-1) players, or a subtree that gives an opponent with k-2 wins, which is F(k-2) players).\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of players for k wins is:\n\n            F(k) = 1 + F(k-1) + min(F(k-1), F(k-2))\n\n        Wait, the \"1\" might be for the two players in the final? Actually, no: the entire subtree for the winner (which includes the final) is F(k-1) (which already includes the winner and the path to his k-1 wins). Similarly, the opponent's entire subtree is either F(k-1) or F(k-2). Then the total is F(k-1) + (min(F(k-1), F(k-2))) + 1? Actually, no: because the two subtrees are separate and the final game is between the two winners of these subtrees. So the entire tournament has:\n\n            Total players = (players in winner's subtree) + (players in opponent's subtree)\n\n        But note: the winner's subtree already includes the winner, and the opponent's subtree includes the opponent (who is not the same as the winner). So we don't add an extra player.\n\n        However, let me define F(k) as the minimal number of players that can produce a winner with k wins (and the entire tournament). Then:\n\n            F(0) = 1   [the winner hasn't played any game, so no one else? Actually, we have one player (the winner) and no game. But then the tournament is over?]\n\n            F(1) = 2   [two players: the winner and one opponent]\n\n            For k=2:\n                Option: the opponent has 1 win (so the opponent must have beaten someone). Then the opponent's subtree requires F(1)=2, and the winner's subtree requires F(1)=2, so total 4. Alternatively, if the opponent has 0 wins, then the opponent's subtree requires F(0)=1, then total is F(1)+F(0)=2+1=3.\n\n            But wait, in the case of 3 players: \n                First game: two players play (say A and B) and one wins (say A). Then the second game: A plays against C. This is allowed because A has 1 game and C has 0, which is a difference of 1. So the winner (A) has 2 wins. Then F(2)=3.\n\n            However, the condition for the second game: the two players (A and C) have 1 and 0, which is allowed.\n\n            Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n                F(0) = 1\n                F(1) = 2\n\n                For k>=2:\n                    F(k) = F(k-1) + min(F(k-1), F(k-2))\n\n            Then for k=2: F(2)=F(1)+min(F(1),F(0))=2+min(2,1)=2+1=3 -> correct.\n\n            Now, k=3:\n                Option 1: opponent has 2 wins -> then the opponent's subtree needs F(2)=3, and the winner's subtree needs F(2)=3 -> total 6.\n                Option 2: opponent has 1 win -> then the opponent's subtree needs F(1)=2, and the winner's subtree needs F(2)=3 -> total 5.\n\n                But according to recurrence: F(3)=F(2)+min(F(2),F(1))=3+min(3,2)=3+2=5.\n\n            Now, can we have 5 players for k=3?\n                The winner's path: must have 2 wins (so he beat two opponents). The opponent in the final has 1 win (so he beat one opponent). \n\n                Structure:\n\n                  Final: winner (with 2 wins) vs opponent (with 1 win)\n                  How did the winner get 2 wins? He must have two wins. How did the opponent get 1 win?\n\n                  We can break down:\n\n                    First round: two matches? But we have 5 players. Maybe:\n\n                    Round 1: \n                      Match1: Player1 vs Player2 -> winner W1 (has 1 win)\n                      Match2: Player3 vs Player4 -> winner W2 (has 1 win)\n                      Then we have 3 players: W1, W2, and Player5.\n\n                    But wait, the winner (Player1) has to win two games. So in the second round, Player1 would play against, say, W2. Then we have:\n\n                    Round 2: W1 (1 win) vs W2 (1 win) -> winner (say Player1) now has 2 wins, and W2 is eliminated.\n                    Then Round 3: Player1 (2 wins) vs Player5 (0 wins) -> allowed (difference 2? no, 2 and 0 -> difference 2 which is more than 1). So that doesn't work.\n\n                Alternatively, we can arrange:\n\n                    First, we have two groups: one group for the winner and one for the opponent.\n\n                    The winner's group: needs 3 players (to get 2 wins) -> meaning two games (so three players: two eliminated, one winner).\n                    The opponent's group: needs 2 players (to get 1 win) -> meaning one game (so two players: one eliminated, one winner).\n\n                    Then the final: the winner (from the group of 3) and the opponent (from the group of 2). Total players = 3+2 = 5.\n\n                Now, check the condition for the final: the winner has 2 wins, the opponent has 1 win -> difference 1, allowed.\n\n                Then the winner ends with 3 wins (the two wins from his own group and the final). So k=3.\n\n            Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n                F(0) = 1\n                F(1) = 2\n                F(k) = F(k-1) + min(F(k-1), F(k-2))   for k>=2\n\n            But note: the problem does not ask for the minimal number of players for k wins, but given n, we want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n            However, note: the tournament has n players. The winner must come from one of the players, and the entire tournament requires at least F(k) players to have a winner with k wins.\n\n            So we are to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n            But note: the recurrence is defined for k from 0 upwards. We know:\n\n                k=0: F(0)=1\n                k=1: F(1)=2\n                k=2: F(2)=3\n                k=3: F(3)=5\n                k=4: F(4)= F(3)+min(F(3),F(2)) = 5+min(5,3)=5+3=8\n                k=5: F(5)= F(4)+min(F(4),F(3))=8+min(8,5)=8+5=13\n                k=6: F(6)=13+min(13,8)=13+8=21\n\n            This sequence: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,... is similar to Fibonacci numbers.\n\n            In fact, let's write:\n\n                F(0)=1\n                F(1)=2\n                F(2)=3\n                F(3)=5\n                F(4)=8\n\n            So it's like the Fibonacci sequence starting with 1,2.\n\n            We can observe:\n\n                F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)   for k>=2, but with F(0)=1, F(1)=2.\n\n            Then:\n\n                F(0)=1\n                F(1)=2\n                F(2)=3 = 2+1\n                F(3)=5 = 3+2\n                F(4)=8 = 5+3\n                F(5)=13=8+5\n\n            So indeed, F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2) for k>=2.\n\n            Now, we can compute F(k) for k from 0 up until F(k) exceeds n (which can be up to 10^18). Since the sequence grows exponentially (like Fibonacci, which is exponential), we can iterate until we exceed n.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Read n (which is the number of players)\n\n              We are to find the maximum k (number of wins) such that F(k) <= n.\n\n              Note: the winner must have k wins, and we require F(k) <= n.\n\n              However, note: the entire tournament must have n players. The minimal tournament requiring k wins for the winner is F(k). But we can have more than F(k) players? Actually, no: the minimal configuration is F(k). But if we have more players, we can still arrange the tournament so that the winner has k wins? Or maybe we can have a longer path? \n\n              Actually, the problem states: we are to maximize the number of games the winner plays. The condition is that the tournament grid must follow the rule. The minimal requirement to have k wins is F(k) players. If we have more than F(k) players, we can still arrange the tournament so that the winner has k wins (by having extra players that don't affect the winner's path). However, we are allowed to set up the entire tournament arbitrarily (as long as the rule holds). So the winner can have at most k wins if there exists a tournament with at most n players that allows k wins.\n\n              But note: having more players might allow a longer path (more wins). So we are to find the maximum k for which there exists a tournament of n players (meaning we can use up to n players) and the winner can have k wins.\n\n              However, the minimal tournament for k wins is F(k). Therefore, if n >= F(k), then we can have a tournament with k wins. But if n < F(k), then we cannot.\n\n              Therefore, we need to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n            But note: the example input:\n\n                Input: 2 -> Output: 1\n                Input: 3 -> Output: 2\n                Input: 4 -> Output: 2\n                Input: 10 -> Output: 4\n\n            Let's check:\n\n                n=2: k=1 -> F(1)=2 <=2 -> so k=1 is valid. k=2: F(2)=3>2 -> so maximum k=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n                n=3: k=1: 2<=3, k=2:3<=3 -> valid. k=3:5>3 -> so maximum k=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\n                n=4: k=1:2<=4, k=2:3<=4, k=3:5>4 -> so maximum k=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\n                n=10: k=1:2<=10, k=2:3<=10, k=3:5<=10, k=4:8<=10, k=5:13>10 -> so maximum k=4 -> output 4. Correct.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n              We will generate the Fibonacci-like sequence until the value exceeds n.\n\n              We start with:\n                 a0 = 1 (k=0)\n                 a1 = 2 (k=1)\n\n              Then for k>=2: a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2}\n\n              We are to find the maximum k such that a_k <= n.\n\n            However, note: k=0 corresponds to 0 wins (which is not typical for a tournament winner) but our winner must win at least one game? Actually, if n=1, then the winner has 0 wins. But the problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry about n=1.\n\n            But note: the examples start from n=2.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Let a0 = 1, a1 = 2.\n              Let k = 0\n              Let sequence = [a0, a1]\n\n              Then while the next term (a_{k+2}) <= n:\n                  a_{k+2} = a_{k+1} + a_k\n                  k += 1\n\n              Then the maximum k is the last index for which the term is <= n.\n\n              However, note: we are counting k (the number of wins) and the sequence index corresponds to k.\n\n              But wait: our sequence index i corresponds to k=i.\n\n              We can do:\n\n                k = 0: term = 1\n                k = 1: term = 2\n                k = 2: term = 3\n                k = 3: term = 5\n                ...\n\n              We are to return the k (the index) for the last term <= n.\n\n              However, note: the example n=2: \n                k=0: 1<=2 -> valid\n                k=1: 2<=2 -> valid\n                k=2: 3>2 -> stop. Then the maximum k is 1.\n\n              So we return 1.\n\n            But wait: the number of wins is the index k? \n\n              k=0 -> 0 wins\n              k=1 -> 1 win\n              k=2 -> 2 wins\n\n            So the answer is the index k (the number of wins).\n\n            However, note: the problem says the winner must win all his games. The number of wins is the number of games he played.\n\n            Therefore, we need to output k (the index) for the last term <= n.\n\n            But note: the example n=3: \n                k=0: 1<=3 -> yes\n                k=1: 2<=3 -> yes\n                k=2: 3<=3 -> yes\n                k=3: 5>3 -> stop. Then the maximum k is 2.\n\n            So we output 2.\n\n            Implementation:\n\n              We'll use two variables to hold the last two terms, and we'll iterate until the next term exceeds n.\n\n              Steps:\n\n                if n==1: then answer 0 (but n>=2, so skip)\n                Let a = 1   # k0\n                Let b = 2   # k1\n                Let k = 1   # because we have at least one win (b=2 corresponds to 1 win)\n\n                Then we want to iterate to find the next term: c = a + b.\n\n                We are to count the wins (k) for which the term is <= n.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  k0: 1 <= n -> count k0 (wins=0) is valid, but we are looking for maximum wins (so we need the highest k such that F(k)<=n). We are including k0, k1, ... until we exceed.\n\n                Actually, we are to return the maximum k (the index) for which F(k)<=n.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  count = 0\n                  a_prev2 = 1   # F(0)\n                  a_prev1 = 2   # F(1)\n                  k = 1\n\n                  while a_prev1 <= n:   # we are at k=1 (which is 2) and we want to check k=1, then k=2, etc.\n                    count = k   # because we are at k (the current k) and the value is a_prev1 (which is F(k)) and it is <=n, so candidate.\n\n                    Then update for the next k: \n                    next_term = a_prev2 + a_prev1\n                    if next_term > n:\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        a_prev2 = a_prev1\n                        a_prev1 = next_term\n                        k += 1\n\n                But wait, this way we are counting the wins (k) and updating the sequence.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  a0 = 1\n                  a1 = 2\n                  while True:\n                    if a1 <= n:\n                        k = 1   # because we are at k=1 (the last term is 2) and we want to remember the maximum k (which is the index) that satisfies the condition.\n                        # But then we update for k=2: a2 = a0+a1 = 1+2=3\n                        # Then set a0 = a1, a1 = a2, and k becomes 2.\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n                Then we output k.\n\n                However, we want to remember the maximum k (the index) for which F(k)<=n.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  a, b = 1, 2\n                  k = 1\n                  while b <= n:\n                      # Then we can go to the next k?\n                      a, b = b, a+b\n                      k += 1\n\n                Then when we break, k is the next k that would exceed n, so the maximum k is k-1.\n\n                But wait:\n\n                  Start: a=1, b=2, k=1 -> condition: 2<=n (if n>=2, then true). Then update: a=2, b=3, k=2 -> then check 3<=n? if yes, then update again: a=3, b=5, k=3 -> then check 5<=n? ...\n\n                Then when we break, we break at k such that the current b (which is the next term) is greater than n. Then the last valid k was k-1.\n\n                Example n=2:\n\n                  Start: a=1, b=2, k=1 -> condition: 2<=2 -> enter loop.\n                  Then set a=2, b=3, k=2 -> then check 3<=2? -> no, break.\n                  Then we output k-1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n                Example n=3:\n\n                  Start: a=1, b=2, k=1 -> 2<=3 -> enter.\n                  Then a=2, b=3, k=2 -> 3<=3 -> enter.\n                  Then a=3, b=5, k=3 -> 5<=3 -> false, break.\n                  Output k-1=2 -> correct.\n\n                Example n=4:\n\n                  Start: a=1, b=2, k=1 -> 2<=4 -> enter.\n                  Then a=2, b=3, k=2 -> 3<=4 -> enter.\n                  Then a=3, b=5, k=3 -> 5<=4 -> false, break.\n                  Output k-1=2 -> correct.\n\n                Example n=10:\n\n                  Start: a=1, b=2, k=1 -> 2<=10 -> enter -> a=2, b=3, k=2\n                  Then a=3, b=5, k=3 -> 5<=10 -> enter -> a=5, b=8, k=4\n                  Then a=8, b=13, k=5 -> 13<=10 -> false, break.\n                  Output k-1=4 -> correct.\n\n            However, note: the sequence is defined for k=0,1,2,... and we are using the terms for k=1,2,... and we break when the next term (which would be k+1) exceeds n, then the answer is the last k (which is k-1, because we just incremented k and then checked the new b for the next term). But wait, in our code we are checking the current b (which is the term for k) and then updating for the next term (k+1) and incrementing k.\n\n            Actually, let me restructure:\n\n                We are storing:\n                  a = F(k-2)   [when k is the current index we are considering?]\n                  b = F(k-1)   [current term is for index k-1?]\n\n                Actually, we started with:\n                  k=1: then we have a=F(0)=1, b=F(1)=2.\n\n                Then we update:\n                  k=2: a = F(1)=2, b = F(2)=3.\n\n                Then k=3: a = F(2)=3, b = F(3)=5.\n\n                Then we break when b (which is F(k)) > n, then the last valid k is k-1 (which is the previous index) and the term for k-1 is <=n, but the term for k is >n.\n\n            But note: we are checking the condition at the beginning of the loop? Actually, we check the condition for the current b (which is F(k-1)) and then update to get F(k) and then k becomes k+1.\n\n            Alternatively, we can avoid confusion by keeping track of the index separately.\n\n            Since n can be as large as 10^18, we cannot iterate too many times (the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so we will iterate about 100 times at most).\n\n            Code:\n\n              n = int(input().strip())\n\n              # If n is 1, then answer 0 (but n>=2, so we don't need to handle n=1)\n              if n == 1:\n                  print(0)\n                  exit(0)\n\n              # Start with the first two terms\n              a, b = 1, 2\n              k = 1   # we are currently at the term for k=1 (which is 2)\n\n              # We'll iterate until the next term exceeds n\n              while True:\n                  # Check the current term (b) for k (which is the current index) is <= n\n                  if b > n:\n                      break\n\n                  # Then we can have at least k wins (because k is the index of the term we just checked, and the term is F(k)=b)\n                  # Then we update for the next term and next k.\n                  a, b = b, a + b\n                  k += 1\n\n              # Then the maximum wins is k-1, because the last valid term was at k-1 (which is the term we just computed as exceeding n, so we break without including the last update in k).\n              # But wait: when we break, we haven't updated k for the term that exceeded n. The last update was for the next term and we incremented k. Then we break.\n\n              Actually, let's simulate for n=2:\n\n                Initially: a=1, b=2, k=1.\n                Condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n                Then update: a=2, b=3, k=2.\n                Then check: 3<=2 -> false, break.\n\n                Then we break and output k-1 = 1. Correct.\n\n              But wait, the above code does the update and then checks the condition for the next term in the next iteration. Actually, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. But note: the initial condition is for the first term (k=1). Then we update to get the next term (k=2) and then the condition is checked for the next term (k=2) in the next iteration.\n\n              Alternatively, we can change the order: check the current term, then update to get the next term and then set k to the next index.\n\n            Let me rewrite without changing the variable names:\n\n              We want to know the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n              We can iterate:\n\n                k0: F0 = 1 -> valid (k0=0)\n                k1: F1 = 2 -> valid (k1=1)\n                k2: F2 = 3 -> valid (k2=2) if n>=3\n                ...\n\n              We are storing the last two terms. We can do:\n\n                count = 0\n                a, b = 1, 2\n                # k0 and k1 are already set.\n\n                # We want to check from k=0 to as long as the term is <=n.\n\n                # But note: we are asked for the maximum number of wins (which is k, the index). The index k=0 means 0 wins, k=1 means 1 win, etc.\n\n                # We can start by checking the current term (which is for k=1) and then update.\n\n                # Instead, we can do:\n\n                #   We know that k=0 is always valid (if n>=1) but the problem says n>=2, so we don't need to consider k=0 as the maximum? Actually, we are to find the maximum k (wins) and k=0 is 0 wins, but the winner must have at least one win (unless there is only one player, which is not the case). \n\n                # But note: the tournament with 2 players: the winner has 1 win. So k=1 is the maximum.\n\n                # How do we include k=0?\n\n                # Actually, the sequence is defined for k=0,1,2,... and the minimal tournament for k wins is F(k). We want the maximum k (wins) such that F(k)<=n.\n\n                # We can start from k=0 and then k=1, etc.\n\n                # However, the problem does not require to consider k=0 as the answer (because the winner must win at least one game). But the recurrence naturally includes k=0.\n\n                # Since n>=2, the minimal k for which F(k)<=n is k=0 and k=1. But we want the maximum k.\n\n            Let me adjust the code to start from k=0 and then k=1, and then update until we exceed.\n\n            But note: the example n=2: the maximum k is 1.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                k = 0\n                a_prev2 = 1   # F(0)\n                a_prev1 = 2   # F(1) -> but wait, if k=0, then we have F(0)=1, and then F(1)=2.\n\n                Then we want to check for k=0: 1<=n -> valid, then k=1: 2<=n -> valid, then k=2: 3<=n -> invalid for n=2.\n\n            We can iterate by k from 0 to ... and use two variables to store the last two.\n\n            Since the problem states n>=2, we can do:\n\n                k = 0\n                a0 = 1\n                a1 = 2\n\n                Then while a1 <= n:\n                    # Then we can have at least k=1 wins (which is the current a1) and then we want to compute the next term for k=2.\n                    a0, a1 = a1, a0+a1\n                    k += 1\n\n                Then the answer is k-1.\n\n            Why? Because when we break, we break when a1 (the next term) exceeds n. But note: we are updating a0 and a1 and then k is incremented. Then we break and then we output k-1.\n\n            Example n=2:\n\n                k=0, a0=1, a1=2 -> condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n                Then update: a0=2, a1=3, k=1.\n                Then condition: 3<=2 -> false, break.\n                Then output k-1 = 0 -> which is wrong.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                k = 0\n                a0 = 1\n                a1 = 2\n\n                while a1 <= n:\n                    # Then the current k (which is the index for a1) is valid, so we can update to the next k.\n                    a0, a1 = a1, a0+a1\n                    k += 1\n\n                Then output k.\n\n            But wait, in this case, we break when a1 (the term for k+1) is > n, then the last valid k was the previous one? \n\n            Actually, we are updating the state and then increasing k. Then the last valid term was the one we just updated to (a1) and then we break because the next term (which we didn't compute) would exceed n? \n\n            Let me simulate n=2:\n\n                Start: k=0, a0=1, a1=2 -> condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n                Then update: a0=2, a1=3, k=1 -> then condition: 3<=2 -> false, so we break and output k=1.\n\n            But wait, the condition is checked for the current a1 (which is the term for k=1). Then we update and set k=1, then check the next term (which is 3) for k=2? Actually, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop for the current a1 (which is the term for the current k). Then we update to the next term (for k+1) and then k becomes k+1, and then we check the next term at the next iteration.\n\n            Actually, the code above updates and then increments k, then checks the updated a1 (which is the term for the next k) in the next iteration. \n\n            We want to check the current term (which is stored in a1) and then update to the next term and then set k to the next index.\n\n            Alternatively, we can check the current term, then update and then set k to the next index, and then check the next term in the next iteration.\n\n            Let me try:\n\n                k = 0\n                a0 = 1\n                a1 = 2\n\n                while True:\n                    if a1 > n:\n                        break\n                    # Then the current term (a1) is valid for k (which is the index of a1) -> so we can say the maximum k is at least k (the index of a1) but note: we are storing a0=F(k-1) and a1=F(k) for k being the current index.\n\n                    # Actually, we are storing:\n                    #   a0 = F(k-2)\n                    #   a1 = F(k-1)\n\n                    # Then we update to get F(k) and then set k to k+1.\n\n                    # But wait, initially: k=0, then a0=F(-2) doesn't make sense.\n\n            Let me redefine:\n\n                Let k = 1 (for the first term a1=2, which is F(1))\n                Then we have:\n                    a_prev2 = F(0)=1\n                    a_prev1 = F(1)=2\n\n                Then the while condition is: while a_prev1 <= n:\n                    Then we compute next_term = a_prev2 + a_prev1\n                    Then we set a_prev2 = a_prev1\n                    Then we set a_prev1 = next_term\n                    Then k += 1   [because we are",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows specific rules. The key insight is recognizing that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence, where each term represents the minimal number of players required for a winner to have a certain number of wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured such that each game eliminates one player, and the winner must win all their games. The constraint is that two players can only compete if their number of previous games differs by at most one. This leads us to model the problem using a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term represents the minimal number of players needed for a winner to achieve a certain number of wins.\n2. **Sequence Generation**: The sequence starts with `F(0) = 1` (no wins) and `F(1) = 2` (one win). For subsequent terms, `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`, which is analogous to the Fibonacci sequence but initialized differently.\n3. **Finding Maximum Wins**: Given the number of players `n`, we generate terms of the sequence until the term exceeds `n`. The highest index `k` for which the term `F(k) <= n` gives the maximum number of wins the winner can have.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a0 = 1\n    a1 = 2\n    k = 1\n    \n    while a1 <= n:\n        a0, a1 = a1, a0 + a1\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input `n`, which is the number of players. If `n` is 1, it prints 0 since no games are played.\n2. **Sequence Generation**: The variables `a0` and `a1` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the first two terms of the sequence (`F(0)` and `F(1)`). The variable `k` keeps track of the current term's index.\n3. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as the current term (`a1`) is less than or equal to `n`. In each iteration, the next term is computed as the sum of the previous two terms (`a0 + a1`), and `k` is incremented.\n4. **Output**: Once the loop exits, the value `k - 1` is printed, which is the highest index for which the term was within the limit `n`, corresponding to the maximum number of wins the winner can have.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` (up to 10^18).",
