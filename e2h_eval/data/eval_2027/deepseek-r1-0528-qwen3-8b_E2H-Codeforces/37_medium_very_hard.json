    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array `a` of n distinct integers (n between 1 and 22). We need to output a permutation `b` of `a` such that for every non-empty proper subset S of the indices, the sum of elements in `a` at these indices is different from the sum of elements in `b` at these same indices.\n\n Note: The empty subset and the full set are excluded.\n\n Observation:\n Since the array `b` is just a permutation of `a`, the multiset of elements is fixed. However, the condition is about the sums over subsets (with the same indices) being different.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let A_S = sum_{i in S} a_i\n   Let B_S = sum_{i in S} b_i\n\n Condition: For every non-empty proper subset S, A_S != B_S.\n\n Another way to think: We are assigning each element of `a` to a position in `b`. The condition must hold for every subset of indices.\n\n Since the problem constraints are small (n <= 22), we might consider generating permutations and checking, but 22! is too big.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Consider what happens if we try to assign the smallest numbers to one part and the largest to another? Or perhaps use two interleaving sequences?\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: [1, 2] -> Output: [2, 1]\n\n In this case, the subsets of indices (positions) are:\n   {0}: then A_0 = 1, B_0 = 2 -> 1 != 2 -> okay.\n   {1}: then A_1 = 2, B_1 = 1 -> 2 != 1 -> okay.\n   The full set and empty set are excluded.\n\n But wait, the problem says non-empty and not the full set. So for n=2, we have two single-element subsets.\n\n Now consider n=3. Let a = [1,2,3]. What could be a permutation?\n\n Example: b = [3, 1, 2]\n\n Check all non-empty proper subsets (which are the singletons and the two-element subsets):\n\n Singletons:\n   S={0}: 1 vs 3 -> ok.\n   S={1}: 2 vs 1 -> ok.\n   S={2}: 3 vs 2 -> ok.\n\n Two-element subsets:\n   S={0,1}: 1+2 = 3 vs 3+1 = 4 -> ok.\n   S={0,2}: 1+3 = 4 vs 3+2 = 5 -> ok.\n   S={1,2}: 2+3 = 5 vs 1+2 = 3 -> ok.\n\n So [3,1,2] works.\n\n But note: the problem says \"if there is no such array, print -1\". So we must check whether it exists.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the array has distinct integers.\n\n How to solve?\n\n One idea: We know that the condition must hold for all subsets. This is very strong.\n\n Another idea: Consider the entire set of all subsets. The condition is that the set {A_S : S non-empty proper subset} and {B_S : S non-empty proper subset} are disjoint.\n\n But note: the entire set is excluded, so we don't require that the total sum of a and b are different (they are the same, because b is a permutation). Similarly, the empty set is excluded.\n\n However, note that the condition is only on the same set of indices. But wait: the set of indices is fixed. The array b is a permutation, so the assignment of numbers to indices matters.\n\n Actually, the condition is: for each subset S (non-empty and not the whole set), the sum of a over S is not equal to the sum of b over S.\n\n We can also note that the condition must hold for every contiguous set? No, just every subset.\n\n Another observation: The problem is equivalent to saying that the mapping from the index set to the values must be such that the induced linear form (the sum over any subset) is injective for the sets that are not the entire set and the empty set.\n\n However, we can use the following known fact:\n\n There exists a permutation b of a such that the condition holds if and only if we can assign the numbers to positions in a way that avoids having the same subset-sum for a and b.\n\n Known approach: \n   One known construction for similar problems (like avoiding equal subset sums) is to use two different orderings. However, note our condition is over the same set of indices.\n\n Let's consider the following:\n\n   Let us split the set of indices into two parts: left and right. Then assign the larger half of the numbers to one part and the smaller to the other, but then we must ensure that for every subset S, the sum of the original a over S is not equal to the sum of the original a over the complement? Actually, note: the condition is for the same set of indices.\n\n Alternatively, consider:\n\n   We are going to assign the numbers arbitrarily to the positions. The condition is that for every subset S (non-empty and not the entire set), the sum of the a's in S is not equal to the sum of the b's in S.\n\n   But note: the array b is a permutation of a. Therefore, the multiset of the entire array is the same. However, the assignment to indices is arbitrary.\n\n   Let T be the set of indices. Then the condition must hold for every non-empty proper subset S.\n\n   We can also think: what if we assign the numbers in decreasing order? Or increasing order? \n\n   Let me try with n=3: [1,2,3] -> increasing: [1,2,3]\n        Check subset {0}: 1 vs 1 -> same? Actually, wait: if we assign [1,2,3] then the array b is [1,2,3]. Then for S={0}: 1==1 -> fails.\n\n   So the identity permutation fails.\n\n   Another try: reverse [3,2,1]\n        S={0}: 1 vs 3 -> ok.\n        S={1}: 2 vs 2 -> fails.\n\n   So the reverse also fails.\n\n   We tried [3,1,2] above and it worked.\n\n   How did [3,1,2] work?\n\n   Let's break down [3,1,2] for a=[1,2,3]:\n\n     Original a: [1,2,3] and b: [3,1,2]\n\n     Subsets of size 1:\n        {0}: 1 vs 3 -> ok.\n        {1}: 2 vs 1 -> ok.\n        {2}: 3 vs 2 -> ok.\n\n     Subsets of size 2:\n        {0,1}: 1+2=3 vs 3+1=4 -> ok.\n        {0,2}: 1+3=4 vs 3+2=5 -> ok.\n        {1,2}: 2+3=5 vs 1+2=3 -> ok.\n\n   Why did this work? The key is that the two-element subsets are all distinct and none of them equals the corresponding two-element subset from a.\n\n   But note: the two-element subset {0,1} in a gives 3, and in b gives 4. Similarly, {0,2} gives 4 and in b 5, and {1,2} gives 5 and in b 3.\n\n   Also, note that the entire set is excluded, so we don't require that the total (6) is different from 6? Actually, the condition excludes the entire set. So the total doesn't matter.\n\n   However, note that the condition also requires that the subset sums for the same indices are different. The same indices: the set of indices is fixed. In our example, the set of indices is fixed: the array b is assigned to the same indices as a.\n\n   So the condition is: for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of the elements in a at the positions in S is not equal to the sum of the elements in b at the positions in S.\n\n   How can we generalize?\n\n   Idea: We want to assign the numbers to the positions such that the ordering is \"mixed\". One common trick in such problems is to assign the numbers in an alternating pattern (like even and odd indices) but that may not work.\n\n   Another idea: Use the concept of \"rainbow\" or \"greedy\" assignment by sorting and then swapping some elements.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the problem is known to be solvable for n>=2, except when n=1 (then the only non-empty proper subset is the empty set and the full set? Actually, for n=1: the non-empty proper subsets are none because the only non-empty subset is the full set (which is excluded) and the empty set is excluded. So for n=1, the condition is vacuously true. Then we can output the array itself.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"every non-empty subset\" and then \"not the full set\", so for n=1 there are no subsets to check. Therefore, we can output any permutation (which is the array itself).\n\n   However, let me read the problem again: \"for every non-empty subset S (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 <k<n)\" — so k must be at least 1 and less than n. For n=1, k must be between 1 and 0, which is impossible. So no subsets. So condition holds.\n\n   So we can output the array in any order (including the original) for n=1.\n\n   Now, for n>=2, we need to find a permutation.\n\n   Known fact: The problem is similar to the \"Array Permutation\" problem where we avoid having the same subset-sum for the same set of indices.\n\n   After research, note that one known solution is to use the following:\n\n      Sort the array, then assign the first ceil(n/2) elements to the even indices (0-indexed) and the remaining to the odd indices, but then interleave appropriately? \n\n   However, let's try with n=4: [1,2,3,4]\n\n   Example solution: \n        Let me try: [4,1,3,2]\n\n        Check:\n          Singletons:\n            {0}: 1 vs 4 -> ok.\n            {1}: 2 vs 1 -> ok.\n            {2}: 3 vs 3 -> fails.\n\n        Another try: [4,3,2,1] -> then {0}: 1 vs 4, {1}: 2 vs 3, {2}: 3 vs 2, {3}:4 vs 1 -> all ok for singletons?\n          But two-element subsets:\n            {0,1}: 1+2=3 vs 4+3=7 -> ok.\n            {0,2}: 1+3=4 vs 4+2=6 -> ok.\n            {0,3}: 1+4=5 vs 4+1=5 -> fails.\n\n        Another try: [4,1,2,3] -> \n          Singletons: {0}:1 vs4, {1}:2 vs1, {2}:3 vs2, {3}:4 vs3 -> ok.\n          Two-element: \n            {0,1}: 1+2=3 vs 4+1=5 -> ok.\n            {0,2}: 1+3=4 vs 4+2=6 -> ok.\n            {0,3}: 1+4=5 vs 4+3=7 -> ok.\n            {1,2}: 2+3=5 vs 1+2=3 -> ok.\n            {1,3}: 2+4=6 vs 1+3=4 -> ok.\n            {2,3}: 3+4=7 vs 2+3=5 -> ok.\n\n        So [4,1,2,3] works for n=4.\n\n        How is [4,1,2,3] constructed? \n          It's almost sorted in descending order, but the two smallest are put in the middle?\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          Place the largest element at the beginning, then the smallest, then the next largest, then the next smallest? \n\n        But in [4,1,2,3]: \n          Start with 4 (largest), then 1 (smallest), then 2 (next largest? but 3 is bigger than 2) — wait, no: the array is [4,1,2,3] — so after 1 we have 2 and then 3. \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let's sort the array: [1,2,3,4]\n          Then we take the largest, then the smallest, then the next largest, then the next smallest, etc.\n\n          For n=4: \n            Step1: take 4 (largest)\n            Step2: take 1 (smallest)\n            Step3: take 3 (next largest)\n            Step4: take 2 (next smallest)\n\n          Then we get [4,1,3,2] — which we saw fails because {2}: 3 vs 3.\n\n        So that doesn't work.\n\n        But [4,1,2,3] is not generated by that method.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe:\n\n          Place the largest element at the beginning, then the rest in increasing order? \n          [4,1,2,3] — yes, that is: largest, then the rest in increasing order.\n\n        Let me test with n=3: \n          Largest is 3, then the rest [1,2] in increasing order: [3,1,2] — which we already know works.\n\n        And n=2: \n          Largest is 2, then the rest [1] in increasing order: [2,1] — which is the example.\n\n        So the construction: \n          Sort the array: [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}] (ascending)\n          Then set b[0] = a_{n-1}\n          Then set b[1:] = a[0:n-1] (in ascending order)\n\n        Let's test for n=4: [10,20,30,40] (if we have distinct integers)\n\n          Then b = [40, 10,20,30]\n\n          Check singletons:\n            {0}: 10 vs 40 -> ok.\n            {1}: 20 vs 10 -> ok.\n            {2}: 30 vs 20 -> ok.\n            {3}: 40 vs 30 -> ok.\n\n          Two-element subsets:\n            {0,1}: 10+20=30 vs 40+10=50 -> ok.\n            {0,2}: 10+30=40 vs 40+20=60 -> ok.\n            {0,3}: 10+40=50 vs 40+30=70 -> ok.\n            {1,2}: 20+30=50 vs 10+20=30 -> ok.\n            {1,3}: 20+40=60 vs 10+30=40 -> ok.\n            {2,3}: 30+40=70 vs 20+30=50 -> ok.\n\n        It works.\n\n        Why does this construction work?\n\n        Let me denote the sorted array a as [x0, x1, ..., x_{n-1}] (so x0 < x1 < ... < x_{n-1})\n        Then b = [x_{n-1}, x0, x1, ..., x_{n-2}]\n\n        The condition for a singleton {i} (for i>=1): \n          a[i] = x_{i-1} (if i>=1) and b[i] = x_{i-2} for i>=2? Actually, indexing:\n\n          Position 0: a0 = x0, b0 = x_{n-1}\n          Position 1: a1 = x1, b1 = x0\n          Position 2: a2 = x2, b2 = x1\n          ...\n          Position i (for i from 1 to n-1): a_i = x_i, b_i = x_{i-1}\n\n        Then for a singleton {i} (with i>=1):\n          A_S = x_i\n          B_S = x_{i-1}\n\n        Since the array is strictly increasing (distinct), x_i != x_{i-1} for all i>=1.\n\n        Now for a two-element subset {i, j} (without loss of generality, assume i<j):\n\n          Case 1: i=0 (the first element) and j>=1:\n            A_S = x0 + x_j\n            B_S = x_{n-1} + x_{j-1}\n\n            We must have x0+x_j != x_{n-1}+x_{j-1}.\n\n          Since x0 < x1 < ... < x_{n-1}, and j>=1, then j-1 < j, so x_{j-1} < x_j.\n\n          Also, x_{n-1} is the maximum, so x_{n-1} >= x_j (actually x_{n-1} > x_j because distinct and j<=n-1, and if j=n-1 then x_{n-1}=x_{n-1} and x_{j-1}=x_{n-2}).\n\n          Then x_{n-1}+x_{j-1} >= x_{n-1} + (some value) and x0+x_j is relatively small.\n\n          We must ensure that for every j from 1 to n-1: \n            x0 + x_j != x_{n-1} + x_{j-1}\n\n          Rearranged: x_j - x_{j-1} != x_{n-1} - x0\n\n          Note that the left side is the difference between consecutive elements (which are positive and increasing) and the right side is the entire range.\n\n          Since the consecutive differences are at most (max difference between consecutive) and the entire range is the sum of consecutive differences, we have:\n\n          The consecutive differences are positive and the entire range (x_{n-1}-x0) is the sum of consecutive differences.\n\n          So unless we have only two elements, the consecutive differences are positive and the equation x_j - x_{j-1} = x_{n-1} - x0 would require that the consecutive difference is the entire range. But the consecutive differences are typically much smaller than the entire range (unless n=2).\n\n          Let's test for n=2: \n            Then the condition for {0,1}: \n                A_S = x0+x1\n                B_S = x1+x0 -> same? \n            Wait, no: for n=2, our construction: \n                a = [x0, x1] (sorted)\n                b = [x1, x0]\n\n                Then the entire set is excluded, so we don't check {0,1}. But we check the singletons, which we already did.\n\n            However, note: the condition also includes two-element subsets for n>=3. For n=2, the two-element subset is the entire set, so it is excluded.\n\n          So for n>=3, we have to check two-element subsets that include the first element and one other.\n\n          Example for n=3: \n            a = [1,2,3] -> b = [3,1,2]\n            Check {0,1}: 1+2=3, 3+1=4 -> ok.\n            Check {0,2}: 1+3=4, 3+2=5 -> ok.\n\n          Now, let's see if the condition x_j - x_{j-1} != x_{n-1} - x0 holds for all j from 1 to n-1.\n\n          For n=3: \n            j=1: x1 - x0 = 2-1=1, x_{2}-x0=3-1=2 -> 1 !=2 -> holds.\n            j=2: x2 - x1 = 3-2=1, x_{2}-x0=2 -> 1!=2 -> holds.\n\n          For n=4: \n            a = [10,20,30,40] -> b = [40,10,20,30]\n            Check two-element subsets including the first element (index0) and others.\n\n            j=1: 10+20=30, 40+10=50 -> 20-10=10, 40-10=30 -> 10 !=30 -> holds.\n            j=2: 10+30=40, 40+20=60 -> 30-20=10, 30 !=60? Actually, we are comparing 40 vs 60, and 10 !=30 -> holds.\n            j=3: 10+40=50, 40+30=70 -> 40-30=10, 30 !=50? Actually, we are comparing 50 vs 70, and 10 !=30 -> holds.\n\n          Now, consider two-element subsets that do not include the first element.\n\n          Example: {i,j} where i,j>=1.\n\n          Then A_S = x_i + x_j\n          B_S = x_{i-1} + x_{j-1}\n\n          We require x_i + x_j != x_{i-1} + x_{j-1}\n\n          Rearranged: x_i - x_{i-1} != x_{j-1} - x_j   [but note: i,j>=1, so the positions are from 1 to n-1, and the array b at these positions is the original sorted array without the last element? Actually, b from index1 to end is the sorted array from index0 to index n-2.\n\n          Actually, the array b is [x_{n-1}, x0, x1, ..., x_{n-2}]\n\n          So for indices i and j (>=1), the elements in b are:\n            At position i: x_{i-1}\n            At position j: x_{j-1}\n\n          Then the sum for S (with indices i and j) is x_{i-1} + x_{j-1}.\n\n          The sum for a is x_i + x_j.\n\n          Condition: x_i + x_j != x_{i-1} + x_{j-1}\n\n          Note: i and j are at least 1 and at most n-1.\n\n          We can write: x_i - x_{i-1} != x_{j-1} - x_j   [But wait: rearranged from x_i + x_j != x_{i-1} + x_{j-1} -> x_i - x_{i-1} != -(x_j - x_{j-1}) ? Not exactly.\n\n          Actually, we have: x_i + x_j != x_{i-1} + x_{j-1}  <=>  (x_i - x_{i-1}) + (x_j - x_{j-1}) != 0.\n\n          But note: the differences (x_i - x_{i-1}) and (x_j - x_{j-1}) are both positive (since the array is increasing). So their sum is positive, and cannot be zero. Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n          However, wait: the condition is automatically satisfied for two-element subsets that do not include the first element? \n\n          But note: the indices in the two-element subset are the same as the original indices. In the array b, the first element is taken from the largest, and the rest are the sorted array from smallest to second largest.\n\n          Actually, let me reindex the array a:\n\n            Original a: [x0, x1, x2, ..., x_{n-1}]\n            Then b: [x_{n-1}, x0, x1, x2, ..., x_{n-2}]\n\n          Now, for two indices i and j (both >=1) in the original array, the value at index i in b is x_{i-1} (because the original a's x0 goes to index1, x1 to index2, etc.). \n\n          So the condition for the two-element subset {i, j} (i<j, and both>=1) is:\n\n            a_i + a_j = x_i + x_j\n            b_i + b_j = x_{i-1} + x_{j-1}\n\n          We require x_i + x_j != x_{i-1} + x_{j-1}.\n\n          Since the array is strictly increasing, we have:\n            x_i > x_{i-1} and x_j > x_{j-1} (because j>=1, so j-1>=0, and the array is sorted). But note: i and j are at least 1, so x_i and x_j are at least x1 and x2.\n\n          However, the difference x_i - x_{i-1} is the gap at position i, and similarly for j. The condition is that the sum of the two gaps (from the two positions) is not zero? Actually, we have:\n\n            x_i + x_j - (x_{i-1} + x_{j-1}) = (x_i - x_{i-1}) + (x_j - x_{j-1}) > 0\n\n          So the condition always holds for two-element subsets that do not include the first element.\n\n          Now, what about subsets of size>=3? \n\n          Example: n=3, subset {0,1,2} is excluded (full set). But what about {0,1} and {0,2} we already checked, and {1,2} we checked.\n\n          For n=4, the three-element subsets are excluded? Actually, no: the problem says non-empty and not the full set. For n=4, the three-element subsets are not the full set (which is four) so they are included.\n\n          We must check three-element subsets for n=4.\n\n          Example: a = [10,20,30,40], b=[40,10,20,30]\n\n          Three-element subsets that include the first element (index0) and two others.\n\n          {0,1,2}: \n            A_S = 10+20+30 = 60\n            B_S = 40+10+20 = 70 -> ok.\n\n          {0,1,3}:\n            A_S = 10+20+40=70\n            B_S = 40+10+30=80 -> ok.\n\n          {0,2,3}:\n            A_S = 10+30+40=80\n            B_S = 40+20+30=90 -> ok.\n\n          Now, three-element subsets that do not include the first element (index0)?\n\n          {1,2,3}:\n            A_S = 20+30+40=90\n            B_S = 10+20+30=60 -> ok.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          But wait, is this always true? \n\n          For a general subset S (non-empty and not the entire set) we have:\n\n          Let S be a subset of indices. We break S into two parts: \n            Part1: indices that are 0 (the first element) and indices that are >=1.\n\n          Then the sum in a for S is:\n            If 0 is in S, then we add x0 (the smallest) and then for each index i>=1 in S, we add x_i.\n            If 0 is not in S, then we add the elements from a at indices in S, which are x_i for i in S (and these indices are from 1 to n-1).\n\n          Similarly, the sum in b for S is:\n            If 0 is in S, then we add x_{n-1} (the largest) and for each index i>=1 in S, we add x_{i-1}.\n            If 0 is not in S, then we add the elements from b at indices in S, which are the sorted array from index0 to index n-2 (so x0, x1, ..., x_{n-2}) but wait, no: the array b is [x_{n-1}, x0, x1, ..., x_{n-2}]. So the element at index i (for i>=1) is x_{i-1}.\n\n          Actually, the array b at index i (for i>=1) is x_{i-1}. \n\n          Therefore, the entire array b is:\n\n            b[0] = x_{n-1}\n            b[1] = x_0\n            b[2] = x_1\n            ...\n            b[n-1] = x_{n-2}\n\n          Then for any subset S, the sum in a is:\n            If 0 in S: x0 + sum_{i in S, i>=1} x_i\n            Else: sum_{i in S} x_i   [but note: the indices in S are from 1 to n-1, and the value at index i is x_i, so the sum is sum_{i in S} x_i]\n\n          The sum in b is:\n            If 0 in S: x_{n-1} + sum_{i in S, i>=1} x_{i-1}\n            Else: sum_{i in S} x_{i-1}   [because for each index i in S (which is at least 1), the element is x_{i-1}]\n\n          Now, we must show that for every non-empty proper subset S, the two sums are different.\n\n          Let S be a subset that contains the first element (0). Then:\n\n            A_S = x0 + sum_{i in S, i>=1} x_i\n            B_S = x_{n-1} + sum_{i in S, i>=1} x_{i-1}\n\n          We can write:\n\n            A_S - B_S = x0 + sum_{i in S, i>=1} x_i - [x_{n-1} + sum_{i in S, i>=1} x_{i-1}]\n                     = (x0 - x_{n-1}) + sum_{i in S, i>=1} (x_i - x_{i-1})\n\n          Since x0 < x_{n-1}, the term (x0 - x_{n-1}) is negative. The sum is the sum of the gaps (differences) for the indices in S (excluding 0). Each gap (x_i - x_{i-1}) is positive. However, the entire expression might be zero? \n\n          Example: n=3, S={0,1} (the first element and the second element, index1). Then:\n\n            A_S = 10 + 20 = 30\n            B_S = 30 + 10 = 40   (if a=[10,20,30] then x0=10, x1=20, x2=30; then b0=30, b1=10, b2=20)\n\n            Then A_S - B_S = 10 + 20 - (30 + 10) = 30 - 40 = -10.\n\n          Now, consider S={0,2} (the first and the third element, index2):\n\n            A_S = 10 + 30 = 40\n            B_S = 30 + 20 = 50\n            Difference = 40-50 = -10.\n\n          Now, consider S={0,1,2} (the entire set) is excluded.\n\n          Now, what if we consider a subset S that does not contain the first element? Then:\n\n            A_S = sum_{i in S} x_i\n            B_S = sum_{i in S} x_{i-1}\n\n          Then A_S - B_S = sum_{i in S} (x_i - x_{i-1})\n\n          Note: the indices i in S are at least 1. Then x_i - x_{i-1} is the gap at position i. But note: the array is sorted, so x_i > x_{i-1}. However, the gaps are positive. But wait, the gaps are defined for consecutive indices? Actually, the gaps are for the entire array, but here we are subtracting x_{i-1} from x_i for each index i in S.\n\n          However, note: the array a is [x0, x1, ..., x_{n-1}]. Then the array b for indices>=1 is [x0, x1, ..., x_{n-2}]. \n\n          Then for a subset S (without index0) we have:\n\n            A_S = x_i1 + x_i2 + ... (where i1, i2, ... are the indices in S, and they are at least 1)\n            B_S = x_{i1-1} + x_{i2-1} + ...\n\n          Then A_S - B_S = (x_{i1} - x_{i1-1}) + (x_{i2} - x_{i2-1}) + ... \n\n          Each term (x_i - x_{i-1}) is positive. So the entire sum is positive.\n\n          Now, the key is: can we have A_S = B_S for some S?\n\n          For S containing the first element: \n            We require: x0 + sum_{i in S, i>=1} x_i = x_{n-1} + sum_{i in S, i>=1} x_{i-1}\n            => (x0 - x_{n-1}) + sum_{i in S, i>=1} (x_i - x_{i-1}) = 0\n\n          But note: (x0 - x_{n-1}) is negative and the sum is positive. The entire expression is negative? Actually, we showed above that for S containing the first element, the difference is negative. So we never get zero? \n\n          However, wait: the expression is negative, so the condition A_S != B_S holds.\n\n          For S not containing the first element:\n            We require: sum_{i in S} x_i = sum_{i in S} x_{i-1}\n            => sum_{i in S} (x_i - x_{i-1}) = 0\n\n          But each term (x_i - x_{i-1}) is positive (because the array is strictly increasing). So the sum is positive. Therefore, it cannot be zero.\n\n          Therefore, the condition holds for all non-empty proper subsets.\n\n          But wait: what if S is the entire set? We don't check that, and indeed we excluded it.\n\n          However, note: the entire set is not considered, so we are safe.\n\n          But wait, the entire set: \n            A_total = sum(a) = x0+x1+...+x_{n-1}\n            B_total = x_{n-1} + x0 + x1 + ... + x_{n-2} = (x0+x1+...+x_{n-2}) + x_{n-1} = same as A_total.\n\n          But the condition excludes the entire set, so we don't require them to be different.\n\n          Therefore, the construction works.\n\n          However, note: the problem states that the array has distinct integers. Our construction uses the sorted array and then places the largest at the front and the rest in increasing order.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Read n.\n            Read the array a of n distinct integers.\n\n            If n==1:\n                Then output the array (it's the only permutation) and we are done.\n\n            Else:\n                Sort the array.\n                Then output [largest] + [the rest in increasing order]\n\n          But wait, the example input:\n\n            Input: ['2\\n1 2', '4\\n1000 100 10 1']\n\n            Output: ['2 1', '100 1 1000 10']\n\n          For the second example: \n            Input: [1000, 100, 10, 1] -> we sort: [1,10,100,1000]\n            Then output: [1000, 1,10,100]\n\n          But the example output is: '100 1 1000 10'\n\n          Why the example output is different? \n\n          The example output: [100, 1, 1000, 10] is a permutation of [1000,100,10,1]? \n            [100,1,1000,10] -> elements: 100,1,1000,10 -> which are the same as the original [1000,100,10,1] (multiset: {1,10,100,1000}).\n\n          But our construction: \n            Sorted: [1,10,100,1000] ->",

This construction ensures that all subset sums (for non-empty proper subsets) in the original and permuted arrays are different. \n2. **Intuition**: By placing the largest element first, we maximize the difference in sums for subsets that include the first element. The rest of the elements are placed in ascending order, which helps in ensuring that no subset sum matches between the original and permuted arrays except for the entire set, which is excluded by the problem constraints.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves sorting the array and then constructing the result array by placing the largest element first, followed by the remaining elements in their natural order.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(n) to store the sorted array and the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n        \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    result = [a_sorted[-1]] + a_sorted[:-1]\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the size of the array and the array elements.\n2. **Handling Single Element Case**: If the array has only one element, it is directly printed since there are no non-empty proper subsets to consider.\n3. **Sorting and Constructing Result**: The array is sorted in ascending order. The largest element is placed at the beginning of the result array, followed by the remaining elements in their sorted order.\n4. **Output**: The constructed result array is printed, which is a permutation of the original array satisfying the problem's conditions.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all subset sums (for non-empty proper subsets) differ between the original and permuted arrays by leveraging sorting and a specific placement strategy.",
