There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: n, h, m and then m lines of [l, r, x]\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use a dynamic programming or even iterate over possibilities.\n\n However, note that the restrictions are on contiguous segments. The key is that each restriction i: from l_i to r_i must have maximum height <= x_i.\n\n But note: there might be multiple restrictions overlapping.\n\n Observation: Each house (spot) can be assigned a height between 0 and h, but must satisfy all restrictions that cover it. Moreover, for a restriction [l_i, r_i] with maximum x_i, no house in that segment can exceed x_i.\n\n Additionally, we want to maximize the sum of squares of the heights.\n\n We can think of the problem as: assign a height a_i for each spot i (1-indexed) such that:\n   0 <= a_i <= min(h, max_{all restrictions covering i} (x_i))\n   and also for each restriction j, the maximum a_i in [l_j, r_j] <= x_j.\n\n However, note that the restrictions are independent and we must satisfy all. We can combine the restrictions: for each spot i, let the maximum allowed height by any restriction that covers i be the minimum of the x_j for all restrictions j that include i? Actually, no: because if a restriction j says the entire segment [l_j, r_j] must have max <= x_j, then in particular, each house in that segment must be <= x_j. So the constraint for a house i is that it must be <= the minimum x_j for which i is in [l_j, r_j]. However, wait: what if two restrictions apply: one says <= 10 and another says <= 5? Then house i must be <= 5. But note: the condition is that the entire segment must be <= x_j. So yes, for each house i, we can define:\n   base[i] = min{ x_j | j such that l_j <= i <= r_j }   (if no restriction covers i, then base[i] could be set to h? But note: the problem says \"the tallest house from spots l_i to r_i must be at most x_i\". If no restriction covers a spot, then there is no explicit upper bound from the restrictions, so the house can go up to h. However, we are also bounded by h.\n\n But wait: the example input has h=3 and the first example: \n     Restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n     Then for spot1: only restriction 1 -> base[1]=1\n          spot2: only restriction 2 -> base[2]=3\n          spot3: only restriction 3 -> base[3]=2\n\n However, note that the second example: \n     n=4, h=10, m=2, restrictions: [2,3,8] and [3,4,7]\n     For spot1: no restriction -> so base[1] = 10 (since the maximum height is h=10, and no restriction, so we take min(10, ...) but actually we don't have a restriction so we just use h)\n     For spot2: covered by first restriction -> base[2] = 8\n     For spot3: covered by both -> base[3] = min(8,7)=7\n     For spot4: covered by second restriction -> base[4]=7\n\n However, note that the example solution uses [10,8,7,7]. This satisfies the restrictions: \n     First restriction [2,3]: max(8,7) = 8 <=8 -> ok.\n     Second restriction [3,4]: max(7,7)=7<=7 -> ok.\n\n So the constraints for each spot i are: a_i <= base[i] and a_i <= h (but base[i] is computed from restrictions, and if there are no restrictions then base[i] is set to h? Actually, we should set base[i] to h if no restriction applies, because without any restriction the house can be as high as h.\n\n But wait: what if there are two restrictions? One that sets an upper bound and then we don't want to exceed h. So the effective upper bound for house i is min(base[i], h). However, note that base[i] is defined as the minimum x_j from restrictions that cover i, and if there are none, then we can set base[i] to h (because we are allowed to build up to h). Alternatively, we can define base[i] as the minimum x_j over all j such that i in [l_j, r_j] and if there are no such j, then base[i] = h.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"In each spot,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with specific zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. Each house's height must comply with all zoning restrictions that apply to its spot, and the height cannot exceed the given maximum height `h`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to each of the `n` spots such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of these heights.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each spot, the maximum allowable height is the minimum of all the restrictions that cover that spot. If no restrictions cover a spot, the maximum height is simply `h`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the optimal heights for each spot. The solution involves:\n   - **Preprocessing**: Determine the effective maximum height (`allowed_height`) for each spot by considering all restrictions that include it.\n   - **Dynamic Programming**: For each spot, consider all possible heights (from 0 to `allowed_height`) and use the results from previous spots to build up the solution. The DP state `dp[i][a]` represents the maximum profit achievable up to the `i-th` spot with the `i-th` house having height `a`.\n4. **Optimization**: The DP approach ensures that we explore all feasible height combinations while adhering to the constraints, leveraging the fact that the profit function (sum of squares) is maximized by higher heights, but constrained by the restrictions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x_val))\n        index += 3\n    \n    base = [h] * (n + 1)\n    for l, r, x_val in restrictions:\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            if x_val < base[i]:\n                base[i] = x_val\n    \n    dp = [[0] * (base[i] + 1) for i in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        current_base = base[i]\n        for height in range(0, current_base + 1):\n            prev_max = 0\n            if i == 1:\n                dp[i][height] = height * height\n            else:\n                best_prev = 0\n                for j in range(i - 1, 0, -1):\n                    if dp[j][k] >= best_prev:\n                        best_prev = dp[j][k]\n                dp[i][height] = best_prev + height * height\n    \n    result = max(dp[n])\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spots `n`, maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. Each restriction is stored as a tuple of `(l, r, x_val)`.\n2. **Restriction Processing**: For each spot, the effective maximum height is determined by checking all restrictions that include the spot. The minimum `x_val` from these restrictions becomes the allowable height for the spot.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: A DP array `dp` is initialized where `dp[i][a]` will store the maximum profit achievable up to the `i-th` spot with height `a`.\n4. **DP Initialization**: For the first spot, the profit is simply the square of the height (from 0 to `base[1]`).\n5. **DP Filling**: For each subsequent spot, the algorithm checks all possible heights (from 0 to `base[i]`). For each height, it considers the maximum profit from all previous spots and adds the square of the current height.\n6. **Result Extraction**: The maximum value in the last row of the DP array (corresponding to the last spot) gives the highest possible profit, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and leverages dynamic programming to explore all feasible solutions, ensuring optimal profit while adhering to the zoning restrictions.",
