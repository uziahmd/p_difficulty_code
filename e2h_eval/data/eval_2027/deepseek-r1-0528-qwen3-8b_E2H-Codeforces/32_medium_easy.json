    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing an element from the array will remove either the minimum or the maximum (or both) from the current min and max.\n\n However, note that the instability is defined as (max - min). If we remove one element, the new min or max might change.\n\n Approach:\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. The idea is that we can consider removing one of the elements. Then the instability would be the difference between the maximum of the remaining elements and the minimum of the remaining elements.\n\n But note: if we remove an element that is not the global min or max, then the min and max of the entire array remain the same? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max are still the same. However, if we remove the only min or the only max, then the min or max changes.\n\n Therefore, we have two types of removals:\n\n   a) Removing an element that is the current minimum (if there are multiple mins, then after removal the next smallest becomes the min)\n   b) Removing an element that is the current maximum (if there are multiple maxes, then after removal the next largest becomes the max)\n\n Also, we can remove an element in the middle. But note: removing an element from the middle doesn't change the overall min and max, so the instability remains the same as the original array.\n\n However, wait: what if we remove an element that is the only occurrence of the min or the only occurrence of the max? Then the min or max changes.\n\n But note: if there are duplicates, then even if we remove one occurrence of the min, the min might not change because there are other min values.\n\n So, we can think:\n\n Let the sorted array be `b`.\n Then the original instability is `b[n-1] - b[0]`.\n\n Now, if we remove one element, the resulting array has two possibilities for min and max:\n\n Possibility 1: The min remains `b[0]` and the max becomes `b[n-1]` (if we remove an element that is not the max). But if we remove the max, then the max becomes `b[n-2]`. Similarly, if we remove the min, the min becomes `b[1]`.\n\n However, we can also remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, then the min and max remain the same.\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. We want the minimum instability.\n\n We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Remove the first element (the smallest). Then the new array's min is `b[1]` and max is `b[n-1]`, so instability = `b[n-1] - b[1]`.\n\n Option 2: Remove the last element (the largest). Then the new array's min is `b[0]` and max is `b[n-2]`, so instability = `b[n-2] - b[0]`.\n\n Option 3: Remove an element from the middle? Actually, we don't need to consider every middle element because if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max remain the same, so the instability is `b[n-1]-b[0]`. \n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min or the max? We already considered the endpoints. However, what if there are multiple minima or maxima?\n\n Actually, we must consider that if we remove an element that is the min but there are duplicates, then the min remains the same? No, because if we remove one occurrence of the min, then the next smallest might be the same as the min (if there are duplicates) so the min doesn't change. But if we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates, then we still have the min. Similarly for max.\n\n Therefore, we must consider:\n\n For any removal, the new min is:\n   If the removed element is less than the current min? It can't be because we sorted. So if we remove an element that is the current min, then the new min is the next smallest (which is at least the current min). Similarly for max.\n\n However, we can also consider: what if we remove an element that is not the min but there are duplicate min values? Then the min remains the same.\n\n Actually, the min of the array is `b[0]`. If we remove an element that is greater than `b[0]`, then the min remains `b[0]`. Similarly, the max remains `b[-1]` if we don't remove the maximum.\n\n Therefore, the instability after removal is:\n\n   If we remove an element that is not the maximum, then the max is still `b[-1]` (unless we remove the last occurrence, but note: we are removing one element and the array is sorted, so if there are duplicates, then the max might be repeated).\n\n Actually, the best way is to consider two scenarios:\n\n   Scenario 1: The new min is `b[0]` (meaning we didn't remove the only occurrence of `b[0]`). Then the max is either `b[-1]` (if we didn't remove the last element) or `b[-2]` (if we did remove the last element and there was only one max). But wait, if we remove an element that is not the max, then the max remains `b[-1]`.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible removals by looking at the effect of removing each candidate that could change the min or max.\n\n But note: the problem size is up to 10^5, so we cannot check every removal (n possibilities) and compute the instability (which would be O(n^2)).\n\n Insight:\n\n We note that the instability is determined by the new min and new max. The new min is either `b[0]` or `b[1]` (if we remove the first element) and similarly the new max is either `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` (if we remove the last element). However, if we remove an element from the middle, then the min and max are unchanged.\n\n But wait: if we remove an element from the middle, the min and max are unchanged, so the instability is the same as the original. Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is at most the original instability, and sometimes we can reduce it.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n   candidate1: Remove the first element -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n   candidate2: Remove the last element -> instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n But also, we can remove an element that is the min but not the first? Actually, the array is sorted, so the first element is the min. Similarly, the last is the max.\n\n However, what if we remove an element that is not at the ends? Then the instability remains the same. Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n   candidate1: b[-1] - b[1]\n   candidate2: b[-2] - b[0]\n   and the original instability (if we remove a middle element, we get the same instability, but maybe we can get a lower one by removing an endpoint).\n\n But wait: if we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates, then the min doesn't change. Similarly for max.\n\n Example: [1,1,3,7] \n   Original instability = 7-1 = 6.\n   If we remove the first 1, then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability = 7-1 = 6.\n   If we remove the last 7, then the array becomes [1,1,3] -> instability = 3-1 = 2.\n\n So we see that removing the last element gives a better result.\n\n But note: we can also remove the second 1 (at index1) and then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability 6.\n\n So the key is: we are allowed to remove any one element. We can simulate removals at the boundaries and also removals that might change the min or max.\n\n Actually, the minimal instability must be the minimum of:\n\n   For each i from 0 to n-1: \n        instability_i = max(b[i+1:]) - min(b[:i+1])   [if we remove the i-th element]\n\n But that is O(n^2) and n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We note that the instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining array.\n\n The remaining array's min is the min of the original array if we don't remove any occurrence of the original min, otherwise the next smallest (which is the next distinct value or the same if duplicates).\n\n Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, we can consider:\n\n   Option A: Remove an element that is the min (but note: if there are multiple mins, then removing one min doesn't change the min, so the instability remains the same). However, if we remove the only min, then the min increases.\n\n   Similarly for the max.\n\n But note: the array is sorted. The min is at the beginning and the max at the end.\n\n How about we consider:\n\n   Let m = b[0], M = b[-1]\n\n   We can also consider: what if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max are unchanged -> instability M - m.\n\n   What if we remove an element that is the min? Then the min becomes the next smallest, which is the first element that is greater than m. But wait, if there are duplicates of m, then the min remains m.\n\n   Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max, then the max becomes the previous largest (which might be the same if duplicates).\n\n Therefore, we can break down:\n\n   Let's define:\n        left_min[i] = the minimum of the array from index 0 to i-1 (if we remove index i, then the min is the minimum of indices [0, i-1])\n        right_max[i] = the maximum of the array from index i+1 to n-1\n\n   Then the instability when removing index i is: right_max[i] - left_min[i]   [if we define left_min[i] as the min of the prefix ending at i-1 and right_max[i] as the max of the suffix starting at i+1]\n\n   But building these arrays for every i would take O(n) and then we do an O(n) scan. However, building the prefix min and suffix max arrays is standard and can be done in O(n).\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Sort the array.\n\n   Step 2: Precompute:\n        prefix_min[i] = minimum value from 0 to i (for the prefix including i)\n        suffix_max[i] = maximum value from i to n-1 (for the suffix including i)\n\n   But actually, for removal at index i:\n\n        left part: indices [0, i-1] -> min = (prefix_min[i-1] if i>0 else a very big number)\n        right part: indices [i+1, n-1] -> max = (suffix_max[i+1] if i < n-1 else a very small number)\n\n   Then instability at removal i = max( (min of left part) , (max of right part) ) - min( (min of left part), (max of right part) )? \n\n   Actually, the instability is defined as (max - min) of the entire remaining array, which is the max of the left part and the right part minus the min of the left part and the right part.\n\n   But note: the entire remaining array is the left part and the right part.\n\n   However, we can compute:\n\n        left_min[i] = prefix_min[i-1] if i>=1 else None\n        right_max[i] = suffix_max[i+1] if i<=n-2 else None\n\n   Then the instability is: \n        if i==0: then the array is from 1 to n-1 -> min = prefix_min[n-1]? Actually, we need to adjust.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n        prefix_min[0] = a[0]\n        for i from 1 to n-1: prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n\n        suffix_max[n-1] = a[n-1]\n        for i from n-2 down to 0: suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n\n   Then for removal of index i:\n\n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1] if i>=1 else None   -> but if i==0, then we don't have left part, so we consider the right part from index1 to n-1.\n\n   Actually, we can define:\n\n        For removal at index i:\n            left_part = a[0:i]   -> min is prefix_min[i-1] if i>=1, else no left part (then the min is from the right part)\n            right_part = a[i+1:n] -> max is suffix_max[i+1] if i<n-1, else no right part\n\n        Then the min of the remaining array is: \n            if i==0: then min_right = suffix_min[i+1] (but wait, we don't have suffix_min, we have suffix_max) -> actually we need the min of the entire remaining array? \n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n        We need for removal i:\n            min_val = min( (min of a[0:i]), (min of a[i+1:n]) )\n            max_val = max( (max of a[0:i]), (max of a[i+1:n]) )\n\n   But we can use:\n\n        Let L[i] = minimum of a[0:i] (i.e., from 0 to i-1) -> prefix_min[i] (if we define prefix_min[i] as min of a[0..i])\n        But if we remove i, then the left part is a[0:i] and the right part is a[i+1:n].\n\n        We can precompute:\n            prefix_min[i] = min(a[0..i])\n            prefix_max[i] = max(a[0..i])\n            suffix_min[i] = min(a[i..n-1])\n            suffix_max[i] = max(a[i..n-1])\n\n        Then for removal at i:\n            left_min = prefix_min[i-1] if i>=1 else (a very big number)   -> but if i==0, then the left part is empty, so we take the min from the right part.\n            left_max = prefix_max[i-1] if i>=1 else (a very small number)\n            right_min = suffix_min[i+1] if i<n-1 else (a very big number)\n            right_max = suffix_max[i+1] if i<n-1 else (a very small number)\n\n        Then the min of the remaining array is min(left_min, right_min) and the max is max(left_max, right_max).\n\n        But note: if i==0, then we don't have a left part, so we should set left_min and left_max to something that doesn't interfere. We can set:\n\n            left_min = float('inf') if i==0 else prefix_min[i-1]\n            left_max = float('-inf') if i==0 else prefix_max[i-1]\n\n            Similarly, if i==n-1, then right_min = float('inf'), right_max = float('-inf')\n\n        Then the instability = (max_value) - (min_value)\n\n        And we take the minimum instability over i from 0 to n-1.\n\n   However, note: we have to consider the entire array without the element at i.\n\n   But building prefix_min, prefix_max, suffix_min, suffix_max is O(n). Then we do a loop of n, so total O(n). This is acceptable.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If n==2, then we have two elements.\n\n        # Build prefix_min and prefix_max arrays (from index0 to index i)\n        prefix_min = [0] * n\n        prefix_max = [0] * n\n        prefix_min[0] = a[0]\n        prefix_max[0] = a[0]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n            prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\n        suffix_min = [0] * n\n        suffix_max = [0] * n\n        suffix_min[n-1] = a[n-1]\n        suffix_max[n-1] = a[n-1]\n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a[i])\n            suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n\n        # Now, for each removal i:\n        best = float('inf')\n        for i in range(n):\n            # For removal at index i\n            # Left part: [0, i-1]\n            # Right part: [i+1, n-1]\n\n            left_min_val = prefix_min[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else float('inf')\n            left_max_val = prefix_max[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else float('-inf')\n\n            right_min_val = suffix_min[i+1] if i+1 < n else float('inf')\n            right_max_val = suffix_max[i+1] if i+1 < n else float('-inf')\n\n            # The entire remaining array's min is the minimum of left_min_val and right_min_val (if both exist) or the existing one.\n            if i == 0:\n                # Then we don't have left part, so the min is the min of the right part (which we have in suffix_min[i+1])\n                # But note: our suffix_min[i+1] is the min from i+1 to n-1, which is the entire right part.\n                min_val = suffix_min[i+1] if n > 1 else None  # But n>=2, so if n==2 then i+1 is 1 which is valid.\n                max_val = suffix_max[i+1]\n            elif i == n-1:\n                min_val = prefix_min[i-1]\n                max_val = prefix_max[i-1]\n            else:\n                min_val = min(left_min_val, right_min_val)\n                max_val = max(left_max_val, right_max_val)\n\n            # However, we can combine without if-else by setting the non-existent parts to extreme values.\n\n            # Let me restructure without if-else using the above definitions:\n\n            # We defined:\n            #   left_min_val = ...

The above min and max will work because:\n            #   if left_min_val is inf and right_min_val is not, then min_val = right_min_val.\n            #   if left_max_val is -inf and right_max_val is not, then max_val = right_max_val.\n\n            # However, we must avoid the case when the array has only one element?

But wait, we defined suffix_min[i] as min from i to n-1.\n\n        Actually, for i=3: [7] -> min=7\n        i=2: min(a[2], suffix_min[3]) = min(3,7)=3\n        i=1: min(3, suffix_min[2])=min(3,3)=3\n        i=0: min(1, suffix_min[1])=min(1,3)=1\n\n        So suffix_min = [1,3,3,7] -> correct.\n\n        Similarly, suffix_max = [7,7,3,7] -> wait:\n\n        i=3: 7\n        i=2: max(3,7)=7\n        i=1: max(3,7)=7\n        i=0: max(1,7)=7\n\n        Actually, no: \n          suffix_max[3] = 7\n          suffix_max[2] = max(a[2], suffix_max[3]) = max(3,7)=7\n          suffix_max[1] = max(a[1], suffix_max[2]) = max(3,7)=7\n          suffix_max[0] = max(a[0], suffix_max[1]) = max(1,7)=7\n\n        But wait, the suffix from index0 to the end is [1,3,3,7] -> max=7, so that's correct.\n\n   Now, consider removal at index0 (element 1):\n\n        left_min_val = float('inf') (since i-1=-1 is invalid)\n        left_max_val = float('-inf')\n        right_min_val = suffix_min[1] = 3\n        right_max_val = suffix_max[1] = 7\n\n        Then min_val = min(inf,3)=3, max_val = max(-inf,7)=7 -> instability=4.\n\n   Removal at index1 (element 3):\n\n        left_min_val = prefix_min[0]=1\n        left_max_val = prefix_max[0]=1\n        right_min_val = suffix_min[2]=3\n        right_max_val = suffix_max[2]=7\n\n        min_val = min(1,3)=1, max_val = max(1,7)=7 -> instability=6.\n\n   Removal at index2 (element 3):\n\n        left_min_val = prefix_min[1]=1\n        left_max_val = prefix_max[1]=3\n        right_min_val = suffix_min[3]=7\n        right_max_val = suffix_max[3]=7\n\n        min_val = min(1,7)=1, max_val = max(3,7)=7 -> instability=6.\n\n   Removal at index3 (element7):\n\n        left_min_val = prefix_min[2]=1\n        left_max_val = prefix_max[2]=3\n        right_min_val = float('inf') (because i+1=4 is out of bounds)\n        right_max_val = float('-inf')\n\n        Then min_val = 1, max_val=3 -> instability=2.\n\n   So the minimum is 2, which matches the example.\n\n   However, we can optimize: note that the minimal instability must be the minimum among:\n\n        candidate1: remove the first element -> instability = a[-1] - a[1]   [if n>=2, then a[1] exists]\n        candidate2: remove the last element -> instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n        candidate3: remove an element in the middle? Actually, the above method considers all removals.\n\n   But the above method is O(n) and n can be 10^5, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can do better by noticing that the minimal instability is the minimum of the two candidates:\n\n        candidate1: a[-1] - a[1]\n        candidate2: a[-2] - a[0]\n\n        and also the original array's instability if we remove an element that is not the min or max? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original one. But we are looking for the minimum, so we can consider:\n\n        best_candidate = min( a[-1]-a[1], a[-2]-a[0] )\n\n        But wait: what if the array has duplicates? \n\n        Example: [1,1,3,7] -> \n            candidate1: a[-1]-a[1] = 7-1 = 6\n            candidate2: a[-2]-a[0] = 3-1 = 2\n\n            Then best_candidate = 2, which is correct.\n\n        But consider: [1,2,3,4,5] \n            candidate1: 5-2 = 3\n            candidate2: 4-1 = 3\n            But if we remove the middle element, say 3, then the array becomes [1,2,4,5] -> instability 5-1=4, which is worse.\n            However, the minimal instability is 3.\n\n        But wait: can we get lower than 3? \n            Removing the first element: [2,3,4,5] -> 5-2=3\n            Removing the last element: [1,2,3,4] -> 4-1=3\n            Removing an element in the middle: \n                remove 2: [1,3,4,5] -> 5-1=4\n                remove 3: [1,2,4,5] -> 5-1=4\n                remove 4: [1,2,3,5] -> 5-1=4\n\n            So the minimal is 3.\n\n        But note: the two candidate removals (first and last) give 3.\n\n        However, what if the array is [1,2,3,100]?\n            candidate1: 100-2=98\n            candidate2: 3-1=2\n\n            But also, if we remove the 100, then the array becomes [1,2,3] -> instability 2, which is the same as candidate2.\n\n            But wait, candidate2 is defined as a[-2]-a[0] = 3-1=2.\n\n        So the two candidate removals (first and last) are enough?\n\n        Why?\n\n        Explanation:\n\n        After removal, the min of the array is either the original min (if we don't remove the only min) or the next smallest (if we remove the only min). Similarly for max.\n\n        The minimal instability we can get is by either:\n\n            Option A: Keep the original min and remove the max (so the new max is the next largest) -> instability = (next largest) - (original min)\n            Option B: Keep the original max and remove the min (so the new min is the next smallest) -> instability = (original max) - (next smallest)\n\n        But note: we can also remove an element that is not the min or max, but then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original one (which is larger than at least one of the above two).\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the minimum of:\n\n            candidate1 = (last element) - (second smallest)   [if we remove the smallest, then the min becomes the second smallest, and the max remains the last element]\n            candidate2 = (second largest) - (first element)   [if we remove the largest, then the max becomes the second largest, and the min remains the first element]\n\n        However, wait: what if we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates? Then the min doesn't change. Similarly for max.\n\n        But note: if there are duplicates, then:\n\n            candidate1: if we remove one occurrence of the min, the min doesn't change, so the instability remains the same as the original? \n\n            Example: [1,1,3,7] -> if we remove the first 1, then the min is still 1, so instability = 7-1=6, which is worse than candidate2 (which is 3-1=2). \n\n            But wait, we are only considering two candidates: removing the first element (which is the min) and removing the last element (which is the max). \n\n            In [1,1,3,7]: \n                Removing the first element: the array becomes [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n                Removing the last element: the array becomes [1,1,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n            So the candidate2 (removing the last element) is valid even if there are duplicates.\n\n        However, the candidate1 (removing the first element) is not giving the minimal instability in this example.\n\n        But wait, we must consider: the candidate1 is defined as (last element) - (second smallest). In [1,1,3,7]: \n            second smallest is 1 (the first element after the first one is 1) -> so candidate1 = 7-1=6.\n\n        How do we get the second smallest? \n\n            sorted_array = [1,1,3,7]\n            second smallest is the element at index1, which is 1.\n\n        Similarly, candidate2: second largest is the element at index n-2, which is 3.\n\n        Now, is it always true that the minimal instability is the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2?\n\n        Consider: [1,2,3,4,5] -> candidate1: 5-2=3, candidate2:4-1=3 -> min=3.\n\n        Consider: [1,2,100,101] \n            candidate1: remove the first element (1) -> then the array [2,100,101] -> instability=101-2=99.\n            candidate2: remove the last element (101) -> then the array [1,2,100] -> instability=100-1=99.\n\n            But wait, we can remove the 2? Then the array [1,100,101] -> instability=101-1=100.\n            Or remove the 100? Then the array [1,2,101] -> instability=101-1=100.\n\n            The minimal instability is 99.\n\n            However, note: the original array's min and max are 1 and 101. When we remove the first element, the min becomes 2 (the next smallest) and the max remains 101 -> 101-2=99.\n            When we remove the last element, the max becomes 100 and the min remains 1 -> 100-1=99.\n\n            So the minimal instability is 99, which is the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n        Therefore, the solution can be simplified to:\n\n            sort the array\n            candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]   # remove the first element (a[0]) -> then the min becomes a[1] and the max remains a[-1]\n            candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]    # remove the last element (a[-1]) -> then the max becomes a[-2] and the min remains a[0]\n\n            answer = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n        But wait: what if the array has duplicates? \n\n        Example: [1,1,1,1] (all ones)\n            candidate1 = 1 - 1 = 0\n            candidate2 = 1 - 1 = 0\n            answer=0 -> correct.\n\n        Example: [1,2,2,3] \n            candidate1: remove the first element (1) -> [2,2,3] -> min=2, max=3 -> 3-2=1\n            candidate2: remove the last element (3) -> [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> 2-1=1\n            answer=1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: [1,2,3,4] \n            candidate1: 4-2=2\n            candidate2: 3-1=2\n            answer=2 -> correct.\n\n        Example: [1,3,3,7] \n            candidate1: 7-3=4   -> wait, no: the array is [1,3,3,7]. Removing the first element (1) leaves [3,3,7] -> min=3, max=7 -> 4.\n            candidate2: 3-1=2   -> correct.\n\n        But wait, why did the example say that removing 7 gives instability 2? That is candidate2.\n\n        However, note: the candidate1 is defined as: after removing the first element, the instability is a[-1]-a[1]. \n            In [1,3,3,7]: a[1] is 3, so 7-3=4.\n\n        Candidate2: a[-2]-a[0] = 3-1=2.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        But why did the example output 2? Yes, and our candidate2 gives 2.\n\n        However, what if we remove an element that is the min but not the first? Actually, the array is sorted, so the min is at the beginning. \n\n        Therefore, the two candidates cover the removal of the global min and the global max.\n\n        But note: if we remove an element that is not the global min or global max, the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original (a[-1]-a[0]). \n\n        And since we are taking the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2, and the original instability (if we don't remove an endpoint) is a[-1]-a[0], which is at least as large as min(candidate1, candidate2) (because:\n\n            candidate1 = a[-1]-a[1] <= a[-1]-a[0]   (since a[1] >= a[0])\n            candidate2 = a[-2]-a[0] <= a[-1]-a[0]   (since a[-2] <= a[-1])\n\n        So the minimal instability is indeed the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a.sort()\n            if n == 2:\n                # Then after removal, the array has one element -> instability 0.\n                # But note: if we remove one element, the other remains -> so the instability is 0.\n                print(0)\n            else:\n                candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n                candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n                print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\n        However, wait: what if the array has two elements? Then we remove one, leaving one element. The instability is 0.\n\n        But in the above code, for n==2:\n\n            candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] = 0\n            candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0] = a[0] - a[0] = 0\n\n        So we can simply:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a.sort()\n            candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]   # if n>=2, then a[1] exists\n            candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]    # if n>=2, then a[-2] exists\n\n            print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: \"4\\n1 3 3 7\" -> sorted=[1,3,3,7]\n                candidate1 = 7-3=4\n                candidate2 = 3-1=2\n                min(4,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example 2: \"2\\n1 100000\" -> sorted=[1,100000]\n                candidate1 = 100000-100000=0\n                candidate2 = 1-1=0\n                min(0,0)=0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, consider an array with three elements: [1,2,3]\n\n            candidate1 = 3-2=1\n            candidate2 = 2-1=1\n            min=1 -> correct.\n\n        Another test: [1,1,2,3] \n            candidate1 = 3-1=2\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can either keep the original min and max unchanged or alter them if the removed element was the only occurrence of the current min or max. \n2. **Insight**: The minimal instability is achieved by either:\n   - Removing the smallest element (min) so the new min is the next smallest element, and the max remains the same.\n   - Removing the largest element (max) so the new max is the next largest element, and the min remains the same.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n   - Calculate two candidates:\n     - **Candidate 1**: The instability after removing the smallest element (difference between the last element and the second smallest element).\n     - **Candidate 2**: The instability after removing the largest element (difference between the second largest element and the first element).\n   - The answer is the minimum of these two candidates.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5). The subsequent operations are O(1), making the overall complexity O(n log n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - **Candidate 1** is computed as the difference between the largest element (`a[-1]`) and the second smallest element (`a[1]`). This represents the instability after removing the smallest element.\n   - **Candidate 2** is computed as the difference between the second largest element (`a[-2]`) and the smallest element (`a[0]`). This represents the instability after removing the largest element.\n4. **Result**: The minimum of the two candidates is printed, which is the minimal possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking two critical scenarios (removing min or max) and leverages sorting to simplify the solution.",
