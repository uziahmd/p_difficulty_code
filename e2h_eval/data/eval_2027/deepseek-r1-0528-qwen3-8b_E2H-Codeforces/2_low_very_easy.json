Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. On both diagonals, all the letters must be the same (the same letter for the entire diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, and that letter is different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the diagonals share the center. The main diagonal and the anti-diagonal.\n\n Steps:\n Let's denote:\n   - The letter for the diagonals as `d`\n   - The letter for the non-diagonal positions as `x`\n\n But note: condition 2 says that the non-diagonal squares must be the same and different from `d`.\n\n However, what if the entire grid is filled with the same letter? Then condition 2 fails because the non-diagonal part would have the same letter as the diagonal.\n\n So we need to check:\n   a) The main diagonal: from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1)\n   b) The anti-diagonal: from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0)\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and the grid.\n\n 2. Traverse the grid and check the two diagonals:\n    - For i in range(n): check grid[i][i] for main diagonal -> all should be the same.\n    - For i in range(n): check grid[i][n-1-i] for anti-diagonal -> all should be the same.\n\n 3. Check that the entire diagonal is one letter, say `d`.\n\n 4. Now, for the rest of the cells (non-diagonal), they must be the same letter, say `x`, and `x != d`.\n\n However, note: the diagonals also cover the center. But the center is included in both diagonals. But that's okay because the condition for the diagonals requires the same letter throughout.\n\n 5. But note: there might be two different letters for the two diagonals? Actually, the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning each diagonal must have the same letter, but the two diagonals can have different letters? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't say the two diagonals have to be the same. However, the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n      5\n      xooox\n      oxoxo\n      soxoo\n      oxoxo\n      xooox\n\n   This outputs 'NO'\n\n   Why? Because in the third row (index 2) the center is 's'. The main diagonal at row2 is grid[2][2] which is 's', but the anti-diagonal at row2 is grid[2][2] (same center) is also 's'. However, look at the third row: \n      s o x o o   -> wait, the third row is given as 'soxoo'. The main diagonal element is at [2][2] = 'x'? Actually, wait:\n\n   Let me index from 0:\n\n   Row0: 'xooox'\n   Row1: 'oxoxo'\n   Row2: 'soxoo' -> actually, wait: the third row (index2) is 'soxoo'. The main diagonal is [0][0], [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], [4][4]: \n        [0][0] = 'x'\n        [1][1] = 'o'\n        [2][2] = 'x'\n        [3][3] = 'o'\n        [4][4] = 'x'\n\n   So the main diagonal is not all the same! Similarly, the anti-diagonal: \n        [0][4] = 'x'\n        [1][3] = 'x'\n        [2][2] = 'x'   -> wait, in row2, the anti-diagonal is at column n-1-2 = 5-1-2=2, so [2][2] is the center and is part of both. But the anti-diagonal from row0 to row4: \n        [0][4] = 'x'\n        [1][3] = 'o' (from row1: 'oxoxo' -> index3 is 'o') -> already breaks the condition.\n\n   Actually, the example input provided is:\n\n   ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]\n\n   But wait, the example output is 'NO'. So the condition fails because the main diagonal has alternating 'x' and 'o' and the anti-diagonal has alternating 'x' and 'o'? Actually, no, the main diagonal: \n        row0: '",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The first line contains an odd integer `n` (3 ≤ n < 300), which is the size of the grid. The next `n` lines each contain `n` lowercase English letters.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - **Main Diagonal**: Verify that all letters from the top-left to the bottom-right are identical.\n   - **Anti-Diagonal**: Verify that all letters from the top-right to the bottom-left are identical.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Letters**: Ensure all letters not on either diagonal are the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag_letter = None\n    anti_diag_letter = None\n    \n    # Check main diagonal and anti-diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n            diag_letter = None\n            break\n        else:\n            diag_letter = grid[0][0]\n            \n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][n-1]:\n            anti_diag_letter = None\n            break\n        else:\n            anti_diag_letter = grid[0][n-1]\n            \n    # If either diagonal fails, output NO\n    if diag_letter is None or anti_diag_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check consistency between the two diagonals at the center\n    if diag_letter == anti_diag_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check non-diagonal letters\n    non_diag_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if non_diag_letter is None:\n                non_diag_letter = grid[i][j]\n            elif grid[i][j] != non_diag_letter:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n                \n    # Check that the non-diagonal letter is different from the diagonal letters\n    if non_diag_letter == diag_letter or non_diag_letter == anti_diag_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` and the grid itself, storing it as a list of strings.\n2. **Diagonal Checks**: It checks the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) to ensure all letters in each are the same. If either diagonal fails this check, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Center Consistency**: The center element of the grid is part of both diagonals. If the letters on both diagonals are the same, it outputs \"NO\" because the diagonals must differ.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Letters**: The code then checks all other positions in the grid to ensure they are identical and different from the diagonal letters. If any position violates this condition, it outputs \"NO\".\n5. **Final Decision**: If all checks pass, the grid forms an \"X\", and the code outputs \"YES\". Otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all conditions necessary to determine if the grid forms an \"X\" by systematically checking each required condition in sequence.",
