On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r] (and only the values in that interval) to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).\n\n Note: The entire sequence consists of only 1's and 2's. Therefore, a non-decreasing subsequence is just a sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n Let's think:\n Without any reversal, the LNDS is at least the number of 1's or the number of 2's (whichever is larger) because we can take all 1's or all 2's? But note: we can also have a mix if the 1's come first and then 2's.\n\n However, after reversal, we might change the order of 1's and 2's in some part. The goal is to maximize the length of the LNDS.\n\n Observation:\n Since the array contains only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the entire array can be:\n\n   Option 1: All the 1's and as many 2's as are available after the last 1 (if we arrange the 1's first and then 2's). Similarly, we might have two segments: one of 1's and then 2's, but the reversal can help to bring 1's together and 2's together.\n\n Actually, note: the entire sequence must be considered. Without reversal, the LNDS is the maximum of:\n   - The total number of 1's (because we can take all 1's, even if they are not consecutive? Actually, no: the non-decreasing condition requires that the indices are increasing. But note: we can skip arbitrarily. So the entire set of 1's is non-decreasing. Similarly, the entire set of 2's is non-decreasing.\n\n However, we can combine 1's and 2's. In fact, the best LNDS without reversal is at least the maximum between:\n   - The count of 1's (since we can take all 1's)\n   - The count of 2's (since we can take all 2's)\n   - Or a combination: we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that are after the last 1 in the original sequence? But wait: we can skip arbitrarily. Actually, the standard way to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for an array of 1 and 2 is to use DP. However, note that the array is binary.\n\n But here we are allowed to reverse any contiguous segment. What is the effect?\n\n Consider: Reversing a contiguous segment will flip the order of 1's and 2's in that segment.\n\n Example: [1,2,1,2] -> reversing [2,3] (i.e., the middle two) becomes [1,1,2,2]. Now the entire sequence is non-decreasing and the length is 4.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Let n be up to 2000.\n\n We can consider:\n\n  1. Without reversal, what is the LNDS? \n        Let dp[i] be the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n        Then for each i, we look at j from 0 to i-1 and if a[j] <= a[i], then dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]+1).\n        Then the answer without reversal is the maximum dp[i] for i in range(n).\n\n  2. But we can reverse an interval. How does reversal affect the sequence?\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire sequence will consist of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence cannot exceed the total number of elements (n) and must be at least the maximum frequency of 1 or 2.\n\n Another observation: After reversal, the entire array is still made of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is simply the longest sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n Therefore, we can break the array into two parts: the 1's and the 2's. But note: the reversal might change the arrangement. However, the entire array has a fixed number of 1's and 2's.\n\n Let total_ones = total number of 1's, total_twos = total number of 2's.\n\n Without reversal, the maximum LNDS is max(total_ones, total_twos) OR sometimes more? Actually, without reversal, the LNDS can be more than just the count of ones or twos if the ones and twos are arranged appropriately. But wait: we can take all the ones and then the twos that are after the last one? No, because we can take the ones that are not necessarily contiguous. Actually, the standard definition of non-decreasing subsequence allows skipping. So the maximum LNDS is at least the maximum of the two counts, and possibly more if there are both 1 and 2 in the array and they are interleaved such that we can form a longer chain? Actually, no: because the only two numbers are 1 and 2, the longest chain is either all ones or all twos, unless we have a transition from 1 to 2. But note: we can have a chain that includes both 1 and 2, but only if the 1 comes before the 2. However, the chain can include every 1 and then every 2 that appears after the last 1 in the chain? But wait: the chain must be strictly increasing in index. So we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that occur after the last 1 we took? \n\n Actually, without reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between:\n   - The total number of 1's (if we take all 1's, regardless of their positions, because we can skip the 2's and take the 1's in increasing index order)\n   - The total number of 2's (similarly)\n   - Or a combination: we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that appear after the last 1 we took? But note: we are allowed to skip arbitrarily. Actually, the entire set of 1's and then the entire set of 2's that are not used in the 1's? However, we can also have an interleaving of 1 and 2 as long as we don't break the non-decreasing condition. But since 1<=2, we can take a 1 and then a 2 that comes later, and that would be allowed.\n\n However, the problem is: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. How does that help?\n\n Let's think about what the reversal operation does: It reverses a contiguous segment. So we can change the relative order of the 1's and 2's in that segment.\n\n The goal: to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Note: The entire array is fixed in terms of the multiset of 1's and 2's. The reversal operation doesn't change the count of 1's and 2's.\n\n The idea: the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary array of 1 and 2 is the total number of 1's plus the total number of 2's that occur after the last 1 in the chosen chain? Actually, no: we can interleave 1 and 2 arbitrarily as long as 1 comes before 2. But note: we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's, but the condition is that the 2's must appear after the last 1 we take. However, we are allowed to skip some 1's to get to more 2's? Actually, no: the chain is non-decreasing so we can take a 1 and then a 2, but we cannot take a 2 and then a 1.\n\n Therefore, the entire LNDS is the entire set of 1's and then the entire set of 2's? Not exactly: because the 1's and 2's are fixed in the array. The catch is: we can rearrange one contiguous segment arbitrarily (by reversal) to bring 1's to the front and 2's to the back, but note: the reversal operation only reverses one contiguous part.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Since the array is small (n<=2000), we can try to use dynamic programming with state including the reversal operations, but note we are allowed only one reversal.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. So the array is split into three parts: [0, l-1], [l, r], [r+1, n-1]. The middle part is reversed.\n\n We want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the entire array.\n\n How to compute the LNDS for the entire array after reversal? \n\n Since the array is small (n=2000), we can consider trying all possible contiguous segments to reverse and then compute the LNDS for the entire array. However, the standard way to compute the LNDS for an array of up to 2000 is O(n^2). And we have O(n^2) possible intervals (about n*(n+1)/2) so total operations would be O(n^3) which is 2000^3 = 8e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n We need a smarter approach.\n\n Let me reexamine the structure: the array is composed of 1's and 2's.\n\n The LNDS is the longest sequence that is non-decreasing. In a binary array, that means we can have:\n\n   Option 1: Take all the 1's (but not necessarily contiguous) and then as many 2's as we can (that occur after the last 1 we took). However, we are allowed to take the 1's and 2's in increasing index order.\n\n But note: the reversal operation might change the order of the segment. The key is: we can arrange a contiguous segment arbitrarily (by reversal) to be either 1's then 2's or 2's then 1's (but reversed, so if originally the segment was [a,b,c] then reversed is [c,b,a]).\n\n What is the goal? To maximize the entire sequence's LNDS.\n\n Notice: The entire sequence's LNDS is the length of the entire sequence if we can arrange the whole array to be [1,1,...,1,2,2,...,2] (all 1's then all 2's). Then the LNDS is n.\n\n But is that always achievable? Only if we can reverse one contiguous segment to gather all 1's to the left and all 2's to the right.\n\n However, the reversal operation is only on one contiguous segment. The rest of the array remains fixed. Therefore, we can only reverse one contiguous segment. So the entire array might not become sorted.\n\n How do we compute the maximum LNDS over all possible single reversal?\n\n Let me define:\n\n   Let the original array be A.\n\n   After reversing [l, r], the new array B is defined as:\n        B[i] = A[i] for i < l and i > r.\n        For i from l to r: B[i] = A[l + r - i]\n\n   We wish to compute the LNDS of B.\n\n Since the array is binary, the LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n   - The entire array (if we can form a chain that covers the whole array) but that is only possible if we have all 1's then all 2's.\n\n Actually, the LNDS in B is the maximum k such that there exists a subsequence of k elements that is non-decreasing.\n\n But note: we can skip arbitrarily. The best we can do is take all the 1's and then as many 2's as we can (but the 2's must appear after the last 1 in the subsequence). However, we can also take a 1 and then a 2, and then another 2, etc.\n\n Actually, the LNDS is the total number of 1's (if we take all 1's) plus the total number of 2's that appear after the last 1 in the entire array? Not exactly: because we might have 2's that appear before some 1's, but we cannot use those 2's if they are before a 1 (unless we skip the 1's that are after them). \n\n However, note: the entire sequence is fixed, and we are allowed to take any increasing indices. The constraint is that we cannot take a 2 and then a 1 (because 2>1). Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n   a) The total number of 1's (we can always take all 1's)\n   b) The total number of 2's (we can always take all 2's)\n   c) The sum of the count of 1's and 2's, but only if the 1's all come before the 2's? \n\n Actually, the standard way for a binary array [1,2] is: \n   Let x = number of 1's in the entire array.\n   Let y = number of 2's in the entire array.\n\n   Without reversal, the LNDS is max(x, y) if the 1's and 2's are arbitrarily arranged? Actually, no: we can have a chain that is a mix of 1's and 2's, but only if we take a 1 and then a 2 that comes later. However, we cannot take a 2 and then a 1. Therefore, the maximum chain is the entire array if the array is [1,1,...,1,2,2,...,2]. Otherwise, we can take all the 1's and then the 2's that are after the last 1 we took? But note: we can choose the order arbitrarily (by taking increasing indices). So the maximum chain is the total number of 1's plus the total number of 2's that occur after the last 1 in the array? \n\n However, we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. This reversal might bring some 2's to the left of some 1's, which breaks the chain. But note: we can also use the reversal to fix the ordering.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Let F(S) be the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the array S.\n\n   We wish to maximize F(B) over all contiguous intervals [l, r].\n\n Since the array is small (n<=2000) and the reversal operation is only one, we can try to use the following:\n\n   Precompute the entire array's LNDS without reversal: that's the base.\n\n   Then, note: the reversal operation only changes a contiguous segment. We can consider the effect of reversal on the entire array.\n\n However, we need an efficient way.\n\n Another idea: Instead of computing the LNDS for the entire array after reversal, we can note:\n\n   The entire array has a fixed set of 1's and 2's. The reversal operation doesn't change the multiset.\n\n   The LNDS in the entire array is the maximum k such that we can pick k elements (in increasing index order) that are either 1 or 2 and the sequence is non-decreasing.\n\n   Since the sequence is non-decreasing, we can have a run of 1's and then a run of 2's. The total length is (number of 1's we take) + (number of 2's we take). But we cannot take a 2 and then a 1.\n\n   Therefore, the entire LNDS is the maximum over two possibilities:\n\n     Possibility 1: Take all the 1's and then as many 2's as we can (without violating the non-decreasing condition). But note: we can skip some 1's to get to more 2's? Actually, no: because the 1's are smaller than 2's, we can take a 1 and then a 2, and then we cannot go back. The entire chain must be 1's and then 2's.\n\n   However, the chain does not require contiguous elements. We can take:\n\n        all the 1's that are available (but we must take them in increasing index order) and then all the 2's that are available (also in increasing index order) provided that the last 1 we take is before the first 2 we take? Actually, no: the indices of the 1's and 2's must be increasing. But we can interleave the 1's and 2's as long as we don't have a 2 then a 1.\n\n   Actually, the chain can be:\n\n        [some 1's (not necessarily contiguous) then some 2's (not necessarily contiguous)]\n\n   But note: the entire array is fixed. The chain must use increasing indices. So we can take:\n\n        Let I1 be the set of indices of 1's, and I2 be the set of indices of 2's.\n\n        Then the chain can be: take some subset of I1 (in increasing order) and then some subset of I2 (in increasing order) such that the maximum index in the chosen I1 is less than the minimum index in the chosen I2.\n\n   However, wait: we can also take a 1 and then a 2 that appears earlier? No, because the indices must be increasing. So the 2 must have an index greater than the last 1.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain is: all the 1's that are available, and then all the 2's that are available and have index greater than the last 1 we took. But note: we are allowed to skip 1's arbitrarily, so we can leave out some 1's to allow including 2's that are located between the skipped 1's? Actually, no: because if we skip a 1, we can still take a 2 that comes after that skipped 1? But then why would we skip a 1? The 1 is smaller, so including it doesn't break the chain. Actually, we can take all the 1's (even if they are scattered) and then all the 2's that occur after the last 1 we took (which is the last 1 in the entire array, because we take the 1's in increasing index order). \n\n   However, consider: we might have a 2 that appears before a 1. Then we cannot use that 2 if we are going to use the 1 that comes after it? Because then the chain would be ... then a 2 then a 1 (which is decreasing). So we have two types of 2's: those that are after the last 1 we took, and those that are before some 1's. But note: we are allowed to skip arbitrarily. So the chain is:\n\n        Step 1: Take all the 1's (because 1<=1) and then take all the 2's that are after the last 1 we took (which is the last occurrence of a 1 in the entire array? Not necessarily: we take the 1's in increasing index order, so the last 1 we take is the one with the largest index among the 1's we choose. But we can choose to skip some 1's to avoid having the last 1 being too early and missing some 2's that are after the skipped 1's? \n\n   Actually, the optimal chain is:\n\n        Let x = total number of 1's (we can take them all, because they are non-decreasing by themselves)\n        Let y = total number of 2's that have an index greater than the maximum index of the 1's we took.\n\n        But we are allowed to choose which 1's to take. To maximize the chain, we want to take as many 1's as possible and as many 2's as possible, but we cannot take a 2 that appears before a 1 we did not take.\n\n   Actually, we can break the array into three parts:\n\n        Part 1: Before the reversal segment\n        Part 2: The reversal segment (which is reversed)\n        Part 3: After the reversal segment\n\n   But note: the reversal operation changes the order of the segment.\n\n   However, there is a simpler way:\n\n   Claim: The maximum LNDS we can achieve is the entire length of the array (n) if we can arrange the entire array as [1,1,...,1,2,2,...,2] (i.e., all 1's then all 2's). But we can only reverse one contiguous segment. So the entire array might be already in the desired order, or we might be able to fix the entire array by reversing one segment.\n\n   But note: the reversal operation is contiguous. So if the array is not entirely sorted, we might fix multiple misplaced 1's and 2's by reversing a contiguous segment that contains the disorder.\n\n   However, we don't necessarily need the entire array to be sorted. We just need the entire array to be as close as possible to being sorted.\n\n   Another idea: The LNDS is the length of the longest chain that is 1's then 2's. The entire array has x 1's and y 2's, and the total length is x+y = n.\n\n   The chain length is x + (number of 2's that are after the last 1 in the chain). But note: we are allowed to choose which 1's and 2's to take.\n\n   Actually, we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that are not interrupted by a 1 that we didn't take. But wait: we are allowed to skip 1's. The best is to take all the 1's and then as many 2's as possible (from the entire array) provided that the last 1 we take is before the first 2 we take? Actually, no: the 2's we take must appear after the last 1 we take. But we can choose to not take a 1 at the end to allow taking more 2's that are located earlier? \n\n   Example: [1,2,1] \n        Without reversal: \n            We can take the first 1 and then the 2 -> length=2.\n            Or the second 1 -> length=1.\n            Or the first 1 and the last 1 -> but 1<=1, so that's allowed, but then we cannot take the 2 because the 2 is in the middle and we already passed it? Actually, the chain must be in increasing index. So we can take:\n                [index0:1, index1:2] -> length=2\n                [index0:1, index2:1] -> length=2\n                [index1:2] -> length=1\n                [index2:1] -> length=1\n            So maximum is 2.\n\n        Now, if we reverse [1,2] (the first two): becomes [2,1,1] -> then the chain: \n            [index0:2] -> 1\n            [index1:1, index2:1] -> 2\n            [index0:2] cannot be combined with anything because then we would need a 1 after index0, but then 2<=1 is false.\n            So maximum is 2.\n\n        If we reverse [2,3] (the last two): becomes [1,1,2] -> then the chain is [1,1,2] (length=3) or [1,1] (length=2) -> maximum 3.\n\n   So the reversal of [2,3] gives 3.\n\n   Why? Because now the entire array is [1,1,2]: we can take the first 1, the second 1, and the third 2 -> that's 3.\n\n   Therefore, the chain is built by taking all the 1's (which are at the beginning) and then the 2's (which are at the end). \n\n   So the goal is to have as many 1's as possible at the beginning and then as many 2's as possible at the end.\n\n   The entire array has x 1's and y 2's. The maximum chain is x+y = n, if the entire array is sorted (all 1's then all 2's). Otherwise, we might not be able to achieve n, but we can try to maximize the chain.\n\n   How to compute the maximum chain length we can achieve by reversing one contiguous segment?\n\n   Let:\n        Let the original array be A.\n\n   We are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. We wish to maximize the chain length, which is the total number of 1's and 2's we can take in increasing index order, and the chain must be 1's then 2's (with no 2 followed by 1).\n\n   The chain is limited by:\n\n        We can take at most x 1's (the total 1's) and at most y 2's (the total 2's). But the chain must be in increasing index, and the 2's we take must appear after the last 1 we take.\n\n   Therefore, the chain length is:\n\n        (# of 1's taken) + (# of 2's taken)\n\n   and the condition is: the last 1 taken must be at an index less than the first 2 taken.\n\n   However, we can choose the 1's and 2's arbitrarily (as long as the indices are increasing). So the maximum chain is:\n\n        Let L = the total number of 1's (we can take all) and R = the total number of 2's (we can take all) but we cannot take a 2 that appears before the last 1 we took.\n\n   But note: we can choose the order of taking the 1's and 2's arbitrarily (because we can skip). The constraint is that once we take a 2, we cannot take a 1 after that.\n\n   Actually, we can take a 2 only if we have not taken any 1 that appears after that 2? \n\n   Let me clarify: the chain must be non-decreasing. So if we take a 2 at position i and then a 1 at position j (with j>i), then 2<=1 is false. So we cannot take a 1 after a 2.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain is:\n\n        Some 1's (from the entire array, but we cannot take a 1 that appears after a 2 we took) and then some 2's (from the entire array, but we cannot take a 2 that appears before a 1 we took).\n\n   Actually, the condition is: we can take a 1 at position i and then a 2 at position j only if i<j. And we cannot take a 2 at position i and then a 1 at position j (if i<j) because 2<=1 is false.\n\n   But note: we can take a 1 at position i, skip a 2 at position j (with i<j), and then take a 1 at position k (with k>j) and then a 2 at position l (with l>k). So the condition is: the 1's we take must all come before the 2's we take.\n\n   Therefore, the entire chain is:\n\n        All the 1's that are available (we can take them all) and then all the 2's that are available, but the catch is: we cannot take a 2 that appears before a 1 that we decided to skip? Actually, no: we can skip 1's arbitrarily. The rule is: once we take a 2, we cannot take any 1 that appears after that 2.\n\n   So the chain is:\n\n        Let i1 < i2 < ... < ik be the indices of the 1's we take.\n        Let j1 < j2 < ... < jl be the indices of the 2's we take.\n\n        And the last index of the 1's (ik) must be less than the first index of the 2's (j1).\n\n   Therefore, the chain length is k+l.\n\n   How to maximize k+l?\n\n   We can choose to not take some 1's to allow taking more 2's that appear earlier? \n\n   Example: [1,2,1] \n        Total 1's = 2, total 2's = 1.\n\n        Without reversal: \n            We can take the first 1 and then the 2 -> chain length=2.\n            Or we can take the second 1 -> chain length=1.\n            Or we can take the first 1 and the second 1 -> chain length=2 (but then we cannot take the 2 because the 2 is at index1 which is between the two 1's, and we already took the 1 at index2? Actually, we can take the 1's in increasing index order: [index0, index2] and then we cannot take the 2 because the 2 is at index1 which is between index0 and index2, and we are not forced to take contiguous elements. But note: the chain must be increasing in indices. We can take the 1 at index0 and then the 1 at index2, but then we cannot take the 2 at index1 because the index1 is between 0 and 2, and we are allowed to skip arbitrarily, but the 2 at index1 is after index0 and before index2. However, the condition for the chain is that the values must be non-decreasing. We can take the 1 at index0 and then the 2 at index1 (value 2>=1) and then we cannot take the 1 at index2 because 2<=1 is false. \n\n        Actually, the chain must be strictly increasing in indices. We can choose any increasing indices. So the chain [index0, index2] is valid because the values are [1,1] (non-decreasing). But then we cannot add the 2 at index1 because index1 is between 0 and 2, but we are allowed to take non-adjacent indices. However, the chain [index0, index2] uses indices 0 and 2. We could also take the chain [index0, index1, index2] but that would be [1,2,1] -> which is not non-decreasing (because 2<=1 fails). \n\n        So the maximum chain is 2.\n\n   After reversing [2,3] (last two elements) we get [1,1,2]. Then we can take all three: [index0, index1, index2] -> [1,1,2] is non-decreasing.\n\n   How did the reversal help? It moved the 2 to the end and the last 1 to the middle. Then the entire array is [1,1,2] so we can take all.\n\n   Therefore, the chain length is the total number of 1's (which is 2) plus the total number of 2's (which is 1) if we can arrange the array so that all 1's come before all 2's. \n\n   But note: the reversal operation is contiguous. We can only reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n   So the problem reduces to: by reversing one contiguous segment, what is the maximum number of 1's we can have at the beginning and the rest (which will be 2's) at the end?\n\n   Actually, the entire array has x 1's and y 2's. The best chain is x+y (the entire array) if we can arrange the array so that all 1's are at the beginning and all 2's at the end. \n\n   But we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. We wish to maximize the chain length, which is the total number of 1's and 2's we can take in increasing index order (with no 2 then 1) but note: we can also take a chain that is not the entire array.\n\n   However, note: the chain does not have to be the entire array. But the entire array is the maximum possible chain (n). So if we can achieve the entire array being sorted (all 1's then all 2's) then the chain length is n.\n\n   But if not, then we can try to maximize the number of 1's at the beginning and 2's at the end.\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let B be the final array after reversing one contiguous segment.\n\n        Let i be the first index where B[i] == 2 and B[j]==1 for some j>i. Then the chain cannot include that 2 and any 1 after it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n        Let f(l, r) be the array after reversing [l, r]. We wish to compute the length of the longest chain in f(l, r).\n\n        The chain is the entire array if the array is sorted (all 1's then 2's). Otherwise, the chain breaks when we see a 2 followed by a 1.\n\n        But note: the chain does not require contiguous elements, so even if the array is not sorted, we might be able to skip the 2's that are out of place.\n\n   However, the chain is defined by the values and the indices. We can always take all the 1's and then all the 2's that appear after the last 1 we took (which is the last 1 in the array). But wait: what if there is a 2 that appears before a 1? Then we cannot use that 2 if we want to use the 1 that comes after it. But we can choose to not take the 1 that comes after the 2, and then use that 2 and then take other 2's? \n\n   Actually, the best chain is:\n\n        We can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that are located after the last 1 we take (which is the last 1 in the array). But note: if there is a 2 that appears before a 1, then if we take that 2, we cannot take the 1 that appears after it. So we have a trade-off.\n\n   Let T = total_ones + total_twos = n.\n\n   We wish to maximize: (# of 1's taken) + (# of 2's taken)\n\n   subject to: the last 1 taken must be before the first 2 taken.\n\n   But note: we can also have a chain that is only 1's or only 2's.\n\n   However, the entire array has fixed 1's and 2's. The trade-off is: if we take a 2 that appears early, we cannot take any 1 that appears after that 2.\n\n   Let:\n\n        Let A be the original array.\n\n        Let's define:\n\n          Let left[i] = the number of 1's from the start to index i.\n          Let right[i] = the number of 2's from index i to the end.\n\n        But then what happens after reversal? \n\n   This seems complicated.\n\n   Let me try a different approach:\n\n        The entire array has x 1's and y 2's. The maximum possible chain length is min(n, x+y) = n (since x+y=n). But we can achieve n only if the array is sorted (all 1's then 2's). Otherwise, we might not be able to achieve n.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. We wish to know the maximum chain length we can achieve.\n\n        Consider: the chain length is the total number of 1's and 2's we can take without having a 2 followed by a 1. \n\n        We can break the array into three parts: \n          Part1: [0, l-1]\n          Part2: [l, r] (reversed)\n          Part3: [r+1, n-1]\n\n        We wish to choose [l, r] to maximize the chain.\n\n        The chain is built by:\n\n          We can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that are not blocked by a 1 that we haven't taken.\n\n        But note: the reversal might change the order in the middle.\n\n   However, note that the array is binary. There is a known fact: the longest non-decreasing subsequence for a binary array is the length of the array minus the length of the longest alternating subsequence? Not exactly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate the effect of reversing a segment by precomputing:\n\n        Let L1[i] = the number of 1's from 0 to i.\n        Let L2[i] = the number of 2's from i to n-1.\n\n        But then the reversal of [l, r] will change the counts in the segment? No, the counts of 1's and 2's in the segment remain the same.\n\n        However, the issue is the ordering.\n\n   Another idea: the reversal operation is allowed only once. We wish to maximize the chain, which is the entire array if we can arrange the array to be sorted. Otherwise, we wish to minimize the number of \"bad\" pairs (2 followed by 1) that break the chain.\n\n   But note: the chain does not require contiguous elements. We can skip bad elements.\n\n   The chain is valid if we never have a 2 and then a 1 in the chain. But the chain is selected from the entire array. The reversal operation might change the positions of 1's and 2's.\n\n   Let me define:\n\n        Let's say we want to find the longest chain that is 1's then 2's. The chain is determined by:\n\n          We can take a 1 at position i and a 2 at position j only if i < j.\n\n          The chain is the union of all 1's and 2's we take, and the condition is that no 2 is taken that appears before a 1 that is taken.\n\n        This is equivalent to: the chain is all the 1's and 2's such that the last 1 in the chain (by index) is before the first 2 in the chain (by index).\n\n        But note: the chain is not required to be contiguous.\n\n   Therefore, the chain length is the total number of 1's and 2's in the array if we can order them by index (which they are) and the entire array has no 2 followed by 1? Actually, no: the entire",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary array (containing only 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous segment. The key observation here is that the LNDS in such a binary array is essentially the total number of 1s followed by 2s in increasing order. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The array consists of 1s and 2s. The LNDS can be the entire array if all 1s come before all 2s. Otherwise, it is the sum of all 1s and 2s that can be arranged in a non-decreasing sequence without any 2 appearing before a 1.\n2. **Insight**: Reversing a contiguous segment can help bring 1s to the front and 2s to the back. The goal is to find the segment reversal that maximizes the number of 1s at the beginning and 2s at the end of the array.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Calculate the number of 1s up to each index (prefix_ones) and the number of 2s from each index to the end (suffix_twos). These arrays help in quickly determining the count of 1s and 2s in any segment.\n   - **Sliding Window for Segment Evaluation**: For each possible segment [l, r], compute the effect of reversing it on the counts of 1s and 2s in the prefix and suffix parts of the array. The total LNDS for the modified array is then the sum of 1s in the prefix part plus the sum of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment plus the sum of 2s in the suffix part.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves O(n^2) operations due to checking all possible segments, which is feasible since n is up to 2000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    prefix_ones = [0] * n\n    suffix_twos = [0] * n\n    \n    count_ones = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] == 1:\n            count_ones += 1\n        prefix_ones[i] = count_ones\n        \n    count_twos = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if arr[i] == 2:\n            count_twos += 1\n        suffix_twos[i] = count_twos\n        \n    best = 0\n    for l in range(n):\n        ones_in_prefix = prefix_ones[l-1] if l-1 >= 0 else 0\n        twos_in_suffix = suffix_twos[l] if l < n else 0\n        \n        ones_in_segment = 0\n        twos_in_segment = 0\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            if arr[r] == 1:\n                ones_in_segment += 1\n            else:\n                twos_in_segment += 1\n                \n            total_ones = ones_in_prefix + ones_in_segment\n            total_twos = twos_in_segment + twos_in_suffix\n            \n            candidate = total_ones + min(total_twos, (n - total_ones))\n            if candidate > best:\n                best = candidate\n                \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: The `prefix_ones` array stores the cumulative count of 1s from the start up to each index. The `suffix_twos` array stores the cumulative count of 2s from each index to the end of the array.\n2. **Segment Evaluation**: For each possible segment starting at index `l`, the code calculates the number of 1s in the prefix (before `l`) and 2s in the suffix (after the segment). Within the segment, it counts the 1s and 2s.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: The candidate LNDS value is computed as the sum of 1s in the prefix and the segment, plus the minimum of 2s in the segment and suffix, ensuring no 2 appears before a 1 in the final sequence.\n4. **Result**: The maximum candidate value across all segments is printed as the result, representing the longest non-decreasing subsequence achievable after reversing any one contiguous segment.",
