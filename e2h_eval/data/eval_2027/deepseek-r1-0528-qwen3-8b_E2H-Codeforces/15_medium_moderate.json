They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string s of length n.\n The tournament has 2^n teams, with skill levels being a permutation of [1, 2, ..., 2^n].\n The string s has n characters. Each character at index i (0-indexed) corresponds to the result pattern for the (n-i)-th phase?\n Actually, note: \n   In the first phase, there are 2^(n-1) games (so that's the last phase in terms of rounds? Actually, the problem says:\n   - First phase: 2^(n-1) games (round 1)\n   - Second phase: 2^(n-2) games (round 2) ... until the last phase which is 1 game.\n\n But note: the problem says the string s is such that if s_i is '0', then in the i-th phase (which has 2^(n-i) games) the lower skill wins; if '1', the higher skill wins.\n\n However, note the indexing: the problem says \"the i-th phase\", meaning the phase with 2^(n-i) games. So the first phase (i=0) is the one with 2^(n-0) = 2^n games? \n Wait, let me read again: \n   \"in the first phase: split into pairs: 2^(n-1) games\"\n   Then second phase: 2^(n-2) games.\n\n So actually, the phases are from the first round (with the most games) to the final. Therefore, the string s is given in order from the first phase (which is the first character) to the last phase (which is the last character).\n\n But note: the problem says \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games), ...\" \n\n Let me clarify: \n   i=0: phase with 2^(n-0) = 2^n games? That doesn't match because the first phase has 2^(n-1) games.\n\n Correction: Actually, the problem says the tournament has 2^n teams and the first phase (phase 1) has 2^(n-1) games. Then the next phase has 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n Therefore, the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games? \n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: \"3\\n101\" -> n=3, so total teams 8. \n      Phase 0: 2^(3-1)=4 games? But wait, the problem says the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, which is 4 for n=3.\n\n However, the string s has length n, and the first character (s_0) corresponds to the first phase (which is the one with 2^(n-1) games). Then the second phase (s_1) is the next, with 2^(n-2) games, and so on until the last phase (s_{n-1}) has 2^(n-n)=1 game.\n\n Therefore, the i-th character (0-indexed) in s corresponds to the (i+1)-th phase, which has 2^(n-i-1) games? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\" -> wait, no:\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\".\n\n However, note: \n   i=0: 2^(n-0) = 2^n games -> but the first phase only has 2^(n-1) games.\n\n There seems to be a discrepancy. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n   \"The tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games. They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 vs team 2, team 3 vs team 4, and so on (so, 2^(n-1) games are played in that phase).\"\n\n Then: \"After that, only 2^(n-1) teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where 2^(n-2) games are played: ...\"\n\n So the phases are:\n   Phase 1: 2^(n-1) games -> this is the first phase (i=0) but the problem says the i-th phase has 2^(n-i) games? \n        For i=0: 2^(n-0) = 2^n -> which is not 2^(n-1).\n\n Alternatively, maybe the problem indexes the phases from 0 to n-1, but the number of games in the i-th phase is 2^(n-i-1)? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\".\n\n But wait, the example input \"3\\n101\": \n   n=3, so the first phase (i=0) should have 2^(3-0)=8 games? But we start with 8 teams and the first phase only has 4 games.\n\n I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Let me compare with the example output.\n\n Example input: \n   3\n   101\n\n Output: 4 5 6 7\n\n How does that work?\n\n Alternative interpretation: the problem might mean that the i-th character (from left to right) corresponds to the phase that eliminates from 2^(n-i) teams down to 2^(n-i-1) teams.\n\n Actually, the tournament structure is fixed: \n   Total games: 2^n - 1, and the number of games in each phase (from the first to the last) is 2^(n-1), 2^(n-2), ... , 1.\n\n Therefore, the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games.\n\n But the problem says: \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\".\n\n This is inconsistent. \n\n Let me reexamine the example: \n   Input: n=3, s=\"101\"\n   The tournament has 8 teams.\n\n   The first phase (i=0) has 4 games (so 2^(3-1)=4). According to the problem, the i-th phase (i=0) is defined by 2^(n-i)=8? But that doesn't match.\n\n I think the problem intended to say: the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games. Or perhaps they meant the phase index is from 1 to n, and the i-th phase (starting from the first) has 2^(n-i) games.\n\n But note: \n   Phase 1: 2^(n-1) = 2^(3-1)=4 -> matches.\n   Phase 2: 2^(n-2)=2 -> matches the example: second phase has 2 games.\n   Phase 3: 2^(n-3)=1 -> matches.\n\n So the i-th phase (if we consider i starting at 1) has 2^(n-i) games.\n\n But the input string s is given for n characters, and the problem says \"the i-th phase\" (probably i from 0 to n-1) meaning the (i+1)-th phase.\n\n Therefore, the i-th character (0-indexed) in s corresponds to the (i+1)-th phase, which has 2^(n-(i+1)) = 2^(n-i-1) games.\n\n So the problem's description might be slightly off: it should say \"the (i+1)-th phase\" or adjust the exponent.\n\n Since the problem says \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\", that would be the (i+1)-th phase having 2^(n-i) games. But wait, for i=0: 2^(n-0)=2^n, which is too many.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended the exponent to be (n-i-1). \n\n Given the example, let's stick to the fact that the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, the second 2^(n-2), etc.\n\n We'll assume that the i-th character (0-indexed) in s corresponds to the phase that reduces the number of teams from 2^(n-i) to 2^(n-i-1) (so the phase after the first i phases). \n\n Actually, the elimination pattern:\n\n   After phase 0 (first phase): 2^(n-1) games, so 2^(n-1) winners.\n   After phase 1: 2^(n-2) games, so 2^(n-2) winners.\n\n Therefore, the i-th phase (0-indexed) is responsible for reducing the number of teams from 2^(n-i) to 2^(n-i-1) (by playing 2^(n-i-1) games). \n\n And the problem says: \"during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\" -> wait, that would be 2^(n-i) games? But we just said that the i-th phase has 2^(n-i-1) games.\n\n So the problem statement says the i-th phase has 2^(n-i) games, but we know it's 2^(n-i-1). \n\n There is an off-by-one error in the problem statement. \n\n However, the example input \"3\\n101\" leads to the output \"4 5 6 7\", meaning the winning integers are from 4 to 7.\n\n How to solve the problem?\n\n We are to determine which integers x (from 1 to 2^n) can be the champion.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know the entire bracket structure: the first round (phase 0) has 2^(n-1) games, then 2^(n-2), etc.\n\n 2. The outcome of each game is determined by the string s. For the i-th phase (0-indexed), if s[i]=='1', then the higher-skilled team wins; if '0', the lower-skilled team wins.\n\n 3. We need to check for a permutation p (which is a bijection from {1,...,2^n} to itself) such that the team with skill x becomes the champion.\n\n Observation:\n\n Instead of trying all permutations (which is too expensive: 2^n! is huge), we need to use the structure of the tournament.\n\n The tournament is a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves and 2^n-1 nodes. The winner of the tournament is the team that wins all the games it plays.\n\n However, the outcome of each game depends on the skill levels of the two teams and the rule of the phase.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can simulate the tournament by considering the bracket and the conditions imposed by s.\n\n But note: the bracket is fixed: the initial seeding is by the natural order (team 1,2,...,2^n). \n\n However, the problem does not specify that the bracket is fixed by the initial order? Actually, the first phase: \n   \"team 1 vs team 2\", \"team 3 vs team 4\", etc.\n\n So the bracket is fixed: the first half (teams 1..2^(n-1)) and the second half (teams 2^(n-1)+1..2^n) are separated, and within each half, the same pattern.\n\n But note: the next phase: \n   \"the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\", then \"the winner of the game '5 vs 6' plays against the winner of the game '7 vs 8'\".\n\n So the bracket is fixed: the first quarterfinal is between the winner of the first two teams and the next two, then the next two, etc.\n\n However, the outcome of each game is determined by the skill levels and the rule of the phase.\n\n We are allowed to assign the skills arbitrarily (any permutation). So we are to decide for which x there exists an assignment of the 2^n distinct skills (from 1 to 2^n) such that the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Conditions:\n\n Let the team x be assigned a particular position in the bracket. But note: we can assign the skills arbitrarily, so we can choose which team (which leaf) gets which skill.\n\n However, the bracket is fixed: the initial positions (leaves) are fixed. But we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n So we can assign the numbers 1..2^n arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n Then, the tournament proceeds as described.\n\n Steps for a fixed x:\n\n We wish to assign the numbers 1..2^n to the leaves such that:\n\n   - The team with number x wins the tournament.\n\n   - The outcome of each game in the i-th phase (0-indexed) is determined by s[i]: if s[i]=='1', the higher number wins; if '0', the lower number wins.\n\n But note: the numbers we assign are the skill levels, and the problem says the permutation p is the assignment of skills to the teams. The teams are numbered from 1 to 2^n, and the bracket is fixed: the first game is between the team that we assign to leaf1 and leaf2, etc.\n\n However, we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves. So we can choose which leaf gets x.\n\n But note: the bracket structure is fixed: the winner must win all the games it participates in. And the opponent in each round is determined by the bracket.\n\n How do we assign the other numbers? We have to assign the remaining 2^n-1 numbers arbitrarily to the other leaves.\n\n However, the condition for each game is determined by the two numbers and the rule of the phase.\n\n We can think of the tournament as a set of conditions that the number x must satisfy.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a recursive (or iterative) method to determine the necessary conditions for x to win.\n\n Idea:\n\n Consider the entire tournament as a binary tree. The root is the champion. The champion must win n rounds.\n\n In each round, the champion (or a candidate) must face an opponent. The outcome is determined by the rule of the phase and the relative ordering of the two numbers.\n\n However, the opponent in the next round is the winner of another subtree.\n\n We can traverse the bracket and for each node (game) that x must win, we can determine constraints on the numbers in the opposite subtree.\n\n But note: we can assign the numbers arbitrarily. So we can choose the entire assignment. However, the condition is that x must win, and we are free to assign the other numbers arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and cover the set {1,2,...,2^n} without x).\n\n Conditions for x to win a particular game (at a particular phase i) in the bracket:\n\n   In the game, x is one of the two teams. Let the other team have skill y.\n\n   Then, according to s[i]:\n      If s[i]=='1': x must be greater than y.\n      If s[i]=='0': x must be less than y.\n\n However, the opponent y is the winner of a subtree. In that subtree, the winner must be someone from the set of numbers we assign to that subtree.\n\n Moreover, the entire set of numbers is fixed (all numbers from 1 to 2^n). We can assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the numbers in the subtrees arbitrarily (except that the number x is fixed in one leaf).\n\n But note: the assignment must be a permutation. So the numbers in the two subtrees (for a given game) must be disjoint, and together with x (if x is in one of the subtrees) must form a subset.\n\n However, the tournament tree is fixed: the bracket is fixed. The path from the champion to the leaves is fixed.\n\n But wait: we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves. So we can choose which leaf is x. Therefore, we can choose the position of x arbitrarily in the bracket.\n\n Then, the problem becomes: is there a way to assign the numbers 1 to 2^n to the leaves (including x) such that when we run the tournament with the rules given by s, x wins.\n\n However, note: the bracket structure is fixed (the initial pairing). The first round: leaves 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, ... 2^(n-1)-1 vs 2^(n-1). Then the next round: the winner of (1,2) vs (3,4) is determined by the next rule, etc.\n\n But we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves, so we can choose the leaf that gets x. Then, the rest of the numbers are assigned arbitrarily to the other leaves.\n\n Then, we require that:\n\n   - In the first round, the leaf containing x must win its first round game (if the game is in the first round) OR if the leaf containing x is not in the first round (but wait, all leaves are in the first round) then x must be able to win the first round, then the second, etc.\n\n However, note: the bracket is fixed. The leaf positions are fixed. We can assign x to any leaf. Then we must assign the other numbers arbitrarily.\n\n But the assignment must be consistent: the entire set of numbers is fixed.\n\n How to check for a fixed x?\n\n We can try to assign the numbers to the leaves such that:\n\n   Condition 1: The leaf assigned x must be in a position that, given the bracket, can lead to victory.\n\n   Condition 2: The opponents in each round must be chosen appropriately.\n\n However, note: the rules for each phase are fixed. The entire tournament is deterministic once the assignment is fixed.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Since we can assign arbitrarily, we can choose the set of numbers that will be in the path from the champion to the root. The champion must be x.\n\n For the champion to win, in each round the opponent must satisfy:\n\n   Round 0 (first round): \n        Let the two numbers in the first round game that contains x be x and y0.\n        Then, if s[0]=='1', we require x > y0; if '0', then x < y0.\n\n   Then, the opponent in the second round is the winner of the adjacent two games (which we can control arbitrarily as long as we don't use x again and use distinct numbers). \n\n However, we have to assign all numbers. We can think greedily:\n\n   We want to assign the smallest possible numbers to the parts that must be greater than x (if the rule requires that x must be greater) and the largest to the parts that must be smaller (if the rule requires x to be smaller).\n\n But note: the bracket is fixed. The champion must go through a fixed set of opponents (each being the winner of a subtree). The entire set of numbers is fixed.\n\n We can use the following:\n\n   Let F(x) be true if there exists an assignment such that x wins.\n\n   We can consider the entire set of 2^n numbers. We remove x. Then we need to assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n   The tournament requires that x wins all its games. For each round, the opponent must be a number that satisfies the condition (either strictly greater or strictly less, depending on s[i]).\n\n   Moreover, the opponents must be winners of their own subtrees, and the numbers in the subtree must be assigned arbitrarily (but distinct).\n\n   We can use a divide and conquer approach on the bracket.\n\n   The bracket is a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves. The champion must be in one leaf, and then it must beat the winner of the adjacent leaf (then the next adjacent, etc.)\n\n   But note: the bracket is built as:\n\n        Round 0: leaves 0,1,2,...,2^n-1.\n        Round 1: winners of (0,1), (2,3), ... (2^(n-1)-2, 2^(n-1)-1)\n\n   However, the problem uses 1-indexed team numbering: team1, team2, ... team(2^n). So the leaves are fixed.\n\n   We can choose which leaf gets x. Then the rest of the leaves get the remaining numbers.\n\n   The condition for the first round: the leaf with x must be paired with some other leaf. The outcome of the first round is determined by the rule s[0] and the two numbers.\n\n   Then the next round: the winner (x) must play the winner of the adjacent two. The condition for that game is given by s[1].\n\n   We can traverse the bracket and for each node (game) that x must win, we can determine the constraints on the entire subtree that feeds into that game.\n\n   Specifically, for a node (game) that x must win (if we are at the node where x is present) then:\n\n        Let the two children of this node be two subtrees. One of them is the leaf x (if we are at the leaf level) or the subtree that contains x.\n\n        Then, the other subtree must provide a number (the winner of that subtree) that satisfies: \n            if s[i]=='1', then x must be greater than the winner of the other subtree.\n            if s[i]=='0', then x must be less than the winner of the other subtree.\n\n        But note: the winner of the other subtree is the maximum (if the rule for that entire subtree is '1') or the minimum (if the rule for that entire subtree is '0') of the numbers assigned to that subtree? \n\n        Actually, the entire subtree has its own set of games with their own rules (given by the subsequent characters in s). The winner of the subtree is determined by the rules.\n\n   However, the rules are fixed for each phase (each level). The entire bracket is fixed.\n\n   We can precompute for each node (each game) the condition on the two numbers that feed into it, given the rule for that node and the rules for the subtree.\n\n   But note: the rule for the game at a particular depth (phase) is given by s[i], and the depth i corresponds to the round (phase) index.\n\n   We know the round (phase) index for each game: the root is at round n-1 (last phase) and the leaves are at round 0.\n\n   Actually, the first phase (round 0) uses s[0], the next s[1], until the last phase (round n-1) uses s[n-1].\n\n   The tournament has n rounds (phases).\n\n   How to compute the constraints?\n\n   We can define a function that, for a given contiguous block of leaves (say from L to R, which forms a complete sub-bracket of size 2^k) and the rules from a certain index (say from index i to n-1) and knowing that one of the leaves in this block is fixed to x (and we wish to know if x can be the winner of this entire block), we can compute whether it is possible.\n\n   However, note: we can choose the assignment arbitrarily, so we are free to assign the other numbers arbitrarily. The only fixed number is x (and we are assuming that x is one of the leaves in this block).\n\n   But we must also remember that the entire set of numbers is fixed (from 1 to 2^n). So the numbers in different blocks must not overlap.\n\n   We can use a recursive function that, for a given block (with a fixed set of leaves) and a starting phase index (from 0 to n-1), returns:\n\n        (min_value, max_value) that the winner of this block must have, if the goal is to have x win the entire tournament and x is located in this block.\n\n   However, we are not fixing the entire block's numbers, but we know the set of numbers that must be used in the entire tournament.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: what are the necessary conditions on the entire set of numbers?\n\n   Since we can assign arbitrarily, we can choose the numbers in the subtrees arbitrarily (as long as they are distinct and cover the set without x). Therefore, the only constraints are:\n\n        In each round that x participates, the immediate opponent must be chosen appropriately.\n\n   But note: the opponent is the winner of a subtree. The winner of a subtree is the maximum (if all the rules in that subtree are '1') or the minimum (if all the rules are '0')? Not exactly: the rules for the subtree are given by the subsequent characters in s.\n\n   Actually, the entire subtree has a set of rules (a string t of length k, where k is the depth of the subtree). The winner of the subtree is determined by the rules: \n\n        In the first phase of the subtree (the innermost games) the rule is the first character of t, then the next, etc.\n\n   But note: the rule for the entire subtree is fixed. The winner of the subtree is the number that wins the entire subtree.\n\n   How to compute the winner of a subtree with a given set of rules? \n\n        In a subtree with k rounds (so 2^k leaves), the winner must be the number that, when compared with the rest, wins all the games in the subtree according to the rules.\n\n        However, we can assign arbitrarily the numbers to the leaves of the subtree. So the winner of the subtree can be any number we want, provided we assign the rest appropriately.\n\n        But wait: we cannot assign arbitrarily the numbers to the entire tournament. The entire tournament uses distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n. However, we are free to choose which numbers go to which part.\n\n   Actually, the problem is: we wish to assign the entire set {1,2,...,2^n} to the leaves, and then run the tournament.\n\n   We can break the problem into independent subtrees? \n\n   However, the entire set is fixed, so the numbers in different parts must be disjoint.\n\n   We can use the following idea:\n\n        The tournament is fixed. The champion must be the number that, in every round, beats the winner of the adjacent subtree.\n\n        We can consider the entire tournament as a sequence of comparisons. The champion must be greater than (if rule is '1') or less than (if rule is '0') the winner of the other half of the bracket at the first round, then the next, etc.\n\n        But note: the bracket is fixed. The first round: the champion must beat the first opponent (which is the winner of the adjacent two). The first opponent is the winner of the next two, and so on.\n\n        However, the entire bracket is a balanced binary tree.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n        Since we can assign arbitrarily, we can choose the numbers in the entire bracket arbitrarily (except x). Then, the condition for x to win is that there exists an assignment of the remaining numbers such that:\n\n          In the first round: the opponent of x must be chosen appropriately (if the rule is '1', then x must be greater than the opponent; if '0', then less).\n\n          Then, the next opponent (the winner of the adjacent two) must be chosen appropriately, and so on.\n\n        We can simulate the tournament by keeping track of the set of numbers that are available for the opponent's subtree.\n\n        We can use a recursive function that, given a node (with two children subtrees) and the rule for this node, and the set of numbers already used, and the requirement for the winner of this node (which is x for the champion, but for intermediate nodes it is the winner of the subtree), determines if it is possible.\n\n   But the state space is too large (2^n numbers, n up to 18 -> 2^18 = 262144, which is acceptable for some methods but the recursion over the entire tree might be too heavy).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a greedy assignment: \n\n        We know the entire set S = {1,2,...,2^n} and we remove x. Then, we wish to assign the rest.\n\n        The tournament requires that in each round, the winner must be the one that satisfies the rule.\n\n        We can consider the entire tournament as a set of conditions that force x to be above or below certain thresholds.\n\n        Specifically, the champion x must be able to beat the entire \"path\" of opponents. The opponents are the winners of the subtrees, and the winners of the subtrees are forced to be either the maximum or the minimum in their respective subtrees.\n\n        However, the rules for the subtree are fixed. The winner of a subtree of size m (2^k leaves) with rule string t (of length k) is:\n\n            It is the number that, when the tournament is run on that subtree with the rules t, wins.\n\n            But we can assign arbitrarily the numbers to the leaves of the subtree. Therefore, the winner of the subtree can be any number we wish, provided we assign the rest appropriately.\n\n        However, the catch is that the same number cannot appear twice and the entire set is fixed.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for the champion x is:\n\n            There must be a way to assign the other numbers to the entire bracket such that:\n\n                In the first round, the immediate opponent is a number y0 that satisfies (if s[0]=='1' then x>y0 else x<y0).\n\n                Then, in the next round, the opponent is the winner of the next two (which is a number y1 that satisfies (if s[1]=='1' then x>y1 else x<y1)), and so on.\n\n        But note: the opponent in the second round is the winner of a subtree of two leaves. We can assign arbitrarily the two leaves. So we can choose y1 to be any number (from the remaining numbers) that satisfies the condition (relative to x) and then the two leaves must be assigned numbers that allow y1 to win its two-leaf tournament.\n\n        For a two-leaf tournament (one game) with rule s[1]:\n\n            If s[1]=='1': then the winner is the maximum of the two numbers.\n            If s[1]=='0': then the winner is the minimum.\n\n        Therefore, for the subtree of two leaves, we can choose two numbers arbitrarily (from the remaining ones) and set y1 to be the maximum (if rule '1') or minimum (if rule '0').\n\n        Similarly, for a larger subtree, we can choose a set of numbers and then the winner of that subtree can be any number we want, provided we can arrange the assignment within the subtree so that that number wins.\n\n        But note: we are constrained by the entire set of numbers. We must assign distinct numbers.\n\n   Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for x to be the champion is:\n\n        There exists an assignment of the entire set {1,2,...,2^n}\\{x} to the leaves (with x in a fixed leaf) such that:\n\n            For each round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1):\n\n                Let A_i be the set of numbers that are available for the entire subtree (the two halves) that meet x in round i.\n\n                Then, we can choose a number y_i (from the available numbers) for the immediate opponent such that:\n\n                    if s[i]=='1', then x > y_i;\n                    if s[i]=='0', then x < y_i.\n\n                Additionally, the rest of the numbers in the opponent's subtree must be assignable so that y_i wins that subtree.\n\n        And for the subtree of the opponent (which has size 2^(n-i-1)) with the rule string s[i+1:] (if any), we can assign arbitrarily the numbers (except y_i) and then the winner of that subtree must be y_i.\n\n        But note: the entire set of numbers is fixed, so we must also ensure that the numbers chosen for the opponent's subtree do not conflict with the numbers needed for the other parts.\n\n   However, we can choose the assignment arbitrarily, so we can reserve the necessary numbers for each part.\n\n   We can use a two-pass method:\n\n        Let T = 2^n.\n\n        We need to assign numbers to the entire bracket. The champion is x.\n\n        The tournament has n rounds. In round i, the champion x must defeat a number y_i (which is the winner of the other half of the current bracket). \n\n        The value y_i must be chosen from the set of numbers not yet used and must satisfy the condition (x>y_i or x<y_i) based on s[i].\n\n        Moreover, the entire subtree that produces y_i must be won by y_i. What are the constraints on the set of numbers in that subtree?\n\n        For the subtree that produces y_i (with size 2^(n-i-1)) and rules s[i+1:], we need to know: what is the minimal and maximal number that can be the winner of that subtree, given that we can assign arbitrarily the numbers (from the available set) to the leaves of that subtree.\n\n        However, the winner of a subtree of size m (with m=2^k) and rule string t (of length k) is:\n\n            The winner must be one of the numbers assigned to that subtree. \n\n            But we can assign arbitrarily, so the winner can be any number in the assigned set. However, the rule string t imposes an order: the winner must win all the games in the subtree according to t.\n\n            In fact, the winner of the subtree must be the number that is \"strongest\" according to the rules. \n\n            We can simulate the tournament for the subtree with an arbitrary assignment. The key is: what are the minimal and maximal numbers that can be the winner of the subtree?\n\n        Actually, for a fixed set of numbers assigned to the subtree, the winner is uniquely determined by the rules and the assignment. But we can choose the assignment arbitrarily from the available numbers.\n\n        Therefore, for a given set S (the available numbers for the subtree), the winner of the subtree can be any number in S, provided we can arrange the assignment so that that number wins.\n\n        However, that is not true. The arrangement matters because the bracket is fixed.\n\n        But note: we can assign arbitrarily the numbers to the leaves. So we can choose which number goes to which leaf.\n\n        Then, the winner of the subtree is the number that, when the tournament is run, wins. And we can arrange the assignment to make any particular number in S the winner, as long as the rules allow it.\n\n        How?\n\n            In the last round of the subtree, the two finalists must satisfy the rule of that round. But the two finalists are the winners of two halves. We can arrange the two halves arbitrarily.\n\n        Actually, it is known from similar problems (like \"Bracket Sequence\") that the winner of a tournament bracket with fixed rules and arbitrary assignment is the number that is the median or something? \n\n        Let me consider a simple case:\n\n            Two teams (n=1): then the rule is s[0]. \n                If s[0]=='1': the higher number wins. So the winner is the maximum of the two.\n                If s[0]=='0': the winner is the minimum.\n\n            Four teams (n=2): \n                Round 0: two games, then the winners meet.\n\n                Suppose the rule for the first round is s[0] and the final round s[1].\n\n                We have four numbers: a, b, c, d (distinct).\n\n                We can assign arbitrarily to the four leaves.\n\n                We wish to know if we can make a particular number (say a) win.\n\n                Conditions:\n\n                  In the first round: \n                    a must be in one of the two games. Suppose a is in the first game (against b) and the second game is between c and d.\n\n                  Then the final game is between the winner of a vs b and the winner of c vs d.\n\n                The condition for a to win the tournament:\n\n                  Case 1: a is in the first game and the second game is between c and d.\n\n                    Round0 (first game): a vs b -> outcome depends on s[0]: \n                         if s[0]=='1': then a must be greater than b.\n                         if s[0]=='0': then a must be less than b.\n\n                    Round1 (final): a (or the winner of a vs b) vs winner of c vs d -> outcome depends on s[1]:\n                         if s[1]=='1': then a (if a wins the first game) must be greater than the winner of c vs d.\n                         if s[1]=='0': then a must be less than the winner of c vs d.\n\n                But note: the winner of c vs d is determined by s[0] (the rule for the second game) and the assignment of c and d.\n\n                We can choose the assignment arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose b, c, d from the set excluding a.\n\n                However, we must use distinct numbers.\n\n                How to check for a fixed a?\n\n                We can try to reserve the necessary numbers:\n\n                  Condition for the first game: \n                    if s[0]=='1', then we need to choose b < a (because a must be greater than b). \n                    if s[0]=='0', then we need to choose b > a.\n\n                  Then, for the second game (c vs d): we have two numbers left (from the set {1,2,...,4}\\{a,b}). \n\n                  Condition for the final:\n                    if s[1]=='1', then the winner of the final is the maximum between a (if a advanced) and the winner of c vs d. But a is already fixed (assuming a won the first game). So we require a > winner(c,d).\n                    if s[1]=='0', then we require a < winner(c,d).\n\n                Now, the winner of c vs d is:\n                    if s[0]=='1' (the same rule applies to the second game? Actually, the rule for the second game is s[1]), so:\n                         if s[1]=='1', then winner(c,d) is the maximum of c and d.\n                         if s[1]=='0', then winner(c,d) is the minimum of c and d.\n\n                Therefore, we require:\n\n                  Case 1: s[0]=='1' and s[1]=='1'\n                    Condition1: b < a.\n                    Condition2: a > (max(c,d))\n\n                  Case 2: s[0",
