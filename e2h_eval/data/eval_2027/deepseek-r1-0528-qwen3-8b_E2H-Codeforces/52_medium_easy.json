Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of used candles needed to make a new one)\n Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n We can take b used candles to make a new one.\n\n The process:\n   hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: \"4 2\" -> Output: 7\n\n Steps:\n   Hour 1: Use 1 candle -> burned: 1, leftover: 1, total hours=1, remaining candles=3\n   Hour 2: Use 1 candle -> burned: 2, leftover: 2, total hours=2, remaining candles=2\n   Hour 3: Use 1 candle -> burned: 3, leftover: 3, total hours=3, remaining candles=1\n   Hour 4: Use 1 candle -> burned: 4, leftover: 4, total hours=4, remaining candles=0\n\n   Now, with 4 used candles, we can make floor(4/2)=2 new candles. Then we burn these 2 for 2 hours.\n   Then we have 2 new candles which become used, so total used now is 2, and we can form floor(2/2)=1 new candle.\n   Then we burn that 1 for 1 hour, then we have 1 used candle, which is not enough (we need 2) so we stop.\n\n   Total hours = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        total_hours += current   # because we use all current candles for burning\n        leftover = current   # the current candles will burn and become used, but wait: actually we burn them and then we have leftovers?\n        Actually, we use the current candles to burn, then we get current used candles, then we can form new ones.\n\n   But note: the process is:\n\n   Step 1: Burn the current candles (each gives 1 hour) -> so we add current to total_hours.\n   Then, we have current used candles (from the current ones). Then we form new_candles = current // b, and the leftover_used = current % b.\n\n   Then the next round's current becomes new_candles, and we continue until current becomes 0.\n\n   However, note: after burning, we have current used candles. Then we convert as many as possible (current // b) to new candles, and the remainder (current % b) is stored for next time.\n\n   So let's define:\n        total_hours = 0\n        current = a\n        leftover = 0\n\n   But wait, we don't separate the initial a into burning and leftover? Actually, we can think:\n\n   We start with a candles (all new). We burn them, then we have a used candles. Then we make a//b new candles and leave a % b used.\n\n   Then we set current = a//b + (a % b from previous step?) ... no, actually we should accumulate the leftovers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        total = a\n        while a >= b:\n            hours = a // b   # this is the number of new candles we can make, but also we are going to use the entire a to burn and then recast?\n            Actually, we burn all the current candles (which are a) for a hours, then we have a used candles. Then we convert them to new candles: a_new = a // b, and leftover = a % b.\n\n        But note: the example does not separate the initial burning and the making of new candles in the same step.\n\n   Let me restructure:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   However, we can simulate by:\n\n   Step 1: Burn the candles: total_hours += candles (burn each for an hour)\n   Then, we have 'candles' used candles (from the ones we just burned). Then we can make:\n        new_candles = candles // b\n        leftover = candles % b\n\n   Then, we set candles = new_candles + leftover   (because we can combine the leftover from previous steps? Actually, we are starting with 0 leftover, and then we accumulate)\n\n   But wait: initially, we only have the initial a. Then we burn them and get a used candles, then we form a//b new and leave a % b.\n\n   Then we burn the new ones? Yes, and then we have a//b used candles (from the new ones) plus the leftover (a % b) from the first set.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        current = a\n        leftover = 0\n\n        But actually, we don't need to store leftover separately if we do:\n\n        while current >= b or leftover > 0? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        total_hours = 0\n        candles = a\n        while candles >= b:\n            # Burn all the candles: we get candles hours\n            total_hours += candles\n            # Then, we have 'candles' used candles. We can make new_candles = candles // b, and leftover = candles % b.\n            # But wait, we are going to use all the candles to make new ones? Actually, we can use the entire set of used candles (which is candles) to make new ones.\n\n            # However, note: the problem says we can make b went out candles into a new candle. So from 'candles' used candles, we get n = candles // b new candles, and r = candles % b left over.\n\n            # Then we set candles to n (the new ones) and we keep the r (leftover) for the next cycle? Actually, we must account for the leftover.\n\n            # But the process: after burning, we have candles used candles. Then we form n = candles // b and r = candles % b. Then we set candles = n + r? \n\n            # However, note: we don't have any leftover from previous cycles? Actually, we do: because we might have leftovers from previous cycles that were not used.\n\n            # We can change the state: we have two things: the current available candles (which are all new) and the leftover used candles from previous recycling.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can consider: total used candles we have is the current candles (which we just burned) plus any leftover from previous?\n\n            # But wait, the problem: we start with a new candles. Then we burn them and get a used. Then we recycle the used to get a//b new and leave a % b used.\n\n            # Then we have (a//b) new candles and (a % b) used candles. Then we burn the new candles (if we have any) and then we get more used.\n\n            # Actually, we can combine the leftover from the previous recycling with the new used candles from burning the new ones.\n\n            # So we can do:\n\n            # Let x = current (the new candles we have at the beginning of the cycle)\n            # Burn x -> total_hours += x\n            # Then we have x used candles from this cycle, plus any leftover from previous (but we don't have that stored separately) — wait, we need to track the leftover.\n\n            # We can do:\n\n            #   total_used = 0   # This isn't necessary.\n\n            # Instead, we can have:\n\n            #   current = a   # current new candles\n            #   leftover = 0   # leftover used candles from previous recycling\n            #   Then, we can use the leftover and the current burned candles together.\n\n            # But note: the example input \"6 3\": expected output 8.\n\n            # Let me simulate \"6 3\":\n\n            # Option 1: without tracking leftover separately, we can do:\n\n            #   Step 0: total_hours = 0, current = 6, leftover = 0\n            #   We have 6 new candles -> burn them: total_hours = 6\n            #   Now, we have 6 used candles. Make 6//3 = 2 new candles, leftover = 6 % 3 = 0.\n            #   Then current = 2, leftover = 0.\n            #   Burn 2: total_hours = 8\n            #   Now, 2 used candles -> 2//3 = 0, leftover = 2.\n            #   Then current = 0, leftover = 2 -> stop.\n\n            #   Output 8, which is correct.\n\n            # But wait, the example input \"4 2\" expected 7:\n\n            #   Step0: total_hours=0, current=4, leftover=0\n            #   Burn 4: total_hours=4\n            #   Now, 4 used -> 4//2=2 new, leftover=0 -> current=2\n            #   Burn 2: total_hours=6\n            #   Now, 2 used -> 2//2=1 new, leftover=0 -> current=1\n            #   Burn 1: total_hours=7\n            #   Now, 1 used -> 1//2=0, leftover=1 -> stop.\n\n            #   That gives 7.\n\n            # However, wait: in the example, after the first 4 hours, they make 2 new candles (from 4 used) and then burn those 2 (so 2 more hours) and then from the 2 used from the second burning, they make 1, and burn that one (1 more hour). So total 4+2+1=7.\n\n            # But in the simulation above, we did:\n\n            #   First burn 4: total_hours=4, then we get 4 used -> make 2, then burn 2: total_hours=6, then from 2 used make 1, then burn 1: total_hours=7.\n\n            # So the code would be:\n\n            #   total_hours = 0\n            #   current = a\n            #   leftover = 0\n\n            #   But wait, in the above simulation, we didn't use the leftover from previous cycles? Actually, we did: in the first step we started with a and then we set current to the new candles (without adding the previous leftover). \n\n            #   However, the process: we only have the current new candles and we are allowed to use any used candles (from previous burnings) to make new ones. But in the above simulation, we are only using the used candles from the current burning. \n\n            #   Actually, we must account for the fact that we might have leftover from previous cycles. \n\n            #   Let me try with a different example: suppose we have a=5, b=3.\n\n            #   Without considering leftover from previous cycles:\n\n            #       Start: current=5, total=0\n            #       Burn 5: total=5\n            #       Then, 5//3=1 new candle, leftover=2 (from 5 used)\n            #       Now, we have 1 new candle and 2 leftover used candles (which we haven't burned yet). \n\n            #   How do we account for the 2 leftover? They are used in the next cycle.\n\n            #   So we should combine the leftover from the previous cycles with the new used candles from the current burning.\n\n            #   Therefore, we cannot just use the current (the new candles) for burning and then throw away the leftover. We must keep track of the total used candles we have (which is the leftover from previous cycles plus the current burning).\n\n            #   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            #       total_used = 0   # but we don't know how many we have until we burn everything.\n\n            #   Another way: \n\n            #       We start with a new candles and 0 leftover.\n            #       Then, we burn all the new candles (and the leftover from previous? Actually, we have to consider that we might have leftover from previous cycles that we haven't used) — but wait, the problem doesn't specify the order.\n\n            #   Actually, we can consider that we have two kinds of candles: \n            #       - The ones we currently have (which are new) and \n            #       - The leftover used candles from previous recycling.\n\n            #   But note: the problem says Vasily acts optimally. He can use any used candles (whether from the current burning or from previous leftovers) to form new candles.\n\n            #   So the process:\n\n            #       total_hours = 0\n            #       new_candles = a\n            #       used_candles = 0   # leftover from previous recycling\n\n            #       while new_candles + used_candles > 0:\n            #           # Burn all the new_candles and the used_candles? Actually, we can only burn the new ones? \n            #           # Wait, no: the problem says when he lights a candle, it burns for an hour and then goes out. He can only light the new ones? Or can he light the recycled ones?\n\n            #           # The problem says: \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle\", meaning that the recycled ones are made from used ones and then they are new. So we are only allowed to burn the new ones.\n\n            #           # But note: the recycled ones are then burned and become used again.\n\n            #           # So we have two types: new and recycled (which are effectively the same as new once lit). \n\n            #           # However, the problem states: \"Vasily has a candles.\" and then he can make new ones from the used ones. So we start with a new ones.\n\n            #           # Then, we burn all the new ones (both the original and the recycled) because they are all usable.\n\n            #           # But wait, the example: we start with 4 new. Then we burn them and get 4 used. Then we use 4 used to make 2 new. Then we burn the 2 new and get 2 used, then use 2 used to make 1 new, then burn the 1 new and get 1 used.\n\n            #           # So the process is: we always burn all the candles we have (both the ones we just got and the leftovers). \n\n            #           # Therefore, the total candles to burn in a cycle is (new_candles + used_candles). Then we get (new_candles + used_candles) used candles.\n\n            #           # Then, we can form floor((new_candles + used_candles) / b) new candles, and the leftover used candles is (new_candles + used_candles) % b.\n\n            #           # Then, we set new_candles = floor((new_candles + used_candles) / b)\n            #           # And used_candles = (new_candles + used_candles) % b   [but wait, we already accounted for the entire (new_candles+used_candles) above?]\n\n            #           # Actually, we don't need to keep two variables. We can do:\n\n            #           #   total_candles = new_candles + used_candles\n            #           #   Then, we burn them: total_hours += total_candles\n            #           #   Then, new_candles = total_candles // b\n            #           #   used_candles = total_candles % b\n\n            #           # But note: in the next cycle, we don't have the new_candles and used_candles separated? Actually, we do: the new_candles are the ones we just made (which are new) and the used_candles are the leftovers from the last burning.\n\n            #           # However, we can simplify by having a single variable for the total available candles (which are the ones we can burn). But wait, the problem distinguishes between new and recycled? Actually, no: once a candle is burned, it becomes used regardless of whether it was originally new or recycled.\n\n            #           # So we can combine: we have a total of (new_candles + used_candles) candles to burn, and then we get (new_candles + used_candles) used candles. Then we make new_candles = (new_candles + used_candles) // b, and used_candles = (new_candles + used_candles) % b.\n\n            #           # But then, we set new_candles to the newly made ones, and the used_candles is the remainder.\n\n            #           # However, we must note that the next cycle will have both new_candles (which are the newly made) and the used_candles (the remainder) to burn together.\n\n            #   So algorithm:\n\n            #       total_hours = 0\n            #       new = a\n            #       old = 0   # leftover used candles from previous recycling\n\n            #       while new + old > 0:\n            #           total_candles = new + old\n            #           total_hours += total_candles   # burn all the candles we have\n\n            #           # Now, we have total_candles used candles (from burning)\n            #           # Then, we can make new_candles = total_candles // b\n            #           # And the leftover is total_candles % b.\n\n            #           new = total_candles // b\n            #           old = total_candles % b\n\n            #   Then print(total_hours)\n\n            #   Let's test with a=4, b=2:\n\n            #       Iteration1: new=4, old=0 -> total_candles=4, total_hours=4\n            #           new = 4//2 = 2, old = 4%2=0\n            #       Iteration2: new=2, old=0 -> total_candles=2, total_hours=6\n            #           new = 2//2=1, old=0\n            #       Iteration3: new=1, old=0 -> total_candles=1, total_hours=7\n            #           new = 1//2=0, old=1\n            #       Iteration4: new=0, old=1 -> total_candles=1, total_hours=8\n            #           new = 1//2=0, old=1 -> infinite loop.\n\n            #   Wait, we don't want an infinite loop. Also, note: when old=1, we burn that 1, then we get 1 used, then we set new=0 and old=1 again. So we are stuck.\n\n            #   Why? Because we are burning the old ones too. But note: the problem says we can only use the used candles to make new ones. But we are allowed to burn the old ones? Actually, the old ones are used candles, and we can only burn the new ones (which are the ones we just made from the old ones). \n\n            #   However, the problem does not specify that we must use the candles in a particular order. But note: the example only burns the new ones and then uses the used ones to make new ones. \n\n            #   But wait: the example does not burn the used ones. It burns the new ones (which are made from the used ones) and then uses the burned ones (which become used again) to make more.\n\n            #   However, the problem says: \"When Vasily lights up a new candle\", meaning that he can only light the candles that are new (or the ones he just made, which are new). The used ones are not lit because they are used? Actually, no: the process is:\n\n            #       He starts with a new candles. He lights them -> they burn for an hour and then become used.\n\n            #       Then, he takes b used candles and makes a new one (which is not used yet).\n\n            #   So the old ones (the used candles) are not burned again. Therefore, we should not burn the old ones (the leftover used candles) because they haven't been burned yet? \n\n            #   Actually, the problem does not say that the leftover used candles are burned. They are just stored and then combined with the next batch of used candles.\n\n            #   Correction: In the example, after the first 4 hours, we have 4 used candles. We don't burn them again; we use them to make new candles. Then we burn the new ones (2) for 2 hours, then we get 2 used, and then we use those 2 to make 1 new, and then burn that 1 for 1 hour, and then we have 1 used (which is not enough).\n\n            #   Therefore, we should only burn the new candles (which are the ones we have at the beginning of the cycle). The old ones (leftover from previous) are stored and not burned until we use them to make new ones? Actually, no: the problem does not require burning the old ones. The old ones are just collected and then converted to new ones.\n\n            #   So the process should be:\n\n            #       We have two types: \n            #           Type1: New candles (which we can burn)\n            #           Type2: Old candles (which we can use to make new ones)\n\n            #       We burn all the new candles (and then they become used, which are then added to the old ones? Actually, no: the used ones from burning the new candles become part of the old ones for the next cycle.\n\n            #   But wait, the example does not separate the new and old. We have:\n\n            #       Step0: new = 4, old = 0.\n            #       Step1: burn the new ones (4) -> we get 4 used (which are then considered for recycling). Then we make 4//2=2 new ones (from the 4 used) and leave 0 used (because 4%2=0).

So we stop.\n\n            #   However, note: the problem says we act optimally. So we can use the old ones (the 1) and if we had more, we could combine, but here we don't. But the problem does not require burning the old ones. So we stop.\n\n            #   Therefore, the condition should be: while new > 0 OR (old >= b) ? Actually, no: we can use the old ones to make new ones even if we don't have new ones. But the problem says: we can only burn the new ones. So we can only burn the new ones. Then, after burning, we get more used ones (which are then added to the old ones). Then we can use the total used ones (from the burned new ones and the old ones) to make new ones.\n\n            #   Actually, we can combine the old ones and the new ones (after burning the new ones) to form the next batch of new ones.\n\n            #   Revised process:\n\n            #       total_hours = 0\n            #       new = a\n            #       old = 0\n\n            #       while True:\n            #           # Burn all the new candles (if any)\n            #           if new > 0:\n            #               total_hours += new\n            #           # Then, we have new used candles from the burning (which are the ones we just burned) and we also have the old ones.\n            #           total_used = new + old   # because the new candles we burned become used, and we already have old ones.\n            #           # Now, we use total_used used candles to make new ones: \n            #           new = total_used // b\n            #           old = total_used % b\n\n            #           # Then, we set new to the newly made ones (which are now available as new candles) and the old is the remainder.\n\n            #           # But note: we don't burn the old ones (they are just stored). \n\n            #           # Then, we break when there are no new candles and the old ones are less than b (so we can't make any new ones) OR we can break when new==0 and old < b?

But note: the process requires burning the new ones. Since we don't have any new ones, we don't burn anything. Then we use the old ones to make new ones.\n\n            #           # But the problem says: we can only burn the new ones. So we don't burn the old ones. Therefore, we can continue the cycle as long as we have at least b used candles (which are either from new ones we burned or from leftovers). \n\n            #           # Actually, the cycle is: \n            #           #   Burn all the new ones (if any) -> add their burning hours.\n            #           #   Then, combine the burned ones (which are used) and the old ones to form new ones (if we have at least b used candles).\n\n            #           # But the problem does not require burning the old ones. So we can do:\n\n            #           #   Continue if we can make at least one new candle OR if we have new ones to burn? Actually, we can only burn the new ones (which we are making from the used ones). \n\n            #           # However, we can also have leftover used candles that are not enough to make a new one, but we don't burn them. \n\n            #           # So the condition to stop is when we cannot make any new ones and there are no new ones to burn.\n\n            #           # But note: we don't burn the old ones. So after burning the new ones, we have new_used = new (the ones we burned) and old. Then we set new = (new + old) // b and old = (new+old)%b.\n\n            #           # Then, if new==0 and old < b, we break.\n\n            #   However, in the example a=4, b=2:\n\n            #       Step0: new=4, old=0 -> burn 4: total_hours=4, then total_used=4+0=4, new=4//2=2, old=0.\n            #       Step1: new=2, old=0 -> burn 2: total_hours=6, total_used=2+0=2, new=2//2=1, old=0.\n            #       Step2: new=1, old=0 -> burn 1: total_hours=7, total_used=1+0=1, new=1//2=0, old=1.\n            #       Then, since new==0 and old=1 <2, we break.\n\n            #   This gives 7.\n\n            #   Now, example a=6, b=3:\n\n            #       Step0: new=6, old=0 -> burn 6: total_hours=6, total_used=6+0=6, new=6//3=2, old=0.\n            #       Step1: new=2, old=0 -> burn 2: total_hours=8, total_used=2+0=2, new=2//3=0, old=2.\n            #       Then break.\n\n            #   This gives 8.\n\n            #   But wait, in the example a=6, b=3: \n            #       First burn 6 -> 6 hours, then we have 6 used -> make 2 new (since 6//3=2). Then we burn the 2 new -> 2 hours, then we have 2 used, which is less than 3, so we stop.

Then burn the 1 new: 1 hour, then we have 1 used (from the new one) and 1 leftover -> total_used=2, so we make 1 new. Then burn that 1: 1 hour. Then we have 1 used (from that new one) and no leftover? Actually, let me recount:\n\n            #       After step0: 3 burned -> 3 used -> make 1 new and 1 leftover.\n            #       Step1: burn the 1 new -> 1 hour, then we have 1 used (from the new one) and the leftover 1 -> total 2 used. Then we make 2//2=1 new and 0 leftover.\n            #       Step2: burn the 1 new -> 1 hour, then we have 1 used -> which is less than 2, so stop.\n\n            #       Total hours: 3+1+1 = 5.\n\n            #   So the code above gives 5 for a=3, b=2.\n\n            #   But the example in the problem does not cover this. However, the problem says: \n            #       \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle\"\n\n            #   And we are accounting for that.\n\n            #   However, note: in step1, we have old=1 (from step0) and new=1 (from step0) -> then we burn the new=1 (so we get 1 used from the new one) and then we add the old=1 (which was from step0) and the new used=1 (from step1) -> total_used=2.\n\n            #   But wait, in step0: we set new=1 and old=1. Then in step1, we burn the new=1 (so we get 1 used from the burning) and then we have the old=1 (which is the leftover from step0). Then we use the total_used=1 (from step1 burning) + 1 (old) = 2. Then we set new=2//2=1 and old=0.\n\n            #   Then step2: burn new=1 -> total_hours becomes 3+1+1=5.\n\n            #   So the code is:\n\n            #       total_hours = 0\n            #       new = a\n            #       old = 0\n            #       while new > 0 or old >= b:   # Actually, we can break when new==0 and old < b, so we continue when new>0 OR (old>=b and new==0) OR (new>0 and old>=b) OR (new==0 and old>=b) ?\n\n            #       Actually, we can break when we cannot make any new ones and there are no new ones to burn.\n\n            #       Condition to continue: if new > 0 OR (old >= b) then we can make at least one new candle (even if new==0, we can use old to make new ones) OR if new>0 we burn them and then use the total_used to make new ones.\n\n            #       However, note: we don't require old>=b to continue if new>0. We always burn the new ones (if any) and then use the total_used (which includes new and old) to make new ones.\n\n            #       So we can simply run the loop until we have no new ones and the old ones are less than b.\n\n            #       But wait, in the code above, we are updating new and old at the end of each iteration. We break when we cannot make any new ones and there are no new ones to burn? Actually, the code above breaks when after the update, new==0 and old < b. But we update new and old at the end, so we should check at the beginning of the next iteration.\n\n            #       Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            #           while new > 0 or old >= b:\n            #               if new > 0:\n            #                   total_hours += new\n            #               total_used = new + old\n            #               new = total_used // b\n            #               old = total_used % b\n\n            #       But wait, if new==0 and old>=b, then we don't burn anything (because new>0 is false) and then we update new and old. Then the next iteration, we have new = (0+b_used)//b, and old = b_used % b.\n\n            #       However, we don't burn the old ones. The burning only happens for the new ones.\n\n            #       Example a=3, b=2: \n            #           Step0: new=3, old=0 -> burn 3: total_hours=3, total_used=3, new=3//2=1, old=1.\n            #           Step1: new=1, old=1 -> burn 1: total_hours=4, total_used=2, new=1, old=0.\n            #           Step2: new=1, old=0 -> burn 1: total_hours=5, total_used=1, new=0, old=1.\n            #           Then, condition: new>0 -> 0>0 false, old>=b -> 1>=2 false -> break.\n\n            #       But wait, in step1, we set new=1 and old=0, then step2 we burn the new=1 and then set new= (1+0)//2 = 0, old=1. Then step3: condition fails.\n\n            #       However, we can also have a case where we don't burn anything but we still have old>=b. For example, a=0, b=2, old=3: \n            #           Then we don't burn (new=0) but old=3>=2 -> then we update: new=3//2=1, old=1, and then we break the condition? Actually, we break the condition at the beginning of the next iteration.\n\n            #       But the problem: we are allowed to use the old ones (without burning) to make new ones. So we should do:\n\n            #           total_hours += 0   (because no new ones to burn)\n            #           then update: new = (0+3)//2 = 1, old=1.\n\n            #       Then we have new=1, so we burn it in the next iteration.\n\n            #       Therefore, we can change the condition to:\n\n            #           while new > 0 or old >= b:\n\n            #       Then, inside the loop:\n\n            #           if new > 0:\n            #               total_hours += new\n\n            #           total_used = new + old\n            #           new = total_used // b\n            #           old = total_used % b\n\n            #       But wait, if we have old>=b and new==0, then we don't burn anything (so we don't add to total_hours) and then we update new and old. Then the next iteration, if new>0 we burn it.\n\n            #       Example: a=0, b=2, old=3 -> \n            #           Iteration1: new=0, old=3 -> condition true (old>=b). Then, we don't burn (total_hours remains 0). Then total_used=3, new=3//2=1, old=1.\n            #           Iteration2: new=1, old=1 -> condition true (new>0). Then we burn 1: total_hours=1. Then total_used=2, new=1, old=0.\n            #           Iteration3: new=1, old=0 -> condition true. Burn 1: total_hours=2. Then total_used=1, new=0, old=1.\n            #           Iteration4: new=0, old=1 -> condition false (1<2) -> break.\n\n            #       But wait, we burned 1 (from the first non-zero new) and then 1 again, so total_hours=2.\n\n            #       However, the process: \n            #           Start with 3 used (old=3). Then we make 1 new and leave 1. Then we burn the 1 -> becomes 1 used, then we have 1 leftover and 1 used from burning -> total 2 used, then make 1 new. Then burn that 1 -> becomes 1 used. Then stop.\n\n            #       Total hours: 2.\n\n            #       But the problem: we only burn the new ones. We didn't burn the initial 3 used, so they were never burned. Therefore, the total hours should be 2.\n\n            #       However, the problem statement says: \"for how many hours can his candles light up the room\". The burning only happens when we light a new candle. The used ones are not burned. So the initial 3 used were never burned. Then we made 1 new (from 2 of the used) and then burned that one (1 hour), then we had 1 used (from the burned one) and 1 unused used (the one we didn't use) ->",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. Vasily can then combine `b` used candles to create a new one. The challenge is to simulate this process efficiently until no more candles can be burned.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `a` new candles and zero leftover used candles.\n2. **Burning Candles**: In each iteration, burn all available new candles. Each burned candle contributes one hour to the total time.\n3. **Recycling Used Candles**: After burning, combine all used candles (both from the current burn and any leftovers from previous cycles) to create new candles. The number of new candles is the total used divided by `b`, and the leftover used candles are the remainder of this division.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are new candles to burn or enough used candles to create new ones. The loop exits when there are no new candles and insufficient used candles to form a new one.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the number of hours by burning all new candles in each cycle and recycling the used ones to maximize the total burning time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    new = a\n    old = 0\n    \n    while new > 0 or old >= b:\n        if new > 0:\n            total_hours += new\n        total_used = new + old\n        new = total_used // b\n        old = total_used % b\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to create a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_hours` starts at zero to accumulate the burning time. `new` holds the count of new candles, initialized to `a`, and `old` holds leftover used candles, initialized to zero.\n3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as there are new candles (`new > 0`) or enough used candles (`old >= b`) to create new ones.\n   - **Burning Phase**: If there are new candles, their count is added to `total_hours`.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The total used candles (sum of `new` and `old`) is divided by `b` to get the number of new candles (`new = total_used // b`) and the remainder (`old = total_used % b`) becomes the new leftover.\n4. **Output**: After the loop exits, the accumulated `total_hours` is printed, representing the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and recycling process, ensuring optimal use of available candles to maximize the total burning time.",
