Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given:\n   n: an integer (number of array elements)\n   a list `a` of n integers (the array elements)\n   a string `s` (the binary representation of m) without spaces, and the length of the string is n.\n\n Note: The function f(x) is defined as:\n   Let x be a number from 0 to 2n-1.\n   Write x in base-2 with exactly n bits (if x has less than n bits, we consider leading zeros).\n   Then, f(x) = sum_{i: the i-th bit of x is set} a[i]\n\n However, note that the problem says: \n   \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn-1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n And the value of m is given by: m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0?\n\n Actually, note: the example input for the second sample is:\n     5\n     17 0 10 2 1\n     11010\n\n Here, m is represented as '11010' which is 5 bits. But note that the array a has 5 elements, so we have indices 0 to 4.\n\n In the example, m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26? But wait, the example says m=11 (which is 1011 in binary). \n\n There seems to be a discrepancy. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n Example: \"n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23)\" -> here the positions are from 0 to 3 (so the highest bit is the 3rd). \n\n The problem states: \"the binary representation of number m\" is given as a string of n digits.\n\n In the example: \n   Input: \n        2\n        3 8\n        10\n\n   This means n=2, and the binary string is \"10\". So m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n But note: the example says m=20 (which might be a typo, because 20 is written as 2 followed by 0? Actually, the example says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1\", but wait, 20 in decimal is not 1.\n\n Let me check the example again:\n\n   First test case: \n        Input: \n            2\n            3 8\n            10\n\n        Output: 3\n\n   Explanation: \n        m = 2 (because the binary string \"10\" is 2 in decimal). \n        Then x can be 0 or 1 (since 0<=x<=2). \n        f(0) = 0 (no bits set)\n        f(1) = a0 (because the least significant bit is set? But wait, the example says f(1)=a0=3)\n\n   How does the indexing work?\n        The problem says: \"value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n   And note: the array a has n elements, so there are n bits.\n\n   How are the bits numbered? \n        The example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) then f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n   In this example, the bits are numbered from 0 to 3 (for n=4). The binary representation of 11 (1011) is 4 bits: \n        bit0 (LSB): 1 -> index0\n        bit1: 1 -> index1\n        bit2: 0\n        bit3 (MSB): 1 -> index3\n\n   So the i-th bit in the binary representation: when we write x in base-2 with n bits, the leftmost digit is the most significant (which corresponds to the highest power, 2^(n-1)) and the rightmost is the least significant (2^0).\n\n   However, note that the array a is given as a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. \n\n   Therefore, the first element a0 corresponds to the least significant bit (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements in the array \\( a \\) at positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Binary Representation Handling**: The input provides the binary string representation of \\( m \\) without spaces. This string has length \\( n \\), which matches the number of elements in the array \\( a \\). Each bit in this string corresponds to a position in the binary representation of \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Bitwise Analysis**: For each bit position from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), we decide whether setting that bit to 1 in \\( x \\) would maximize \\( f(x) \\), given the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: Starting from the LSB, we consider each bit position. If setting a bit to 1 does not violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\), and the corresponding element in \\( a \\) is positive, we set the bit to 1. Otherwise, we leave it unset or adjust previous bits if necessary.\n\n4. **Constraint Handling**: The key insight is to process each bit from right to left. For each bit, if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 0, we cannot set the current bit to 1 without violating \\( x \\leq m \\). However, if the bit is 1, we can choose to set it to 1 only if the cumulative effect of setting higher bits allows it without exceeding \\( m \\). \n\n5. **Optimization**: By processing bits from LSB to MSB, we ensure that each decision is made with knowledge of previous choices, allowing us to maximize \\( f(x) \\) efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    m_bin_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total_bits = len(m_bin_str)\n    m_val = 0\n    for i in range(total_bits):\n        if m_bin_str[total_bits - 1 - i] == '1':\n            m_val += (1 << i)\n    \n    max_value = 0\n    current_x = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_bits):\n        bit_index = total_bits - 1 - i\n        if m_bin_str[bit_index] == '1':\n            if a_list[i] > 0:\n                current_x |= (1 << i)\n                max_value += a_list[i]\n            else:\n                pass\n        else:\n            if a_list[i] > 0:\n                max_value -= a_list[i]\n            pass\n    \n    print(max_value)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the integer \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representing \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Binary Conversion**: The binary string of \\( m \\) is converted into its decimal value for reference, though it's not directly used in the main logic.\n\n3. **Bit Processing**: The algorithm processes each bit from the least significant to the most significant. For each bit:\n   - If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\)'s binary representation is '1' and the array element at that position is positive, the bit is set to 1 in \\( x \\), and the element's value is added to the result.\n   - If the bit is '0' in \\( m \\), setting it to 1 would make \\( x \\) exceed \\( m \\), so it is left unset. However, if the element is positive, subtracting its value from the result accounts for the fact that not setting this bit might allow higher bits to be set without exceeding \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Output**: The maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is printed, which is computed by considering each bit's contribution while respecting the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes \\( f(x) \\) by leveraging a greedy strategy that processes each bit independently, ensuring optimal performance even for large \\( n \\).",
