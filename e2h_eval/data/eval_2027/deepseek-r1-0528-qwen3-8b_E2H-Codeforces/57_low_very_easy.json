His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two numbers n and x in the first line.\n Then two lists: one for the first tour (list a) and one for the second tour (list b).\n\n We know that Vasya's total points must be at least x. However, the results are anonymous. We are given two arrays of n integers each.\n\n The idea:\n 1. We are to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have.\n\n How?\n Let's denote that Vasya has a score s = a_i + b_j for some i and j. But note: the problem says there is exactly one participant per index? Actually, the input gives two arrays of n integers each, but the participants are identified by their two scores? Actually, the problem states: \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\".\n\n However, note: the input has two arrays of n integers. There are n participants, and for each participant we have two scores. But the catch: the two arrays are given in arbitrary order. And we don't know which participant's first score corresponds to which second score.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and then \"the participants' points in the second tour\". So we have two arrays of the same length, and we can assume that the k-th element of the first array is the first score of participant k and the k-th element of the second array is the second score of participant k? Actually, no: the problem says \"the participants' points are given in arbitrary order\". \n\n However, note: the example input: \n   \"5 2\"\n   \"1 1 1 1 1\"\n   \"1 1 1 1 1\"\n\n And the output: \"1 5\"\n\n This implies that we are allowed to assign the two scores arbitrarily to the same participant. In other words, we can form pairs (a_i, b_j) arbitrarily? But wait, the problem says: \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\". \n\n Clarification: the two arrays are independent. Each participant has one score from the first array and one from the second array, but we don't know which one. However, the problem does not specify that the same index corresponds to the same participant. Therefore, we are allowed to pair the two arrays arbitrarily. But note: the condition for Vasya is that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Vasya was present\", so we know that at least one pair (from the entire set of participants) satisfies the condition. However, note that the entire set of participants is given by the two arrays. Actually, there are n participants, and we have two arrays of n integers. We are allowed to assign the second array arbitrarily to the first? Actually, the problem says \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\", meaning that the two arrays are not necessarily aligned.\n\n Important: the two arrays are the scores of all participants for the first and second tour, respectively. Since each participant appears once in each array, we can form n pairs by matching the two arrays arbitrarily. However, the problem does not require that the same index is the same participant. So we can form any permutation of the second array and match it with the first array.\n\n Now, we are to compute:\n\n Best place: the highest rank (lowest number) Vasya could get.\n Worst place: the lowest rank (highest number) Vasya could get.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to consider that Vasya's score is the sum of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.\n\n 2. However, note: the entire set of participants is fixed. The ranking is based on the sum of two tours. But note: we don't know which pairs are assigned to which participant. Actually, the problem says the two arrays are the results (so we have two sets of numbers). Then we form n pairs (each participant gets one from the first and one from the second) arbitrarily.\n\n But wait: the problem doesn't say we can reassign arbitrarily. It says the results are anonymous. However, the total results table sorts the participants by the sum of points. The participants are the n participants, each having two scores. The catch: we don't know which participant is which. However, the two arrays are the two sets of scores. So the entire set of participants is characterized by the multiset of pairs (a_i, b_j) for the entire n, but note: the problem does not specify that the same participant must have the same index in both arrays. Actually, the problem says: \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The key insight is that we can pair Vasya's scores from the first and second tours in any way that maximizes or minimizes his rank, considering all other participants' scores.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Each participant has a score from the first tour and a score from the second tour. The total score for each participant is the sum of these two scores.\n   - The ranking is determined by these total scores in descending order. If multiple participants have the same total score, their ranks can be adjusted arbitrarily by the jury.\n   - Vasya's total score must be at least `x`. We need to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) rank he can achieve by strategically pairing his scores with others' scores.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To achieve the best rank, we need to maximize Vasya's total score while minimizing the number of participants with higher scores.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To achieve the worst rank, we need to minimize Vasya's total score (but still at least `x`) and maximize the number of participants with higher scores.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both the first and second tour scores are sorted in non-decreasing order. This allows efficient pairing and calculation of ranks.\n   - **Binary Search**: For each possible total score of Vasya (from the minimum required `x` to the maximum possible sum), we determine how many participants could potentially have a higher total score.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both arrays takes O(n log n) time.\n   - The binary search approach ensures that we efficiently compute the best and worst ranks in O(log(max_sum)) time, where `max_sum` is the maximum possible sum of two scores.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    total_min = x\n    total_max = a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1]\n    \n    if total_min > total_max:\n        print(\"1 1\")\n        return\n        \n    def count_higher(score):\n        count = 0\n        j = n - 1\n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            while j >= 0 and a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] > score:\n                j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n            if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] > score:\n                continue\n            else:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\n    best_rank = 1\n    worst_rank = 1\n    \n    low, high = total_min, total_max\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_higher(mid)\n        if cnt < best_rank:\n            best_rank = cnt + 1\n        low = mid + 1\n\n    low, high = total_min, total_max\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_higher(mid - 1)\n        if cnt >= worst_rank:\n            worst_rank = cnt + 1\n        high = mid - 1\n\n    print(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total score `x`, and the two lists of scores for the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing and comparison.\n3. **Edge Handling**: If the minimum required score `x` exceeds the maximum possible score (sum of the highest scores from both tours), Vasya will be the sole participant with the highest rank (rank 1).\n4. **Binary Search for Best Rank**: Using binary search, we determine the highest possible rank Vasya can achieve by finding the smallest number of participants who could have a higher score than him.\n5. **Binary Search for Worst Rank**: Similarly, we determine the worst possible rank by finding the largest number of participants who could have a higher score than Vasya, given his minimum required score.\n6. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible ranks using sorting and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
