Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We need to assign each digit in A (from left to right) to either Homer (H) or Marge (M) for exactly n moves per player.\n The goal is to maximize the total prize: S1 (Homer's number) + S2 (Marge's number).\n\n Note: The process is that on each turn, the leftmost digit of A is taken by the current player and appended to their own number.\n\n However, note that the entire sequence of moves must be of length 2n, and each player makes exactly n moves.\n\n Observation:\n Since the digits are taken from left to right, the order in which they are appended to S1 and S2 is fixed by the assignment.\n\n But note: the value of S1 is built from the digits assigned to Homer (in the order they were assigned) and similarly for Marge.\n\n We cannot assign arbitrarily because the digits are removed from the left. So the assignment is just partitioning the 2n-digit string into two subsequences (each of length n) that are built in order.\n\n However, the problem is: we want to maximize the total prize, i.e., the numerical value of S1 plus the numerical value of S2.\n\n But note: the numerical value of a number with leading zeros is not the same as the integer it represents? Actually, the problem says leading zeros are allowed. But when we form the numbers, if we have a leading zero then the number is smaller.\n\n However, note: the entire string A is fixed. The two numbers S1 and S2 are built by taking the digits assigned to each in the order they appear.\n\n We can think of the assignment as: we choose n indices (without changing the order) for Homer and the rest for Marge. Then S1 is the concatenation of the digits at the chosen indices (in increasing index order) and S2 is the concatenation of the remaining digits.\n\n But wait: the process is sequential. On move 1, we take the first digit and assign to either H or M. Then the second digit, and so on.\n\n The catch: the assignment must be done in the order of the digits. So the relative order of the digits in each number is the same as in A.\n\n Therefore, the two numbers S1 and S2 are formed by interleaving the digits of A, but keeping the original order.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"1234\", n=2.\n   Possibilities:\n     HHMM: S1 = \"13\", S2 = \"24\" -> 13 + 24 = 37\n     HMHM: S1 = \"12\", S2 = \"34\" -> 12 + 34 = 46\n     MHMH: S1 = \"24\", S2 = \"13\" -> 24 + 13 = 37\n     MMHH: S1 = \"34\", S2 = \"12\" -> 34 + 12 = 46\n\n But note: the example output for ['2\\n9911'] is 'HMHM'. Let's check:\n\n   Input: \"9911\", n=2.\n   Possibilities:\n     Option 1: HHMM -> S1=\"99\", S2=\"11\" -> 99+11 = 110\n     Option 2: HMHM -> S1=\"91\", S2=\"91\" -> 91+91 = 182\n     Option 3: MHMH -> S1=\"91\", S2=\"91\" -> 182\n     Option 4: MMHH -> S1=\"11\", S2=\"99\" -> 11+99 = 110\n\n So the maximum is 182, and the sequences HMHM and MHMH both yield that.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Output the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge\"\n\n We are free to output any valid sequence that achieves the maximum.\n\n How to solve?\n\n We are to assign exactly n digits to H and n digits to M, and we want to maximize the sum of the two numbers.\n\n But note: the two numbers are built from the assigned digits in the order of appearance. \n\n Since the digits are in fixed order, we can consider dynamic programming. However, n is up to 18, so the total length is 36. We cannot iterate over all combinations (C(36,18) is about 9e9 which is too many).\n\n Alternative idea:\n\n We want to maximize S1 + S2. Note that S1 and S2 are two numbers that together use all the digits. The catch is that the digits are in fixed order, and we assign them alternately (but not necessarily alternating the players, but we can choose the assignment arbitrarily as long as each gets n digits).\n\n However, note: the assignment must be such that the digits are taken from left to right, and we decide for each digit which player takes it.\n\n But note: the value of S1 is determined by the digits assigned to Homer (and the order is fixed: the order they appear). Similarly for S2.\n\n We can also note: the entire set of digits is fixed. The total prize is the sum of two numbers. But note that the two numbers are built independently from disjoint sets of digits (the entire set is partitioned). However, the positions matter because the same digit in a higher place value contributes more.\n\n How do we compare two different assignments?\n\n Consider: We have two assignments P1 and P2. In P1, a digit d at position i (0-indexed) is assigned to H, and in P2 it is assigned to M. Then in the resulting numbers, the digit d will appear in the same relative order in both assignments, but the place value (i.e., the power of 10) it gets depends on how many digits are assigned to that player after it.\n\n Specifically, for a digit at position i (0-indexed) that is assigned to H, it will be placed at a certain position in S1. The position in S1 is determined by the number of H's that appear from the start to this digit (including this one). Similarly for M.\n\n Alternatively, we can use DP that considers:\n\n   state: (i, j, k) where i is the current index (from 0 to 2n-1), j is the number of moves Homer has made so far, and k is the number of moves Marge has made so far.\n\n But then we need to know the actual numbers? That would be too expensive because the numbers can have up to 18 digits (so 10^18 is huge).\n\n However, note: we don't need the exact numbers, we only care about the total sum. And we are building two numbers. The total sum is the sum of two numbers. But the two numbers are built by appending digits. \n\n Another idea: since the assignment is fixed by the order, we can think of the contribution of each digit.\n\n Let the entire sequence be d0, d1, ... d_{2n-1}. When we assign a digit di to H, then its contribution to the total sum is:\n\n   digit_value * (10^(number of H digits from di to the end))   [because in S1, the digits after di (that are assigned to H) will be placed to the right, so they multiply by 10^(count of H from di onward)]\n\n Similarly, if assigned to M, then it is multiplied by 10^(number of M digits from di to the end).\n\n However, note: the assignment of subsequent digits is not independent, so we cannot easily separate.\n\n Alternatively, we can use DP that tracks:\n\n   dp[i][j] = maximum total sum we can achieve from the first i digits, with j being the number of moves by Homer (so Marge has taken i-j moves) and we also need to know the count of H and M from the remaining part? Actually, no, because the multiplier for a digit depends on the future assignments.\n\n But note: the multiplier for a digit is determined by the number of moves (from that player) that occur after it.\n\n Therefore, we can precompute the multipliers for each digit for both players if we knew the entire assignment. But the assignment is what we are optimizing.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a DP that goes from left to right and assigns the current digit to either H or M, and then the multiplier for the current digit is:\n\n   If assigned to H, then the multiplier is 10^(remaining_H_moves - 1) [because after assigning, there will be (remaining_H_moves - 1) digits to be appended to the right?] \n\n But wait, actually, the entire number S1 will have n digits. The first digit assigned to H will be the most significant (multiplied by 10^(n-1)), the next by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n However, the catch: the assignment does not fix the order of the digits in the final number? Actually, the digits in S1 are in the order they were taken, which is the same as the original order. So the first digit assigned to H is the first occurrence, then the next time we assign to H is the next available digit (which might not be consecutive).\n\n Actually, the multiplier for a digit assigned to H is:\n\n   multiplier = 10^( (number of H digits that are assigned to the right of this digit) )\n\n But note: the digits to the right of this digit that are assigned to H will be placed after this digit in S1. Similarly for M.\n\n So if we let:\n   Let H_count[i] = the number of H digits from position i to the end (excluding the current)\n   Then if we assign the current digit (at position i) to H, then its contribution is int(d_i) * (10^(H_count_from_i_to_end))\n\n But wait, that is not correct: because the digits after i that are assigned to H will be appended to the right, so they form the lower digits. Therefore, the current digit is at a place value of 10^(number of H digits after i).\n\n Similarly, if assigned to M, then the current digit is at a place value of 10^(number of M digits after i).\n\n However, note: the total number of digits for H is n, so the current digit is the (j+1)-th digit for H, and then the remaining n - j - 1 digits from the rest will be placed to the right? But wait, we don't know the future assignments.\n\n Actually, the multiplier for the current digit if assigned to H is 10^(remaining_H_assignments - 1) [if we consider that the current digit will be the first H digit we have, then the remaining H_assignments-1 digits will be placed to the right, making the current digit's place 10^(remaining_H_assignments-1)].\n\n But note: the remaining_H_assignments is (n - current_H_count). However, the multiplier for the current digit is independent of the other digits? Actually, no: because the same digit could be in a higher place value if we assign more digits to the right to H? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n In the final number S1, the digits assigned to H will appear in the order of A. The first H digit (by the order of A) becomes the most significant, and the last H digit becomes the least significant.\n\n Therefore, the multiplier for a digit that is the k-th H digit (counting from left) is 10^(n - k - 1) [because there are k-1 digits already to the left in S1? Actually, no: the k-th H digit is the (k-1)-th from the left, so it is multiplied by 10^(n - k)].\n\n Actually, if we have n digits, the first digit (first H) is multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), ..., the last by 10^0.\n\n So for a digit that is the x-th H digit (so there are x-1 H digits before it in the final number) then its multiplier is 10^(n - x).\n\n Similarly, for M: the x-th M digit is multiplied by 10^(n - x).\n\n Now, the challenge: we don't know the order of the H digits until we assign. But note: the assignment is sequential. The x-th H digit is the x-th time we choose H, and it will be the digit at the position where we choose H at that step.\n\n However, we can use DP that goes from left to right and keeps track of:\n\n   dp[i][h][m] = the maximum total sum we can get from the prefix [0:i] (i digits processed) with h H's and m M's (so h+m = i)\n\n But then how do we account for the future multipliers? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a different state: we know that the entire assignment is fixed, and the total sum is:\n\n   Sum_{each digit} (digit_value * 10^(power))\n\n where the power depends on the player and the number of that player's digits that remain to be assigned to the right.\n\n However, we can compute the total sum by processing from left to right and accounting for the fact that a digit assigned to a player will eventually be in a specific position.\n\n But note: the position in the final number for a digit is determined by the total number of that player's digits that are assigned after it.\n\n We can use DP that also counts the remaining moves for each player.\n\n Let:\n   dp[i][h][m] = the maximum total sum from the first i digits, with h being the number of H moves and m the number of M moves (so h+m=i, and h<=n, m<=n)\n\n But then we don't know the exact contribution of the digits that have been assigned, because the multiplier depends on the future.\n\n However, we can break down the contribution of a digit:\n\n   For a digit d at position i (0-indexed) that we assign to H, then its base value is int(d). Its multiplier is 10^( (n - (h_so_far+1) - (number of H moves from i+1 to the end))? \n\n Actually, no: the multiplier for the digit d is determined by the total number of H moves that happen from this digit to the end. But note: the entire H moves will be n. So if we have h_so_far H moves so far, then the current digit is the (h_so_far+1)-th H move, and there will be (n - h_so_far - 1) H moves after it. Then the multiplier for this digit is 10^(n - h_so_far - 1)? \n\n But wait: the digits that are assigned to H after this one will be appended to the right, so they form the lower digits. So the current digit is at the (h_so_far+1)-th position (counting from left) in S1, and therefore it will be multiplied by 10^( (n - (h_so_far+1)) )? \n\n Actually, the entire S1 has n digits. The first digit (the first H) is multiplied by 10^(n-1). The second by 10^(n-2). The (h_so_far+1)-th by 10^(n - (h_so_far+1)).\n\n But note: the remaining digits (after the current) that are assigned to H will be appended to the right. However, the current digit's multiplier is fixed by its position in the final S1. The position is determined by the total number of H digits that are assigned from the beginning to the end. The current digit will be the (h_so_far+1)-th H digit (if we assign it to H). Then the exponent is (n - (h_so_far+1)).\n\n Similarly, if we assign to M, then the exponent is (n - (m_so_far+1)).\n\n But wait: we are processing from left to right, and the multiplier for a digit is 10^(n - (player_count+1)) for that player. However, we must note that the digits that are assigned to the same player later (to the right) will be appended, so they will be in lower places. Therefore, the multiplier is 10^( (n - (player_count+1)) ) because the player_count (for that player) from the beginning to the end is n, and we are at the (player_count+1)-th digit (so there will be n - (player_count+1) digits to the right for that player).\n\n However, the catch: the multiplier for a digit is independent of the other player? Actually, yes, because the two numbers are independent.\n\n Therefore, the total sum is the sum over all digits of:\n\n   if assigned to H: int(d) * (10^(n - (h_total_so_far+1))) \n   if assigned to M: int(d) * (10^(n - (m_total_so_far+1)))\n\n But note: we cannot use h_total_so_far because we don't know the total h for the entire sequence until the end. However, we know that the entire sequence for H is n. But wait, we are processing from left to right, and the exponent is determined by the rank of the digit in the H sequence (if assigned to H). However, we cannot know the rank until the end.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a different approach: we know the entire assignment, so the rank of a digit in the H sequence is the number of H digits from the beginning to that digit (including this one). Similarly for M.\n\n Then, the total sum is:\n\n   Sum_{each digit} [ (assigned to H) ? (int(d) * 10^(n - (rank_in_H))) : (int(d) * 10^(n - (rank_in_M))) ]\n\n But note: the rank_in_H for a digit is the count of H's from the beginning to that digit (inclusive). Similarly for M.\n\n Now, we can use DP that goes from left to right and for each digit we decide to assign to H or M, and we keep track of:\n\n   dp[i][h][m] = the total sum we have computed so far (for the digits from 0 to i-1) and we also know that the current digit is the next.\n\n However, the problem is that the multiplier for a digit depends on the total number of H's (or M's) that will be in the entire assignment (from the beginning to the end). But we are building the entire assignment.\n\n But note: we know that the entire assignment will have n H's and n M's. So the rank of a digit in H is the number of H's from the beginning to that digit (including this one) and we know that the total H's is n, so the exponent is (n - (rank)).\n\n However, we can also compute the exponent for a digit if we know the entire assignment. But we are trying to design a DP that doesn't require knowing the entire assignment.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a state that includes the number of H moves so far and M moves so far (which is i, and we know h and m). Then, the exponent for a digit (if assigned to H) would be (n - (h+1)) because there will be (h+1) H moves including this one, and the remaining H moves (n - (h+1)) will be the ones that come after, but wait: the exponent is (n - (h+1))? Actually, no: the exponent is (n - (h+1)) because the current digit is the (h+1)-th H, and the total H digits is n, so the current digit is at the (h+1)-th place (from left) and hence the multiplier is 10^(n - (h+1)).\n\n Similarly for M: 10^(n - (m+1)).\n\n But note: the above formula is true if we assign the current digit to H. Then the current digit is the (h+1)-th H, and the remaining n - (h+1) digits (all the H digits after) will be placed to the right, so the current digit is multiplied by 10^(n - (h+1)).\n\n However, wait: the entire S1 has n digits. The first H is the most significant (10^(n-1)), the second (10^(n-2)), so the (h+1)-th H is multiplied by 10^(n - (h+1)).\n\n Therefore, the DP recurrence:\n\n   Let dp[i][h][m] = maximum total sum from the first i digits (0-indexed, so i from 0 to 2n) with h H's and m M's (so h+m=i)\n\n   Base: dp[0][0][0] = 0\n\n   Then for each digit i (from 0 to 2n-1) and for each state (h, m) with h+m=i, we consider:\n\n     Option 1: assign to H. Then we require h < n.\n        Then the digit d = A[i]\n        Contribution from this digit: int(d) * (10**(n - (h+1)))\n        Then update: dp[i+1][h+1][m] = max(dp[i+1][h+1][m], dp[i][h][m] + int(d) * (10**(n - (h+1))))\n\n     Option 2: assign to M. Then we require m < n.\n        Contribution: int(d) * (10**(n - (m+1)))\n        Then update: dp[i+1][h][m+1] = max(dp[i+1][h][m+1], dp[i][h][m] + int(d) * (10**(n - (m+1))))\n\n   Then the answer is the maximum over dp[2*n][n][n].\n\n However, note: the exponents are large (n up to 18, so 10^(n) is 10^18, which is a 19-digit number) and we are doing DP with states (i, h, m) and i from 0 to 36, h from 0 to 18, m from 0 to 18. The total states are 36*19*19 ~ 13000, and for each state we do 2 checks. This is acceptable.\n\n But wait: the exponentiation 10**(n - (h+1)) might be heavy? However, n is at most 18, so the exponents are from 10^0 to 10^17. But we can precompute the powers.\n\n However, note: we are using the same exponent for every digit at the same state (h). So we can precompute:\n\n   power_H[h] = 10**(n - (h+1))   for h from 0 to n-1, and similarly for M.\n\n But note: for a given h (number of H's so far) and when we assign the next to H, the exponent is 10**(n - (h+1)).\n\n Steps:\n\n   Precompute a list for H_exponents: [10**(n - (h+1)) for h in range(n)]\n   Similarly for M_exponents: [10**(n - (m+1)) for m in range(n)]\n\n Then the recurrence:\n\n   dp[i][h][m] = \n        if we came from dp[i-1][h-1][m] and h>0, then add int(A[i-1]) * H_exponents[h-1] (wait, no: the state h is the total H so far, so when we assign the current digit (the i-th digit, i from 0 to 2n-1) to H, then the exponent is 10**(n - (h+1)) but note: the current state h is the previous h (without the current) so then the current digit would be the (h+1)-th H. However, in our state, we are at step i, and we are going to assign the i-th digit.\n\n   Actually, let me index the digits from 0 to 2n-1.\n\n   We are at state (i, h, m) meaning we've processed i digits. Then the next digit (the i-th digit) is being assigned.\n\n   Then the two options:\n\n      Option 1: assign to H -> then new state (i+1, h+1, m) and the exponent is 10**(n - (h+1)) [because now we have h+1 H's so far, and the current digit is the (h+1)-th H]\n\n      Option 2: assign to M -> then new state (i+1, h, m+1) and the exponent is 10**(n - (m+1))\n\n   But note: the digit is the one at index i (so we are processing the i-th digit, which is A[i] if we store A as a string of length 2n).\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the exponent depends on the total H's (or M's) so far (including the current one). \n\n   We can precompute:\n\n      H_power[k] = 10**(n - (k+1))   for k from 0 to n-1   (for the k-th H, which is the (k+1)-th one, the exponent is 10^(n - (k+1)))\n      Similarly, M_power[k] = 10**(n - (k+1))\n\n   But note: the exponent for a digit assigned to H at a state with h (meaning we are going to have h+1 H's) is H_power[h] (because h is the current count, then the next one is the (h+1)-th, so exponent is 10**(n - (h+1))).\n\n   Actually, let me define:\n\n      H_power[h] = 10**(n - (h))   # but wait, if we have h H's so far (before the current) then the next H (current) will be the (h+1)-th, so we need 10**(n - (h+1))\n\n   So we can define:\n\n      H_power = [10**(n - (h+1)) for h in range(n)]   # for h from 0 to n-1: the exponent for the next H (making the total h+1) is 10**(n - (h+1))\n\n   Similarly for M_power.\n\n   However, note: the exponent for the same player's digit depends only on the total number of that player's moves so far (and the current one will be one more). \n\n   But wait: what if we assign the same player multiple times? The exponent is determined by the rank in that player's sequence.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the exponent is independent of the other player. \n\n   Example: n=2, then for the first H: exponent = 10**(2-1) = 10, for the second H: exponent = 10**(2-2)=1.\n\n   Then the number S1 = d1 * 10 + d2.\n\n   Similarly, for M: the first M: 10, the second M: 1.\n\n   But wait, that is not correct: the entire S1 has two digits, so the first digit is multiplied by 10 and the second by 1. So the formula is correct.\n\n   Now, the DP:\n\n      dp[i][h][m] = maximum total sum from the first i digits.\n\n      Transition:\n\n          if h < n:\n              candidate1 = dp[i][h][m] + int(A[i]) * H_power[h]   # because we are adding the (h+1)-th H (so we use H_power[h] which is 10**(n - (h+1)))\n              then update dp[i+1][h+1][m] = max(dp[i+1][h+1][m], candidate1)\n\n          if m < n:\n              candidate2 = dp[i][h][m] + int(A[i]) * M_power[m]\n              update dp[i+1][h][m+1] = max(dp[i+1][h][m+1], candidate2)\n\n   But note: the state i, h, m: h and m are the counts of H and M so far (for the first i digits). The digit at index i is the (i)-th digit (0-indexed).\n\n   However, we must initialize dp[0][0][0] = 0, and then iterate i from 0 to 2n-1.\n\n   But note: the exponents H_power and M_power are defined for h from 0 to n-1 and m from 0 to n-1.\n\n   We'll use a 3D DP array of dimensions (2*n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1). Since n<=18, the total states are (36+1)*19*19 = 37*361 = 13357, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we must be cautious with the memory: 13357 states, and each state stores an integer (the total sum). The total sum can be very large (up to 10^18 * 18, but actually the numbers are built from digits, so the maximum value is about 10^(2n) * 2, which is 2 * 10^36, which is too big for standard integers? But Python integers are arbitrary precision, so we can use them.\n\n   But the problem: we are asked to output the sequence of moves (a string of 2n characters) that achieves the maximum total prize.\n\n   So we need to not only compute the maximum total prize, but also reconstruct the sequence.\n\n   We can store the DP as a 3D array of the maximum total sum, and also store a 3D array (or two 2D arrays) that records the choice (whether we chose H or M) and the previous state.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store the DP table and then backtrack.\n\n   Steps for backtracking:\n\n        Let dp[i][h][m] be the maximum total sum from the first i digits.\n        We also maintain a 3D array (or dictionary) parent[i][h][m] = the previous state (i-1, h', m') and the choice (either 'H' or 'M') that led to this state.\n\n        Then, starting from (i=2n, h=n, m=n), we backtrack:\n\n            Let s = dp[2n][n][n]\n            At state (2n, n, m): the last move was either H or M. But note: we know that the last move must be the one that completed the last player. Actually, the state (2n, n, n) is the end.\n\n            How to backtrack:\n\n                We look at the previous state: (2n-1, n-1, n) and (2n-1, n, n-1). Then we know that the last move was either H (if we came from (n-1, n)) or M (if we came from (n, n-1)).\n\n                But wait: we don't know which one is the last move? Actually, we need to record the last choice.\n\n            Alternatively, we can store:\n\n                dp[i][h][m] = (value, prev_state, choice)\n\n            But that is memory-heavy.\n\n        Instead, we can store:\n\n                dp[i][h][m] = maximum total sum, and we store two arrays:\n\n                    prev_H[i][h][m] = the previous state (i-1, h-1, m) and whether we chose H (then we mark that we chose H at state (i-1, h-1, m) to get to (i, h, m))\n                    similarly for M.\n\n            However, we can store:\n\n                from_H[i][h][m] = True/False meaning that the transition to (i, h, m) was via H (so we added one H and the digit was assigned to H)\n                from_M[i][h][m] = similarly.\n\n            Then we can reconstruct by:\n\n                Start at (2n, n, n). Then:\n\n                  if we can backtrack via H: then the previous state is (2n-1, n-1, n) and the move at position 2n-1 was H.\n                  else: then the move at position 2n-1 was M, and the previous state is (2n-1, n, n-1).\n\n            But note: the state (i, h, m) is reached by two possibilities: either from (i-1, h-1, m) by choosing H, or from (i-1, h, m-1) by choosing M.\n\n            We can store:\n\n                parent[i][h][m] = (prev_i, prev_h, prev_m, choice)\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                Let parent[i][h][m] = None\n                And then for each state, we record the previous state and the choice.\n\n            Steps for DP and backtracking:\n\n                Initialize dp[0][0][0] = 0, and parent[0][0][0] = (-1, -1, -1, None)   # no parent.\n\n                Then for i from 0 to 2n-1:\n                    for h from 0 to n:\n                        for m from 0 to n:\n                            if h+m != i: continue\n                            if dp[i][h][m] is set (i.e., we reached this state):\n\n                                Option1: if h < n, then\n                                    new_state = (i+1, h+1, m)\n                                    value1 = dp[i][h][m] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n - (h+1)))\n                                    if value1 > dp[i+1][h+1][m] (or if not visited), then set dp[i+1][h+1][m] = value1, and parent[i+1][h+1][m] = (i, h, m, 'H')\n\n                                Similarly for M.\n\n                Then after filling dp, we find the state (2n, n, n) and backtrack:\n\n                    sequence = []   # we'll build the moves from last to first.\n\n                    state = (2n, n, n)\n                    while state != (-1, -1, -1):\n                        i, h, m = state\n                        # But note: our parent links: state (i, h, m) came from (i_prev, h_prev, m_prev) and a choice.\n                        # Actually, in our parent we stored the previous state and the choice. But wait: we stored the parent as the state before the current, and the choice for the current digit? Actually, the current digit is at index i-1? \n\n                    Alternatively, we can store the parent state and the choice for the current digit.\n\n                However, note: we are storing the state (i, h, m) and the parent is (i_prev, h_prev, m_prev) and the choice for the digit at position i_prev (which is the i_prev-th digit) is the choice.\n\n                Then, when we backtrack, we can build the sequence from the end to the beginning.\n\n                Steps for backtracking:\n\n                    Let current = (2n, n, n)\n                    moves = []   # will store the moves in reverse order.\n\n                    while current != (-1, -1, -1):\n                        i, h, m = current\n                        # The previous state is parent[i][h][m] = (prev_i, prev_h, prev_m, choice)\n                        # But we didn't store the choice in the parent array? Actually, we stored the parent state and the choice separately? \n\n                Let me change: we store two 3D arrays:\n\n                    dp[i][h][m] = the maximum total sum for the first i digits with h H's and m M's.\n\n                    choice[i][h][m] = the choice made at the i-th digit (0-indexed) to reach state (i, h, m). It can be 'H' or 'M' or None (if not reached).\n\n                    prev[i][h][m] = the previous state (i-1, h_prev, m_prev) from which we came.\n\n                Then we can do:\n\n                    Start at (2n, n, n). Then:\n\n                    sequence = []\n                    i_cur, h_cur, m_cur = 2n, n, n\n\n                    while (i_cur, h_cur, m_cur) != (0,0,0):\n                        c = choice[i_cur][h_cur][m_cur]\n                        # The move for the (i_cur-1)-th digit is c (because we are at state i_cur, which is after processing i_cur digits, so the last move was at index i_cur-1).\n                        sequence.append(c)\n                        # Then update: \n                        if c == 'H':\n                            i_cur, h_cur, m_cur = i_cur-1, h_cur-1, m_cur\n                        else:\n                            i_cur, h_cur, m_cur = i_cur-1, h_cur, m_cur-1\n\n                    Then reverse the sequence.\n\n                But wait: the state (0,0,0) is the start.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns selecting digits from a given number A. The goal is to partition the digits of A into two subsequences (each of length n) such that the sum of the two numbers formed by these subsequences is maximized. The challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal assignment of digits to each player.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning a sequence of 2n digits into two subsequences of length n each. Each subsequence forms a number by concatenating the digits in the order they appear. The sum of these two numbers should be maximized. The key observation is that the value of each digit in its respective number depends on its position, which is determined by the count of digits assigned to that player up to that point.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state `dp[i][h][m]` represents the maximum sum achievable after processing the first `i` digits, with `h` digits assigned to Homer and `m` digits assigned to Marge. The transitions involve assigning the next digit to either player, updating the sum based on the digit's positional value in the resulting number.\n\n3. **Exponent Calculation**: For each digit, if assigned to a player, its contribution to the sum is determined by its value multiplied by \\(10^{(n - \\text{player\\_count})}\\), where `player_count` is the number of digits already assigned to that player plus one (for the current digit). This accounts for the digit's positional value in the final number.\n\n4. **Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the state `(2n, n, n)` to determine the sequence of moves (H or M) that achieves the maximum sum. The backtracking involves checking whether the last move was H or M and adjusting the state accordingly until we reach the initial state.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_digits = 2 * n\n    \n    # Precompute the exponents for H and M\n    H_power = [10**(n - (h+1)) for h in range(n)]\n    M_power = [10**(n - (m+1)) for m in range(n)]\n    \n    # Initialize DP table and parent information\n    dp = [[[None for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    choice = [[[None for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    \n    dp[0][0][0] = 0\n    choice[0][0][0] = None\n    \n    for i in range(total_digits):\n        for h in range(n+1):\n            for m in range(n+1):\n                if h + m != i or dp[i][h][m] is None:\n                    continue\n                if h < n:\n                    exp_val = H_power[h]\n                    new_val = dp[i][h][m] + int(A_str[i]) * exp_val\n                    if dp[i+1][h+1][m] is None or new_val > dp[i+1][h+1][m]:\n                        dp[i+1][h+1][m] = new_val\n                        choice[i+1][h+1][m] = 'H'\n                if m < n:\n                    exp_val = M_power[m]\n                    new_val = dp[i][h][m] + int(A_str[i]) * exp_val\n                    if dp[i+1][h][m+1] is None or new_val > dp[i+1][h][m+1]:\n                        dp[i+1][h][m+1] = new_val\n                        choice[i+1][h][m+1] = 'M'\n    \n    # Backtrack to find the sequence\n    seq_list = []\n    i_cur, h_cur, m_cur = total_digits, n, n\n    while i_cur > 0:\n        c = choice[i_cur][h_cur][m_cur]\n        seq_list.append(c)\n        if c == 'H':\n            i_cur -= 1\n            h_cur -= 1\n        else:\n            i_cur -= 1\n            m_cur -= 1\n            \n    seq_list.reverse()\n    result = ''.join(seq_list)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of 2n digits.\n2. **Exponent Precomputation**: Arrays `H_power` and `M_power` store the positional values for digits assigned to Homer and Marge, respectively, based on their rank in the subsequence.\n3. **DP Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the maximum sum achievable at each state `(i, h, m)`, where `i` is the number of digits processed, and `h` and `m` are the counts of digits assigned to Homer and Marge.\n4. **DP Transitions**: For each digit, the algorithm checks if assigning it to either player yields a better sum, updating the DP table and recording the choice made.\n5. **Backtracking**: Starting from the state `(2n, n, n)`, the algorithm backtracks through the DP table, collecting the choices (H or M) made at each step to form the sequence of moves.\n6. **Output**: The collected sequence is reversed to present the correct order of moves from left to right.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal sequence of moves using dynamic programming and backtracking, ensuring the maximum total prize for both players.",
