His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two numbers n and x in the first line.\n Then two lists: one for the first tour (list a) and one for the second tour (list b).\n\n We know that Vasya's total points (from both tours) is at least x. However, we don't know which participant is Vasya, but we know that there are two integers i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n The problem: we have to find the best and worst place Vasya could have got.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to consider all participants. Each participant has two scores: one from the first tour and one from the second tour.\n\n 2. However, note: the input gives two separate lists for the two tours, but the assignment of the second list to the first list is arbitrary. That is, the two lists are independent.\n\n 3. We can think: Vasya must be one of the participants. But note: the problem does not tell us which one is Vasya. Instead, we are told that there is at least one pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. Actually, we know that Vasya's score is at least x (total). But note: the problem says \"at least x\", so we are given the minimum total.\n\n 4. However, the catch: the two lists are from the same set of participants, but we don't know which participant got which score in the first and second tour.\n\n 5. We need to assign each participant an a_i and a b_j? Actually, no: we are given two arrays of n numbers. The idea is that the participants are the same for both tours, but the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n 6. So, we can form a list of pairs (a_i, b_j) for every participant? Actually, the problem states: the teacher has the results of the first and second tour (each participant participated in both). But the two lists are independent. However, we are allowed to arbitrarily assign the second list's scores to the first list's scores? Actually, no: the problem says the results (the two lists) are given in arbitrary order, but the participants are fixed. \n\n 7. Clarification: There are n participants. The first list contains the first tour scores for these n participants (but in arbitrary order). The second list contains the second tour scores for the same n participants (again, arbitrary order). Therefore, we can consider that we have two sets of scores. However, we don't know the matching.\n\n 8. Since the matching is arbitrary, we can consider that each participant's two scores are one from the first list and one from the second list. But note: the problem does not require that we use the same participant's two scores from the two lists. Actually, the problem states: \"The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order.\" and \"It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\".\n\n 9. Therefore, we can reassign the second list arbitrarily to the first list's participants? Actually, the problem does not specify which score from the second list goes to which participant. So we can choose any matching? But wait: the two lists are given, and we know that the total points for Vasya is at least x, and we are to determine the best and worst place.\n\n 10. Alternate interpretation: There are n participants. Each participant has two scores: one from the first tour and one from the second tour. The first list is the first tour scores, the second list is the second tour scores. The two lists are of the same n participants, but the assignment is arbitrary.\n\n 11. Therefore, we can form a list of pairs by matching the first list with the second list arbitrarily. However, we are allowed to assign the second list arbitrarily to the first list's participants.\n\n 12. But note: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\". So we have two multisets of scores.\n\n 13. How do we compute the best and worst place?\n\n Approach:\n\n Let S be the multiset of all participants' first tour scores (first list) and T be the multiset of all participants' second tour scores (second list).\n\n We know that Vasya's two scores are one from S and one from T, and his total is at least x. But which one? Actually, we are allowed to choose any pairing? Or is Vasya fixed as one particular participant? \n\n The problem says: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x\". This means that Vasya must be the participant that got the first tour score a_i and the second tour score b_j (for some i and j). However, note that the same participant appears only once in the first list and once in the second list.\n\n But wait: the problem does not tell us which participant is Vasya. So we can choose which pair (a_i, b_j) to assign to Vasya, as long as the total is at least x? Actually, no: the pairing must be consistent. We cannot assign two different second tour scores to the same participant. \n\n However, note: the problem says the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but the participants are anonymous. So we are allowed to arbitrarily assign the second list's scores to the participants (which already have the first list's scores). \n\n Therefore, we can form a complete graph where the nodes are the participants (indexed by the first list) and the edges are the second list's scores. Then we can assign each participant a second score arbitrarily. But note: the second list is fixed and must be assigned exactly once.\n\n However, the problem does not require to fix the entire matching. We are only concerned with Vasya's total being at least x, and then we want to compute the best and worst possible rank.\n\n Let me restate:\n\n We have two lists: A (first tour) and B (second tour). We will form a new list C of pairs (a_i, b_j) for each participant. But note: the same element of B cannot be used twice. So we are actually forming a bijection between A and B.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that Vasya was present\", meaning that there exists a way to assign the second list to the first list (so that each participant gets one score from A and one from B) such that the total of Vasya is at least x. However, we are free to choose the entire matching arbitrarily (as long as it's a bijection) to minimize or maximize Vasya's rank.\n\n However, note: the problem does not fix which participant is Vasya. Actually, we are to consider that Vasya is one specific participant, but we don't know which one. And we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily. Then, we can choose which two scores (one from A and one from B) are assigned to Vasya, as long as they sum to at least x. But wait: the matching must assign every score from A and B exactly once.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: we have two multisets A and B. We wish to assign the entire set B to A (so each element in A gets one element from B). Then, for Vasya, we can choose one participant (i.e., one element from A) and one element from B (that hasn't been taken) such that their sum is at least x? Actually, no: the entire matching is fixed, but we don't know which participant is Vasya. \n\n Another interpretation: we are allowed to choose which participant is Vasya (from the set of participants) and then assign the entire matching arbitrarily. However, note: the problem says \"Vasya was present\", meaning that there is at least one participant (one element in A and one in B) that sums to at least x.\n\n Actually, the problem does not specify that we can choose the entire matching arbitrarily. It just says the two lists are given arbitrarily. \n\n After reading the problem again: \"the results have only points, no names\", so we are free to assign the second list to the first list arbitrarily. Then, we can choose the entire matching arbitrarily.\n\n Therefore, we can choose any matching between the two lists. Then, we can also choose which participant is Vasya, as long as the total for that participant is at least x.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Vasya got at least x points\", meaning that the sum of his two scores is at least x.\n\n So, we can choose:\n\n   - A matching f: A -> B (bijection) and then choose a participant i such that a_i + f(i) >= x.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire matching is chosen arbitrarily; but the condition is that Vasya's total is at least x.\n\n Now, how to compute the best and worst place?\n\n The ranking is by the total points (a_i + b_j) for the participant. If two participants have the same total, the order is arbitrary (so the jury can decide the tie-breakers arbitrarily).\n\n Best place: we want to assign the matching and choose Vasya such that Vasya's total is as high as possible (so that he can be first) and then arrange the others so that as few as possible have higher totals.\n\n Worst place: we want to assign the matching and choose Vasya such that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x) and then arrange the others so that as many as possible have higher totals.\n\n However, note: we can choose the matching arbitrarily. So we can choose the matching that minimizes the number of participants with total greater than Vasya's total (for best place) and maximizes the number of participants with total greater than Vasya's total (for worst place).\n\n But wait: we are also free to choose which participant is Vasya? Actually, no: we are told that there is a participant (Vasya) that has a total of at least x. But we don't know which one. However, we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily. So we can choose the matching and then choose Vasya arbitrarily from the participants that have at least x.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\"\n\n So we are to consider that Vasya is fixed as one of the participants? Actually, no: we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily, and then we can choose which participant is Vasya (from the ones that have total >= x). But note: the problem does not fix Vasya's identity. So we can choose the matching and then choose the participant (i.e., the pair) that has the total >= x and then compute the rank.\n\n However, note: the problem states that Vasya was present, meaning that there is at least one participant (one pair) that has total >= x. But we are to compute the best and worst rank that Vasya could get, assuming we can choose the matching arbitrarily.\n\n Therefore, we can choose the matching and then choose a pair (a_i, b_j) (with i and j being the indices) such that the total is >= x, and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to consider the entire set of participants. The total for each participant is a_i + b_j (where j is assigned by the matching). But note: the matching is a bijection, so we cannot assign the same b_j to two different a_i.\n\n 2. We can choose the matching arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the highest available b_j to the a_i that we want to be high, etc.\n\n 3. To get the best place for Vasya:\n\n    We want to minimize the number of participants with total > Vasya's total.\n\n    How?\n\n    We can choose a matching that gives Vasya a very high total (if possible) and then assign the remaining scores so that as few participants as possible have a total greater than Vasya's.\n\n    Alternatively, we can choose Vasya's total to be the maximum possible (by assigning him the highest available b_j, but we have to assign the entire matching). However, note: we can choose which participant is Vasya. \n\n    Actually, we can choose the matching arbitrarily and then choose the participant (pair) that has the total >= x and that gives the best/worst rank.\n\n    But note: the problem does not require that we fix Vasya's total to be the minimal x. We just require that it is at least x.\n\n    However, to get the best place, we would want to assign Vasya a high total, and then arrange the other participants to have as low totals as possible.\n\n    Similarly, for the worst place, we want to assign Vasya a total as low as possible (but at least x) and then arrange the other participants to have as high totals as possible.\n\n 4. How to approach:\n\n    Let M be the set of all participants (each participant has one score from A and one from B, and the matching is a bijection).\n\n    We are allowed to choose any matching. Then, we choose one participant (the one we call Vasya) such that his total >= x.\n\n    We want to compute:\n\n        best_place = the minimum rank Vasya can achieve (i.e., the smallest integer k such that there are at most k-1 participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's total, and then the rest can be tied arbitrarily so that Vasya can be k-th)\n\n        worst_place = the maximum rank Vasya can achieve (i.e., the largest integer k such that there are at most k-1 participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's total, and then the rest can be tied arbitrarily so that Vasya can be k-th)\n\n    However, note: the ranking is by total points, and ties are broken arbitrarily (so if two have the same total, they can be ordered arbitrarily). Therefore, the rank of a participant is defined as: \n        rank = (number of distinct participants with total strictly greater) + 1\n\n    But wait: if there are ties, we can break arbitrarily. So in the best case, we can put Vasya above all the ones with the same total (if they are below) or below? Actually, no: the problem says the total results' table sorts by the sum (decreasing). Then, if two have the same total, the jury decides arbitrarily.\n\n    Therefore, to minimize Vasya's rank (best place), we can assume that all participants with the same total as Vasya are ranked below him. Then, the rank is the number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's plus one.\n\n    Similarly, to maximize Vasya's rank (worst place), we can assume that all participants with the same total as Vasya are ranked above him. Then, the rank is the number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's (plus the number of participants with the same total as Vasya) plus one? Actually, no: because the ranking is by decreasing total. \n\n    Actually, the standard way: \n        The first place is the highest. Then, the next distinct total is the next place. And when there are ties, we can assign the lower ranks arbitrarily.\n\n    For best place: \n        We want to minimize the rank. The rank is determined by:\n            rank = (number of participants with total > Vasya's total) + (the position in the group of participants with the same total, but we can choose to put Vasya at the top of the same group) so that the rank is (number of participants with total > Vasya's total) + 1.\n\n    For worst place:\n        We want to maximize the rank. Then, we can assign Vasya to be at the bottom of the same group. So the rank is (number of participants with total > Vasya's total) + (the size of the group of participants with total equal to Vasya's total) + 1.\n\n    However, note: we are free to choose the matching and then choose Vasya (any pair with total>=x). Therefore, we can choose the matching and then choose a particular pair (a_i, b_j) to be Vasya's, as long as a_i+b_j>=x.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute the entire set of participants. But note: we have two lists A and B.\n\n        We can consider: we have two multisets. The total for a participant is the sum of one element from A and one from B.\n\n        Step 2: We are going to consider that we can assign the matching arbitrarily. Therefore, the entire set of totals is the multiset { a_i + b_j for each i, j } but without repetition? No, because we have to assign each b_j exactly once.\n\n        Actually, we have to form a matching (bijection) between A and B, so the set of totals is the set of the sums of pairs (a_i, b_j) for the matched pairs.\n\n        Step 3: We are free to choose the matching. Then, we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) (with the constraint that we use each element exactly once) such that the sum is at least x.\n\n        Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n          We have two multisets A and B. We wish to assign a bijection f: A->B (or equivalently, we are to form a list of pairs (a, b) such that each a is used once and each b is used once). Then, we choose one pair (a, b) with a+b>=x.\n\n          We want to compute:\n\n            best_place: the minimum possible rank (over all matchings and over all choices of Vasya with total>=x) that Vasya can get.\n\n            worst_place: the maximum possible rank (over all matchings and over all choices of Vasya with total>=x) that Vasya can get.\n\n        How to compute these?\n\n        Observation:\n\n        We can use a greedy approach and sorting.\n\n        Idea for best_place:\n\n          We want to assign the matching so that Vasya's total is as high as possible and the number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's is as small as possible.\n\n          Alternatively, we can fix Vasya's total to be as high as the maximum possible (which is max(A)+max(B)), and then try to minimize the number of participants that have total greater than that? But wait, if we set Vasya's total to the maximum, then no one else can have a total greater than that (because we have assigned the maximums). Then, the rank would be 1.\n\n          However, note: we are not forced to assign the maximum to Vasya. We can assign the maximum to someone else and then assign a slightly lower one to Vasya, but then we might have more participants above.\n\n          Actually, to get the best place, we can assign the highest possible total to Vasya, and then the next highest totals to others, but we can also break ties arbitrarily.\n\n          But note: we can choose the matching arbitrarily, so we can set Vasya's total to the maximum (by giving him the maximum of A and the maximum of B) and then the next highest totals we give to others, but then there will be no one above him. So the best place is 1.\n\n          However, wait: what if we cannot assign the maximum of A and the maximum of B to Vasya because we are constrained by the entire matching? Actually, we can: we are free to assign any element of B to any element of A.\n\n          Therefore, we can assign the highest available score from A and the highest available score from B to Vasya. Then, the rest can be assigned arbitrarily.\n\n          Then, the total for Vasya is the maximum possible (max_A + max_B). Then, the rank is 1 (if there is no one with a higher total) and if there are others with the same total, we can break the tie arbitrarily to put Vasya first.\n\n          But note: there might be multiple participants that have the same maximum total? Actually, the maximum total is max_A+max_B. However, if there are duplicates in A and B, then there might be multiple participants with that total. But we are assigning each element of A and B exactly once.\n\n          Actually, the matching is fixed: we have n participants. The maximum total we can assign is max_A+max_B, but if there are multiple ways to get that total, then we can assign it to multiple participants? No, because we are using one element from A and one from B.\n\n          Example: A = [5,5], B=[5,5]. Then we can assign (5,5) to two participants. Then the total for each is 10. Then the rank is 1 (because even though there are two with 10, the problem says the jury can break arbitrarily, so we can put Vasya first).\n\n          Therefore, in the best case, we can always get rank 1.\n\n          But wait: what if the maximum total is achieved by multiple pairs, but we cannot assign all of them to Vasya? Actually, we are only assigning one pair to Vasya. The rest are assigned arbitrarily.\n\n          However, the problem says: we are free to choose the matching arbitrarily and then choose Vasya arbitrarily (from the ones with total>=x). So we can choose the matching and then choose one of the pairs (from the matching) that has total>=x.\n\n          Then, for best_place: we can set Vasya's total to be the maximum total (max_A+max_B) and then there is no one above him (because that total is the highest). Therefore, the best_place is 1.\n\n          But wait, what if we cannot set Vasya's total to the maximum? Actually, we can: we are free to choose the matching. So we assign the highest available A and highest available B to Vasya.\n\n          Then, the rest of the matching is arbitrary. Then, the best_place is 1.\n\n        Similarly, worst_place: we want to assign Vasya a total that is as low as possible (but at least x) and then arrange the matching so that as many participants as possible have a total greater than Vasya's.\n\n        However, we must consider that the matching uses all the scores. Therefore, we cannot assign arbitrarily: we have to use all the scores.\n\n        Steps for worst_place:\n\n          We want to minimize Vasya's total (to the minimum value that is at least x) and then maximize the number of participants with total greater than that.\n\n          But note: we are free to choose the matching and then choose Vasya from the pairs that have total>=x.\n\n          Actually, we can choose the matching arbitrarily, so we can choose which pair is Vasya's. We want to minimize Vasya's total (subject to >=x) and then maximize the number of participants with total greater than Vasya's.\n\n          However, we cannot arbitrarily assign the scores: we have to use each element of A and B exactly once.\n\n          Therefore, we need to:\n\n            - Find the smallest total T_min (>=x) that we can assign to Vasya, and then in the rest of the matching, maximize the number of participants with total > T_min.\n\n          But note: we are not forced to assign the smallest T_min to Vasya. We can choose the matching and then choose Vasya arbitrarily from the pairs that have total>=x. So we can choose a matching that gives some participants very high totals and then choose Vasya from the pairs that are just above x.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Consider all pairs (a, b) from A and B (but we are going to assign each element exactly once). We want to choose a matching and then choose a pair (a, b) with total>=x.\n\n            We wish to maximize the rank (i.e., the worst place). The rank is:\n\n                rank = (number of participants with total > T) + (number of participants with total == T and we are placed after them) + 1\n\n            Actually, if we let T be Vasya's total, then the rank is at least (number of participants with total > T) + 1 (if we are alone in our total) and at most (number of participants with total > T) + (number of participants with total == T) + 1.\n\n            But note: we can choose the matching arbitrarily, so we can control the distribution of the totals.\n\n          Alternative approach:\n\n          We can use a greedy method to assign the matching so that we minimize the number of participants that have total >= x (so that Vasya's total is as low as possible) and then count how many participants have total > Vasya's total.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily, and we are allowed to choose which participant is Vasya (from the ones with total>=x). Therefore, we can consider:\n\n            Let F be the multiset of all possible totals (but we have to form a matching). \n\n          Actually, we can use the following known method:\n\n          Step 1: Sort both A and B.\n\n          Step 2: We can use two pointers or binary search to count the number of participants that can have a total greater than a given value.\n\n          However, we are dealing with two multisets. We are going to assign the entire matching arbitrarily.\n\n          Known technique for problems like \"assigning ratings\" or \"matching two arrays\":\n\n          We can sort A in descending order and B in descending order, and then consider the cumulative sums.\n\n          But note: we are free to choose the matching arbitrarily. Then, the set of totals is the set of the sums of the pairs. We can use the concept of matching two sorted arrays to maximize or minimize the number of pairs above a threshold.\n\n          Steps for best_place and worst_place:\n\n          We know:\n\n            best_place = 1   (as argued above: we can always assign the highest two scores to Vasya)\n\n          However, wait: what if there are multiple participants that can get the same maximum total? Then we can still assign the highest two scores to Vasya and then the rest can be arbitrarily arranged. Then, the rank is 1.\n\n          But wait: what if the maximum total is achieved by multiple pairs, but we are forced to use the same score in B for two different participants? Actually, no: the matching is a bijection.\n\n          Example: A = [10,10], B=[10,10]. Then the two participants have totals 20 and 20. Then we can assign Vasya one of them and the other participant also has 20. Then, in the best case, the jury can break the tie arbitrarily so Vasya is first. In the worst case, the jury can put Vasya last (so the other participant is first and then Vasya is second). \n\n          Therefore, the best_place is 1, but the worst_place is 2.\n\n          However, wait: we are free to choose the matching arbitrarily. In this example, there is only one matching (since the two pairs are (10,10) and (10,10)). So we cannot change the matching.\n\n          But note: we can choose which participant is Vasya. So we can choose either participant to be Vasya. Then, the rank of Vasya is either 1 or 2 (depending on how the jury breaks the tie). But the problem says the jury breaks ties arbitrarily. So we are to consider the best and worst scenario.\n\n          Therefore, the best_place is 1 and the worst_place is 2.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"the best and the worst place Vasya could have won\". So we are to output:\n\n            print(1, 2)\n\n          But wait, the example input: \n            Input: \"5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\"\n            Output: \"1 5\"\n\n          Why is the worst_place 5?\n\n          In that example, all participants have total 2. Then, the total for Vasya is 2. Then, the number of participants with total > 2 is 0. Then, the rank of Vasya can be from 1 to 5.\n\n          Why can it be 5? Because the jury can break the ties arbitrarily. We can put Vasya last.\n\n          Therefore, the rank is determined by:\n\n            Let T = Vasya's total (which is 2).\n\n            Then, the rank is: (number of participants with total > T) + (an integer between 1 and (number of participants with total == T)+1).\n\n            Actually, the standard ranking:\n\n              If we have k participants with total > T, then the next rank is k+1, and then the participants with total == T can be assigned the next k' positions arbitrarily (where k' is the count of participants with total==T). \n\n            But note: the problem does not specify the ordering of the participants with the same total. So the rank of Vasya can be any integer from k+1 to k+count(T) (if we consider the entire set of participants with total==T).\n\n          Therefore, the best_place is k+1 (minimum rank) and the worst_place is k+count(T) (maximum rank).\n\n          However, note: we are free to choose the matching arbitrarily, but in the example, the matching is fixed: every participant gets 1 and 1, so total=2 for everyone.\n\n          But wait: the example input says: \n            \"5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1\"\n\n          Then, the matching is fixed? Actually, no: the matching is arbitrary. But since all the a_i and b_j are 1, any matching gives the same totals.\n\n          Therefore, the key is:\n\n            Let T = Vasya's total (which must be at least x). Then, the best_place is:\n\n                best_place = (number of participants with total > T) + 1\n\n            and the worst_place is:\n\n                worst_place = (number of participants with total > T) + (number of participants with total >= T)   [but wait, no]\n\n          Actually, the rank is defined by:\n\n            Let g(t) = the number of participants with total > t.\n\n            Then, the best_place is g(T) + 1 (if we are the first among the ones with total T).\n\n            The worst_place is g(T) + (the number of participants with total >= T)   [because we are the last among the ones with total>=T?] \n\n          But note: the problem sorts by decreasing total. So:\n\n            The participants with total > T are ranked first, then the participants with total == T are ranked arbitrarily.\n\n          Therefore, the rank of Vasya is:\n\n            best_place: g(T) + 1\n\n            worst_place: g(T) + (number of participants with total == T) + 1   ??? \n\n          Actually, no: the participants with total == T are all grouped together. The entire group of total >= T is ranked from g(T)+1 to g(T) + (number of participants with total >= T) (inclusive). \n\n          But wait, the ranking:\n\n            Rank 1: all participants with total = M1 (the maximum)\n            Rank 2: ... until we run out of the maximum, then the next maximum, etc.\n\n          Actually, the standard way: \n\n            The rank is computed by:\n\n              rank = (number of participants with total > T) + (position within the group of total T)\n\n          And the position within the group can be from 1 to (number of participants with total == T).\n\n          Therefore, the best_place is: (number of participants with total > T) + 1\n\n          The worst_place is: (number of participants with total > T) + (number of participants with total == T)\n\n          But note: if two participants have the same total, then they share the same block. The entire block of total T is ranked from (g(T)+1) to (g(T)+c_T) (where c_T is the count of total T). Then, the worst_place (if Vasya is the last in the block) is g(T) + c_T.\n\n          However, wait: the total number of participants is n. The rank should be an integer between 1 and n.\n\n          Example: n=5, T=2, and every participant has total=2.\n\n            g(2) = 0 (no one has total>2)\n            Then, best_place = 0+1 = 1\n            worst_place = 0+5 = 5\n\n          Example: n=2, T=2, and the two participants have totals 2 and 2.\n            g(2)=0\n            best_place=1, worst_place=0+2=2.\n\n          But note: the problem says the teacher has to know Vasya's chances. And the example input \"5 2 ...\" outputs \"1 5\".\n\n          Therefore, the formulas are:\n\n            Let T be Vasya's total (which is at least x, and we can choose T from a set of values that are achievable and >=x).\n\n            Then, the best_place is: (number of participants with total > T) + 1\n\n            The worst_place is: (number of participants with total >= T)   [because the entire group of >=T includes those above and the ones equal, and the worst rank is the last in the group of >=T, which is the (number of participants with total>=T)-th in the block?]\n\n          Actually, the worst_place is: (number of participants with total >= T)   [because the rank is the position in the sorted list (from highest to lowest). The participants with total >= T are the first (number of participants with total>=T) participants, and if Vasya is the last one in that group, then his rank is (number of participants with total>=T)].\n\n          But wait: the ranking is by descending total. The first participant is the one with the highest total. Then the second, etc.\n\n          The rank is defined as:\n\n            rank = (number of participants with total > T) + (the index of Vasya in the group of total T)   [if we list the participants with total T in increasing order of the index?] \n\n          Actually, no: the problem doesn't specify an order within the same total. The rank is the position in the sorted list (without breaking ties by index). \n\n          The standard competition ranking: \n\n            Participant1: 100 -> rank 1\n            Participant2: 90 -> rank 2\n            Participant3: 90 -> rank 3   [if the problem requires distinct ranks]\n\n          But note the problem says: \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\"\n\n          Therefore, the rank can be assigned arbitrarily. So the best_place is the minimum rank (which is the size of the set {p: p.total > T} + 1) and the worst_place is the maximum rank (which is the size of the set {p: p.total >= T}).\n\n          However, note: the set {p: p.total >= T} includes Vasya. The rank is defined by the number of participants with total strictly greater than T, plus one (if we are alone) or plus more if there are ties. But we can choose the order arbitrarily.\n\n          Actually, the worst_place is the maximum rank Vasya can get, which is the entire set of participants with total >= T, because the jury can put all the others (with total >= T) above Vasya.\n\n          But wait: the total of Vasya is T. The participants with total > T are fixed (they must be above). Then, the participants with total == T can be arranged arbitrarily. The worst arrangement for Vasya is to put him at the end of the entire group of total>=T.\n\n          How many participants are in the entire group of total>=T? It is the number of participants with total>=T.\n\n          Then, the rank of Vasya is:\n\n            best_place: the number of participants with total > T (call this k) then the best rank is k+1.\n\n            worst_place: the number of participants with total >= T (call this m) then the worst rank is m.\n\n          But wait: if there are m participants with total>=T, then the rank of Vasya is at most m (because the highest rank is 1 and the lowest is m). \n\n          Example: n=5, T=2 (all 2). Then m=5. Then worst_place=5.\n\n          Example: n=2, T=2 (two 2). Then m=2. Then worst_place=2.\n\n          Example: n=3, and the totals are [5,5,3] and Vasya has T=5. Then:\n\n            Participants with total>=5: two (Vasya and one other). Then worst_place=2.\n\n          But wait: the participants with total>5: none. Then the rank of Vasya (if we put him last in the group of >=5) would be 2 (because there is one participant above him? No: the participants with total>=5 are two, and they are the two with 5. Then the rank is 1 and 2? \n\n          Actually, the ranking is:\n\n            First: the two participants with total 5 (we can break arbitrarily). Then the third with total 3.\n\n          Then, if the jury puts Vasya first, his rank is 1. If the jury puts the other participant first, then Vasya's rank is 2.\n\n          So the worst_place is 2.\n\n          Therefore, the formula for worst_place is: the number of participants with total >= T.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the given scores from both tours and efficiently calculating the ranks by considering all possible matchings of the scores.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to find the best and worst ranks Vasya can get, given that his total points from both tours are at least `x`. The key observation is that we can choose any matching between the first and second tour scores (a bijection) to form participants' totals. The rank is determined by the number of participants with higher totals, and ties can be broken arbitrarily.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Best Rank**: To achieve the best rank, we should maximize Vasya's total points by pairing the highest score from the first tour with the highest from the second tour. This minimizes the number of participants with higher totals.\n   - **Worst Rank**: For the worst rank, we need to minimize Vasya's total (but at least `x`) and maximize the number of participants with higher totals. This involves pairing Vasya's scores in a way that as many other participants as possible have higher totals.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting and Two Pointers**: We sort both the first and second tour scores. Using two pointers, we can efficiently compute the number of participants who can have totals greater than or equal to a certain value.\n   - **Binary Search**: To quickly determine the minimum total for Vasya (at least `x`) and count participants with higher totals.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the lists takes O(n log n) time. The two-pointer and binary search operations are O(n) and O(log n) respectively, making the overall complexity O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    total_a = sum(a_list)\n    total_b = sum(b_list)\n    \n    if total_a + total_b < x:\n        print(\"1 1\")\n        return\n        \n    m = len(a_list)\n    \n    def count_greater_or_equal(t):\n        count = 0\n        j = m - 1\n        for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):\n            while j >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[j] > t:\n                j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n            count += 1\n        return count\n        \n    def count_at_least(t):\n        count = 0\n        j = 0\n        for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):\n            while j < m and a_list[i] + b_list[j] >= t:\n                j += 1\n            count += m - j\n        return count\n        \n    T_best = float('-inf')\n    low = 0\n    high = 10**6 * 2\n    ans_best = n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_greater_or_equal(mid) > 0:\n            ans_best = count_greater_or_equal(mid)\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    best_rank = ans_best + 1\n    \n    T_worst = float('inf')\n    low = 0\n    high = 10**6 * 2\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_at_least(mid) > 0:\n            T_worst = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    count_greater = count_greater_or_equal(T_worst)\n    worst_rank = count_greater\n    \n    print(str(best_rank) + \" \" + str(worst_rank))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total points `x`, and two lists of scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both score lists are sorted to facilitate efficient counting using two-pointer techniques.\n3. **Checking Feasibility**: If the sum of the smallest scores from both tours is less than `x`, Vasya cannot participate, so his rank is 1 (though the problem guarantees his presence).\n4. **Finding Best Rank**: Using binary search, we find the maximum total `T` such that Vasya can have a rank better than or equal to `T`. The best rank is then `count_greater + 1`, where `count_greater` is the number of participants with totals strictly greater than `T`.\n5. **Finding Worst Rank**: Using binary search, we find the minimum total `T` (≥ `x`) that Vasya can have. The worst rank is the number of participants with totals greater than or equal to `T`.\n6. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and binary search to handle large input sizes within feasible time complexity.",
