His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two numbers n and x in the first line.\n Then two lists: one for the first tour (list a of n integers) and one for the second tour (list b of n integers).\n\n We know that Vasya's total points must be at least x. However, we don't know which participant's first tour point and second tour point belong to Vasya.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the total points for a participant is the sum of his two tour points.\n\n 2. The problem: we have two sets of points (the first tour and the second tour). We don't know how they are assigned to the same participant.\n\n 3. We are to find:\n    - The best place Vasya could have: meaning we try to assign his two scores (one from a and one from b) in such a way that his total is at least x, and then arrange the other participants' scores (by pairing the remaining a's with the remaining b's) to minimize the number of participants with a higher total than Vasya.\n\n    - The worst place: similarly, we want to maximize the number of participants that have a total >= x (but note: actually, we consider the entire set of participants and their totals, but Vasya's total is fixed to be at least x, but the assignment can be arbitrary). However, note that the problem states that the teacher knows the total results (so all participants) and the two tours' results (so we know all the pairs? Actually, no: the two lists are given arbitrarily. But note: the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\", meaning that we have two lists of n numbers each (first tour and second tour) but we don't know which score from the first tour goes with which from the second.\n\n 4. Important: We are allowed to assign any a_i with any b_j as long as we use each element exactly once. However, Vasya is one specific participant: there exists a pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. But note: we don't know which one is Vasya's. Actually, the input does not specify which participant is Vasya. However, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that Vasya was present\" — so there exists at least one pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n 5. Approach:\n\n Let's denote:\n   We are going to consider the entire set of participants. Each participant has a total score = a_i + b_j (for some matching). But note: the matching is arbitrary? Actually, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So the set of all possible total scores for the participants is the set {a_i + b_j} for i from 0 to n-1 and j from 0 to n-1? No, because there are n participants, and we have two lists of n numbers. Actually, we have two lists of n numbers (the first tour and the second tour). We are going to form n pairs (each a_i must be paired with one b_j, but the pairing is arbitrary). However, wait: the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\". This means that we have two lists, and we don't know which participant got which score in the first and which in the second. But the catch is: each participant must have one score from the first list and one from the second. And the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we use the same index for the same participant. So we can rearrange the second list arbitrarily. Therefore, the total set of n pairs is a matching between the two lists.\n\n But note: the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", so we have n participants, and we have two lists (each of n numbers) for the two tours. The two lists are the same set of participants, but the scores are given arbitrarily.\n\n How to proceed?\n\n Let's consider:\n\n We are to compute the best and worst rank of Vasya, assuming that we can assign the scores arbitrarily (except that one participant must have at least x).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to consider all the possible ways to form the pairs? That's too expensive (n! possibilities). We need a smarter way.\n\n 2. We can think:\n\n   Let S be the multiset of all possible total scores if we were to assign arbitrarily? Actually, no, because we are only allowed to assign each a_i to one b_j and vice versa. But note: the problem does not fix which participant is which, so we can assign arbitrarily. However, we are only concerned with the set of total scores and how many of them are greater than or equal to Vasya's.\n\n 3. Actually, we are allowed to choose which pair is Vasya's (as long as it sums to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The key insight is that we can arbitrarily assign the participants' scores from the first and second tours, but Vasya's total must be at least `x`. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists, `a` (first tour scores) and `b` (second tour scores), each of size `n`.\n   - Vasya's total score must be at least `x`, meaning there exists a pair `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n   - The rank of Vasya depends on how many participants have a higher total score than him. Since the assignment of scores is arbitrary, we can manipulate the rankings by strategically pairing scores.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To minimize Vasya's rank, we want as few participants as possible to have a higher total score than Vasya. This is achieved by maximizing Vasya's total score (to just meet the minimum `x`) and assigning the smallest possible scores to other participants.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we want as many participants as possible to have a total score at least `x`. This involves assigning the highest possible scores to other participants while ensuring Vasya's score meets the minimum requirement.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order to facilitate efficient pairing.\n   - **Two Pointers Technique**: For determining the best rank, we use two pointers to count how many participants can have a total score greater than Vasya's minimal score. For the worst rank, we count how many participants can have a total score at least `x`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both lists takes `O(n log n)` time.\n   - The subsequent linear scans to compute the best and worst ranks take `O(n)` time each.\n   - Overall, the solution efficiently handles the constraints with a time complexity of `O(n log n)`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    \n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    # Determine the best place (minimal rank)\n    best_place = 1\n    total_needed = x\n    \n    # Count how many participants have total > x (for best place, we want minimal such)\n    j = n - 1\n    count_greater = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a[i] + b[j] > total_needed:\n            count_greater += 1\n            j -= 1\n        if j < 0:\n            break\n            \n    best_place = count_greater + 1\n    \n    # Determine the worst place (maximal rank)\n    # Count the number of participants that can have total >= x\n    j = n - 1\n    count_at_least_x = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n            count_at_least_x += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n        if j < 0:\n            break\n            \n    worst_place = count_at_least_x\n    \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n` and the minimum required total score `x`, followed by the two lists `a` and `b` containing the first and second tour scores respectively.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing using the two-pointer technique.\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**: By iterating from the end of both lists, we count how many participants can have a total score greater than `x`. The best rank is then `count_greater + 1` because Vasya's rank is one better than the count of those with higher scores.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: Similarly, by counting how many participants can have a total score at least `x`, the worst rank is simply this count, as Vasya's position would be the last among these.\n5. **Output**: The results for the best and worst ranks are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and linear scanning to determine the desired ranks without explicitly enumerating all possible pairings, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.",
