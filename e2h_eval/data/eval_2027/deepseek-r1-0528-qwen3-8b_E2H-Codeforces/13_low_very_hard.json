For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string of three notes. We need to determine if it's a major, minor, or strange chord.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number in the 12-note scale. The notes are: \n    ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    But note: the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. However, the example includes 'H' which is the same as 'B' in some contexts? Actually, wait: the problem states there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n However, looking at the example: \n   Input: \"C# B F\" is minor. And the ordering they use is \"B C# F\": \n      B to C#: from the list, after B comes C (which is 1 semitone above B) and then C# (another semitone). So from B to C# is 2 semitones? Wait, but the example says 3 semitones.\n\n Let me map the notes to numbers:\n\n Let the order be: \n   index 0: C\n   index 1: C#\n   index 2: D\n   index 3: D#\n   index 4: E\n   index 5: F\n   index 6: F#\n   index 7: G\n   index 8: G#\n   index 9: A\n   index 10: B\n   index 11: H   ??? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again\". And the example input has \"C# B F\", and note that B and H are different? Actually, the problem lists 12 distinct notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n So there are two accidentals for each letter except B and H? Actually, no: the list is fixed. Let me clarify the note names: \n   The standard 12 notes in Western music are: C, C#/Db, D/Dflat, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/E♭, G, G#/Ab, A, B/H (wait, what's H?) \n\n Wait, the problem says: \"there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n In standard notation, H is sometimes used for B? Actually, in some countries, B is called H. But here, the problem uses both B and H. \n\n However, note the example: \"C# B F\" is minor. And the ordering is \"B C# F\". \n\n Let's assign numbers to the notes as given:\n\n Note: The problem says the distance between consecutive notes is 1 semitone.\n\n So let's create a list of the 12 notes in order (with index 0 to 11):\n\n   notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n But wait, the example says the distance from B to C# is 3 semitones. Let's check:\n\n   From B to C: one semitone (because next note is C)\n   Then from C to C#: another semitone -> so from B to C# is 2 semitones.\n\n However, the example says 3 semitones. \n\n Alternatively, maybe the list is not starting with C as 0 and then going up? Or perhaps the note after H is C, so the cycle is 12. \n\n Let me re-map the notes in a circular way.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\"\n\n So the entire set is 12 notes. We can map:\n\n   C -> 0\n   C# -> 1\n   D -> 2\n   D# -> 3\n   E -> 4\n   F -> 5\n   F# -> 6\n   G -> 7\n   G# -> 8\n   A -> 9\n   B -> 10\n   H -> 11\n\n Then, the distance from B (10) to C (0): \n   If we go forward from B (10) to C (0): \n     10 -> 11 (H) then 0 (C) -> so 2 semitones? But wait, we are allowed to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither (classified as \"strange\"). The solution involves mapping each note to a numerical value in a 12-note scale, calculating the distances between the notes, and checking specific distance conditions to classify the chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer from 0 to 11 based on its position in the 12-note sequence (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation of the three input notes, compute the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation. The distances are calculated modulo 12 to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Classification**:\n   - **Major Chord**: The chord can be ordered such that the distance between the first and second note is 4 semitones, and the distance between the second and third note is 3 semitones.\n   - **Minor Chord**: The chord can be ordered such that the distance between the first and second note is 3 semitones, and the distance between the second and third note is 4 semitones.\n   - **Strange Chord**: If neither of the above conditions is met for any permutation of the notes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes)}\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        n1, n2, n3 = data\n        indices = [note_to_index[n1], note_to_index[n2], note_to_index[n3]]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in [(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0)]:\n        i, j, k = indices[perm[0]], indices[perm[1]], indices[perm[2]]\n        d1 = (i - j) % 12\n        d2 = (j - k) % 12\n        d3 = (k - i) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 and d3 == 9:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4 and d3 == 9:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by creating a list of the 12 musical notes in order and a dictionary to map each note to its corresponding index (0 to 11).\n2. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes. The code checks if there are exactly three notes; otherwise, it classifies the chord as \"strange\".\n3. **Index Conversion**: Each input note is converted to its corresponding index using the predefined dictionary. If any note is not found in the dictionary, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n4. **Permutation Check**: The code checks all permutations of the three notes to see if they can be ordered to satisfy the conditions for a major or minor chord. The distances between consecutive notes in each permutation are calculated modulo 12 to account for the circular nature of the musical scale.\n5. **Classification**: Based on the permutations checked, the code determines if the chord is major, minor, or neither (strange) and prints the result accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the input notes to classify the chord accurately, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
