Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. This means that:\n - '0's can be moved arbitrarily (because they can be swapped with '1's, and '1's can be swapped with '2's, so effectively a '0' can pass through a sequence of '1's and '2's until it reaches the front).\n - However, note that we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly. But since we can use '1' as an intermediary, we can actually move a '0' past a '1' and then the '1' might be able to move past a '2' (if there is a '1' between them). However, the swaps are only adjacent.\n\n Observation: \n The allowed swaps mean that the relative order of the same characters must remain the same (because swapping only happens between different ones). However, the operations allow us to rearrange the string as follows:\n\n Since we can swap:\n   \"01\" <-> \"10\"\n   \"12\" <-> \"21\"\n\n We cannot swap \"02\", but note that if we have a '0' followed by a '2', we can potentially break it down by having a '1' in between? Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n The moves generate a graph on the three symbols: \n   There is an edge between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. So the graph has two connected components: {0,1} and {2}. \n\n However, wait: we can also have a chain: 0-1-2. So actually, we can move a '0' through a sequence of '1's and then a '2' because to get from 0 to 2 we need to go via 1. But note: the swap operations are only adjacent. \n\n Therefore, we can think of the entire process as being able to independently rearrange the relative positions of the three digits, but with restrictions: \n   - The relative order of the '0's is preserved.\n   - The relative order of the '1's is preserved.\n   - The relative order of the '2's is preserved.\n\n However, we can interleave the three groups arbitrarily, except that we cannot put a '2' before a '0' without having at least one '1' in between? Actually, no: because the '2' can only pass through '1's, so if we want to put a '2' in front of a '0', we must have all the '1's that were originally between them moved appropriately.\n\n But note: the problem allows arbitrary number of swaps. This is similar to having three independent stacks (for each digit) and we can merge them arbitrarily as long as the internal order of each stack is maintained, but with the constraint that a '0' can only be placed in front of a '1' if we have a swap (meaning we can invert the order of a '0' and a '1'), and similarly for '1' and '2'.\n\n Actually, note that the operations are reversible and we can consider the entire set of achievable permutations as those that preserve the relative order of the same digits. However, wait: that is not entirely true because the operations are adjacent swaps only for specific pairs. \n\n Alternatively, we can think of the problem as having two independent bubble-sort like processes: \n   - The '0's and '1's can be rearranged arbitrarily relative to each other (because we can swap any adjacent '0' and '1'), and similarly the '1's and '2's can be rearranged arbitrarily. But what about the '0's and '2's? \n\n However, note: we cannot directly swap '0' and '2'. But we can use '1's as intermediaries. For example, to move a '0' past a '2', we must have the '0' swap with every '1' that is between them (to move the '0' forward) and then the '2' must swap with every '1' that is between them (to move the '2' backward). But note: the '1's themselves have an order that must be preserved.\n\n Actually, the key is to realize that the entire process is equivalent to having three independent queues (for '0','1','2') and then merging them arbitrarily, but with the condition that a '0' can only overtake a '1', a '1' can only overtake a '2', but a '0' cannot overtake a '2'. \n\n However, wait: what does \"overtake\" mean? In lexicographical minimization, we want to push the smallest digits to the front. But note: we cannot move a '0' past a '2' without moving the '2' backward, which requires moving the '1's that are in between. But the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on '0' and '1', and on '1' and '2'. The key observation here is that the relative order of the digits must be preserved in certain ways, but we can rearrange them based on the allowed swaps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. This means that '0's can move past '1's, and '1's can move past '2's. However, '0's cannot move directly past '2's without the help of '1's. The goal is to arrange the digits such that the smallest possible digits (lexicographically) come first.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves three main steps:\n   - **Separate Digits**: Split the original string into three lists: one for '0's, one for '1's, and one for '2's.\n   - **Merge Strategy**: Merge these lists in a way that respects the allowed swaps. Specifically, all '0's should come first, followed by '1's, and then '2's. Within each group, the relative order of the digits must remain the same as in the original string.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves counting the occurrences of each digit and then constructing the result string by placing all '0's first (in their original order), followed by all '1's (in their original order), and finally all '2's (in their original order). This ensures the lexicographically smallest string because '0' is the smallest digit, followed by '1', and then '2'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(char)\n        else:\n            twos.append(char)\n            \n    result = ''.join(zeros) + ''.join(ones) + ''.join(twos)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Splitting Digits**: The string is split into three separate lists: `zeros`, `ones`, and `twos`, each containing the respective digits from the original string in their original order.\n3. **Constructing Result**: The result string is constructed by concatenating the `zeros` list, followed by the `ones` list, and then the `twos` list. This arrangement ensures that all '0's come first (smallest lexicographical value), followed by '1's, and then '2's, which is the lexicographically smallest possible string under the given constraints.\n4. **Output**: The constructed string is printed as the output.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the allowed swaps by maintaining the relative order of each digit type while ensuring the smallest digits appear first, thus achieving the desired lexicographical minimum. The algorithm operates in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 10^5 characters.",
