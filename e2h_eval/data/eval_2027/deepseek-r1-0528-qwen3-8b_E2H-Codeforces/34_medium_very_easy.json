And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, we compute the average (sum of the k days divided by k) and then take the overall average over all weeks.\n\n However, note: the overall average is the sum of sleep times in all weeks divided by the number of weeks (which is n-k+1).\n\n But note: we can also think of it as:\n   total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} [ (a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{i+k-1}) ] / (n-k+1)\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the prefix sums to quickly calculate the sum for any contiguous segment.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, k and the list of sleep times.\n 2. Precompute the prefix sum array for the list.\n    Let prefix[0] = 0, prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1}\n 3. The sum for a week from index i to i+k-1 is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i].\n 4. Then, the total sum of all weeks is the sum of (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]) for i from 0 to n-k.\n 5. The number of weeks is (n - k + 1).\n 6. The average is total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n\n But note: we must output the average with absolute or relative error <= 1e-6.\n\n However, note that the problem has constraints that n and k can be up to 200,000, so we must do this efficiently.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 2\" and [3,4,7]\n   Weeks: [3,4] -> (3+4)/2 = 3.5; [4,7] -> (4+7)/2 = 5.5\n   Total weeks: 2\n   Overall average: (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 9/2 = 4.5\n\n But wait: \n   Using our method: \n      prefix = [0, 3, 7, 14]\n      Week1: i=0 -> prefix[2]-prefix[0] = 7-0 = 7 -> then divide by k=2? Actually no, because the overall average is the average of the averages? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n   We are not taking the average of the averages. We are taking the average of the total sleep per week.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\".\n\n   Each week has an average. But note: the overall average is the average of the weekly averages? \n\n   However, let's break down:\n\n   Let S_i = sum of sleep for week i (which is k consecutive days). Then the average for week i is S_i / k.\n\n   Then the overall average is (sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (S_i / k)) / m, where m = n-k+1.\n\n   But note: \n        (sum_{i=0}^{m-1} S_i) / (k * m) * k? \n\n   Alternatively, note that:\n\n        overall_avg = (1/m) * (1/k) * (sum_{i=0}^{m-1} S_i) * k? \n\n   Actually, let's see:\n\n        overall_avg = (1/m) * (sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (S_i / k))\n\n                    = (1/(m*k)) * (sum_{i=0}^{m-1} S_i)\n\n   But note: the entire sleep recorded is the sum of all days? Not exactly: each day is included in multiple weeks?\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} S_i\n\n        But note: each day is included in (m - (i % (n))) ? Actually, we can use the fact that:\n\n        Each day j (0-indexed) is included in the weeks that start from max(0, j - k + 1) to min(j, n-k) ? \n\n        Actually, the day j is included in the weeks that start from i such that i <= j < i+k, so i from max(0, j-k+1) to j, but we must have i from 0 to n-k.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the prefix sum method to get the total_sleep_in_all_weeks.\n\n        How many weeks does day j appear in?\n          It appears in (j+1) weeks if j < k-1? Actually, no: the week must start at i such that i <= j and i >= j-k+1 (if j>=k-1) and i>=0, and i<=n-k.\n\n        Actually, we don't need to worry about that because we can compute the total_sleep_in_all_weeks by:\n\n          total_sleep_in_all_weeks = 0\n          for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n              total_sleep_in_all_weeks += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        Then, the overall average is (total_sleep_in_all_weeks) / (k*(n-k+1))? \n\n        Wait, no: because in the above, we computed the sum of the sleep times for each week. Then we are averaging these weekly totals? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"average sleeping time over all weeks\", meaning the average of the weekly averages? Or the average of the sleep per week (which is the same as the average of the weekly totals divided by k) and then averaged over the weeks.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So we are averaging the weekly sleep amounts (each week being k days, so the sleep amount is the sum of k days). But wait, the example:\n\n          Input: 3 2\n                 3 4 7\n\n          They say: result is ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 = (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5.\n\n          But if we do:\n\n            total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18\n            Then if we divide by the total number of days? That would be 18/(2*2)=18/4=4.5.\n\n          Alternatively, we can see:\n\n            overall_avg = (total_sleep_in_all_weeks) / (k * (n-k+1))\n\n          Because each week's sleep is added, and then we are dividing by the total number of days (since each day is counted once for each week it appears). But wait, is that correct?\n\n          Actually, we are counting each week's total sleep. And there are (n-k+1) weeks, but each week has k days. So the total_sleep_in_all_weeks counts some days multiple times.\n\n          However, note: the problem asks for the average per week. So we are to compute:\n\n            average_per_week = (weekly_total1 + weekly_total2 + ... + weekly_total_m) / m\n\n          But note: the weekly_total_i is the sum of k days. So the average per week is:\n\n            average_per_week = ( (sum of all days * their multiplicities) ) / m\n\n          But wait, the example: \n            m = 2\n            weekly_total1 = 7, weekly_total2 = 11 -> total = 18, then average = 18/2 = 9.\n\n          But the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n          So the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" gives 9.\n\n          Why? Because the problem's example calculation was:\n\n            ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 = (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5\n\n          But wait, that is not 9.\n\n          Let me read the example again: \n\n          \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n          Actually, the example does not specify the exact value, but the sample outputs are:\n\n          Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> Output: \"9.0000000000\"\n\n          This implies that the example result is 9.0.\n\n          Let me recalc: \n\n            There are two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, for the second week (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n\n            Now, the problem says \"average sleeping time over all weeks\", which I believe is the average of the two weekly averages. \n\n            So: (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\n          But the expected output is 9.0.\n\n          There seems to be a discrepancy.\n\n          Let me check the problem statement: \n\n          \"Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration.\"\n\n          Then, \"You should write a program which will calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n          And the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" is said to output \"9.0000000000\".\n\n          What if we interpret \"average sleeping time over all weeks\" as the average per day? \n\n          No, because then we would have total_sleep_in_all_weeks / (total_days_counted) but total_days_counted is 2*2=4, so 18/4=4.5.\n\n          Another interpretation: \n\n          The problem might be asking for the average sleep per week, but note that the example output is 9.0.\n\n          Let me compute without the division by k in the overall average:\n\n            total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (3+4) + (4+7) = 18.\n\n            Then, if we do 18 / (n-k+1) = 18/2 = 9.\n\n          This matches the example output.\n\n          But wait, the example calculation in the problem statement says: \n\n            \"for example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is\"\n\n          And they don't specify the result, but the sample input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" is provided and the sample output is 9.0.\n\n          Therefore, the problem is: \n\n            Calculate the average of the total sleep per week (without dividing by k in the overall average) ?\n\n          But note: the average sleep time per week is usually (total sleep in the week) / k, but then why average over all weeks?\n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". \n\n          This is ambiguous: does it mean the average of the weekly sleep totals (so a number that is the average of the two weekly totals) or the average of the weekly averages (which is the same as the average of the sleep per day multiplied by k)?\n\n          However, note: \n\n            Option 1: average of the weekly totals (without dividing by k) divided by the number of weeks: that is 18/2 = 9.\n\n            Option 2: average of the weekly averages: ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 = (3.5+5.5)/2 = 4.5.\n\n          But the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". \n\n          In English, if we have two weeks, one with 7 hours and one with 11 hours, then the average per week is (7+11)/2 = 9 hours per week.\n\n          However, note: the weekly totals are 7 and 11, and 7 and 11 are the total hours for the week. So the average total hours per week is 9.\n\n          But then the average amount of hours per week (if we think in terms of total) is 9. \n\n          However, typically we think of sleep per night and then average per night. Here, the problem defines a week as k consecutive days, and the sleep time for a week is the sum of the k days.\n\n          The problem asks for the average sleep time over all weeks. So if we have two weeks, the average sleep time (in total hours) per week is 9.\n\n          But then what does the doctor ask? The doctor asked for the average amount of hours of sleep per week. \n\n          So if the week is defined as k consecutive days, then the sleep time for that week is the sum of the k days. Then the average over the weeks is the average of these weekly totals.\n\n          However, note: the example also includes the possibility of having a week of two days: so if we have two weeks, one week has 3 and 4 (so 7 hours) and the next week has 4 and 7 (so 11 hours). Then the average per week is 9 hours.\n\n          But wait, is that the average amount of sleep per week? Yes, because we are considering the entire week's sleep.\n\n          However, the example output for the third sample is 28964.2857142857.\n\n          Let me check with the third sample:\n\n            Input: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n            Number of weeks: 8-2+1 = 7.\n\n            We need to compute the sum of the weekly totals (each week has 2 days) and then divide by 7.\n\n            Weekly totals: \n                [1,2] -> 3\n                [2,4] -> 6\n                [4,100000] -> 100004\n                [100000,123] -> 100123\n                [123,456] -> 579\n                [456,789] -> 1245\n                [789,1] -> 790\n\n            Sum = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = 3+6=9, 9+100004=100013, 100013+100123=200136, 200136+579=200715, 200715+1245=201960, 201960+790=202750.\n\n            Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n          So the third sample matches.\n\n          Therefore, the problem is: \n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n            average = total_sleep_all_weeks / (n-k+1)\n\n          But wait, let me reexamine the example: \n\n            Example 1: n=3, k=2, [3,4,7] -> total_sleep_all_weeks = (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18, then average = 18/2 = 9.\n\n          However, note that the example output is 9.0.\n\n          But wait, what if the problem intended the average per day? Then we would have:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = 18, and the total days covered is (n-k+1)*k = 2*2=4, then average per day would be 18/4 = 4.5.\n\n          But the problem does not ask for per day. It asks for the average per week.\n\n          Since the week is defined as k consecutive days, and the sleep time for the week is the sum of the k days, then the average per week is the average of the weekly totals.\n\n          However, note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" -> output \"10.0000000000\"\n\n          With n=1, k=1: \n            total_sleep_all_weeks = 10, number of weeks=1, so average=10.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          So the solution is:\n\n            Read n, k and the list of n integers.\n            Precompute prefix sums: \n                prefix[0] = 0\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            Then, total = 0\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                total += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n            average = total / (n-k+1)\n\n          But wait, the above loop runs (n-k+1) times and each step is O(1) so it's O(n), which is acceptable.\n\n          However, we can avoid the loop by using the prefix array and summing the segments more efficiently? \n\n          Actually, we can use the fact that the total_sleep_all_weeks can be computed by:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = 0\n            for i in range(0, n):\n                # Count how many weeks include the day i?\n                # The day i is included in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k)\n                # But we don't need to do that because we are using the prefix.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a different way to compute the total_sleep_all_weeks:\n\n            We note that the total_sleep_all_weeks is the sum of the entire array, but each element a[i] is repeated for the number of weeks that cover day i.\n\n            The day i is covered by the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). The number of weeks covering day i is:\n\n                left = max(0, i - k + 1)\n                right = min(i, n-k)   ??? \n\n            Actually, the week must start at an index j such that j <= i and j >= i-k+1 and j>=0 and j<=n-k.\n\n            So the number of weeks covering day i is: min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1) ??? \n\n          But note, we already have the prefix method and the above loop is O(n) so we can do:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = 0\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                total_sleep_all_weeks += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n          However, we can also compute the total_sleep_all_weeks by:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1]-prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n]-prefix[n-k])\n\n          But that is the same as the above loop.\n\n          We can also use a sliding window to compute the sum of the window sums:\n\n            Let window_sum[i] = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i] for i from 0 to n-k.\n\n            Then total_sleep_all_weeks = sum(window_sum)\n\n          But note: the prefix array is already built.\n\n          However, note: we can compute the total_sleep_all_weeks without building the entire prefix array? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = 0\n            for i in range(0, n):\n                # Each element a[i] appears in the windows starting from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) inclusive.\n                # Number of windows that include a[i] is: \n                #   left_bound = max(0, i-k+1)\n                #   right_bound = min(i, n-k)   -> actually, the window starts at j, and j must be <= i and j>= i-k+1, and j from 0 to n-k.\n                #   count_i = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1   but wait, we must ensure that the upper bound is at least the lower bound.\n\n          But the above method is also O(n). \n\n          Since n can be up to 200,000, and we are doing two methods (one with the loop over n-k+1 and one with the loop over n) but both are O(n), we can choose either.\n\n          However, the problem says the input numbers are up to 200000, so we must be efficient.\n\n          The first method (using prefix and a loop for n-k+1) is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n          But note: if k is large, then n-k+1 is small, but worst-case k=1, then we have n iterations. So worst-case n=200000, which is acceptable in Python if we do a single pass.\n\n          However, we can do better by avoiding the inner loop and just using the prefix array and then summing the differences in a single pass? \n\n          Actually, we can precompute the prefix array in O(n) and then the total_sleep_all_weeks can be computed by:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = 0\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                total_sleep_all_weeks += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n          This is one loop of n-k+1 iterations.\n\n          But note: the prefix array is of length n+1, so we can also compute:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = (prefix[k] - prefix[0]) + (prefix[k+1]-prefix[1]) + ... + (prefix[n]-prefix[n-k])\n\n          This is the same as:\n\n            = (prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n]) - (prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[n-k])\n\n          So we can precompute the prefix array and then use two slices of the prefix array and subtract.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let P = prefix (length n+1)\n            Then, the first part: sum(P[i] for i from k to n) \n            The second part: sum(P[i] for i from 0 to n-k)\n\n            Then, total_sleep_all_weeks = (sum of P[k..n]) - (sum of P[0..n-k])\n\n          But note: P[i] is the sum of the first i elements. \n\n          Then, the entire array P is [0, a0, a0+a1, ..., total_sum]\n\n          We can precompute the prefix-sum of the prefix array? But that is just the prefix array itself.\n\n          Alternatively, we can compute the sum of the subarray of P from l to r by having a prefix-sum for P? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let Q[i] = P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[i]\n\n          Then:\n\n            sum(P[k..n]) = Q[n] - Q[k-1]   [if we define Q for indices 0..n, then Q[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i} P[j]]\n\n          However, note: we have P of length n+1, so indices from 0 to n.\n\n          But wait, the first part is from index k to n (inclusive) in P.\n\n          Similarly, the second part is from index 0 to n-k (inclusive) in P.\n\n          Then:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = [Q[n] - Q[k-1]] - [Q[n-k] - Q[-1 for 0?]] \n\n          Actually, we can use:\n\n            Let Q be the prefix-sum of P, then:\n\n            sum(P[k..n]) = Q[n] - (k>0 ? Q[k-1] : 0)   but our Q is defined for indices 0..n.\n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid building Q by using:\n\n            We know that the total_sleep_all_weeks is the sum of the windows. And we have the formula above.\n\n          But note: the two methods are both O(n). However, the problem constraints say n up to 200000, and we are only allowed to use linear time.\n\n          The simple loop:\n\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                total += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n          is clear and straightforward.\n\n          Let's code accordingly.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Build prefix array of length n+1\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total_sleep = 0\n            # The number of windows is n-k+1\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                # The window from i to i+k-1: sum = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n                total_sleep += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n            # The average is total_sleep divided by (n-k+1)\n            avg = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n            # Format the output to have 10 decimal places\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\n          However, note: the example with n=1, k=1: \n            n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n            prefix = [0,10]\n            i from 0 to 0 (since 1-1+1 = 1, so range(0,1)): \n                i=0: prefix[1]-prefix[0]=10-0=10.\n            avg = 10/1 = 10.0 -> \"10.0000000000\"\n\n          Example 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n            prefix = [0,3,7,14]\n            i from 0 to 2 (because 3-2+1=2, so i=0 and i=1)\n            i=0: 7-0=7\n            i=1: 14-3=11\n            total_sleep = 7+11=18\n            avg=18/2=9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n          Example 3: \n            Input: 8 2\n                   1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\n            We already calculated: total_sleep=202750, and 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But wait, is there a faster way? \n\n          We can use the fact that the total_sleep_all_weeks is the sum of the array elements multiplied by the number of windows that cover them.\n\n          The element at index i (0-indexed) is included in the windows that start from j in the range [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)].\n\n          The number of windows that include a[i] is: \n            left = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            right = min(i, n-k)   -> but note: the window starting at j must be <= i and j>= i-k+1, and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n          Actually, the window starting at j must satisfy: j <= i and j >= i-k+1, and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n          So the count for a[i] is: \n            count_i = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1\n\n          Then total_sleep_all_weeks = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * count_i\n\n          This is also O(n) and might be faster because we avoid the nested indexing? Actually, we are still iterating over n.\n\n          However, the original method is simpler and uses the prefix array which we have to build anyway.\n\n          But note: the original method with the prefix array and then a loop of n-k+1 is O(n) and the alternative is also O(n). \n\n          However, the original method does two passes (one for prefix, one for the window sum) and the alternative does one pass (the prefix) and then we can do the multiplication in one pass.\n\n          Let me compare:\n\n          Original method:\n\n            Pass 1: build prefix (n steps)\n            Pass 2: iterate from 0 to n-k (about n steps) and add the window sum.\n\n          Alternative method:\n\n            We don't build the prefix array? Actually, we can compute the count for each index without the prefix array.\n\n          Steps for alternative:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            total_sleep = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                # Determine the range of window starts j that cover i\n                # j_min = max(0, i-k+1)\n                # j_max = min(i, n-k)   [because j cannot exceed n-k (since there are n-k+1 windows, j from 0 to n-k)]\n                # But note: the window starting at j covers days [j, j+k-1]. We require j<=i and j>=i-k+1, and j from 0 to n-k.\n\n                left = max(0, i - k + 1)\n                right = min(i, n-k)   # But wait, the condition j<=i is naturally satisfied by the minimum with i, but the condition j<=n-k is the constraint.\n\n                # Actually, j must be in [left, min(i, n-k)]? \n\n                # However, note: j cannot exceed n-k, so the upper bound is the minimum between i and n-k.\n\n                # But wait, j must be <= i (because the window starting at j must cover i: j<=i) and j must be at most n-k (by definition). Also, j must be at least i-k+1 and at least 0.\n\n                # Then the number of j is: num_j = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1\n\n                # But note: if i < k-1, then left = 0, and right = min(i, n-k). However, if i < k-1, then the window must start at 0 to i (if i<=n-k) or 0 to n-k (if i>n-k? but i is from 0 to n-1, and if i>n-k then we use n-k). \n\n                # Actually, the condition for j: j>=0 and j<=n-k, and j<=i and j>=i-k+1.\n\n                # So the valid j are from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k). If max(0, i-k+1) > min(i, n-k), then the count is 0.\n\n                # However, for i in [0, n-1], we must ensure that the window exists. \n\n                # The first window starts at 0, the last window starts at n-k.\n\n                # For i from 0 to n-1, the condition for j_min and j_max:\n\n                #   j_min = max(0, i-k+1)\n                #   j_max = min(i, n-k)\n\n                # Then if j_min <= j_max, then count = j_max - j_min + 1, else 0.\n\n                # But note: for i from 0 to n-1, the window that contains i must exist if i is within [0, n-1] and the window starts from 0 to n-k, so for i < k-1, j_min=0, j_max = min(i, n-k). Since i < k-1, then j_max = i (if i<=n-k) or n-k (if i>n-k). But i<k-1 and k>=1, so i is small. \n\n                # Actually, the condition j_min<=j_max must hold for all i from 0 to n-1? \n\n                # Example: n=3, k=2, i=0: \n                #   left = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0\n                #   right = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0\n                #   count=0-0+1=1 -> correct.\n\n                # i=1: \n                #   left = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n                #   right = min(1,1)=1\n                #   count=1-0+1=2 -> correct (because day1 is in the first window [0,1] and the second window [1,2] doesn't exist because the second window is from index1 to index2 (two days) and that's the last window? Actually, the windows are:\n                #       window0: [0,1] -> covers day0 and day1\n                #       window1: [1,2] -> covers day1 and day2\n                #   So day1 is in two windows.\n\n                # i=2 (last day, index2):\n                #   left = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1\n                #   right = min(2,1)=1   (because n-k=1)\n                #   count=1-1+1=1 -> correct.\n\n                # Now, for i=0 in n=3,k=2: count=1, for i=1: count=2, for i=2: count=1.\n\n                # Then total_sleep = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3+8+7=18 -> same as before.\n\n            Then, average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n          This alternative method is also O(n). \n\n          Which one is better? \n\n          The first method (using prefix) is more straightforward and easier to understand.\n\n          However, the alternative method avoids building the prefix array and does a single pass. \n\n          But note: the first method builds the prefix array (O(n)) and then does a loop of n-k+1 (which is O(n)).\n\n          The alternative method does a single loop of n (O(n)).\n\n          Both are acceptable.\n\n          We'll choose the first method because it is clearer and the problem is small enough (n=200000) and we are doing two passes.\n\n          However, note: the first method uses an array of n+1 and then a loop of n-k+1, which is about n. \n\n          We can also combine the two passes: \n\n            We can compute the total_sleep_all_weeks by:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                # But then we need to know the contribution of a[i] without the prefix array.\n\n          Actually, we can use the alternative method without the prefix array, but the code might be less clear.\n\n          Since the problem is very easy, I choose the first method.\n\n          But note: the problem constraints say n up to 200000, and the first method does two passes, which is acceptable.\n\n          However, we can also use:\n\n            total_sleep_all_weeks = 0\n            for i in range(k, n+1):   # i is the end index (exclusive) of the window? Actually, the window ending at i-1? \n\n          Wait, let me not complicate.\n\n          I'll stick with the prefix array method.\n\n          Code:\n\n            n, k = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            total = 0\n            # The number of windows is n-k+1\n            for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n                total += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n            avg = total / (n-k+1)\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\n          However, note: the above code uses two loops (building prefix and then the window loop). \n\n          But wait, we can compute the prefix and then the window sum in one go? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            total = 0\n            # We can use a sliding window to avoid the inner subtraction? \n\n          Actually, we can use:\n\n            total = 0\n            # First window: sum of a[0:k]\n            current = sum(a[:k])\n            total += current\n            # Then for the next window, subtract a[0] and add a[k]\n            for i in range(1, n-k+1):\n                current = current - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n                total += current\n\n          This is also O(n)",

The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of sleep times for each week and then finding the average of these weekly sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires processing a sequence of `n` integers, where each integer represents the sleep time on a particular day. For each window of `k` consecutive days (a week), we need to compute the sum of sleep times. The average of these weekly sums across all possible windows is the desired result.\n2. **Intuition**: The straightforward approach involves calculating the sum of sleep times for each window of size `k` and then averaging these sums. To optimize, we use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray (window) in constant time.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the first `i` elements of the original array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time by subtracting the prefix sums at the boundaries of the subarray.\n   - **Sliding Window**: Iterate over each possible window of size `k`, use the prefix sum array to get the sum of the current window, accumulate these sums, and finally compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows (`n - k + 1`).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in linear time, O(n), because it involves two passes over the array: one to build the prefix sum array and another to compute the total sum of all window sums. The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the prefix sum array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_sleep = 0\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(num_weeks):\n        window_sum = prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n        total_sleep += window_sum\n        \n    avg = total_sleep / num_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the length of a week `k`, and the sequence of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array Construction**: The prefix sum array is built such that each element at index `i` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep time sequence. This allows efficient computation of subarray sums.\n3. **Window Sum Calculation**: For each window of size `k` (from day `i` to day `i + k - 1`), the sum is calculated using the prefix array by subtracting the prefix sum at the start of the window from the prefix sum at the end of the window.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows (`n - k + 1`) to get the average sleep time per week. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the prefix sum array to minimize repeated calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
