He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n Steps:\n 1. The string is built in three parts:\n    - Part1: One or more 'a's (from A)\n    - Part2: Some 'b's appended (from B) -> so after this, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n    - Part3: Some 'c's appended (from C) such that the number of 'c's is either equal to the total number of 'a's OR the total number of 'b's (or both) in the entire string (which includes part1 and part2 as well).\n\n But note: the entire string includes the original 'a's, the appended 'b's, and then the appended 'c's.\n\n However, there are conditions on the order:\n   - The string must have a contiguous block of 'a's at the beginning, then a contiguous block of 'b's, then a contiguous block of 'c's.\n\n Why? Because A only uses 'a', then B appends 'b' to the end, then C appends 'c' to the end.\n\n Therefore, the string should be non-decreasing in the sense that once we see a 'b', we shouldn't see an 'a' again, and similarly for 'c'.\n\n So, we can check for the following:\n\n Condition 1: The string should not contain any letter other than 'a','b','c'.\n Condition 2: The string must be divided into three segments: [one or more 'a's], [zero or more 'b's], [zero or more 'c's]. But note: the problem states that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some 'c's. However, note that the condition says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" after B. Then C appends, so the condition on the entire string is that there is at least one 'a', at least one 'b', and then the 'c's are appended.\n\n But wait: what if there are no 'b's originally from B? Actually, the problem says: \n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's (so at least one 'a').\n   - B appends some number of 'b's (so at least one 'b').\n\n Then C appends some number of 'c's (so the final string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and the number of 'c's is either the total count of 'a' or the total count of 'b' (which now includes the original 'b's and also the ones from B? Actually, note: the entire string is built by appending. The total number of 'a's is the initial one from A. The total number of 'b's is the ones from B. The total number of 'c's is chosen by C.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n Important: the string here is the one after B has appended, so when C appends, the total 'a' is the initial count (let's say n_a), the total 'b' is the count from B (n_b). Then C appends n_c which must be either n_a or n_b (or both).\n\n But note: the entire string then has:\n   total_a = n_a (unchanged)\n   total_b = n_b (unchanged)\n   total_c = n_c (which is either n_a or n_b)\n\n However, the problem does not require the entire string to have the counts of 'a' and 'b' remain the same as initially? Actually, the string given to C is the one with the initial 'a's and the appended 'b's. So when C appends, the total 'a' is still the initial n_a, and the total 'b' is the initial n_b (from B). Then the condition for C is: n_c = n_a or n_c = n_b.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" The string at the time of C's turn is the one with the 'a's and 'b's. So the counts are fixed: n_a and n_b.\n\n Now, the overall structure: the string must be of the form: a+ b* c* (with at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the entire string).\n\n Steps to solve:\n\n 1. Check that the string only contains 'a','b','c'. (Given, but we can assume, but still check if needed? The input guarantee says so.)\n\n 2. Check",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order with certain constraints. The solution involves checking the structure and character counts of the string to ensure it meets all specified conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Invalid Characters**: The string should only contain the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If any other character is found, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Validate Character Order**: The string must consist of one or more 'a's followed by zero or more 'b's and then zero or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c') makes the string invalid.\n3. **Check Character Counts**: \n   - The number of 'c's appended must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the entire string. \n   - Additionally, the total number of 'a's and 'b's must be at least one each, as per the problem statement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    if not all(char in 'abc' for char in s):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    n = len(s)\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < n and s[idx] == 'a':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx == n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    while idx < n and s[idx] == 'b':\n        idx += 1\n        \n    while idx < n and s[idx] == 'c':\n        idx += 1\n        \n    if idx != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Check**: The code first checks if the string contains only valid characters ('a', 'b', 'c'). If any invalid character is found, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n2. **Order Validation**: The code then verifies that the string starts with one or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, and ends with zero or more 'c's. If the order is violated, it prints \"NO\".\n3. **Count Validation**: After confirming the correct order, the code counts the occurrences of each character. It checks if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural integrity and the character counts of the string to determine if it adheres to the specified construction rules.",
