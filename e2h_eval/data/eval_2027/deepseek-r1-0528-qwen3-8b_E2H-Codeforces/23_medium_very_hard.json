In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'. But note: the input is given as three separate strings in one line? Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", but looking at the example input:\n\n Input: \n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n However, the problem actually says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning one line with three space-separated strings? Or one string containing three tiles? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n But note: the example input is given as three examples, each being a string of three tiles? Actually, the example input format is ambiguous. The sample input provided in the example is:\n\n Input: \n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This seems to be showing three different inputs. But the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\". \n\n Clarification from the problem: the input is one line with three strings, but what does that mean? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n And then the example input is shown as three examples. But wait, the example input is actually three test cases? \n\n No, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input with three lines (each line being one of the examples). \n\n But the problem statement says: \"The only line\" — so there is only one line of input, which contains three strings. \n\n However, the example input is shown as:\n\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But note: the example input is provided as three separate examples. The problem actually says:\n\n   Input:\n     ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n   Output:\n     ['0', '0', '1']\n\n So, it's likely that the input is one string with three tiles? Or three tiles in one line?\n\n Let me re-read: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n This could be interpreted as: the input line has three tokens (each token is a tile). But wait, each tile is represented by two characters. So if we have three tiles, then the input line would have six characters? Or the tiles are given as three separate two-character strings?\n\n Actually, the example input format in the problem statement is written with quotes and commas, but that is just for illustration.\n\n The problem says: \"Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from 1 to 9). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile.\"\n\n So each tile is two characters. Then, three tiles would be 6 characters, but the representation in the example input is shown as:\n\n   Example 1: \"1s 2s 3s\" — wait, this is three tiles? Actually, no: the example input is given as three separate strings in the array. But the problem says \"the only line\", so the input line is one line.\n\n How should we parse the input?\n\n Let's look at the example output: \n   For input \"1s 2s 3s\" -> output 0\n   For input \"9m 9m 9m\" -> output 0\n   For input \"3p 9m 2p\" -> output 1\n\n But wait, the example input is given as three separate examples, so probably the problem expects multiple test cases? \n\n Actually, the problem statement says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n But then the example input is shown as three different lines (each containing one test case). \n\n I think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then gives three examples. However, the actual competition problem might be a single test case per run.\n\n Since the problem says \"The only line\", we assume one line of input.\n\n How is the input given? \n\n Example 1: \n   Input line: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n\n Example 2:\n   Input line: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n\n Example 3:\n   Input line: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But wait, the example input is three tiles. However, the problem says \"three strings\" — meaning three tokens? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n And note: each tile is represented by two characters. So if we have three tiles, then we have three strings, each of length 2.\n\n Therefore, the input line will have three two-character strings. We can split the input line by spaces? Or not? \n\n The problem says: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n So each tile is two characters. The entire input line has three such tiles. There are two possibilities:\n\n 1. The input line is: \"1s2s3s\" (without spaces) — then we have to take groups of two.\n 2. The input line is: \"1s 2s 3s\" (with spaces) — then we can split by space.\n\n But the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", meaning three tokens. So it's more likely that they are separated by spaces.\n\n However, let's check the example: \n   Example 3 input: \"3p 9m 2p\" — if we split by space, we get three tokens: \"3p\", \"9m\", \"2p\".\n\n So we can do:\n\n   data = input().split()\n\n Then we have a list of three strings.\n\n But wait, what if the input doesn't have spaces? The problem doesn't specify. However, the example representation uses spaces.\n\n Since the problem says \"three strings\", we assume that the input is given as three space-separated strings, each representing a tile.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the input line and split into three strings.\n\n 2. We have three tiles. We need to consider forming a mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from these three tiles (and possibly drawing more).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand\" (meaning in the entire hand, including the drawn ones). But initially she has three tiles, and then she can draw any number (minimum) of extra tiles.\n\n But note: the hand after drawing may have more than three tiles? Actually, the problem says: \"After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one.\" and we are to find the minimum number of draws so that she can win.\n\n However, the definition of mentsu requires three tiles. So we need to form at least one set of three tiles that is either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n But note: the entire hand doesn't necessarily have to be the mentsu; we just need at least one mentsu. Also, we can draw any tiles arbitrarily (any number of times, including duplicates). So we are allowed to add as many as needed.\n\n However, we are to compute the minimum number of draws.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Case 0: Already have a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu) -> then 0 draws.\n\n Case 1: Not having a mentsu initially.\n\n How many draws are required?\n\n Note: We can draw any tile arbitrarily. We are allowed to draw duplicates.\n\n Let's consider:\n\n - Koutsu: three identical tiles. We have three tiles. We can try to form a koutsu by having three of the same.\n\n   For example, if we have two tiles of the same kind, say [1m, 1m, 2m], then we need one more 1m to complete the triplet.\n\n   If we have one tile, then we need two more.\n\n   If we have three distinct tiles, then we cannot form a triplet without drawing at least two (if we pick one tile to duplicate three times) or maybe we can form a triplet by drawing two of one type and then having three of another? Actually, we can choose which triplet to form arbitrarily.\n\n   However, note: we can also form a shuntsu, so we don't necessarily have to form a triplet.\n\n - Shuntsu: three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n   We have three tiles. They might be in the same suit or not.\n\n   For example, [1m, 2m, 3m] is a shuntsu.\n\n   But [1m, 2m, 4m] is not. However, we can draw one tile (say 3m) to complete [1m,2m,3m,4m] — but wait, we don't need to use all four. Actually, we only need one mentsu. So from [1m,2m,4m] we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m, and then we have four tiles, but the condition is satisfied.\n\n   But note: the problem doesn't require to use the minimal set of tiles. We are allowed to have extra tiles.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are to compute the minimum number of draws (nonnegative integer) such that there exists a mentsu (triplet or sequence) in the hand.\n\n Since we can draw any tiles arbitrarily, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Form a triplet.\n\n   We can choose a tile type (suit and number) to duplicate until we have three. We start with the current tiles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can also form a triplet from any tile that appears at least once, and then we can duplicate the others.\n\n   However, we have three tiles. Let the frequency of each tile type be counted.\n\n   We can also form a triplet by drawing two of one tile (if we have one) or one (if we have two). \n\n   But note: we might have multiple tile types. We can choose which triplet to form.\n\n   Similarly, for a shuntsu: we can form a sequence by drawing missing tiles. \n\n   However, we can also combine both: sometimes forming a triplet might require fewer draws than forming a sequence.\n\n But note: we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily. So we can form a triplet by duplicating existing tiles. Also, we can form a sequence by drawing the missing numbers in the same suit.\n\n However, the problem is: we have three tiles. We are going to draw some tiles (each draw adds one tile). Then we check if there is at least one mentsu (any three tiles that form a triplet or a sequence).\n\n Since we can draw arbitrarily, we can also form multiple mentsu, but we only need one.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Let's denote:\n\n   Let the initial hand be H (three tiles).\n\n We consider:\n\n 0 draws: Check if there is already a mentsu.\n\n 1 draw: Check if by drawing one tile, there exists a mentsu.\n\n 2 draws: Check if by drawing two tiles, there exists a mentsu.\n\n But note: sometimes we might need more? Actually, the maximum draws we might need is 3 (because with 3 draws we have 6 tiles, and we can form at least one mentsu? Actually, we can form a mentsu with three tiles, so we don't need more than 2 draws? \n\n Why 2 draws? \n\n Because we have three tiles. \n\n - With 0 draws: if there's a mentsu, done.\n - With 1 draw: we can complete a triplet (if we have two of one tile, then drawing one more completes a triplet) or complete a sequence (if we have two tiles that are part of a sequence, and the third tile is missing, then drawing the missing tile completes the sequence). \n - With 2 draws: we can complete a triplet (if we have one of a tile, then we need two more) or complete a sequence (if we have two non-consecutive tiles, we might need two draws to complete the sequence) or even form a triplet from a tile that we haven't seen? \n\n However, note: we can also form a triplet from a tile that we don't have at all? \n\n Example: \n   Initial hand: [1m, 1m, 2m]\n\n   We can form a triplet of 1m by drawing one more 1m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can form a sequence: [1m, 2m, 3m] by drawing one 3m. But wait, we have two 1m and one 2m. Then we have two 1m, one 2m, and then we draw 3m: then we have a sequence [1m,2m,3m]. But note: we have an extra 1m. So that's okay.\n\n However, the problem does not require that the entire hand is used. We just need at least one mentsu.\n\n But note: the mentsu is a set of three tiles. We are allowed to have duplicates and extra tiles.\n\n Now, the key: we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose the best way.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if we already have a mentsu (0 draws).\n\n    Conditions for koutsu: three identical tiles.\n\n        If there exists a tile that appears three times, then koutsu.\n\n    Conditions for shuntsu: three sequential numbers in the same suit.\n\n        We need to group by suit. Then, within a suit, we need three consecutive numbers.\n\n        But note: the numbers are from 1 to 9.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 3m] is a shuntsu.\n\n        Also, [2m, 3m, 4m] is a shuntsu.\n\n        But [1m, 1m, 2m] is not.\n\n        Also, [1m, 2m, 4m] is not.\n\n        However, [1m, 2m, 2m] is not.\n\n        Also, [9m,1m,2m] is not (because 9,1,2 is not consecutive).\n\n        But note: the sequence must be consecutive. The numbers are from 1 to 9, so we can have sequences that wrap around? The problem says: [9m,1m,2m] is not allowed.\n\n 2. If not, check for 1 draw:\n\n    We can draw one tile. Then we have four tiles. We can form a mentsu if:\n\n        Option A: There is a triplet. We can form a triplet by having two of a kind and then drawing the third. Or we can form a triplet by having one of a kind and then drawing two? But wait, we are only drawing one. So we can form a triplet only if we already have two of a tile (then drawing one more makes three). \n\n        Option B: There is a shuntsu. We can form a shuntsu if we have two tiles that are consecutive (in the same suit) and the missing one is the next one. Or we have two tiles that are two apart (like 1 and 3) then we can draw the 2. Or we have two tiles that are consecutive and the missing one is the previous? \n\n        Actually, for a shuntsu, we need three consecutive. So if we have two tiles in the same suit, say [a, b] (with a and b being numbers, and same suit), then we can form a shuntsu if there exists a number x such that {x, a, b} forms a consecutive triple. \n\n        But note: the three consecutive numbers must be in increasing order. We can have:\n\n            Case 1: We have two numbers (same suit) that are consecutive: then we need the next one (if the next one doesn't exist, then we cannot form a shuntsu by drawing that one? because we only draw one). Actually, if we have [1m,2m] then we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. Similarly, if we have [2m,3m] we can draw 1m? But wait, [1m,2m,3m] is the same as [2m,3m,4m] is not the same. Actually, we can form a sequence [x, y, z] where x, y, z are consecutive. \n\n        But note: the two tiles we have might not be adjacent. For example, [1m,3m] — then we can draw 2m to form [1m,2m,3m].\n\n        However, what if we have [1m,4m]? Then we cannot form a sequence by drawing one tile because we need three consecutive. Drawing 2m or 3m won't help.\n\n        Also, we might have three tiles that are not initially forming a mentsu, but by adding one tile we can form two different mentsu? But we only need one.\n\n        Another possibility: we might form a triplet by drawing a tile that we already have (if we have two of a kind, then we complete the triplet). Or we might form a sequence by drawing a tile that completes a sequence.\n\n        But note: we might have two tiles of the same kind and also two tiles of another kind? \n\n        Example: [1m,1m,2m,3m] — wait, no, we are only drawing one tile. We have three initial tiles, then we draw one, so we have four.\n\n        Actually, we have to consider: after drawing one tile, we have four tiles. Then we can form a mentsu if any three of the four form a triplet or a sequence.\n\n        However, we can also form a triplet from two existing and the drawn one? Or a sequence from two existing and the drawn one?\n\n        Conditions for 1 draw:\n\n          - Triplet: if there is a tile that appears exactly two times, then drawing one more of that tile gives three.\n\n          - Sequence: if there is a suit that has at least two distinct numbers, and by adding one number we can complete a consecutive triple.\n\n          But note: we can also form a triplet from a tile that we haven't seen at all? No, because we only draw one tile. So to form a triplet from a new tile, we would need to draw two of the same (but we draw one). So only existing tiles can be duplicated.\n\n        Actually, for triplet: we can only complete a triplet for a tile that we already have at least two of.\n\n        For sequence: we need to check for each suit separately. For a given suit, we have some numbers. We can sort the distinct numbers in that suit. Then, we can check for consecutive triples that are missing one number.\n\n        Example: \n          Tiles: [1m, 2m, 3m] -> already done (0 draws).\n          Tiles: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> not a sequence, but if we draw 3m, then we have [1m,2m,3m] (and 4m is extra). So 1 draw.\n\n          Tiles: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> not a sequence, but we can form a triplet by drawing 1m (so 1 draw).\n\n          Tiles: [1m, 1m, 1m] -> triplet (0 draws).\n\n          Tiles: [1m, 1m, 2p] -> no triplet (only two 1m, and no other duplicates) and no sequence (different suits). Then we can form a triplet by drawing 1m (1 draw).\n\n          Tiles: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> no triplet (all distinct) and no sequence (because 1,2,4 is not consecutive). Then we can form a sequence by drawing 3m (1 draw).\n\n          Tiles: [1m, 3m, 4m] -> we can form a sequence by drawing 2m (1 draw) for [1m,2m,3m] or [2m,3m,4m]? Actually, [1m,2m,3m] is formed by drawing 2m, and [2m,3m,4m] is formed by drawing 2m (same). So 1 draw.\n\n          But wait, [1m, 3m, 4m] has two possibilities: \n            Option 1: [1m,2m,3m] -> requires 2m.\n            Option 2: [2m,3m,4m] -> requires 2m.\n            So same.\n\n          Another example: [1m, 1m, 4m] -> no triplet (we have two 1m, so we can complete triplet by drawing 1m). Also, for sequence: we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m (two draws) OR [3m,4m,5m] by drawing 5m? But wait, we only draw one. So we cannot complete a sequence with one draw? \n\n          However, we can also consider: we have two 1m and one 4m. We can draw a tile that is not 1m. But then we don't have three consecutive. \n\n          So for [1m,1m,4m]: \n            Triplet: by drawing 1m (1 draw) -> so 1 draw is sufficient.\n\n          But what if we have [1m, 4m, 5m]?\n            We have three distinct tiles. \n            Triplet: we don't have duplicates, so we cannot complete a triplet with one draw (unless we draw two of the same, but one draw only one).\n            Sequence: We have two tiles in the same suit (m) that are 4 and 5. Then we can draw 3m to form [3m,4m,5m] OR 6m to form [4m,5m,6m]? Actually, we can only form one of them. \n\n            Actually, for [1m,4m,5m]:\n                We have 1m,4m,5m. \n                We can form a sequence [4m,5m,6m] by drawing 6m -> one draw.\n                Or we can form a sequence [3m,4m,5m] by drawing 3m -> one draw.\n\n            So 1 draw.\n\n          But wait, the initial hand [1m,4m,5m] does not contain a sequence, but we can complete one by drawing one tile.\n\n          However, note: we can also consider forming a triplet? We don't have duplicates. So we cannot form a triplet with one draw.\n\n          So 1 draw.\n\n          What about [1m, 1m, 3m]?\n            Triplet: two 1m -> drawing one more 1m (1 draw)\n            Sequence: we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m (1 draw)\n\n            So two ways, but minimum is 1.\n\n          Therefore, the conditions for 1 draw are:\n\n            Condition 1: There exists a tile (type) that appears at least twice. Then we can complete the triplet by drawing one more.\n\n            Condition 2: There exists a suit and three numbers (not necessarily distinct) such that if we add one tile (same suit, one number) then we can form a consecutive triple. But note: the three consecutive numbers must be distinct.\n\n            However, we can break down:\n\n            We can form a sequence if in one suit we have two tiles that are consecutive (with a gap of one) OR two tiles that are two apart (then we can fill the middle). But actually, we can have:\n\n            Let S be the set of numbers in a suit. Then we can form a sequence if there exists three consecutive numbers (x, x+1, x+2) such that two of them are present and the third is missing. Then we can draw the missing one.\n\n            But note: we might have more than two of the same number? Then we can use one occurrence and skip the others.\n\n            However, we are allowed to use any three tiles. So if we have [1m,1m,2m] then we can form [1m,2m,?] — but we don't have 3m? Actually, we have two 1m and one 2m. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m (if we ignore one 1m). But wait, we have four tiles then: [1m,1m,2m,3m]. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] and leave the extra 1m.\n\n            But the problem: we are to check if after drawing one tile there exists a mentsu. So we don't need to use all tiles.\n\n            So for condition 2: for a suit, we have a multiset of numbers. We can form a sequence if there exists a consecutive triple (x, x+1, x+2) such that we have at least one of x, one of x+1, and one of x+2 (but note: we can have duplicates, so we don't require distinct tiles, but the consecutive triple must be three distinct numbers). \n\n            However, we are allowed to have duplicates. So we need to check: for a given consecutive triple (x, x+1, x+2), we need to have at least one tile of x, one of x+1, and one of x+2 (in the same suit) — and then we can use one occurrence of each. But note: we are drawing one tile. So we are going to add one tile. \n\n            Actually, the initial hand has three tiles. We are adding one tile. Then we have four. Then we check if there is a consecutive triple (three distinct numbers) in the same suit.\n\n            So we can iterate over the possible consecutive triples (from 1 to 7, because the triple is (x, x+1, x+2) and x can be from 1 to 7).\n\n            For a given suit, we have a set of numbers (ignoring duplicates for the existence of a number? Actually, we need at least one occurrence of each). \n\n            But wait: what if we have two of the same number? Then we have two tiles of x. Then we can use one of them for the triple.\n\n            So condition for a consecutive triple (x, x+1, x+2) in suit S is:\n\n                In the initial hand, for suit S, we have at least one tile with number x, one with x+1, and one with x+2. Then we don't need to draw any for this triple? But wait, we are checking for 1 draw. Actually, if we already have the consecutive triple, then we don't need to draw (0 draws). But we are in the case of 1 draw because we didn't have 0.\n\n            So for 1 draw, we are considering that we draw one tile. Then we have four. So we can form a consecutive triple if the initial hand has two of the three numbers in the triple (in the same suit) and the third is missing. Then we draw the missing number.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> for the triple (2,3,4): we have 2 and 4, missing 3 -> draw 3m.\n\n            Example: [1m,3m,4m] -> for the triple (1,2,3): we have 1 and 3, missing 2 -> draw 2m. For the triple (2,3,4): we have 3 and 4, missing 2 -> same.\n\n            Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> for the triple (1,2,3): we have 1 and 2, missing 3 -> draw 3m.\n\n            Example: [1m,4m,5m] -> for the triple (4,5,6): we have 4 and 5, missing 6 -> draw 6m. Also for (3,4,5): we have 4 and 5, missing 3 -> draw 3m.\n\n            Example: [1m,1m,3m] -> for the triple (1,2,3): we have 1 and 3, missing 2 -> draw 2m. Also for (0,1,2): invalid because 0 is not in [1,9]. So we only consider x from 1 to 7.\n\n            But note: the hand might have two different suits. We have to consider each suit separately.\n\n            So algorithm for 1 draw:\n\n              For each suit that appears in the hand (or even if we don't have that suit, but we can draw a tile in that suit) — wait, but we are limited to the three initial tiles and one drawn. However, we can draw a tile in any suit. But for a sequence, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So we can only complete a sequence in a suit that we already have at least two tiles? Or we can start a new suit? \n\n            Actually, we can draw a tile in a new suit, but then we only have one tile in that new suit, so we cannot form a sequence (need three consecutive). Therefore, for forming a sequence, we must use the suit that we already have at least two tiles (so that we have two numbers and then we can complete the consecutive triple). \n\n            But wait, what if we have one tile in a suit and we draw two more in the same suit? That would be two draws. \n\n            However, for 1 draw: we can only complete a sequence in a suit that we already have two distinct numbers (so we have two tiles of different numbers in that suit) OR we have two tiles of the same number and one of a different? \n\n            Actually, we need at least two distinct numbers in the same suit to form a consecutive triple by drawing one. \n\n            Therefore, for 1 draw, the sequence condition is:\n\n              There exists a suit S and a consecutive triple (x, x+1, x+2) such that in the initial hand, for suit S, we have at least two distinct numbers that are two of {x, x+1, x+2}. And the third is missing.\n\n            However, note: we might have three tiles in the same suit. Then we have three numbers. Then we can form a sequence if they are consecutive, but then we would have already 0 draws. So we are in the 0-draw case.\n\n            Therefore, for 1 draw, we are considering hands that do not have a mentsu initially.\n\n            So, for 1 draw:\n\n              Condition 1 (Triplet): There exists a tile (type) that appears at least two times. Then we can complete the triplet by drawing one more.\n\n              Condition 2 (Sequence): There exists a suit S and a consecutive triple (x, x+1, x+2) and we have two distinct numbers from {x, x+1, x+2} in suit S (and the third is missing) and we haven't already formed a sequence (which we don't because we are in 1 draw and no 0 draw).\n\n            But note: if we have two distinct numbers in a suit, we can complete a sequence by drawing the missing one. However, what if the two numbers are not part of the same consecutive triple? \n\n            Example: [1m, 5m] — we have two distinct numbers. Then we can complete two different consecutive triples:\n\n                For (0,1,2): invalid (0 not allowed).\n                For (1,2,3): we have 1, missing 2 and 3 -> so we can draw 2 or 3? But wait, we need all three. We are missing two. \n\n            Actually, we must have two of the three numbers. So for [1m,5m] we don't have two of the three numbers for any consecutive triple. \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] — we have two numbers (1 and 2, and 4) for the consecutive triple (1,2,3): we have 1 and 2, missing 3.\n\n            Example: [1m,3m,4m] — we have two numbers (3 and 4) for the consecutive triple (2,3,4): we have 3 and 4, missing 2.\n\n            Example: [1m,4m,5m] — we have two numbers (4 and 5) for the consecutive triple (3,4,5) and (4,5,6). \n\n            Example: [2m,4m,5m] — we have two numbers (4 and 5) for the consecutive triple (3,4,5) and (4,5,6). \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,5m] — we have two numbers (1 and 2) for the consecutive triple (1,2,3) and (0,1,2) invalid, so only (1,2,3): we have 1 and 2, missing 3. Also, we have two numbers (2 and 5) for the consecutive triple (4,5,6): we have 5, missing 4 and 6 -> not two. And (3,4,5): we have 5, missing 3 and 4 -> not two. So only one consecutive triple (1,2,3) is missing one.\n\n            Therefore, we can check for each suit and each consecutive triple (x from 1 to 7) whether we have two of the three numbers.\n\n            However, note: we might have more than two tiles in a suit. But we are only concerned with the distinct numbers? Actually, we don't care about duplicates for the consecutive triple: we need at least one occurrence of two distinct numbers (and the third distinct number is missing).\n\n            But wait: if we have three tiles in the same suit, and they are [1m,1m,2m] then we have two distinct numbers (1 and 2). Then for the consecutive triple (1,2,3): we have two distinct numbers (1 and 2) and missing 3. So we can draw 3m.\n\n            However, we can also form a triplet by drawing 1m. So we have two possibilities: 0 draws? No, because [1m,1m,2m] is not a mentsu. Then 1 draw by either condition.\n\n            But note: the condition for triplet is met (two 1m) so we can complete the triplet. So we don't need to rely on the sequence condition.\n\n            Therefore, we can check for 1 draw:\n\n              Step 1: Check if there is a tile that appears at least two times. If yes, then 1 draw suffices (by completing the triplet).\n\n              Step 2: Otherwise, check if there is a consecutive triple (in the same suit) that we can complete by drawing one tile. That is, for each suit, we look at the distinct numbers present. Then for each consecutive triple (x,x+1,x+2) that is contained in the set of distinct numbers (with at most one missing) and the total distinct numbers in that suit is at least two (so that we have two of the three). Then we can complete by drawing the missing one.\n\n            However, note: if we have two distinct numbers in a suit, they might not be consecutive. But we are checking consecutive triples. We only consider the consecutive triples that are entirely in the range [1,9] and for which we have two of the three numbers.\n\n            Example: [1m,3m] -> distinct numbers {1,3}. Then consecutive triples that include both 1 and 3: \n                (0,1,2): invalid because 0 not in [1,9].\n                (1,2,3): we have 1 and 3, missing 2 -> valid.\n                (2,3,4): we have 3, missing 2 and 4 -> not two.\n                ... etc.\n\n            So [1m,3m] qualifies for the consecutive triple (1,2,3) by drawing 2m.\n\n            But wait: [1m,3m] is two tiles. We are starting with three tiles? Actually, no: our hand has three tiles. But we are counting the entire hand. \n\n            The input is three tiles. So we have three tiles. \n\n            However, we are in the case where we don't have any duplicate (so no triplet condition). Then we check for the sequence condition.\n\n            Example: three tiles: [1m,3m,5m] — no duplicate, so check for sequence: \n                Suit m: distinct numbers {1,3,5}. \n                Check consecutive triples: \n                    (1,2,3): we have 1 and 3, missing 2 -> so we can draw 2m.\n                    (2,3,4): we have 3, missing 2 and 4 -> not two.\n                    (3,4,5): we have 3 and 5, missing 4 -> so we can draw 4m.\n                    (4,5,6): we have 5, missing 4 and 6 -> not two.\n\n                So two possibilities: draw 2m or 4m.\n\n            But note: we are drawing only one tile. Then we can form a mentsu by drawing either",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu (0 draws). If not, we then check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu (1 draw). If still not possible, we check if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu (2 draws). The solution involves evaluating all possible scenarios where a mentsu can be formed with the fewest additional tiles.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles. If there are at least two identical tiles in the hand, drawing one more of the same tile completes the triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit. If there are two distinct numbers in the same suit that are part of a consecutive sequence (with one missing number), drawing the missing tile completes the sequence.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Check for 0 draws**: Verify if the hand already contains a koutsu or shuntsu.\n   - **Check for 1 draw**: Determine if drawing one tile (either to complete a triplet or a sequence) is sufficient.\n   - **Check for 2 draws**: If neither 0 nor 1 draw suffices, check if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu. This could involve completing a triplet from a single tile (drawing two more) or completing a sequence by filling two missing numbers in a consecutive triple.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves checking all possible sequences and triplets, which is efficient given the constraints (tiles range from 1 to 9 and suits are limited to 'm', 'p', 's'). The checks are done in constant time, making the solution O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) < 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = data[:3]\n    \n    # Parse the tiles: each tile is two characters: first digit, second letter\n    # Represent each tile as (suit, number)\n    hand = []\n    for tile in tiles:\n        if len(tile) < 2:\n            num = tile[0]\n            suit = ''\n        else:\n            num = tile[0]\n            suit = tile[1]\n        hand.append((suit, int(num)))\n    \n    # Check for 0 draws: koutsu or shuntsu\n    # Koutsu: three identical tiles\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_tiles = defaultdict(int)\n    for s, num in hand:\n        count_tiles[(s, num)] += 1\n        \n    has_koutsu = False\n    for count in count_tiles.values():\n        if count >= 3:\n            has_koutsu = True\n            break\n            \n    has_shuntsu = False\n    suit_groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for s, num in hand:\n        suit_groups[s].append(num)\n        \n    for s, nums in suit_groups.items():\n        unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))\n        n = len(unique_nums)\n        if n < 3:\n            continue\n        for i in range(n - 2):\n            a, b, c = unique_nums[i], unique_nums[i+1], unique_nums[i+2]\n            if b == a + 1 and c == b + 1:\n                has_shuntsu = True\n                break\n        if has_shuntsu:\n            break\n            \n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for 1 draw: either complete a triplet or complete a sequence\n    # Triplet: any tile that appears at least twice\n    has_triplet_condition = False\n    for count in count_tiles.values():\n        if count >= 2:\n            has_triplet_condition = True\n            break\n            \n    # Sequence: for each suit, check if there exists a consecutive triple with one missing\n    has_sequence_condition = False\n    for s, nums in suit_groups.items():\n        unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))\n        n = len(unique_nums)\n        if n < 2:\n            continue\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            if start not in unique_nums and start+1 not in unique_nums and start+2 not in unique_nums:\n                continue\n            if start in unique_nums and start+1 in unique_nums and start+2 in unique_nums:\n                continue\n            if (start in unique_nums and start+1 in unique_nums and start+2 not in unique_nums) or \\\n               (start in unique_nums and start+2 in unique_nums and start+1 not in unique_nums) or \\\n               (start+1 in unique_nums and start+2 in unique_nums and start not in unique_nums):\n                has_sequence_condition = True\n                break\n        if has_sequence_condition:\n            break\n            \n    if has_triplet_condition or has_sequence_condition:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for 2 draws: \n    # Option 1: Complete a triplet from a tile that appears once (draw two of the same)\n    # Option 2: Complete a sequence by drawing two missing tiles in a consecutive triple\n    # But note: we might also consider forming a triplet from a tile that doesn't exist in the hand? \n    # However, we can draw any tile, so we can choose to draw two of a tile that appears once.\n    # Also, for sequences, we might have two tiles in a suit that are part of a consecutive triple but missing two numbers.\n    # Since we can draw any tile, we can always form a mentsu with at most 2 draws.\n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into three tiles.

If found, it prints 0.\n3. **1 Draw Check**: The code checks if drawing one tile can complete a koutsu (any tile appearing at least twice) or a shuntsu (two numbers in a suit that can form a consecutive triple with one missing number). If found, it prints 1.\n4. **2 Draws Check**: If no mentsu can be formed with 0 or 1 draw, the code defaults to 2 draws, as it is always possible to form a mentsu by drawing two tiles (either completing a triplet from a single tile or a sequence with two missing numbers).\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form a mentsu, ensuring optimal performance.",
