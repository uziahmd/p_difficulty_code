Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\nWe are given:\n  n and x: two integers in the first line.\n  a list of n integers (the found cards)\n\nWe can assume that Vanya had infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x (so we can choose any card with absolute value <= x).\n\nGoal: We have some found cards. We want to find the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum is zero.\n\nLet S be the sum of the found cards.\n\nWe need to achieve a total sum of 0, so the sum of the additional cards must be -S.\n\nWe are allowed to choose any number of cards (each card is an integer between -x and x) and we want the minimum number of cards to make the sum -S.\n\nNote: We can also use the fact that we have negative and positive numbers available.\n\nWhat is the maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards?\nEach card has absolute value at most x, so the maximum absolute value we can get with k cards is k*x.\n\nBut note: we don't necessarily need the maximum absolute value, but we need the sum to be exactly -S.\n\nHowever, there's a catch: we can only use integers in the range [-x, x]. \n\nThe key idea:\n\n1. Let current_sum = sum(found_cards). Then we need to form the value -current_sum by adding as few cards as possible (each card between -x and x).\n\n2. We are allowed to pick any integer values (within [-x, x]) for each card.\n\n3. The problem reduces to: what is the minimum nonnegative integer k such that there exists integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (each |a_i|<=x) and \n   a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_k = -current_sum?\n\nHow to think about it?\n\nNote: The minimal k must satisfy that | -current_sum | <= k*x, because the maximum absolute sum we can get from k cards is k*x.\n\nBut also, we must be able to form the exact value -current_sum.\n\nActually, we can use the following:\n\n- If current_sum is already 0, then we need 0 cards.\n\n- Otherwise, we need to cover the deficit of -current_sum.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use negative and positive numbers arbitrarily.\n\nThe minimal k must be at least ceil(|current_sum| / x) because the maximum absolute value per card is x. However, that is not always sufficient.\n\nWait: consider if current_sum is positive, then we need to add negative numbers. Similarly for negative.\n\nBut also, we can mix positive and negative? Actually, no, because we are trying to get to -current_sum. So if current_sum is positive, we need negative numbers. But we might also use positive numbers and negative numbers in the same set? Actually, we are free to choose any integers (positive, negative, or zero) as long as they are in [-x, x].\n\nBut note: the goal is to minimize the number of cards. \n\nWe can consider:\n\nCase 1: If current_sum is 0, answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Otherwise, we need to form the value T = -current_sum.\n\nWe are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. We are to find the minimum k such that T is in the set of achievable sums with k cards.\n\nWhat are the constraints for T to be achievable with k cards?\n\n1. |T| <= k*x.\n\n2. Additionally, we must be able to form T by adding k numbers each in [-x, x]. There is a known coin problem variant: we can form any integer T as long as |T| <= k*x and k is sufficiently large? Not exactly, because we have both positive and negative.\n\nActually, we can form any integer T as long as:\n\n  - |T| <= k*x, and\n  - T is congruent modulo 2 to something? Actually, we have both even and odd steps? \n\nBut note: we can use any integers. In particular, we can adjust by 2 if we have at least two cards (because we can use two cards: one +1 and one -1, but wait, we have up to x, not just 1). Actually, the set of numbers is symmetric and includes all integers from -x to x.\n\nHowever, note that the set of numbers includes all integers in [-x, x], so the gcd of the step sizes is 1 (if x>=1). Therefore, by the Chicken McNugget theorem, for sufficiently large k, we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k*x and T is in the set of residues modulo 1? Actually, since we can form 1 (if x>=1) then we can form any integer T provided k is large enough and |T| <=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. Each card must have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the sum of the found cards must be balanced by the sum of the additional cards. Let the sum of the found cards be `S`. The additional cards must sum to `-S`. The challenge is to find the smallest number of cards (each with values between -x and x) that can sum to `-S`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the absolute value of `S` and the maximum absolute value per card (x). The worst-case scenario is when each card contributes the maximum possible absolute value towards balancing the sum. Thus, the minimal number of cards needed is at least the ceiling of `abs(S)/x`. However, we must also ensure that the sum `-S` can be achieved with these cards.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - If the sum `S` of the found cards is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the required sum `-S`. The minimal number of cards is the smallest integer `k` such that `k * x >= abs(S)` and the sum `-S` can be formed using `k` cards. Since the cards can be any integers between -x and x, the only constraints are the magnitude of the sum and the number of cards.\n\n4. **Optimization**: The solution involves calculating the ceiling of `abs(S)/x` and checking if the sum `-S` can be achieved with that number of cards. Given the symmetry and range of card values, as long as the total magnitude constraint is satisfied, the sum can always be achieved.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    deficit = abs(total)\n    k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n    \n    while True:\n        if k * x >= deficit:\n            print(k)\n            break\n        else:\n            k += 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by `n` integers representing the card values.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the total sum of the found cards. If this sum is zero, output `0` since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Deficit Calculation**: The deficit is the absolute value of the total sum, representing the magnitude by which the sum needs to be balanced.\n4. **Card Count Calculation**: The minimal number of cards `k` is calculated as the ceiling of `deficit/x`. This ensures that the combined magnitude of `k` cards (each up to `x` in absolute value) is at least `deficit`.\n5. **Output**: The calculated `k` is printed, which is the minimum number of additional cards required to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently balances the sum using the minimal number of cards by leveraging simple arithmetic and ensures correctness by adhering to the constraints provided.",
