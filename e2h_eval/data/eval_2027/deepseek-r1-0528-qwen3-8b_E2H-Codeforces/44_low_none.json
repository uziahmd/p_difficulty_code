He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line n, k; second line list of n integers.\n\n Conditions:\n   - We must split the list of n problems (in order) into exactly k contiguous segments (each segment is a contiguous part from the start).\n   - The profit of a day is the maximum difficulty in the problems solved that day.\n   - Total profit is the sum of the daily profits.\n\n Observation:\n   Since the problems are contiguous and we cannot change the order, we can use dynamic programming.\n\n Let dp[i][j] = maximum total profit we can achieve after having covered the first i problems and used j days.\n However, note: we must also output the segmentation.\n\n But note constraints: n, k up to 2000. So O(n^2*k) might be too slow (n^2 * k = 8e9 which is too slow in Python).\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n How do we compute the profit for a segment [l, r]? It is the maximum value in the segment.\n\n We know that the entire array is fixed. We want to break the array into k contiguous segments.\n\n Another idea: we can precompute the maximums for all contiguous segments? Actually, we can use a two-pointer or DP with state (i, j) meaning the j-th day ends at i-1, but then we need to consider the next day starting at i.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n Let's define:\n   dp[j][i] = maximum total profit for the first i problems using j days.\n\n Then we need to consider: the last day (j-th day) covers from x to i (inclusive). Then the profit for that day is max(a[x..i]), and the total profit is dp[j-1][x-1] + max(a[x..i]).\n\n But how to quickly get the max(a[x..i]) for all x from 1 to i? And we have to consider the previous segment ended at x-1.\n\n However, we can precompute a table M where M[i][j] = maximum value in the subarray from index i to j (0-indexed). But building such a table for every i,j would be O(n^2) and n=2000 -> 4e6 elements, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we have to be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a sparse table or segment tree for range maximum queries, but since n is 2000, we can just precompute a 2D array for the maximums.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute a 2D array `max_val` such that `max_val[i][j]` is the maximum from index i to j (inclusive). We can do this by:\n      max_val[i][j] = max(max_val[i][j-1], a[j])   for j>=i, and if j==i then a[i].\n\n    But we can do it in a smarter way: for each starting index i, we can compute the maximum from i to j for increasing j.\n\n    Actually, we can do:\n\n        max_val = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            current = 0\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                if a[j] > current:\n                    current = a[j]\n                max_val[i][j] = current\n\n    But note: we only need the maximum from i to j, and we can also use:\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a DP that for each i, we store the next indices where the maximum increases? Actually, we don't need the whole table, but we can use a different DP.\n\n 2. We design the DP:\n\n        dp[0][0] = 0, and for i from 1 to n, dp[0][i] = -infinity (since we need at least one day)\n\n        For j from 1 to k:\n            for i from j to n:  (since we need at least j problems for j days, because each day at least one)\n                dp[j][i] = max_{x from j-1 to i-1} { dp[j-1][x] + max_val[x][i-1] } \n\n        Wait, but note: our array is 0-indexed. Let's assume we are considering the first i problems (index 0 to i-1). Then the last day goes from some position x (which is the end of the previous day) to i-1. The previous day ends at x-1, so the first problem of the last day is x, and the last is i-1.\n\n        Actually, let's define:\n            dp[j][i] = maximum total profit for the first i problems (i.e., a_0 to a_{i-1}) using j days.\n\n        Then the last day covers from p to i-1 (so",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp gets from solving problems over exactly `k` days, where each day he solves a contiguous segment of problems from the start of the list. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the profit for each day depends on the maximum difficulty in the contiguous segment of problems solved that day. The challenge is to partition the list of problems into `k` contiguous segments such that the sum of the maximum difficulties in each segment is maximized.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[j][i]` where `j` represents the number of days and `i` represents the number of problems solved so far. The value `dp[j][i]` stores the maximum total profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems in `j` days.\n\n3. **Precompute Maximum Values**: To efficiently compute the maximum difficulty in any segment, we precompute a 2D array `max_val` where `max_val[l][r]` is the maximum difficulty from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) in the problem list.\n\n4. **DP Transition**: For each day `j` and each problem count `i`, we consider all possible starting positions for the current day's segment. The transition involves finding the best previous state (after `x` problems in `j-1` days) and adding the maximum difficulty of the segment from `x` to `i-1`.\n\n5. **Backtracking for Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[k][n]` to determine the exact segments that achieve the maximum profit. This involves keeping track of the starting positions of each day's segment during the DP computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 1:\n        print(sum(a))\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    max_val = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        cur = 0\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            if a[j] > cur:\n                cur = a[j]\n            max_val[i][j] = cur\n            \n    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(k+1)]\n    prev_end = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(k+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            best = -1\n            start_index = -1\n            for x in range(j-1, i):\n                seg_max = max_val[x][i-1]\n                candidate = dp[j-1][x] + seg_max\n                if candidate > best:\n                    best = candidate\n                    start_index = x\n            if best != -1:\n                dp[j][i] = best\n                prev_end[j][i] = start_index\n                \n    total_profit = dp[k][n]\n    print(total_profit)\n    \n    starts = [0] * k\n    ends = [0] * k\n    current_end = n\n    for day in range(k-1, -1, -1):\n        start_pos = prev_end[day+1][current_end]\n        starts[day] = start_pos + 1\n        ends[day] = current_end\n        current_end = start_pos\n        \n    day_lengths = [ends[i] - starts[i] + 1 for i in range(k)]\n    \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, day_lengths)))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads input values for the number of problems `n`, the number of days `k`, and the list of problem difficulties.\n2. **Single Day Case**: If only one day is required, the total profit is simply the sum of all problem difficulties.\n3. **Precompute Maximum Values**: The `max_val` table is built to store the maximum difficulty between any two indices, allowing quick lookup during DP transitions.\n4. **DP Table Construction**: The DP table `dp[j][i]` is filled by considering all possible segments ending at `i` for `j` days, using the precomputed `max_val` to determine the segment's profit.\n5. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, the solution backtracks to find the exact segments that achieve the maximum profit. The lengths of these segments are then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum profit by leveraging dynamic programming and precomputed maximum values, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
