    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and occurrences can overlap).\n\n Since the string length is small (<=100), we can do:\n\n Approach:\n 1. Let n = len(s)\n 2. We'll iterate over all possible starting indices and then expand the substring length until the end.\n 3. For each substring, we will check if it appears again somewhere else in the string (we can use a set or dictionary to store seen substrings, but note: we want the longest one that appears at least twice).\n\n But note: the problem asks for the length of the substring. We are to output the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n However, we can also think: what is the maximum length L for which there is a substring of length L appearing at least twice?\n Since the string is short, we can try from the longest possible (which is floor(n/2) because two non-overlapping? Actually, overlapping is allowed so even the entire string might appear twice if the string is repeated? But note: the substring must appear at least twice. The entire string appearing twice would require the string to be periodic, but the problem says \"substring\" and occurrences can overlap. However, the entire string cannot appear twice unless the string is repeated, but if the entire string appears twice then we have two copies, and they can overlap only if the string is of length 0? Actually, for example: \"aaa\" has two occurrences of the entire string? Actually, the entire substring \"aaa\" only appears once as a contiguous substring? But note: the problem does not specify that the two occurrences must be distinct in the sense of starting indices. However, typically, we consider two occurrences as two different starting indices. So the entire string can appear at most once (unless the string is periodic, but for \"aaa\", the entire string \"aaa\" is present at index0 and index1? Actually, no: the substring from index0 is \"aaa\", and from index1 is \"aa\", so the entire string only appears once.\n\n Actually, let me clarify with the sample: \n   Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n Explanation:\n   - \"abcd\": There's no substring that appears at least twice. So output 0.\n   - \"ababa\": The substring \"aba\" appears twice (at index0 and index2). Also, \"bab\" appears twice? Actually, let's list:\n        Substrings of length 3: \n            \"aba\" (from index0) and \"aba\" (from index2) -> so length 3 is valid.\n            Also, \"bab\" (from index1) and ... wait, is there another \"bab\"? \n            Actually, the string is \"ababa\". The substring \"aba\" is found at index0 and index2. The substring \"bab\" is found at index1 and index3? \n            But at index3: from index3 we have only one character. So actually, \"bab\" only appears once? \n            Actually, the substring \"bab\" starts at index1 and then we don't have another one because the next part is \"a\". \n            So the longest is 3.\n\n        However, note that the substring \"a\" appears many times, but we are looking for the longest.\n\n   - \"zzz\": The substring \"zz\" appears twice: at index0 and index1. So output 2.\n\n Alternate approach: \n   We can iterate over the possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is n-1, because we need two occurrences and the string length is n, but note: two occurrences of a substring of length L must have two starting indices i and j such that the substring s[i:i+L] equals s[j:j+L]. The condition for overlapping: j can be less than i+L.\n\n   Steps:\n   - We can start by trying the maximum possible L (from floor(n/2) down to 1) and check if there exists any substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   However, note: the two occurrences can be anywhere, even overlapping. For example, in \"ababa\", the substring \"aba\" (length 3) appears at index0 and index2.\n\n   But note: the maximum L cannot exceed n//1 (so n) but if we take L = n, then the substring is the whole string and we need two occurrences. The whole string can only appear once (unless the string is periodic and we have two identical consecutive parts, but then the two occurrences would require the string to be at least 2n long? Actually, no: we are just looking for two",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution must efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings where no such substring exists.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters (substring) within a string that occurs at least twice. The key observation here is that the occurrences can overlap, which means we don't necessarily need non-overlapping instances of the substring.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string, starting from the longest possible down to the shortest, to determine if any substring repeats. This approach ensures that we find the longest valid substring early, optimizing the solution.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a nested loop to generate all possible substrings. The outer loop fixes the start index, and the inner loop varies the end index to form substrings of increasing lengths. For each substring, we check if it appears again later in the string. If found, we record the length and break early since we are checking from the longest possible substring downwards.\n4. **Optimization**: By iterating from the longest possible substring length downwards, we can immediately return the first valid length found, which is guaranteed to be the longest possible. This avoids unnecessary checks for shorter substrings once the solution is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    max_length = 0\n    found = False\n\n    for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for start in range(0, n - length + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+length]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(length)\n                found = True\n                return\n            seen[substr] = True\n\n    if not found:\n        print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. If the string is empty, the output is immediately 0.\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `max_length` and `found` are initialized to keep track of the longest valid substring length and whether such a substring has been found.\n3. **Nested Loops**: The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from the longest (`n-1`) down to 1. For each length, the inner loop generates all substrings of that length.\n4. **Substring Check**: Each generated substring is checked against a dictionary `seen` to see if it has appeared before. If a duplicate is found, the current length is printed, and the program exits, as we are checking from the longest possible substring downwards.\n5. **Output Result**: If no duplicate substring is found after all checks, the program outputs 0, indicating no valid substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of the problem.",
