He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How do we count trailing zeros in n!?\n The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the limiting factor is the exponent of 5.\n\n Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n Then, f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the function f(n) is non-decreasing. Moreover, for a fixed m, there might be a contiguous range of n that yield the same number of trailing zeros? Actually, no: the trailing zeros increase in steps. For example, from n=5 to n=9, we have 1 trailing zero (for n=5 to 9). Then at n=10, we get 2 trailing zeros.\n\n But note: the problem asks for n such that the factorial ends with exactly m zeros.\n\n Observation:\n   Let g(m) be the set of n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the same m may appear for multiple consecutive n. In fact, once the trailing zeros jump from m-1 to m+1 or more, then there is a gap.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We first need to understand that for a given m, the values of n that satisfy f(n)=m form an interval (if any). But note: the function f(n) is strictly increasing only at multiples of powers of 5. However, the condition f(n)=m holds for a contiguous set of n.\n\n 2. How to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m? And the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1?\n\n Actually, we want:\n   Let L(m) be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n   Then, the largest n such that f(n) < m+1 is L(m)-1? Not exactly.\n\n Alternatively, we can use binary search to find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m (call it low_bound) and the minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1 (call it high_bound). Then the numbers n that have exactly m zeros are the numbers from low_bound to high_bound - 1.\n\n However, note: if there is no n such that f(n)=m, then we output nothing (but the problem states m>=1 and up to 100000, so we know that m is in the range of the trailing zeros).\n\n But wait: the trailing zeros function f(n) takes on every value? Actually, no. There might be gaps. For example, when m=0, we have n from 0 to 4. Then m=1, n from 5 to 9. Then m=2, n from 10 to 14. But then m=3: n from 15 to 19. Then m=4: n from 20 to 24. Then m=5: n from 25 to ... but wait, at n=25, we have an extra factor of 5 (so two extra factors) so the trailing zeros jump from 6 (at 24: 24//5 + 24//25 = 4+0 -> wait, let me compute:\n\n   f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 + ... = 4 + 0 = 4.\n   f(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 + 25//125 = 5 + 1 + 0 = 6.\n\n So between m=4 and m=6, we skip m=5.\n\n Therefore, we cannot assume that every m from 1 to 100000 is achieved.\n\n So the plan:\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Call this L.\n   Step 2: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Call this R.\n\n   Then, the numbers n for which f(n)=m are from L to R-1 (if any). But note: if R does not exist (meaning we don't reach m+1) then R would be infinity? However, m is at most 100000, and we know that for n sufficiently large, the trailing zeros become very large. But we can set an upper bound.\n\n   However, we must consider that sometimes m might not be achieved. Then what? The problem says: \"print k — the number of values of n\", and then the list.\n\n   But note: if there is no n such that f(n)=m, then the interval [L, R-1] might be empty? Actually, if the minimal n for m is L, and the minimal n for m+1 is also L (which should not happen because f(L) >= m and then f(L) >= m+1? Actually, no: if we define L as the minimal n such that f(n)>=m, then for m+1 we require even larger n.\n\n   However, if m is skipped, then we have:\n        f(L) = m (because if f(L)=m, then we stop at m and then the next value is at least m+1) OR maybe f(L) = m+1? \n\n   Actually, we have two cases:\n\n   Case 1: There exists an n0 such that f(n0)=m. Then the minimal n for m is n0, and the minimal n for m+1 is the next n where the trailing zeros become m+1, which is greater than n0.\n\n   Case 2: There is no n0 such that f(n0)=m. Then the minimal n for m is actually the same as the minimal n for m+1? No, because if m is skipped, then the minimal n for m is the same n that gives m+1. But wait, the function f(n) is non-decreasing and integer valued. Then if m is skipped, then the minimal n for which f(n) >= m is the same as the minimal n for which f(n) >= m+1. Then the interval [L, R-1] would be from L to L-1, which is empty.\n\n   Therefore, we can say:\n\n        If the minimal n for m is L, and the minimal n for m+1 is R, then the numbers n with f(n)=m are the integers in [L, R-1].\n\n   But if R == L, then there's no n with f(n)=m.\n\n   However, note: if m is achieved, then we must have f(L)=m (because L is the minimal n for m) and then f(L) < m+1? Not necessarily: it could be that L is the minimal n for m, but then at L we have f(L)=m, and then at some point before we hit m+1, we have f(n)=m until n=R-1. But how do we know that R is the first n that gives m+1? \n\n   Actually, the definition of R is the minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1. Then if there is an n0 (which is L) such that f(L)=m, then R must be > L because f(L)=m < m+1, so R is the next jump. But note: we might have multiple jumps: from m to m+k (k>=1) in one step.\n\n   Example: m=5. Then the minimal n for which f(n)>=5 is 25 (because f(24)=4, f(25)=6). Then R = minimal n for which f(n)>=6 is 25. So then the interval [L, R-1] is [25,24] which is empty. But wait, we just said that m=5 is skipped.\n\n   Correction: We must check if m is skipped, then there is no solution. Otherwise, we have solutions.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n     1. Define a function count_trailing_zeros(n): returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n     2. Use binary search to find:\n          L = minimal n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n          R = minimal n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n     3. Then the numbers n that satisfy the condition are from L to R-1.\n\n     4. But note: we must ensure that at L, the trailing zeros is exactly m. However, if we found L as the minimal n for m, then by definition, for all n < L, f(n) < m. Then at L, f(L) >= m. But it might be that f(L) > m (like in the example m=5, then L=25 and f(25)=6). Then the set {n: f(n)=m} is empty.\n\n     5. Therefore, we must check: if f(L) != m, then there is no n such that f(n)=m. But wait, our binary search for m was defined as >= m. Then the minimal n for which f(n)>=m is L, and then we check the value at L. If f(L) == m, then we have n from L to R-1 (where R is the minimal n for m+1). If f(L) > m, then there is no n with exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the set of n with f(n)=m is non-empty if and only if there exists an n such that f(n)=m. And that happens if and only if the minimal n for m is such that f(L)=m.\n\n   But note: if we define L as the minimal n such that f(n)>=m, then if f(L) > m, then the minimal n for m is actually the same as the minimal n for m' = f(L) (which is greater than m). Then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n   So:\n\n        Step 1: Find L = minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n        Step 2: Check if f(L) == m. If not, then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n        However, wait: what if m is achieved by an n less than L? But by definition, L is the minimal n for which f(n)>=m, so if there is an n0 < L with f(n0)=m, then L wouldn't be minimal. So if f(L) != m, then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n   But wait, what if m is achieved by an n that is not the minimal n for m? Actually, the minimal n for m must be the smallest n such that f(n)=m, because the function is non-decreasing.\n\n   However, note: the minimal n for m is defined by >=m. Then if f(L)=m, then we have an n (namely L) with f(n)=m. But if f(L)>m, then we don't have any n with f(n)=m.\n\n   So the procedure:\n\n        Let L = minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n        Let R = minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then if f(L) != m, then the answer is 0 and we output nothing beyond the count.\n\n        But wait, we must output the count first. Then:\n\n            k = max(0, R - L)   [if there is an n with f(n)=m, then the n's are from L to R-1, so there are (R - L) numbers]\n\n        However, if f(L) == m, then the numbers are from L to R-1, so the count is (R - L). But if f(L) != m, then the set is empty.\n\n        But note: we found L as the minimal n for m, so if f(L) > m, then there is no n with f(n)=m. However, if f(L)==m, then we have numbers.\n\n   However, what if m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n   But wait, the problem says m>=1 and <=100000.\n\n   Now, how to compute L and R?\n\n        We can use binary search for L:\n\n            low = 0, high = something big (since m<=100000, we know that n! has at least 100000 zeros, so n must be at least around 500000? Actually, we can set an upper bound: the minimal n for m is at most 5*m (because each 5 contributes at least one zero, but actually we have to account for higher powers). We can set:\n\n            Let high = 5 * m   (but this might not be enough for m=100000? Let's check: for m=100000, then n must be at least 400000? Actually, the formula for trailing zeros is:\n\n                f(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... \n\n            We can set an upper bound: since f(n) ~ n/4 (actually, the series converges to n/(5-1) = n/4, but that's an approximation). So n should be about 4*m. But to be safe, we can set:\n\n                high = 5 * m   # because n//5 + n//25 + ... <= n/5 + n/25 + ... = n/4, so we need n>=4*m. But we want an upper bound that is definitely greater than the minimal n for m.\n\n            However, to be safe, we can set:\n\n                high = 5 * m   (this is an upper bound for the minimal n? Actually, the minimal n for m is at most 5*m? Because if n=5*m, then f(5*m) >= 5*m//5 + 5*m//25 + ... >= m (since 5*m//5 = m, and the rest are nonnegative). So 5*m is an upper bound.\n\n            But wait, we are doing minimal n for >=m, so we can set high = 5*m + 100? Actually, we can set high = 5 * m + 100 (to be safe) or even better, we can set high = 5 * m * 2 (or use a while loop to double until we exceed m). But m is up to 100000, so we can set:\n\n                high = 500000   (which is 5 * 100000) is safe.\n\n        Steps for binary search for L:\n\n            low = 0\n            high = 500000   (since m<=100000, the minimal n for m is at most 500000)\n\n            while low < high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n                    high = mid\n                else:\n                    low = mid+1\n\n            Then L = low.\n\n        Similarly, for R (minimal n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1), we can use the same function and set high = 500000 (or even 500000 is safe because m+1 is 100001, so the minimal n for m+1 is at most 500000 as well).\n\n        But note: if m is 100000, then m+1 is 100001, and the minimal n for 100001 might be slightly above 500000? Let's check: \n\n            We know that for n=500000, the trailing zeros is:\n\n                f(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + 500000//125 + ... \n\n            This is a geometric series: \n                term1 = 500000//5 = 100000\n                term2 = 500000//25 = 20000\n                term3 = 500000//125 = 4000\n                term4 = 800\n                term5 = 160\n                term6 = 32\n                term7 = 6\n                term8 = 1\n\n            Sum = 100000+20000+4000+800+160+32+6+1 = 124999.\n\n            So 500000 gives 124999 zeros, which is more than 100000 and 100001. So we are safe.\n\n        However, to be absolutely safe, we can set the high bound to 1000000 (if needed) but 500000 is already above 100000.\n\n        But note: the minimal n for m=100000 is at most 500000, and the minimal n for m=100001 is also at most 500000 (since 500000 gives 124999). However, we might need a higher bound for m=100000? Actually, the minimal n for m=100000 is less than 500000. But we set high=500000, so that's okay.\n\n        However, what if m=0? But the problem says m>=1.\n\n   Implementation of count_trailing_zeros(n):\n\n        def count_trailing_zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n            return count\n\n   Then:\n\n        L = minimal n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n        R = minimal n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, if count_trailing_zeros(L) != m:\n            Then k = 0\n        Else:\n            k = R - L   (because the numbers are from L to R-1, inclusive)\n\n        Then output:\n            print(k)\n            if k > 0:\n                # Output the numbers from L to R-1, each separated by space.\n                # But note: k can be very large? The problem says m up to 100000, and the numbers n can be from, say, 1000 to 1000000, so the list of numbers might be huge (up to 10^6 numbers). We cannot output them all if there are millions.\n\n        Wait, the problem says: \"First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\n        But note: the sample input ['1', '5'] outputs: \n            ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n        However, if m is 5, then the answer is 0. But if m is 1, then we output 5 numbers.\n\n        But if m is 0, then we output 0 numbers (but m>=1). \n\n        The issue: the range [L, R-1] might be very large. For example, if m is small, then the interval might contain many numbers (like m=1: 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers). But if m is large, the interval might be only one number (if the trailing zeros jump by more than one at a certain n) or even empty.\n\n        However, the problem says m from 1 to 100000. The worst-case scenario for the length of the interval is when the trailing zeros increase by one at each n? Actually, they increase by one only when n is divisible by 5 but not by 25, etc. But note: the trailing zeros can jump by more than one.\n\n        But the problem does not require to output the entire list if the list is too long? Actually, the problem says \"print these k integers\". However, k can be up to ...?\n\n        Consider: the minimal n for m is L, and the next time the trailing zeros increases is at R. The length of the interval is R-L. How big can R-L be?\n\n        Actually, the trailing zeros function f(n) is constant over intervals. The length of the interval for a given m is the gap between two consecutive jumps (when the trailing zeros increase). The jumps occur at multiples of 5, but the size of the jump is the exponent of 5 in n (i.e., if n is divisible by 5^k but not 5^(k+1), then adding n increases the trailing zeros by k.\n\n        However, the maximum gap for a given m is when the jump is large (like at n=25, the jump is 2). Then the interval for m=4 is from 20 to 24 (5 numbers) and then the next jump is 25, which goes to 6.\n\n        In general, the gap (the length of the interval for m) is at most 4? Actually, no: the gap is the distance from the last time we added a factor of 5 to the next time. Actually, the trailing zeros remain constant until the next multiple of 5. But when we hit a multiple of 5, we add at least one, and sometimes more.\n\n        Actually, the trailing zeros increase only at multiples of 5. And the amount of increase is the exponent of 5 in that number.\n\n        But the interval for m is from the smallest n0 such that f(n0)=m to the smallest n1 such that f(n1)=m+1 (or more). The length of the interval is (n1 - n0). Since the trailing zeros increase only at multiples of 5, then the next jump is at n1, and the previous jump was at the last multiple of 5 that caused the trailing zeros to become m.\n\n        However, the length of the interval is at most 5? Actually, no: consider m=0: n from 0 to 4 -> 5 numbers. But m>=1. For m=1: n from 5 to 9 -> 5 numbers. For m=2: n from 10 to 14 -> 5 numbers. Then at m=3: 15 to 19 -> 5 numbers. Then m=4: 20 to 24 -> 5 numbers. Then m=5: skipped, then m=6: 25 to 29 -> 5 numbers? But wait, at n=25, we add two zeros (so from 4 zeros to 6 zeros). Then the interval for m=4 is 20 to 24 (5 numbers) and for m=6 is 25 to 29 (5 numbers). Then m=5 is skipped.\n\n        So the maximum gap (the length of the interval for a given m) is 5, unless the jump is more than 1? Actually, the jump can be more than 1, but then the interval for m is still 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n        Actually, the trailing zeros function f(n) is constant between multiples of 5. Specifically, it increases by the exponent of 5 in n when n is a multiple of 5. And the exponent of 5 in n is at least 1. The next time the trailing zeros increases is at the next multiple of 5. So the interval for a particular m is always 5 consecutive numbers, unless the jump at a multiple of 5 causes skipping some m.\n\n        Therefore, the length of the interval (the count k) is either 0, or 5 (if the jump is exactly 1) or more? Actually, no: the jump is the exponent of 5 in n. For example, n=25: exponent is 2. Then the jump is 2, so we skip one m (from 4 to 6). Then the interval for m=4 is 5 numbers (20-24) and then the interval for m=6 is 25-29 (5 numbers). \n\n        But wait, what if we have a jump of 3? Then we skip two m's. Then the interval for the original m is 5 numbers, and then the next m (after the jump) is 5 numbers. \n\n        Actually, the key is: the trailing zeros function f(n) is constant on intervals [5*k, 5*k+4] (if k is not a multiple of 5, then the next change is at 5*k+5). However, if k is a multiple of 5, then the next change is at 5*k+5, but the jump at 5*k is the exponent of 5 in 5*k.\n\n        But the length of the interval for a given m is always 5? Actually, yes, because the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5, and between two consecutive multiples of 5 (say from 5*k to 5*k+4) the trailing zeros remain constant. So the interval for m is always 5 consecutive numbers, unless the jump at the next multiple of 5 skips over m.\n\n        Therefore, the count k can be 0, 5, or possibly more? Actually, no: the function f(n) is constant on [a, a+4] for a being a multiple of 5? Not exactly: the function changes at every multiple of 5. But the value of f(n) is the same for n in [a, a+4] if a is not a multiple of 5? Actually, no: the function changes at every multiple of 5. So the value of f(n) is the same for n in [a, a+4] only if a is a multiple of 5 and the next multiple is a+5. But note: if a is a multiple of 5, then the next multiple is a+5, and the trailing zeros increases at a, then remains constant until a+4, and then at a+5 it increases again.\n\n        Actually, the function f(n) is defined as:\n\n            f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n        This is a step function that increases by the exponent of 5 in n when n is a multiple of 5. But note: the function increases by more than one at n that are multiples of 25, 125, etc.\n\n        However, the important thing is: the function f(n) is constant on intervals between multiples of 5. The next change occurs at the next multiple of 5. Therefore, the maximal gap (length of the interval for a given m) is 5, because the next multiple of 5 is 5 away.\n\n        But wait: consider n=24 and n=25: the next multiple of 5 after 20 is 25. Then the interval for m=4 is from 20 to 24 (5 numbers). Then at 25, we jump to m=6.\n\n        However, the interval for m=6 is from 25 to 29 (5 numbers). Then at 30, we add one more (if 30 is divisible by 5 once, so we add 1) -> so m becomes 7.\n\n        So the length of the interval for a given m is always 5, except when the jump at the beginning of the interval is more than 1 (then we skip some m's). But the length of the interval itself is always 5, unless the entire interval doesn't exist (because the jump overshoots).\n\n        But wait, what if m is 6? Then the interval is [25,29]. The length is 5.\n\n        So the maximum k is 5. Therefore, we can safely output the numbers from L to R-1 (which is 5 numbers at most) if k>0.\n\n        However, wait: what if the jump is 3? Then we skip two m's. For example, at n=125, the exponent is 3 (since 125=5^3). Then the trailing zeros increases by 3. \n\n        Example: Let n=120: \n            f(120) = 120//5 + 120//25 + 120//125 = 24 + 4 + 0 = 28.\n        Then n=125: \n            f(125) = 125//5 + 125//25 + 125//125 = 25 + 5 + 1 = 31.\n\n        Then the m=29 and m=30 are skipped. Then the interval for m=28 is from 120 to 124 (5 numbers). Then the next interval is for m=31 from 125 to 129 (5 numbers). \n\n        So the length of the interval is still 5.\n\n        Therefore, the length of the interval (the count k) is either 0 or 5.\n\n        But wait, what if the jump is 1? Then we have 5 numbers. Jump is 2? Then we have 5 numbers. Jump is 3? Then we have 5 numbers. \n\n        Why is that? Because the trailing zeros function only changes at multiples of 5, and the change is by the exponent of 5 in that number. The function is constant between multiples of 5, so the interval is always 5 numbers (unless the jump causes skipping, but the skipping doesn't change the length of the interval for the m that is present).\n\n        However, wait: the interval for m is defined by the minimal n achieving m (which is the first n after the jump that sets the trailing zeros to m) and the next jump (which sets it to at least m+1). The length is always 5 because the next jump is 5 away (the next multiple of 5). \n\n        Therefore, the count k is either 0 or 5.\n\n        But wait, consider m=0: then the interval is [0,4] (if we consider n=0, but the problem says positive integers, so n>=1). But the problem says positive integers, so n>=1. Then m=0 is not considered. \n\n        For m>=1, the interval is 5 numbers if m is achieved, otherwise 0.\n\n        However, wait: what about m=28? The interval is 5 numbers. What about m=30? \n\n        Actually, the jump at 125 was 3, so we skipped 29 and 30. Then the interval for m=30 is empty. \n\n        But wait, is that correct? \n\n            We found L = minimal n such that f(n)>=30. \n            f(124)=28, f(125)=31 -> so the minimal n for 30 is 125. Then we check: f(125)=31 !=30 -> so k=0.\n\n        So the interval length is 0 for m=30.\n\n        Similarly, for m=29: minimal n is 125, and f(125)=31 !=29 -> k=0.\n\n        Therefore, the length of the interval is 5 if the minimal n for m (L) satisfies f(L)=m, and 0 otherwise.\n\n        But note: the minimal n for m is defined by >=m. Then if f(L)=m, then the interval is [L, R-1] (with R being the minimal n for m+1). And the length is R-L, which is 5? Not necessarily.\n\n        Example: m=1: \n            L = 5, R = 10 (minimal n for 2 is 10). Then k = 10-5 = 5.\n\n        Example: m=2:\n            L = 10, R = 15 -> k=5.\n\n        Example: m=4:\n            L = 20, R = 25 -> k=5.\n\n        Example: m=6:\n            L = 25, R = 30 -> k=5.\n\n        Example: m=30: \n            L = minimal n such that f(n)>=30 -> 125 (because f(124)=28, f(125)=31). Then R = minimal n such that f(n)>=31 -> 125. Then k = 125-125 = 0.\n\n        Therefore, the length k is not always 5. It is 5 if the minimal n for m is the same as the minimal n for m+1 minus 5? Actually, no. The length is (R - L). \n\n        However, note that the trailing zeros function increases by the exponent of 5 at n, and then the next jump is at n+5 (if n+5 is the next multiple of 5). But if the jump at n is d, then the next jump is at n+5 (unless n+5 is a multiple of a higher power, but the next multiple of 5 is always n+5). \n\n        But wait, the next jump is the next multiple of 5, which is n+5. Then the minimal n for m+1 is n+d (if d>=1, then m+1 is achieved at n+d? Actually, no: the minimal n for m+1 is the next jump after the jump that gave us m. \n\n        Actually, the minimal n for m is the first n0 such that f(n0)=m. Then the minimal n for m+1 is the next jump (the next multiple of 5) if the jump at n0 was 1, but if the jump was more than 1, then the minimal n for m+1 is still n0 (if the jump was 2, then at n0 we got m0, and then at n0 we jumped from m0-1 to m0+1, so m0 is skipped). \n\n        But wait, the minimal n for m is defined by >=m. Then if we jump from m-1 to m+1 (skipping m), then the minimal n for m is the same as the minimal n for m+1.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            Let L = minimal n such that f(n) >= m.\n            Let R = minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n            Then, if f(L) == m:\n                k = R - L   (and note, the numbers are from L to R-1, which is k numbers)\n            Else:\n                k = 0\n\n        And the length k is the number of integers from L to R-1, which is (R - L).\n\n        But note: the next jump is at R (which is the minimal n for m+1). Then the numbers from L to R-1 are the ones that have trailing zeros = m. \n\n        However, we must consider that the function f(n) is constant between multiples of 5. Then the next jump is at R, and the previous jump was at L (if the jump at L was 1, then the interval is 5 numbers; if the jump was 2, then the interval for m is from L to L+4 (if any) but wait, if the jump at L was 2, then we skipped m, so L is the minimal n for m (by >=m) but then f(L)=m+2 (if we skipped m and m+1) or f(L)=m+1 (if we skipped m but not m+1)? \n\n        Actually, no: the jump at L is the exponent of 5 in L. Then the increase is by that exponent. Then the minimal n for m is L, and the minimal n for m+1 is also L if the jump was at least 1 (but then we require >=m+1, so if the jump was 2, then at L we have f(L)=m+2, so R is the minimal n for m+1 is L (because f(L)>=m+1). Then k = R - L = 0.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            m = int(input().strip())\n\n            def count_trailing_zeros(n):\n                cnt = 0\n                i = 5\n                while i <= n:\n                    cnt += n // i\n                    i *= 5\n                return cnt\n\n            # Function to find minimal n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= target\n            def find_min_n(target, max_high=500000):\n                lo, hi = 0, max_high\n                while lo < hi:\n                    mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                    if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= target:\n                        hi = mid\n                    else:\n                        lo = mid+1\n                return lo\n\n            L = find_min_n(m)\n            R = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n            # Now, we must check: if the minimal n for m (L) has trailing zeros exactly m?\n            if count_trailing",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such integers \\( n \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where each term accounts for higher powers of 5.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Minimal \\( n \\)**: For a given \\( m \\), we use binary search to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( f(L) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( f(R) \\geq m+1 \\). The numbers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( f(n) = m \\) lie in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\) if \\( f(L) = m \\). If \\( f(L) \\neq m \\), no such \\( n \\) exists.\n\n3. **Output the Result**: The result is the count of numbers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\) (if any) followed by these numbers in increasing order. If no such numbers exist, the output is simply 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        cnt += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return cnt\n\ndef find_min_n(target, max_high=500000):\n    lo, hi = 0, max_high\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            hi = mid\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n    return lo\n\ndef main():\n    m_val = int(input().strip())\n    \n    L = find_min_n(m_val)\n    R = find_min_n(m_val + 1)\n    \n    if count_trailing_zeros(L) != m_val:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(L, R))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **find_min_n(target, max_high)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq \\text{target} \\). The search space is bounded by 0 and a sufficiently large number (500,000) to cover all possible values of \\( m \\) up to 100,000.\n\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes \\( L \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with \\( f(n) \\geq m \\)) and \\( R \\) (smallest \\( n \\) with \\( f(n) \\geq m+1 \\)). It checks if \\( f(L) = m \\). If true, it prints the count of numbers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\) and lists them; otherwise, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
