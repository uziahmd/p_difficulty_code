He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers or one integer and an 'R'\n The next line is a string representing a non-negative integer in base `a` (which may have leading zeros, but the length is at most 1000)\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base `a` to an integer (base 10) and then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n    Note: The problem says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n 2. Otherwise, convert the number from base `a` to base `b` (with `a` and `b` between 2 and 25, inclusive).\n\n However, note that the input number c is given as a string in base a. We have to consider that the base a might be greater than 10, so the digits can be from '0' to '9' and then 'A' to whatever (but the input string is given with digits, and for base up to 25, we will use digits 0-9 and then letters A-O for 10 to 24). But wait, the input representation is in base a, and the digits are provided as a string. The problem says the number may contain leading zeros and its length doesn't exceed 1000.\n\n Important: The input number in base a is given as a string. We must first convert that string (which is in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n\n But note: the example includes base 16 and base 12, and even base 2.\n\n However, there's a catch: when converting from base a to base b (if b is not R), we are to output the number without leading zeros.\n\n How to approach:\n\n Case 1: b is an integer (so 2 <= b <= 25)\n   Step 1: Convert the string (which is in base a) to a base 10 integer.\n   Step 2: Convert the base 10 integer to base b (if the number is 0, then output \"0\", but note the guarantee: if Roman then it's at least 1, otherwise the number might be 0? Actually, the input says \"non-negative integer\", so 0 is possible. However, the example input has a '1' for base10 to base2. Also note: the example input has \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> which is 1111001 in base2, and that is a big number.\n\n   But note: the problem says for Roman numerals the number is at least 1 and at most 300010. For other bases, the number might be 0? Let's check: the input says non-negative. So we must handle 0.\n\n   However, if the input number is 0, then in base b (if b is integer) we output \"0\".\n\n Case 2: b is 'R'\n   Step 1: Convert the string (base a) to base 10 integer. Then convert that integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n But wait: what if the base a is greater than 10? The input string uses digits and possibly letters (for base a > 10). The problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n So, we have to parse the string in base a. Since the base a is at most 25, we can map the digits to numbers. The digits in the input string can be:\n\n   - Digits from '0' to '9': these represent 0 to 9.\n   - Then, if the base a is greater than 10, we might have letters. The letters are from 'A' to ... (until base a-1). The mapping is: 'A' -> 10, 'B'->11, ... up to base a-1.\n\n However, note: the input string might have mixed digits and letters? Yes, but the problem says: \"integer number c in base a\". So we must assume that the digits are valid for base a.\n\n But wait: the example input \"12 13\\nA\": \n   Here, base a=12, so the digit 'A' represents 10. Then we convert 10 from base12 to base13? Actually, no: the example input is \"12 13\\nA\", so we are converting from base12 to base13. The number is 'A' in base12, which is 10 in base10. Then we convert 10 to base13, which is 'A'.\n\n However, the example output is 'A'.\n\n Steps for converting the base a string to base10:\n\n   Let s = input string (without leading zeros, but we don't care because we are going to convert the whole string)\n\n   We traverse the string and for each character:\n        if char is between '0' and '9': value = int(char)\n        else: value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n   But wait: what if the base a is 11? Then we cannot have a digit 'A' for 10 because 10 < 11 is allowed? Actually, yes: base a=11 means digits from 0 to 10. But the digit for 10 is 'A'. Similarly, base a=16 allows digits from 0 to 15, and we use '0'-'9' and then 'A' to 'F'. \n\n   However, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n   So, we must ensure that the string only contains digits and letters that are valid for base a. The problem guarantees that.\n\n   Then, the base10 value is computed as:\n\n        num = 0\n        for each char in the string (from left to right, but note: the leftmost is the most significant? Actually, the standard is that the string is given in normal order: the leftmost digit is the highest power.\n\n   Example: \"1111001\" in base2 is 121 in base10.\n\n   But wait: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> output \"1111001\". This is because the base is 2 and we are converting to base2, so we leave the same representation? Actually, we are converting from base2 to base2. But note: the input is given as a string in base2, and we are to output the same string (without leading zeros). However, the input string is \"1111001\", which is already without leading zeros.\n\n   However, if we convert \"1111001\" from base2 to base10, we get 121. Then we convert 121 to base2: 121 in base2 is indeed \"1111001\". So we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Convert base a string to base10 integer.\n\n        Step 2: If b is an integer, convert the base10 integer to base b.\n\n        Step 3: If b is 'R', convert the base10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n   But note: the base10 integer might be very large (the input string can be up to 1000 digits, and base a can be up to 25). Then the base10 integer might be huge (up to 25^1000). That is too big for Python integers? Actually, Python integers can be arbitrarily large, but converting such a big number to base b (which is at most 25) would require a lot of steps (1000 digits in base25 is about 25^1000, which is a number with about 1000*log10(25) ~ 1000*1.4 = 1400 digits). But the problem says that for non-Roman cases the number might be up to 10^1510, which is also very big, but again Python handles big integers.\n\n   However, the conversion from base a string to base10 might be done by iterating over the string and using powers, but we have to be cautious about performance. The string can be up to 1000 characters, so 1000 iterations is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that for non-Roman cases the number won't be greater than 10^1510, so the base10 integer might be very big, but we are only converting from base a (which is at most 25) to base10, then to base b. The base10 integer is the same regardless of the path.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let's read the first line, split into tokens.\n\n   Example inputs:\n\n      \"10 2\"\n      \"16 R\"\n      \"5 R\"\n      \"2 2\"\n      \"12 13\"\n\n   We'll read the first two tokens. The second token might be 'R' or an integer string.\n\n   Then read the next line: the string of the number.\n\n   Plan:\n\n   if the second token is 'R':\n        base10_num = convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a)\n        roman_numeral = convert_base10_to_roman(base10_num)\n        print(roman_numeral)\n\n   else:\n        base10_num = convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a)\n        # Now convert base10_num to base b (which is integer)\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            # Convert base10_num to base b (with digits from 0 to b-1, and then map to string representation)\n            # The string representation for base b: digits 0 to 9 are represented as '0' to '9', and then 10 to b-1 are represented by 'A' to the letter corresponding to (b-10)th letter (if b>10)\n\n   However, note: the input base a is at least 2 and at most 25, and base b is at least 2 and at most 25 (if it's an integer). So we don't have to worry about base b being greater than 25 in this case.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the first token is a (base a) and the second token is either an integer b (base b) or 'R'. So for the non-Roman case, base b is given as an integer between 2 and 25.\n\n   Now, how to convert base a string to base10?\n\n        def convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a):\n            # s is the string, a is the base (integer)\n            num = 0\n            # Traverse each character in the string\n            for char in s:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n                # Check if d is within [0, a-1] (should be, by problem guarantee, but still)\n                if d >= a:\n                    # According to the problem, the input should be valid, but just in case we break?\n                    # But the problem says it's guaranteed, so we don't handle error.\n                    pass\n\n                num = num * a + d\n\n            return num\n\n   Then, for converting base10_num to base b:\n\n        digits = []\n        n = base10_num\n        while n:\n            n, r = divmod(n, b)\n            digits.append(r)\n\n        Then reverse digits and map each digit to a character.\n\n        But wait: if base b is greater than 10, then we need to map digits above 9 to letters.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        s = ''\n        for d in digits[::-1]:\n            if d < 10:\n                s += str(d)\n            else:\n                s += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n        However, note: the example \"12 13\\nA\": \n            base a=12, so the string is \"A\", which is 10 in base10.\n            Then we convert 10 to base13: \n                10 // 13 = 0 remainder 10 -> so the digit is 10, which is 'A'\n\n        But the above code for base10 to base b would produce the string from least significant digit to most, so we reverse.\n\n        However, the above loop does:\n\n            digits = [] \n            n = 10, then 10//13 = 0, remainder 10 -> digits becomes [10]\n            Then we reverse: [10] reversed is [10] and then we map 10 to 'A'\n\n        So that's correct.\n\n   But what if the base10_num is 0? Then the while loop is skipped, so we must handle separately.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            return \"0\"\n        digits = []\n        n = base10_num\n        while n:\n            n, r = divmod(n, b)\n            digits.append(r)\n\n        Then build the string from the last remainder (least significant) to the first (most significant). But we have the remainders in reverse order.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        digits = []\n        n = base10_num\n        if n == 0:\n            return \"0\"\n        while n:\n            n, r = divmod(n, b)\n            digits.append(r)\n\n        Then the digits are stored in reverse order (last remainder is the last digit). So we need to reverse the list.\n\n        Then, for each digit in the reversed list (which is now from most significant to least), convert to the appropriate character.\n\n   However, we can also build the string in reverse order and then reverse the entire string.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        s = ''\n        n = base10_num\n        if n == 0:\n            s = '0'\n        else:\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                s = string(r, b) + s   # This would build from least significant to most, but we can avoid by storing the digits and then reversing.\n\n        But building the string by prepending might be inefficient because the string grows at each step (and the number can be very big, so the string can be long). But the length of the string in base b is logarithmic (base b) of the base10 number, so it's acceptable.\n\n        However, let me stick to the method of storing the digits and then reversing.\n\n   But wait: the example input \"10 2\\n1\": \n        base a=10, base b=2, string=\"1\"\n        base10_num = 1\n        Then 1 in base2: \n            digits = []\n            n=1 -> 1//2 = 0, remainder 1 -> digits=[1]\n            Then we reverse: [1] -> so we output '1'\n\n   Another example: \"10 2\\n10\"\n        base10_num = 10\n        digits = []\n            n=10: 10//2=5, remainder 0 -> digits=[0]\n            n=5: 5//2=2, remainder 1 -> digits=[0,1]\n            n=2: 2//2=1, remainder 0 -> digits=[0,1,0]\n            n=1: 1//2=0, remainder 1 -> digits=[0,1,0,1]\n        Then reverse: [1,0,1,0] -> then convert: 1->'1', 0->'0', 1->'1', 0->'0' -> \"1010\"\n\n   However, 10 in base2 is \"1010\", so that's correct.\n\n   But wait, our algorithm for base10 to base b:\n\n        We are doing:\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                digits.append(r)\n\n        Then we have the digits in reverse order (least significant first). Then we reverse the list to get the most significant first.\n\n        Then we map each digit to the corresponding symbol.\n\n   Now, the Roman numeral conversion:\n\n        The number is between 1 and 300010 (inclusive) as per the problem.\n\n        We can define a function:\n\n        def convert_base10_to_roman(n):\n            # Define the Roman numeral mapping for the values up to 300010 (which is less than 4 million, so we need up to thousands)\n            # We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n            # But note: the standard Roman numerals go up to 3999, but here we have up to 300010.\n\n            # Actually, 300010 is 300,010. We can break it as:\n\n            # However, the standard Roman numerals did not have a standard way to represent numbers beyond 3999. But the problem says the number is at most 300010.\n\n            # We can break the number as:\n\n            # Let's use the subtractive principle and the standard symbols.\n\n            # But 300010: \n            #   Break into: 300000 + 10\n\n            # However, we don't have a symbol for 100000. So we have to use multiple 'C' (100) or use a different representation? Actually, the problem does not specify beyond the standard.\n\n            # But note: the example numbers are small (like 5, 4, etc.). The problem says the number is at most 300010.\n\n            # Standard approach for Roman numerals:\n\n            # We can use a list of tuples for the standard Roman numeral system, but for numbers up to 300010 we need to extend.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can break the number by place value (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones) and then represent each part.\n\n            # However, 300010 is 300,010. We can represent 300,000 as CCCC? But that's 400,000? No, wait: 100,000 is usually represented by an extra bar or something, but the problem doesn't specify. \n\n            # But the problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n            # And the standard Roman numerals for 1000 is M, so 1000 is M, 2000 is MM, 3000 is MMM. Then 4000 is usually represented as MMMM but sometimes as IV̅ (with a bar for thousands) but the problem does not specify bars. \n\n            # However, the problem states that the number is at most 300010, which is 300,010. So we can break it as:\n\n            #   Break the number into groups by powers of 1000, 100, 10, 1.\n\n            # But note: the standard Roman numerals do not use a digit for 100000. So we have to represent 300,000 as three hundred thousand? \n\n            # Actually, the standard representation for 300,000 is \"C\" repeated 3000 times? That's not practical.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            #   Since 300,000 is 3 * 100,000, but we don't have a symbol for 100,000. However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can represent 300,000 as \"C\" * 3000? But wait, 100,000 is not represented by a single symbol in standard Roman numerals.\n\n            # Let me check the problem statement: it says \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" but that is for the base conversion, not for Roman.\n\n            # After reading the problem again, it does not specify how to represent numbers beyond 3999. But note: the example numbers are small.\n\n            # However, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\".\n\n            # So we must handle up to 300010.\n\n            # Standard Roman numerals did not have a standard representation for numbers beyond 3999. But the problem doesn't specify, so we have to come up with a way.\n\n            # One common way is to use parentheses or bars, but the problem does not mention that.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can break the number into thousands and then represent the thousands as M's, but 300,000 is 300 thousands, so we can represent it as 300 M's? That would be \"M\" repeated 300 times.\n\n            # But wait, that is 300,000.

However, 300010 is 300,010, which is 300010.\n\n            # Another idea: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can break it into:\n\n            #   Break the number by dividing by 1000, then by 100, then by 10, then by 1.\n\n            # But wait, 300010 is 300010 = 3 * 100000 + 0 * 10000 + 0 * 1000 + 1 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 0 * 1? Actually, no, we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can use the following: represent the number by breaking it into parts that are multiples of 1000, but then we have to represent the thousands.\n\n            # Since the problem does not specify, I'll use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 and then for numbers above, we break the number into thousands and then represent the thousands part by using the standard Roman numeral for the thousands count and then the rest.\n\n            # But wait, 300010 is 300 thousand and 10. In standard Roman numerals, we can write 300 thousand as \"C\" * 300? That is too long. Instead, we can use the fact that 1000 is 'M'. Then 300000 is 'M'*300? But that is 300 'M's.

But the problem does not say that.\n\n            # Another common way is to use a space or a dot to separate thousands. But the problem does not specify.\n\n            # However, the problem says: \"The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty!\" and the example outputs are simple.\n\n            # After looking at the examples, the largest example is 5 -> \"V\", 4 -> \"IV\", so they are small.\n\n            # But the problem says the number can be up to 300010. We must represent that.\n\n            # Let me check: 300010 is 300,010. We can break it as:\n\n            #   300,000 + 10\n\n            # We can represent 300,000 as \"C\" * 3000?

But the problem says up to 300010.\n\n            # Wait, 300010 is 300,010, which is 300010.

But how to combine the thousands?\n\n            # Actually, in standard Roman numerals, you write the thousands part and then the rest. But 300 is 300, and 300 in Roman numerals is \"C\" * 3 -> \"CCC\". Then 300000 is \"CCC\" followed by a bar? Or we just write \"CCC\" for 300 and then \"X\" for 10, but that would be 300,010 = CCCX? That is 300,010? No, because CCCX is 300,010? Actually, no: \n            #   In standard Roman numerals, the value is additive and subtractive.

But the problem does not allow spaces.\n\n            #   Alternatively, we can use the following: represent the entire number by converting it to base 1000 and then use the standard Roman numerals for each base 1000 digit?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of converting to Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, and then converting the base 10 number to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the first line to determine the source base (a) and the target base (b), which could be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. Read the next line to get the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input number from the source base to a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value by considering its positional value.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols, handling subtractive notation where necessary.\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base is an integer, convert the base 10 number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (0-9 and A-Z for bases greater than 10).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef convert_base_a_to_base10(s, a):\n    num = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * a + d\n    return num\n\ndef convert_base10_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    roman = ''\n    for value, symbol in val:\n        while n >= value:\n            roman += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return roman\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    base_a_str = parts[0]\n    base_b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        base_a = int(base_a_str)\n    except:\n        base_a = base_a_str\n        \n    if base_b_str == 'R':\n        base10_num = convert_base_a_to_base10(num_str, base_a)\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            roman_num = convert_base10_to_roman(base10_num)\n            print(roman_num)\n    else:\n        try:\n            base_b = int(base_b_str)\n        except:\n            base_b = int(base_b_str)\n        \n        base10_num = convert_base_a_to_base10(num_str, base_a)\n        \n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            n = base10_num\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, base_b)\n                digits.append(r)\n                \n            s = ''\n            for d in digits[::-1]:\n                if d < 10:\n                    s += str(d)\n                else:\n                    s += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n            print(s)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input lines to get the source base, target base, and the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function `convert_base_a_to_base10` processes each character of the input string, converts it to its numerical value, and accumulates the total value by multiplying the current total by the base and adding the new digit's value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `convert_base10_to_roman` converts a base 10 number to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: For target bases other than 'R', the program converts the base 10 number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to digits (0-9 and A-Z for bases greater than 10) and combined in reverse order to form the output string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both base conversion and Roman numeral conversion, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
