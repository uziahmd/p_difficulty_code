Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (each between 1 and 10) so we can use combinatorial methods.\n\n The problem is to check if there exists a perfect matching (i.e., a bijection) between R rebels (spaceships) and B bases such that:\n   - Each base gets one spaceship and each spaceship gets one base.\n   - The straight lines connecting the base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect (except at endpoints).\n\n However, note: The condition of non-intersection is only for straight paths. Since we are in 2D, we can use the following idea:\n\n We are given R + B points. But note: the first R are rebels, the next B are bases.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If R != B, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching (unless R+B is even? Actually, no: the matching must be from R rebels to B bases, but the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian\" and \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so we require R = B. Otherwise, we cannot assign all. So first check: if R != B, output 'No'.\n\n 2. But wait: the input says \"For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases.\"\n\n    And the problem says: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" meaning that we need to assign each of the R spaceships to one of the B bases, and vice versa? Actually, the problem states: \"every base has exactly one guardian\" and \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This implies that the number of bases must equal the number of spaceships. Therefore, we must have R = B.\n\n 3. However, the example input has two test cases: \n        Case 1: R=3, B=3 -> Yes.\n        Case 2: R=2, B=1 -> No.\n\n    So indeed, if R != B, we output 'No'. But note: the problem does not explicitly say that the assignment is between the R spaceships and B bases (meaning a bipartite matching with R nodes on left and B on right). However, the condition for perfect matching requires |R| = |B|. \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This is a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. But note: the problem does not specify that the bases and spaceships are distinct sets. However, the input gives R points for rebels and then B points for bases, and they are distinct (no two points coincide and no three points are colinear). So the total set has R+B points.\n\n    But wait: the condition is that we are to assign each of the R spaceships to one of the B bases (so the bases are the targets). Then the matching is from the set of R spaceships to the set of B bases. For a perfect matching, we must have R = B. If R != B, then it's impossible.\n\n    However, note: the problem statement says \"the assignment is a perfect matching\", which in bipartite matching means we have a matching that covers all nodes on both sides. So if R != B, we cannot have a perfect matching.\n\n 4. But wait, the example input: \n        Input: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n\n    Here, R=2, B=1. So we are trying to assign 2 spaceships to 1 base. That is impossible. Hence, output 'No'.\n\n 5. Now, assuming R = B, we need to check if there is a matching (a bijection) from the set of R rebels (say set A) to the set of B bases (set B) such that the straight lines drawn from each base to its assigned rebel do not intersect (except at the endpoints).\n\n    How to check for non-intersection?\n\n    Observation: The problem is about non-intersecting straight lines. In general, two line segments (from base1 to rebel1 and base2 to rebel2) will intersect if the endpoints are arranged in a crossing pattern.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So we need to know if there exists an assignment (a permutation) such that no two edges (from base to rebel) cross.\n\n    Conditions for two edges (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) to not cross: They should not intersect in their relative interiors.\n\n    We can use the following approach:\n\n    a. We have 2*R points (R rebels and R bases, since R=B). But note: the input gives R rebels and B bases, and if R=B, then total points = 2*R.\n\n    b. We are going to try to find a matching (permutation) from the base set to the rebel set such that the edges do not cross.\n\n    c. However, note that the problem is small (R, B <= 10, and hence the number of points is at most 20). But wait, actually, we have R rebels and R bases (if R=B). So we have 2*R points, and we want to match the R bases to the R rebels.\n\n    d. We can use recursion/backtracking to try all permutations (which is factorial(R) and R<=10 -> 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in worst-case if optimized, but 10! is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python if implemented carefully).\n\n    However, we can also use a more combinatorial geometric insight.\n\n    Insight: The condition that the edges do not cross is similar to drawing non-crossing edges in a bipartite matching. This is reminiscent of planar embeddings.\n\n    Another idea: fix an ordering of the rebels and an ordering of the bases (for example, by x-coordinate or y-coordinate) and then check if there is a monotone matching (like in the context of crossing-free matchings). But note: the problem does not require the entire set of edges to form a polygon without crossings, but just that any two edges (from base to rebel) do not cross.\n\n    There is a known fact: In a set of points in the plane, a matching (between two sets) is non-crossing if and only if we can order the rebels and the bases in the same cyclic order (if we consider a convex hull) such that the matching is non-crossing.\n\n    However, we have two distinct sets (rebels and bases) and the condition is that the straight lines do not cross.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n    We can use the following property: Consider the entire set of 2*R points. We can consider the arrangement of the points. We can fix an order of the rebels and bases by their x-coordinate (or any coordinate) and then check if there is a matching that is non-crossing.\n\n    But note: the condition of non-crossing is local. Two edges (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) cross if the two points of one set (say the rebels) are interleaved with the two points of the other set (bases) in the ordering.\n\n    Specifically, if we order the rebels by x-coordinate (and if there are ties, use y-coordinate), then we can require that the bases are also ordered by the same criteria, and then the matching must be increasing in both? Not necessarily.\n\n    Actually, we can use the following: \n\n    Step 1: Sort all the 2*R points by x-coordinate (and then y-coordinate if needed) but separately we have two sets: rebels and bases.\n\n    However, note: the two sets are distinct. We can do:\n\n    - Sort the rebels by x (and then y) and the bases by x (and then y). Then, we can try to assign the smallest x base to the smallest x rebel, then the next smallest base to the next smallest rebel, etc. But is that always non-crossing? \n\n    Example: \n        Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n        Bases: [(-2,1), (0,3)]\n\n        Sorting rebels by x: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n        Sorting bases by x: [(-2,1), (0,3)]\n\n        Matching: (-2,1) to (0,0) and (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n        Now, check if the edges cross: \n            Edge1: from (-2,1) to (0,0)\n            Edge2: from (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n        These two edges: \n            Edge1: from (-2,1) to (0,0): goes down right.\n            Edge2: from (0,3) to (2,0): goes down right.\n\n        Do they cross? Let's see: \n            The two segments: \n                Segment1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n                Segment2: (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n        The endpoints are: \n            Base1: (-2,1), Base2: (0,3)\n            Rebel1: (0,0), Rebel2: (2,0)\n\n        The segments: \n            From Base1 to Rebel1: (-2,1) -> (0,0)\n            From Base2 to Rebel2: (0,3) -> (2,0)\n\n        They don't share endpoints and the two segments do not overlap. Do they cross?\n\n        We can check by the standard method: \n            Check if (Rebel1, Base2) and (Base1, Rebel2) form a crossing.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the orientation test (cross product) to check if two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) intersect.\n\n        However, note: we are matching bases to rebels. Let the matching be: base i to rebel j.\n\n        We can check for two edges (b_i, r_j) and (b_k, r_l) if they cross.\n\n        But we are to check for any two edges. \n\n        Standard way to check if two segments (A,B) and (C,D) cross:\n\n            def segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                # Check if segments AB and CD intersect, including endpoints? The problem says \"any two (straight) paths ... do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D)\" and \"except at endpoints\"?\n                # The problem says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\"\n\n                # This means that the intersections are allowed only at endpoints (the base and the rebel). So two edges that share an endpoint (like two edges incident to the same base or the same rebel) are allowed to meet at that endpoint.\n\n                # Therefore, we are only concerned with intersections in the interior.\n\n                # We can use the standard method: two segments (A,B) and (C,D) intersect if the points C and D lie on opposite sides of AB, and A and B lie on opposite sides of CD.\n\n                # But note: if they share an endpoint, that's allowed. So we must check for proper crossing (not just touching at endpoints).\n\n                # Steps: \n                #   Check if the orientations around the segment AB for C and D are different (and similarly for CD for A and B) and neither segment has an endpoint inside the other.\n\n                # However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\", meaning that we don't allow two edges to cross even if they don't share an endpoint.\n\n                # So we are to check for two edges that do not share a common endpoint.\n\n                # We can use the following: \n                #   Two segments (A,B) and (C,D) (with A,B,C,D distinct) cross if (A,B) and (C,D) are interlaced.\n\n                # We can use the cross product method:\n\n                #   Define function for orientation of triplet (A,B,C): \n                #       o1 = (Bx - Ax)*(Cy - Ay) - (By - Ay)*(Cx - Ax)\n                #   Then, two segments (A,B) and (C,D) cross if:\n                #       o1 = orientation(A,B,C) * orientation(A,B,D) < 0 and \n                #       o2 = orientation(C,D,A) * orientation(C,D,B) < 0\n\n                # However, note: this is the standard method for checking if two segments intersect (including possibly at endpoints, but we want to exclude endpoints). Actually, the above method includes endpoints as intersections? \n\n                # But the problem allows sharing endpoints. So we must avoid counting the endpoints as crossing.\n\n                # Actually, the standard method for checking if two segments intersect (including endpoints) is the above. But we want to check for a crossing that is not at the endpoints.\n\n                # So we must ensure that the endpoints are not shared. \n\n                # Alternatively, we can check that the four points are distinct and that the above condition holds.\n\n            But note: our four points are from two distinct edges. Each edge is from a base to a rebel. The edges are disjoint in endpoints? \n\n            In our matching, each base and each rebel is used exactly once. Therefore, the two edges we are considering have four distinct endpoints.\n\n            So we can use the standard method.\n\n        However, we are going to try all permutations (matchings) and check for every pair of edges whether they cross. \n\n        But note: the condition is that no two edges cross. So we need to check for every pair of edges (in the entire matching) that they do not cross.\n\n        Algorithm for fixed matching (bijection from bases to rebels):\n\n            Let M be a matching: a list of pairs (base_i, rebel_j) for i in range(R) and j in range(R) such that each base and each rebel is used exactly once.\n\n            Then, for every pair of edges (base_i, rebel_j) and (base_k, rebel_l) with i != k and j != l (so distinct edges), check if the two segments (base_i, rebel_j) and (base_k, rebel_l) intersect (properly, i.e., not just at endpoints). \n\n            If any pair of edges intersects, then this matching is invalid.\n\n        Then, we try all permutations (there are R! possibilities) and if at least one matching satisfies the condition, output 'Yes'. Otherwise, 'No'.\n\n    However, note: R is at most 10, so the number of permutations is 10! = 3628800, and for each permutation we check C(R,2) = 45 pairs. Each pair check is O(1). So total operations: 3628800 * 45 = 163296000, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n    But wait, 163 million checks might be borderline in Python. However, we can optimize the intersection check and hope that the inner loop is fast.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a more efficient geometric condition: \n\n    There is a known necessary and sufficient condition for a bipartite matching to be non-crossing: \n\n        Order the rebels and bases by the same coordinate (say x) and then the matching must be such that if we sort the rebels by x and the bases by x, then the matching is order-preserving (i.e., the smallest x base is matched to the smallest x rebel, the next smallest base to the next smallest rebel, etc.). \n\n    Why? Consider: if we have two edges that cross, then in the sorted order by x, the two bases would be in the order base1, base2 and the two rebels in the order rebel1, rebel2, but then if base1 is matched to rebel2 and base2 to rebel1, then the edges cross.\n\n    More precisely, if we have two bases B1, B2 (with B1.x < B2.x) and two rebels R1, R2 (with R1.x < R2.x), then the matching that assigns B1 to R2 and B2 to R1 will cause the edges (B1,R2) and (B2,R1) to cross. Conversely, if the matching is order-preserving (assigning the smallest base to the smallest rebel, etc.), then the edges will not cross.\n\n    However, what if the points are not aligned by x? What if the rebels and bases have the same x? Then we use y-coordinate. \n\n    But note: the condition that no three points are colinear. So when we break ties, we can use y-coordinate.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        Sort the rebels by x (and then by y, if x is the same).\n        Sort the bases by x (and then by y, if x is the same).\n\n        Then, the only matching we need to check is the order-preserving one? \n\n    Why is that? Because if we assign the bases in increasing order to the rebels in increasing order, then the edges are drawn from left to right and bottom to top (or top to bottom, depending on the y-coordinate) and they won't cross.\n\n    But wait, consider:\n\n        Example 1: \n            Bases: [(0,0), (0,2)] -> sorted by x (both 0) then by y: [ (0,0), (0,2) ]\n            Rebels: [(1,1), (1,3)] -> sorted by x (both 1) then by y: [ (1,1), (1,3) ]\n\n        Then the matching: base (0,0) to rebel (1,1) and base (0,2) to rebel (1,3) is order-preserving.\n\n        Now, if we draw the edges: \n            (0,0) -> (1,1) and (0,2) -> (1,3): these two edges are parallel and do not cross.\n\n        Example 2: \n            Bases: [ (0,0), (0,2) ] (same as above)\n            Rebels: [ (1,3), (1,1) ] (so sorted by x then y: [ (1,1), (1,3) ])\n\n        Then the order-preserving matching would be: base (0,0) to (1,1) and base (0,2) to (1,3). \n\n        But note: we defined the rebels sorted by x then y: [ (1,1), (1,3) ]. So the order-preserving matching is the one above.\n\n        However, if we try to assign base (0,0) to (1,3) and base (0,2) to (1,1) then we get the matching that is not order-preserving (because the smallest base is matched to the largest rebel). And that matching would be:\n\n            Edge1: (0,0) -> (1,3)\n            Edge2: (0,2) -> (1,1)\n\n        Now, do these two edges cross? \n\n            The two segments: \n                (0,0) to (1,3) and (0,2) to (1,1)\n\n            The endpoints: \n                (0,0), (1,3) and (0,2), (1,1)\n\n            We can check: \n                Let A=(0,0), B=(1,3), C=(0,2), D=(1,1)\n\n            Check orientation of A,B,C: \n                (B-A) = (1,3), (C-A) = (0,2)\n                Cross product: 1*2 - 3*0 = 2 > 0.\n\n            Orientation of A,B,D: \n                (1,3) and (1,1): 1*1 - 3*1 = 1-3 = -2 < 0.\n\n            So A,B separates C and D -> so the segments AB and CD must be checked for crossing.\n\n            Now, check orientation of C,D,A: \n                (D-C) = (1,-2), (A-C)=(-0, -2) -> (0,-2)\n                Cross product: 1*(-2) - (-2)*0 = -2 < 0.\n\n            Orientation of C,D,B:\n                (D-C)=(1,-2), (B-C)=(1,1) -> 1*1 - (-2)*1 = 1+2=3>0.\n\n            So CD separates A and B.\n\n            Therefore, the two segments cross.\n\n        So the non-order-preserving matching causes a crossing.\n\n    Therefore, we can hypothesize: \n\n        A non-crossing matching exists if and only if there exists an order-preserving matching (when both the bases and rebels are sorted by the same coordinate, say x, and then y, and then match the smallest base to the smallest rebel, etc.)\n\n    But wait, what if the points are given arbitrarily? \n\n    Actually, the condition of non-crossing in straight-line embedding for bipartite matching is equivalent to being able to order the points (both sets) monotonically without crossing. \n\n    However, note: the problem does not require the matching to be drawn in a particular way, but the condition is purely geometric.\n\n    Known fact: The non-crossing bipartite matching (if we fix the two sets in convex position) can be found by sorting both sets by the same coordinate. \n\n    But note: the two sets (bases and rebels) are not necessarily in convex position. However, we can use the following:\n\n        Sort the rebels by x, and the bases by x. Then, the matching that matches the i-th base (in sorted order) to the i-th rebel (in sorted order) is non-crossing.\n\n    Why? Because if we draw the edges from base_i to rebel_i, then for two indices i<j, the base_i is to the left of base_j and rebel_i is to the left of rebel_j. Then the edge from base_i to rebel_i and base_j to rebel_j will not cross because the entire edge from base_i to rebel_i is to the left of the edge from base_j to rebel_j (if we consider the x-coordinates). \n\n    However, consider:\n\n        Bases: [(0,0), (1,0)] and Rebels: [(0,1), (1,1)]\n\n        Then the order-preserving matching: \n            base0 (0,0) -> rebel0 (0,1)\n            base1 (1,0) -> rebel1 (1,1)\n\n        The edges: \n            (0,0)->(0,1) and (1,0)->(1,1): these are two vertical lines and do not cross.\n\n        Now, what if we have:\n\n        Bases: [(0,0), (1,0)] and Rebels: [(0,1), (2,1)]\n\n        Then the order-preserving matching: \n            base0 (0,0) -> rebel0 (0,1)\n            base1 (1,0) -> rebel1 (2,1)\n\n        The edges: \n            (0,0)->(0,1) and (1,0)->(2,1): \n            The first edge is vertical, the second edge goes from (1,0) to (2,1).

However, our sets are not necessarily in convex position.\n\n    But note: the condition of non-crossing is equivalent to the matching being non-crossing in the complete graph. And there is a known result: \n\n        A set of edges (a matching) is non-crossing if and only if the two sets of endpoints can be separated by a line (if we consider the entire set) but that is for planar graphs.\n\n    However, here we are in the plane and the edges are straight. \n\n    Another known fact: The non-crossing matching is unique if the two sets are in convex position and the matching is the one that matches the convex hull edges. But our sets are arbitrary.\n\n    Actually, the order-preserving matching (by x) is non-crossing if and only if the two sets are separable by a vertical line? \n\n    But note: the above examples are not necessarily separable by a vertical line.\n\n    Let me try to find a counterexample where the order-preserving matching crosses:\n\n        Example:\n\n        Bases: [ (0,0), (1,0) ]\n        Rebels: [ (0,1), (1,-1) ]\n\n        Sort bases: [ (0,0), (1,0) ]\n        Sort rebels: [ (0,1), (1,-1) ]\n\n        Matching: base0 (0,0) -> (0,1); base1 (1,0) -> (1,-1)\n\n        Edges: \n            (0,0) to (0,1): vertical up.\n            (1,0) to (1,-1): vertical down.\n\n        They don't cross.\n\n        Now, let me try:\n\n        Bases: [ (0,0), (1,0) ]\n        Rebels: [ (0,1), (0.5, -1) ]\n\n        Then sorted rebels: [ (0,1), (0.5,-1) ]\n\n        Matching: \n            base0 (0,0) -> (0,1)\n            base1 (1,0) -> (0.5,-1)\n\n        Now, edges:\n            (0,0) to (0,1) and (1,0) to (0.5,-1)\n\n        Check if they cross:\n\n            A=(0,0), B=(0,1), C=(1,0), D=(0.5,-1)\n\n            Condition1: AB separates C and D?\n                Vector_AB = (0,1)\n                Vector_AC = (1,0): cross product with AB: (0,1) x (1,0) = 0*0 - 1*1 = -1 <0.\n                Vector_AD = (0.5,-1): cross product with AB: (0,1) x (0.5,-1) = 0*(-1) - 1*0.5 = -0.5 <0.\n\n                Same side.\n\n            Condition2: CD separates A and B?\n                Vector_CD = (0.5-1, -1-0) = (-0.5,-1)\n                Vector_CA = (0-1,0-(-1)) = (-1,1): cross product = (-0.5)*1 - (-1)*(-1) = -0.5 -1 = -1.5 <0.\n                Vector_CB = (0-1,1-(-1)) = (-1,2): cross product = (-0.5)*2 - (-1)*(-1) = -1 -1 = -2 <0.\n\n                Same side.\n\n            So no crossing.\n\n        How about:\n\n        Bases:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between R Rebel spaceships and B bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect (except at their endpoints). The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the bases and spaceships to find one that satisfies the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching (bijection) between R spaceships and B bases where R must equal B for a perfect matching to exist. If R ≠ B, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n\n2. **Geometric Condition**: For any two edges (segments connecting a base to a spaceship) not to intersect, they must not cross each other. This can be checked using the orientation test (cross product) to determine if the endpoints of the segments are interlaced.\n\n3. **Order-Preserving Matching**: A key insight is that if we sort both the bases and spaceships by their x-coordinates (and y-coordinates as a tiebreaker), the order-preserving matching (smallest base to smallest spaceship, etc.) will inherently avoid crossings. However, we must verify this by checking all permutations to ensure no better solution exists.\n\n4. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints (R, B ≤ 10), we can use brute-force by generating all permutations of assignments between the bases and spaceships. For each permutation, we check all pairs of edges to ensure they do not intersect. If any permutation satisfies the condition, the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\".\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of permutations is R! (up to 3,628,800 for R=10). For each permutation, we check C(R, 2) pairs (up to 45 for R=10). Each pair check is O(1) using the orientation test, making the total operations manageable within the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - B[1]) - (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - B[0])\n\ndef do_segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    \n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    R = int(next(it)); B = int(next(it))\n    \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    n = R\n    bases_sorted = sorted(bases)\n    rebels_sorted = sorted(rebels)\n    \n    points = list(range(n))\n    found = False\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(points):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            base1 = bases_sorted[i]\n            rebel1 = rebels_sorted[perm[i]]\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                base2 = bases_sorted[j]\n                rebel2 = rebels_sorted[perm[j]]\n                if do_segments_intersect(base1, rebel1, base2, rebel2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Initial Check**: If R ≠ B, output \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Sorting**: Both bases and spaceships are sorted by their x-coordinates (and y-coordinates if x-coordinates are equal) to facilitate the order-preserving matching check.\n4. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of spaceship assignments, the code checks all pairs of edges to ensure they do not intersect using the orientation test. The orientation test determines if four points are interlaced, indicating potential intersection.\n5. **Output Result**: If any permutation satisfies the non-intersecting condition, print \"Yes\"; otherwise, print \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments while leveraging geometric properties to ensure correctness.
