    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements (from 0 to n-1)\n   an array a of n integers\n   a string that is the binary representation of m (without spaces) of length n\n\n Note: The problem says that the binary representation of m is given as a string s0s1...sn-1, so m = s0*(2^(n-1)) + s1*(2^(n-2)) + ... + s_{n-1}*(2^0)\n\n However, note: the function f(x) uses the bits of x (which is up to 2n-1, meaning we consider bit positions from 0 to n-1). \n But note: the array a has indices from 0 to n-1, and the i-th bit of x (if set) adds a_i.\n\n Actually, the example: n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> bits set at positions 0,1,3. So we use a0, a1, a3.\n\n Therefore, we can think of x as having n bits (from least significant to most significant, but the input string for m is given as s0 s1 ... sn-1, where s0 is the most significant).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have two main ideas:\n    a) Without the constraint x<=m, the maximum value of f(x) would be the sum of all positive a_i (because we would set every bit that has a positive contribution).\n    b) However, we are constrained by x<=m.\n\n 2. Let's denote:\n    Let S = set of indices i for which a_i >= 0. But note: if a_i is negative, then we don't want to set that bit if we are maximizing. However, wait: the problem states that ai are nonnegative (0 <= ai <= 10000). So all a_i are nonnegative.\n\n    Then without constraint, the best is to set all bits, i.e., x = (1<<n) - 1? Actually, x can be any integer from 0 to m, and the bits in x correspond to the first n bits (since the array a has n elements). But note: the binary representation of m has exactly n digits (with leading zeros allowed). \n\n    However, note: the problem says the binary representation of m is given as a string of n digits (each either '0' or '1'). So the number m has exactly n bits, but the bits are from the most significant (position n-1) to the least significant (position 0). \n\n    In our function f(x), we consider the i-th bit (for i from 0 to n-1). The i-th bit in x corresponds to the coefficient for a_i. \n\n    How is the binary representation of x defined? Typically, the least significant bit is the 0th. But the problem says: \"value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\".\n\n    So, if we index the bits from 0 (LSB) to n-1 (MSB) then the i-th bit is the coefficient for a_i.\n\n    However, the input for m is given as a string of n digits, which is the binary representation of m, with the first character being the most significant. This means:\n\n        m = s0 * (2^(n-1)) + s1 * (2^(n-2)) + ... + s_{n-1} * (2^0)\n\n    But in our function f(x), the bit at position 0 (the least significant) is the last digit of the string.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: the array a is indexed by the same bit position as in x (from 0 to n-1). And the x is represented in base-2 with n bits (from bit0 to bit_{n-1}), but the input for m gives the most significant bit first.\n\n    Example: n=4, m=10 (binary string \"1010\") -> m = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 8+2=10.\n\n    Now, what is the condition for x<=m?\n\n    We can compare x and m by their bits (from the most significant to least significant). However, note that the array a and the bit positions are aligned with the natural order (bit0 is the least significant, bit_{n-1} the most).\n\n    But wait: in the example, n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> bits: bit0=1, bit1=1, bit2=0, bit3=1. Then f(11)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n    However, the array a has indices from 0 to 3. So the i-th bit of x (i from 0 to n-1) corresponds to a_i.\n\n    The issue: the binary string for m is given in the order from most significant (first char) to least significant (last char). But the standard bit numbering in x is from LSB (rightmost) to MSB (leftmost). \n\n    How do we align?\n\n    We can interpret the input string for m as:\n\n        Let m_str = s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}   (each s_i is '0' or '1')\n        Then, the j-th character (0-indexed) in m_str corresponds to the (n-1-j)-th bit of x? \n\n    Actually, let's map:\n\n        In the example: n=4, m_str=\"1010\"\n        Then, the first character '1' is the most significant, which is the bit for 2^(n-1) = 2^3.\n\n        In x, the bit at position 3 (the most significant) is the one for 2^3.\n\n        So, the i-th character in m_str (starting from 0) is the bit for the (n-1-i)-th position in x?\n\n    But wait: the function f(x) uses the i-th bit (where i is the exponent index) and that i is the same as the index in the array a.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not specify the alignment between the binary string of m and the bit positions of x. But observe:\n\n        The array a has n elements, and the function f(x) is defined by the bits of x at positions 0 to n-1.\n\n        The binary representation of m is given as a string of n digits. The example input:\n\n            Input: \n                2\n                3 8\n                10\n\n            Here, n=2, a=[3,8], m=10 (binary string \"10\", which is 2 in decimal). Then the condition is x<=2.\n\n        What is the value of x? It must be 0, 1, or 2 (since x is from 0 to 2, because m=2).\n\n        Then, for x=0: f(0)=0.\n        x=1: binary representation of 1 (in 2 bits) is \"01\", so bit0 is set (so we use a0) -> 3.\n        x=2: binary representation of 2 (in 2 bits) is \"10\", so bit1 is set -> a1=8.\n\n        So the maximum is 8.\n\n        But wait, the example output is 3. Why?\n\n        The example input says: \n            Input: ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n        The first sample output is 3.\n\n        However, the example explanation: \n            \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.\"\n\n        Wait, the example says m=20? But the input says the third line is '10' (which is two-digit binary string). \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n        And the example: \n            Input: \n                2\n                3 8\n                10\n\n        Then, m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n        But the example says \"m = 20\", which is 2 in base-10? Or maybe they meant m=2?\n\n        Actually, the example says: \"f(0)=0, f(1)=3\" and then stops. But note: the condition is 0<=x<=m, so x can be 0,1,2.\n\n        Then why the maximum is 3? Because we can only set the bits that are present in x and the constraint is x<=m. \n\n        However, note that x=2 (which is 10 in binary) sets the second bit (index1) and that gives 8, which is larger than 3.\n\n        But wait, the example output is 3. There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n        Rethink: the example input says n=2, then the array a has two numbers: [3,8]. Then the binary representation of m is \"10\", which is 2. \n\n        Then the condition is x from 0 to 2.\n\n        x=0: 0 -> no bits set -> f(0)=0.\n        x=1: binary '01' (in two bits) -> bit0 set -> a0=3 -> f(1)=3.\n        x=2: binary '10' -> bit1 set -> a1=8 -> f(2)=8.\n\n        Then the maximum should be 8. But the example output is 3.\n\n        This indicates that the example might have a different interpretation.\n\n        Looking again at the problem statement: \n            \"For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.\"\n\n        In this example, the bits set are at positions 0,1,3. \n\n        Now, note: the array a has 4 elements, so indices 0 to 3.\n\n        But in the example input with n=2, the array a has two elements, so indices 0 and 1.\n\n        However, the example output is 3, not 8.\n\n        Let me check the problem statement example: \n            \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.\"\n\n        They say m=20, but that doesn't match the input. Also, they say f(1)=3.\n\n        Wait, perhaps the problem intended that the binary representation of m is given in the reverse order? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"the binary representation of number m\"\n\n        and then the example: \n            \"Number m equals s0*(2^(n-1)) + s1*(2^(n-2)) + ... + s_{n-1}*(2^0)\"\n\n        So the first character is the most significant.\n\n        But in the example, they wrote m=20. That doesn't make sense because 20 in base-10 is 16+4, but we are in base-2. \n\n        Alternatively, they might have written the binary representation of m as a string of n digits, and then m is the number represented by that binary string.\n\n        However, the first sample input: \n            n=2, a=[3,8], m=\"10\" -> m = 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2.\n\n        Then the condition is x<=2.\n\n        But the example explanation says: \n            \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.\"\n\n        This is confusing. Let me break down the example explanation:\n\n            \"m = 20 = 1\"\n\n        Wait, 20 in base-10 is 20, but then they write 1? Maybe they meant m=1? \n\n        Alternatively, the example input was provided incorrectly. \n\n        After reading the problem statement again: \n            \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n        And the example input: \n            \"2\\n3 8\\n10\"\n\n        So the third line is \"10\". \n\n        But the example explanation says: \"m = 20 = 1\", which is inconsistent.\n\n        I suspect there is a typo in the example. Let me assume the example intended:\n\n            Input: \n                2\n                3 8\n                1   (meaning the binary representation of m is \"1\", but then n=2 so we need two digits)\n\n        But wait, the input format says the third line is a string of n digits. For n=2, we must have two digits.\n\n        Another possibility: the example input was intended to be:\n\n            Input:\n                1\n                3\n                0   # but wait, the problem says the third line is the binary representation of m, and n=1, so one digit.\n\n        Or:\n\n            Input:\n                1\n                3\n                1   # then m=1, then x can be 0 or 1.\n\n        Then f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3, so maximum is 3.\n\n        But the input says n=2.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem's example input and output might be separate. The example input is given as:\n\n            ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n        And the outputs:\n\n            ['3', '27']\n\n        So the first sample input gives output 3, the second gives 27.\n\n        Let's try the first sample input again with a different interpretation:\n\n        Interpretation: The binary string for m is given from least significant to most significant?\n\n        That is, the string \"10\" for n=2 would mean: \n            m = 0*(2^1) + 1*(2^0) = 1.\n\n        Then the condition is x<=1, so x can be 0 or 1.\n\n        Then f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3. Maximum is 3.\n\n        Similarly, the second sample:\n\n            Input: \n                n=5\n                a = [17, 0, 10, 2, 1]\n                m_str = \"11010\"\n\n            If we interpret the string from least significant to most significant (i.e., the string is given in the order from bit0 to bit_{n-1}?):\n\n                Then m = 0*(2^0) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^3) + 1*(2^4) = 0+2+0+8+16 = 26.\n\n            But wait, the example says m=11 (binary representation 1011) and then x=5 (which is 101 in binary, but in 5 bits: 00101) and then f(5)=a0+a2=17+10=27.\n\n            However, if m=26, then x=5 (which is less than 26) is allowed, but also x=26 is allowed. What is f(26)? \n                Binary of 26 (5 bits): 11010 -> bits set at positions 1,3,4 (if we count from 0 to 4). Then f(26)=a1+a3+a4=0+2+1=3, which is not 27.\n\n            Alternatively, if we interpret the string from most significant to least significant (as originally stated in the problem) then:\n\n                m_str = \"11010\" (for n=5) means:\n                    m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n            Then the condition is x<=26.\n\n            Now, we want to maximize f(x)=a0*(bit0_set)+a1*(bit1_set)+a2*(bit2_set)+a3*(bit3_set)+a4*(bit4_set)\n\n            Without constraint, we would set all bits: x = (1<<5)-1 = 31, but 31>26, so we cannot set all bits.\n\n            How to solve?\n\n            Since all a_i are nonnegative, the unconstrained maximum is the sum of all a_i (by setting all bits). But we have the constraint x<=m.\n\n            We can use a greedy approach from the highest bit (the most significant) to the least significant, but note: the bits in x are independent? However, we cannot set a bit arbitrarily if it exceeds m.\n\n            But note: the bits are independent in the sense that each bit has a weight (power of 2). However, the constraint is on the entire number.\n\n            Standard approach for comparing two numbers: we process from the most significant bit to the least.\n\n            However, we are not just comparing x and m, but we want to choose a set of bits (each bit either 0 or 1) such that the total value is <= m and the sum of a_i for set bits is maximized.\n\n            Since the a_i are nonnegative, we would like to set as many bits as possible (because setting a bit always adds a positive a_i). But sometimes we may have to skip a bit to allow more bits to be set in the lower positions.\n\n            However, note: the weights of the bits (the powers of 2) are exponentially increasing. So the higher the bit, the more it contributes to the numeric value.\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n            We can consider processing from the most significant bit (i.e., the first character of the string, which is the highest power) to the least significant (the last character, which is the lowest power).\n\n            But note: the function f(x) does not care about the numeric value of x beyond the constraint? It only uses the bits set. And since the a_i are independent of the weight (they are just constants), we want to set a bit if its a_i is positive (which they all are) and if we can afford the numeric cost (the power of 2) without exceeding m.\n\n            However, we cannot set a bit arbitrarily: if we set a high bit, we might be forced to not set some lower bits because the total value would exceed m.\n\n            Standard technique: \n                Let total = 0 (current value of x)\n                Let ans = 0 (current sum of a_i for set bits)\n\n                But we have two choices for each bit (from high to low): set it or not, but we must ensure the entire x<=m.\n\n            However, the problem is that the bits are independent and the a_i are positive, but the constraint is on the entire number.\n\n            Alternative idea:\n\n            We know that without constraints, we set all bits. Then we subtract the effect of the bits that we cannot set because of the constraint.\n\n            But the constraint is x<=m. We can consider:\n\n                Option 1: Set all bits and then if the resulting x (which is (1<<n)-1) is <= m, then answer is the sum of all a_i.\n\n                But wait: the array a has n elements, and the bit positions correspond to the n bits. The maximum x is (1<<n)-1, which is a number with n bits set (from 0 to n-1). \n\n                However, the binary representation of m has n digits, so the maximum x we can represent is (2^n - 1). But note: the problem says x is from 0 to 2n-1? Actually, the problem says: \"function f(x) taking an integer from 0 to 2n-1\", so x is at most 2n-1. But wait, 2n-1 is a fixed number? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"an integer from 0 to 2n-1\", meaning the domain of x is [0, 2n-1]. But note: 2n-1 is the maximum n-bit number (if we consider n bits). However, the binary representation of m is given as a string of n digits, so m is at most (2^n - 1). \n\n            But wait: the problem says the third line is the binary representation of m (without spaces) and the length is n. So m is a number that can be represented by n bits (so m in [0, 2^n-1]).\n\n            However, the domain of x is [0, 2n-1] (which is a different upper bound). For example, if n=2, then x can be up to 3 (which is 2^2-1). But if n=3, then x can be up to 5 (which is 2^3-1? Actually, 2n-1=5, which is the same as 2^3-1). \n\n            Actually, wait: 2n-1 is the maximum value for an n-bit number? No, the maximum n-bit number is 2^n-1. \n\n            The problem says: \"an integer from 0 to 2n-1\", so the upper bound is 2*n-1, not 2^n-1. \n\n            Example: n=2, then x in [0, 3] (which is [0, 2^2-1]). But wait, the problem says \"from 0 to 2n-1\", so for n=2, 2n-1=3, which is the same as 2^2-1. For n=3, 2n-1=5, while 2^3-1=7. \n\n            But the binary representation of m is given as a string of n digits. Then m is a number that can be represented by n bits (so m < 2^n). \n\n            However, the domain of x is [0, 2n-1]. So for n=3, x can be from 0 to 5 (inclusive). But note: 5 in binary is '101', which uses 3 bits. \n\n            But wait, the function f(x) is defined by the first n bits? Or does it use all bits? \n\n            The problem says: \"where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n            And the array a has n elements, so we only consider the first n bits (positions 0 to n-1). \n\n            Therefore, even if x has more than n bits, we only look at the n least significant bits? \n\n            But note: the example with n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011) uses bits 0,1,3 (and not bit4, which would be the 5th bit). \n\n            However, the problem says: \"for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m\"\n\n            And the binary representation of m is given as a string of n digits, so m is represented in n bits. \n\n            But note: the problem says x is from 0 to 2n-1. For n=3, 2n-1=5, which is 101 in base2 (3 bits). \n\n            So the domain of x is [0, 2n-1] (which is a linear bound, not exponential). \n\n            This changes everything.\n\n            Let me re-read the problem: \n                \"an integer from 0 to 2n - 1\"\n\n            So the maximum value for x is 2n-1, not 2^n-1.\n\n            Then, the binary representation of x will have at most ceil(log2(2n-1)) bits, but we are only concerned with the first n bits (because the array a has n elements). \n\n            However, note: the function f(x) is defined by the bits in the positions 0 to n-1. But if x has more than n bits, then we consider the lower n bits? \n\n            Actually, the problem does not specify. But note: the example n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011) is within [0, 2*4-1=7] (wait, 11 is greater than 7). \n\n            Wait, wait! The example says: \"if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23)\", but 11 in base-10 is 11, and 2n-1=7 for n=4. \n\n            This is a contradiction.\n\n            Let me check the problem statement again: \n                \"an integer from 0 to 2n - 1\"\n\n            For n=4, 2n-1=7. So x can be 0..7. Then x=11 is not allowed.\n\n            But the example says: \"In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11\", and then the maximum is 27.\n\n            Wait, the example input is:\n\n                5\n                17 0 10 2 1\n                11010\n\n            Then n=5, so the domain of x is [0,9]. And m is given by the binary string \"11010\", which according to the problem is:\n\n                m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n            But 26 is greater than 9 (the maximum x). \n\n            This is very confusing.\n\n            After re‐reading the problem statement: \n                \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n            And the example input for the second sample is:\n\n                5\n                17 0 10 2 1\n                11010\n\n            Then the problem says: \"Number m equals s0*(2^(n-1)) + s1*(2^(n-2)) + ... + s_{n-1}*(2^0)\".\n\n            So for the second sample, n=5, so m = 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n            But then the condition is 0<=x<=min(m, 2n-1)? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m\"\n\n            And also separately: \"an integer from 0 to 2n - 1\"\n\n            So the domain is [0, min(m, 2n-1)]? \n\n            But wait, the problem says \"an integer from 0 to 2n-1\", meaning the domain is defined by the problem as [0, 2n-1]? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\"\n\n            And then separately defines the domain of x as [0, 2n-1] (in the function definition). \n\n            But note: the function f(x) is defined for any integer x (from 0 to 2n-1). And we are to consider x in [0, min(m, 2n-1)]? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"an integer from 0 to 2n - 1\" — this is the domain of the function? Or just the input constraint?\n\n            Let me read the problem statement carefully:\n\n            \"Valera has array a, consisting of n integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1, and function f(x), taking an integer from 0 to 2n - 1 as its single argument.\"\n\n            So the function f is defined only for x in [0, 2n-1]. \n\n            Then, the problem says: \"Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\"\n\n            But note: if m > 2n-1, then we consider only x in [0, 2n-1]. \n\n            However, the input says the third line is the binary representation of m (of length n). Then m = s0*(2^(n-1)) + ... + s_{n-1}*(2^0) = a number in [0, 2^n-1].\n\n            Now, 2n-1 is a linear function, and for n>=1, 2n-1 <= 2^n-1 for n>=2, but for n=1: 2*1-1=1, and 2^1-1=1 -> same. For n=2: 3 vs 3 -> same. For n=3: 5 vs 7 -> 5<7. For n=4: 7 vs 15 -> 7<15.\n\n            So if n>=3, then 2n-1 < 2^n-1, so m (which is at most 2^n-1) might be greater than 2n-1.\n\n            Therefore, the effective domain is [0, min(m, 2n-1)].\n\n            But wait, the problem says the function is defined for x in [0, 2n-1]. So we only consider x in [0, 2n-1] anyway. Then the constraint is x<=m, but if m>=2n-1, then we consider all x in [0, 2n-1]. Otherwise, we consider x in [0, min(m, 2n-1)].\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m\", and the function is defined for x in [0,2n-1]. So the effective set is [0, min(m, 2n-1)].\n\n            Now, how to solve?\n\n            We have two constraints:\n                1. x <= m\n                2. x <= 2n-1\n\n            But note: the function f(x) only depends on the bits in the positions 0 to n-1. And x is an integer in [0, 2n-1] (which is less than 2^n for n>=1). \n\n            However, 2n-1 is less than 2^n for n>=3, so the binary representation of x will have at most floor(log2(2n-1))+1 bits, which is less than n bits for n>=3? \n\n            Let me check:\n\n                n=3: 2n-1=5, which is '101' in binary -> 3 bits.\n                n=4: 7 -> 3 bits, but n=4 -> we need to consider up to bit3? \n\n            Actually, the function f(x) considers bits 0 to n-1. But if x is 5 (which is 101 in base2) and n=4, then we consider:\n\n                bit0: 1 -> a0\n                bit1: 0 -> skip\n                bit2: 1 -> a2\n                bit3: 0 -> skip\n\n            But wait, the problem says the array a has n elements, so we have a0, a1, a2, a3. \n\n            However, the binary representation of 5 (in 4 bits) is 0101. Then we consider:\n\n                bit0: 1 -> a0\n                bit1: 0 -> skip\n                bit2: 1 -> a2\n                bit3: 0 -> skip\n\n            But the problem does not specify the number of bits to consider. It says \"the binary representation of number x\", so we consider as many bits as needed. But the function f(x) is defined for x in [0,2n-1], and the array a has n elements, so we only consider the first n bits (from LSB to MSB, but the problem doesn't specify the alignment).\n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\", and i goes from 0 to n-1. \n\n            So we are only considering the first n bits (the least significant n bits) of x.\n\n            Then, the representation of x in base2 with n bits (padded with zeros on the left) is used.\n\n            Example: n=4, x=5 (which is 101 in base2). Then we pad to 4 bits: 0101. Then:\n\n                bit0: 1 -> a0\n                bit1: 0 -> skip\n                bit2: 1 -> a2\n                bit3: 0 -> skip\n\n            So f(5)=a0+a2.\n\n            Now, the constraint x<=m and x<=2n-1. \n\n            But note: the function f(x) is defined for x in [0, 2n-1]. And the input m is given as a binary string of length n, so m can be up to 2^n-1, but we are only allowed to consider x up to 2n-1.\n\n            Therefore, the effective upper bound is U = min(m, 2n-1).\n\n            Then the problem reduces to: find the maximum of f(x) for x in [0, U].\n\n            Since the a_i are nonnegative, the best is to set as many bits as possible (because each bit adds a_i, and a_i>=0). \n\n            However, the numeric value of x is determined by the bits we set (with weights 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{n-1}). But note: the function f(x) is the sum of a_i for the set bits, regardless of the weight. \n\n            But the constraint is on the numeric value of x (the entire number, which is the sum of (bit(i) ? 2^i : 0) for i from 0 to n-1).\n\n            We want to maximize the sum of a_i for the set bits, subject to the numeric value of x <= U.\n\n            Since the a_i are nonnegative, we prefer to set a bit if a_i is large, but we cannot set a bit arbitrarily because it increases the numeric value.\n\n            However, note: the numeric value increases by 2^i when we set bit i, and we get a_i as reward.\n\n            We can view this as a knapsack-like problem: \n                Items: n items, each item i has weight = 2^i and value = a_i.\n                Capacity: U (which is at most 2n-1, and n<=10^5 -> but 2n-1 is 200000, and the weights are powers of 2, so the total weight of all items is 2^n-1, which is huge for n=10^5).\n\n            But note: the capacity U is at most 2n-1, and n<=10^5, so U is at most 200000. \n\n            However, the weights are powers of two (exponentially increasing). But we cannot use a knapsack DP because the capacity is 200000 and the number of items is 100000, and the weights are distinct powers of two.\n\n            But note: the weights are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^(n-1). These are distinct and the total weight is 2^n-1, which is much larger than U (which is at most 200000). \n\n            We can use a greedy approach: \n\n            Since the weights are powers of two, and the knapsack capacity is small (U",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of \\( x \\). The challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal \\( x \\) without resorting to brute-force methods, especially given the constraints where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^5 \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function \\( f(x) \\) sums the elements of array \\( a \\) at positions where the binary representation of \\( x \\) has a '1'. The key observation here is that since all elements of \\( a \\) are non-negative, the optimal solution involves selecting as many bits as possible (i.e., setting them to '1') without exceeding the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\). However, because the numeric value of \\( x \\) is determined by the sum of powers of two corresponding to the set bits, we must balance the selection of bits to maximize the sum of \\( a_i \\) while keeping the total numeric value within the limit \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: The problem resembles a knapsack problem where each bit position (from 0 to \\( n-1 \\)) is an item with a weight of \\( 2^i \\) and a value of \\( a_i \\). The goal is to select a subset of these items such that their total weight does not exceed \\( m \\) (and implicitly \\( 2n - 1 \\), though \\( m \\) might be larger) and their total value is maximized. Given the exponential nature of the weights, a greedy approach is feasible.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We process the bits from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit, if setting it does not cause the numeric value of \\( x \\) to exceed \\( m \\), we include it. This works because higher bits (more significant bits) contribute more to the numeric value but also potentially allow more lower bits to be set if they are skipped. Since all \\( a_i \\) are non-negative, including higher bits first ensures we maximize the sum without prematurely limiting the selection of lower bits.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), which is efficient for the given constraints (up to \\( 10^5 \\) bits). The space complexity is \\( O(1) \\) as we only maintain a running total and do not use additional data structures proportional to the input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    m_str = data[2].strip()\n\n    U = min(int(m_str, 2), 2 * n - 1)\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        bit_val = 1 << i\n        if total + bit_val <= U:\n            total += bit_val\n\n    ans = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if total & (1 << i):\n            ans += a_list[i]\n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n2. **Determine Effective Upper Bound \\( U \\)**: The upper bound for \\( x \\) is the minimum of \\( m \\) (interpreted from its binary string) and \\( 2n - 1 \\), ensuring \\( x \\) stays within the defined domain.\n3. **Greedy Bit Selection**: Starting from the least significant bit (position 0), the algorithm checks if setting the current bit (adding \\( 2^i \\) to the running total) keeps the total within \\( U \\).
