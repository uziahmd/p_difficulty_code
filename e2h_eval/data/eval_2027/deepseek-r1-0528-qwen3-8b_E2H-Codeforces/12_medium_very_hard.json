The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are moving in a circular ring road (clockwise) with n houses.\n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each requiring to be at house a_i (the i-th task's location).\n Since the ringroad is circular and clockwise, we can move from house i to house j by going clockwise: \n   If j >= i, then distance = j - i.\n   If j < i, then we can go clockwise: (n - i + j) OR we can also note that after passing n we wrap around.\n\n However, note: the problem says we must complete tasks in order. So we do task 1, then 2, then ... until m.\n But note: the condition \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" means that we must have done all previous tasks.\n\n The key observation: we start at house 1, then we must go to the first task's house, then from there to the second task's house, etc.\n\n However, because the ring is circular, sometimes it might be shorter to go from a current house to a next house by going the other way? \n But wait: the traffic is one-way clockwise. So we cannot go counterclockwise. Therefore, the only way is clockwise.\n\n Then the movement from a house x to a house y (with x and y being the current and next task) is:\n   If y >= x: then we need (y - x) steps.\n   If y < x: then we need (n - x + y) steps.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to traverse the entire ring and come back. But the ring has n houses, so we can also think of the distance as:\n\n   dist(x, y) = (y - x) % n   but if negative then add n?\n\n Actually, since we are only allowed clockwise, we can define:\n\n   Let d = (y - x) % n   [this gives a number between 0 and n-1] but wait: if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, so modulo n would be positive?\n   Alternatively, we can do: \n        if y >= x: d = y - x\n        else: d = (y + n - x) % n   -> but wait, if we do (y + n - x) and then modulo n, then when y < x, (y+n-x) is positive and less than n? \n        Actually, the distance is (y - x) mod n, but ensuring we don't use negative mod? \n\n Actually, we can compute the clockwise distance from x to y as:\n        (y - x) % n   might not work for negative because in Python, negative modulo gives a positive remainder, but let me test:\n\n Example: n=4, x=3, y=1: (1-3) % 4 = (-2) % 4 = 2, which is correct because from 3 to 1: 3->4->1 (2 steps). \n\n However, note: the problem says moving from a house to a neighboring one takes 1 unit. So the above formula does work.\n\n But wait: the example input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> output 6.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Start at 1, then go to 3: \n        distance from 1 to 3: (3-1)%4 = 2, but wait: actually (3-1)=2, so 2 steps: 1->2->3.\n\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3, but wait, that would mean 3 steps? But the example says the sequence is 1->2->3->4->1->2->3.\n\n   Actually, from 3 to 2: \n        In clockwise direction, we can't go backwards. We have to go 3->4 (step1), 4->1 (step2), 1->2 (step3). So 3 steps.\n\n   Then from 2 to 3: \n        (3-2)%4 = 1 step.\n\n   Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n So the formula is: \n        distance = (y - x) % n\n        But wait, if (y-x) is negative, then modulo n gives a value between 0 and n-1, which is the clockwise distance.\n\n However, note: the modulo operation for negative numbers in Python does give the positive equivalent. But let's check:\n\n        (a-b) % n is equivalent to (a-b + k*n) % n for some k to make it non-negative. And we want the smallest non-negative residue.\n\n Actually, the clockwise distance from a to b is defined as:\n        (b - a) % n   if we consider the entire circle.\n\n But wait, in our example from 1 to 3: (3-1) % 4 = 2 -> correct.\n        from 3 to 2: (2-3) % 4 = -1 % 4 = 3 -> correct.\n\n However, note that we are only doing one step per move, and we are counting the steps. So the total time is the sum of these distances.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" gives output 2.\n\n Let's break down the second example:\n\n   Start at 1, then go to 2: (2-1)%4 = 1 step.\n   Then from 2 to 3: (3-2)%4 = 1 step.\n   Then from 3 to 3: (3-3)%4 = 0.\n\n   Total steps: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n\n So the plan:\n\n   Read n and m.\n   Read the list of m integers (tasks)\n\n   We start at position 1 (index 0). Then we traverse the list.\n\n   For i from 0 to m-1:\n        current = starting point for the first task is 1, then update to the last task's house.\n        next_house = tasks[i]\n\n        distance = (next_house - current) % n   [but wait: if current > next_house, then (next_house - current) is negative, and modulo n gives the positive distance]\n\n   However, note: the modulo operation here is giving the correct clockwise distance.\n\n   But wait: what if the modulo gives 0? That's okay.\n\n   However, we must note that the modulo operation is defined for negative numbers as: \n        a % n = a - floor(a/n)*n, and for negative a, it gives a result in [0, n-1].\n\n   But let's test: \n        n=4, current=3, next_house=1: (1-3) % 4 = (-2) % 4 = 2 (correct).\n\n   So we can compute the distance from current to next_house as (next_house - current) % n? \n\n   However, note: if (next_house - current) is negative, then (next_house - current) % n = (next_house - current + k*n) until it becomes non-negative. \n   But we don't need to add k*n because the modulo operation does that.\n\n   But wait: is this always the minimal clockwise distance? Yes, because the circle has n houses and we are forced to move clockwise.\n\n   However, note: the modulo operation does not necessarily give the minimal positive representation for negative numbers, but in modular arithmetic, \n   (x mod n) is the remainder and is in [0, n-1]. And the clockwise distance from a to b is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (a + d) mod n = b.\n\n   But wait: the clockwise distance from a to b is defined as the smallest d>=0 such that (a + d) mod n = b? \n        Actually, no: because if we start at a, we can only move forward. The equation (a + d) mod n = b, and d must be the smallest nonnegative integer.\n\n        We have two cases:\n          Case 1: if a <= b, then d = b - a.\n          Case 2: if a > b, then d = (n - a) + b.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write: d = (b - a) mod n, but note: in modular arithmetic, the distance we are computing is the same as the above two cases.\n\n        Actually, we can compute d as (b - a) if b>=a, else (b - a + n) and then take modulo n? \n\n        But wait, if we do (b - a + n) % n, then for b>=a: (b-a+n) % n = (b-a) % n, which is just b-a (if b-a < n, which it is because b>=a and a,b in [1,n]).\n        For b < a: (b - a + n) % n = (b - a + n) (because b-a+n is between 0 and n-1, so modulo doesn't change it).\n\n        But note: the example: a=3, b=1, n=4: (1-3+4)=2, which is correct.\n\n        However, the modulo operator already handles negative: (b - a) % n is the same as (b - a + n) % n? \n\n        Actually, no: (b - a) % n is defined as (b - a + n * ceil(|b-a|/n)) but that's not true. The modulo operation in Python for negative adds enough multiples of n to make the result in [0, n-1]. \n\n        We can also compute without relying on negative modulo: \n            if next_house >= current:\n                d = next_house - current\n            else:\n                d = next_house - current + n\n\n        This is equivalent to: d = (next_house - current + n) % n   but wait, no: if next_house >= current, then (next_house - current + n) % n = (next_house - current) % n, but that modulo is not necessary because next_house - current is positive and less than n (since next_house and current are between 1 and n, and next_house>=current, so the maximum difference is n-1). \n\n        However, the problem says the houses are numbered 1..n. The maximum distance when next_house < current is (next_house - current + n) = (next_house + n - current) and that is at most (1 + n - 1) = n, but wait: if next_house=1 and current=n, then 1+n-n=1, which is correct. But note: the distance from n to 1 is 1, not n. So we must not take modulo n again because the distance from n to 1 is 1, and (1 - n + n) = 1, then if we take modulo n we get 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, the expression (next_house - current + n) % n is not the same as the direct calculation for the clockwise distance? \n\n        Actually, the direct calculation for clockwise distance is:\n            if next_house >= current: d = next_house - current\n            else: d = next_house + n - current\n\n        Then we can write: d = (next_house - current) % n   but wait: for the case next_house < current, (next_house - current) is negative, and (next_house - current) % n = (next_house - current + n) % n. However, (next_house - current + n) is positive and less than n? \n\n        Let me check: next_house < current, so next_house - current <= -1. Then next_house - current + n <= n-1. And >= 1 - n + n = 1. So the value is between 1 and n-1, so modulo n doesn't change it.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply do: d = (next_house - current) % n   if we are using Python's modulo, but wait: what if (next_house - current) is negative and large in absolute value? \n\n        Example: n=100000, current=50000, next_house=1, then (1-50000) % 100000 = (1-50000+100000) % 100000 = 50001 % 100000 = 50001, but the actual clockwise distance from 50000 to 1 is 1 - 50000 + 100000 = 50001, which is correct.\n\n        However, note that the problem constraints: n up to 10^5, and m up to 10^5. The modulo operation is efficient.\n\n        But wait: the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers is well-defined. However, we can avoid modulo and use:\n\n            d = next_house - current\n            if d < 0:\n                d += n\n\n        This is the same and avoids negative modulo.\n\n        However, the problem says: initially at house 1, then we go to the first task, then to the second, etc.\n\n        But note: the tasks are given in order. We must complete them in the given order.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current_position = 1\n\n            for each task in the list:\n                next_house = task\n\n                if next_house >= current_position:\n                    d = next_house - current_position\n                else:\n                    d = next_house - current_position + n\n\n                total_time += d\n                current_position = next_house\n\n        Then print(total_time)\n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n            current_position = 1\n            task1: 3\n                3>=1 -> d=2, total_time=2, current_position=3.\n            task2: 2\n                2<3 -> d=2-3+4=3, total_time=5, current_position=2.\n            task3: 3\n                3>=2 -> d=1, total_time=6.\n\n            Output: 6 -> matches.\n\n        Example 2: n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n\n            current_position=1\n            task1:2 -> d=1, total=1, pos=2.\n            task2:3 -> d=1, total=2, pos=3.\n            task3:3 -> d=0, total=2.\n\n            Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n        But wait, the second example input was given as \"4 3\\n2 3 3\", so that's correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that the ringroad is one-way clockwise, so we cannot go backwards. Our method accounts for that.\n\n        But note: the initial position is 1, and the first task is at 2: we go 1->2 (1 step). Then 2->3 (1 step). Then 3->3 (0 steps). \n\n        What if we have a task at a house that is the same as the current? Then we don't move.\n\n        Also, what if we have multiple consecutive tasks at the same house? Then we stay.\n\n        This meets the requirement.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i.\"\n\n        So the condition is that the tasks must be completed in order, and we start at house 1.\n\n        The algorithm above is O(m) and handles the constraints.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a very long chain? The modulo operations or the if-else are constant time, so total time is O(m).\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the example input format: \n            First line: two integers n and m.\n            Second line: m integers.\n\n        Example input: \n            \"4 3\"\n            \"3 2 3\"\n\n        We must read from stdin.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            m = int(data[1])\n            tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for t in tasks:\n                # If the next task is at or beyond the current, then simple subtraction.\n                if t >= current:\n                    d = t - current\n                else:\n                    d = t - current + n\n                total_time += d\n                current = t\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait: is there any possibility that the modulo method is more efficient? Actually, the if-else is the same as the modulo method, but the modulo method for negative numbers might be implemented with conditional jumps too. However, the above if-else is clear and efficient.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints are up to 10^5, so even an if-else for each of 10^5 tasks is acceptable.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3] -> 6\n        Example 2: n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3] -> 2\n\n        But wait, the example input was provided as two strings: \n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n        However, the problem says: \n            Input: \n                The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n        We are reading the entire input and splitting. \n\n        However, note: the first example input is \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", meaning the first line is \"4 3\", and the second line is \"3 2 3\".\n\n        Our code splits the entire input by whitespace, so we get tokens: ['4','3','3','2','3'].\n\n        Then we set n=4, m=3, and tasks = [3,2,3].\n\n        Then we process.\n\n        It should be correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the second line has spaces? The problem says the second line contains m integers, so we are safe.\n\n        Another edge case: n=2, m=1, task=[1]\n            current=1, t=1 -> t>=current -> d=0, total_time=0. Correct.\n\n        Another edge case: n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]\n            Step1: from 1 to 2: d=1, total=1, current=2.\n            Step2: from 2 to 1: d=1-2+2= (1-2=-1, then +2=1) -> 1, total=2.\n\n            Alternatively, we can also think: from 2 to 1 in a ring of 2: 2->1 (one step, because after 2 we go to 1). So total steps=2.\n\n        Another edge case: n=10, m=5, tasks=[10,9,8,7,6]\n            Start at 1.\n            Step1: 1 to 10: 10>=1 -> d=9, current=10, total=9.\n            Step2: 10 to 9: 9<10 -> d=9-10+10=9, total=18, current=9.\n            Step3: 9 to 8: 8<9 -> d=8-9+10=9, total=27, current=8.\n            Step4: 8 to 7: d=7-8+10=9, total=36, current=7.\n            Step5: 7 to 6: d=6-7+10=9, total=45.\n\n        Is that correct? \n            From 1 to 10: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10: 9 steps.\n            Then from 10 to 9: 10->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 9 steps? Actually, from 10 to 9: \n                We can only go clockwise: 10->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: that's 9 steps (since we pass through 10, then 1,2,...,9: 9 edges).\n\n            Similarly for the rest.\n\n            So yes, 9 steps for each move from a higher number to a lower number (wrapping around) and 9 steps for the first jump from 1 to 10.\n\n            However, note: the ring has 10 houses, so from 1 to 10: we have 9 steps (because we don't count staying at the same house). \n\n            The formula for the first step: 10-1=9, which is correct.\n\n            The formula for the second step: 9-10+n=9-10+10=9, which is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for t in tasks:\n                if t >= current:\n                    total_time += (t - current)\n                else:\n                    total_time += (t - current + n)\n                current = t\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait: the input() function will read the entire next line. However, the problem says the second line contains m integers. \n\n        However, if m is large (up to 10^5) and the numbers are large (up to 10^5) then reading the entire line and splitting is acceptable because 10^5 integers is about 100,000 numbers, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        But note: the problem says the input is from stdin, so we can use:\n\n            import sys\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n        But the problem says: \"Note that this is a very hard question.\" and we are constrained by 10^5, so either way is acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says to read from stdin, and the input is two lines.\n\n        We can also do:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        This is simpler.\n\n        But wait: what if the input has more than two lines? The problem says the first line and the second line.\n\n        So we assume two lines.\n\n        Let's submit the code.\n\n        However, wait: the example input was provided as two separate tokens in the example? \n\n        Actually, the example input in the problem statement is:\n\n            Input: \n                4 3\n                3 2 3\n\n        So two lines.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for t in tasks:\n                if t >= current:\n                    total_time += t - current\n                else:\n                    total_time += t - current + n\n                current = t\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait: the problem says that the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 through n. \n\n        However, note: the modulo operation version (using %) was discussed, but we chose the if-else for clarity. \n\n        There is another way: using modulo, but note that the modulo operation might be slightly slower for negative numbers? But the if-else is also a branch.\n\n        But we are only doing one branch per task, and 10^5 is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can also use:\n\n            total_time += (t - current) % n   # but wait, if t>=current, then (t-current)%n = t-current (if t-current < n, which it is because t<=n and current>=1, so maximum t-current is n-1, which is < n). \n            But wait, if t < current, then (t - current) % n is (t - current + n) % n, but since t - current is negative and adding n makes it positive and less than n, so modulo doesn't change it. \n\n        However, we must note: the modulo operation for negative numbers in Python returns a nonnegative number, but the distance we want is the positive representation.\n\n        But wait: the modulo operation for (t - current) % n is not the same as the clockwise distance? \n\n        Actually, the clockwise distance from current to t is (t - current) % n, but wait: \n\n            In modular arithmetic, the clockwise distance is the smallest nonnegative d such that (current + d) % n = t % n? \n\n            Actually, we are representing houses as numbers from 1 to n. \n\n            But note: the modulo operation in mathematics for the ring of n elements: the positions are often represented modulo n, but our houses are labeled 1 to n.\n\n            How to handle modulo with 1-indexed?\n\n            We can map house i to (i-1) mod n, then the clockwise distance from i to j is (j-1 - (i-1)) mod n, then convert back? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            d = (t - current) % n\n            But wait: if we do (t - current) % n, then for t>=current, it's (t-current) % n = t-current (if t-current < n) which is correct.\n\n            For t<current, (t-current) % n = (t - current + n) % n, and since (t - current + n) is positive and less than n (because t>=1, current<=n, so t - current + n >= 1 - n + n = 1, and <= 0 + n? Actually, t>=1, current<=n, so t - current + n >= 1 - n + n = 1, and <= n - 1 + n = 2n-1, but wait: we are taking modulo n, so we subtract n until in [0, n-1]? \n\n            Actually, the modulo operation in Python for (t - current + n) % n is (t - current + n) if (t - current + n) < n? No, because t - current + n is positive and might be greater than or equal to n.\n\n            Example: n=4, current=3, t=1: (1-3+4)=2, 2%4=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example: n=4, current=1, t=3: (3-1)=2, 2%4=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example: n=4, current=3, t=1: as above.\n\n            Example: n=4, current=2, t=3: (3-2)=1, 1%4=1 -> correct.\n\n            Example: n=4, current=4, t=1: (1-4+4)=1, 1%4=1 -> correct.\n\n            But wait: what if t=current? then (t-current)%n=0, correct.\n\n            However, note: the modulo operation in Python for (t - current) % n when t>=current and t-current is exactly n? \n\n            But t is at most n, current is at least 1, so t-current is at most n-1, so modulo n is the same.\n\n            Therefore, we can also write:\n\n                total_time += (t - current) % n\n\n            But wait, this would not work if (t - current) is negative and (t - current) % n is the positive representation, but that positive representation is exactly the clockwise distance.\n\n            However, note: the modulo operation for negative numbers does the right thing. \n\n            But wait, what if (t - current) is negative and its absolute value is huge? \n\n            Actually, the modulo operation is defined for any integer, and we are only concerned with the residue modulo n.\n\n            However, the problem says the houses are between 1 and n, so the difference (t - current) is between -(n-1) and (n-1). \n\n            Then (t - current) % n is the same as (t - current + n) % n, and since |t - current| < n, then (t - current + n) is between 1 and 2n-1, but modulo n will reduce it by n if it is >=n? \n\n            Example: n=4, t=3, current=5 (but wait, current is always a house, and houses are from 1 to n, so current is in [1, n]. \n\n            Actually, in our problem, the current starts at 1 and then becomes the task's house, so current is always in [1, n]. Similarly t is in [1, n].\n\n            Then (t - current) is between -(n-1) and (n-1). \n\n            Then (t - current) % n is:\n\n                If t>=current: then (t-current) is in [0, n-1], so modulo n leaves it unchanged.\n\n                If t<current: then (t-current) is in [-(n-1), -1]. Then (t-current) % n = (t - current + n) % n, and (t - current + n) is in [1, n-1] (because t>=1, current<=n, so minimum t - current + n is 1-n+n=1, maximum is (n-1)-1+n = 2n-2, but wait: t is at least 1, current is at most n, so t - current + n is at least 1 - n + n = 1, and at most n-1 - 1 + n = 2n-2. \n\n            Now, 2n-2 might be >= n, so we have to do modulo again? \n\n            Example: n=4, t=1, current=3: 1-3+4=2 -> 2%4=2.\n\n            Example: n=4, t=1, current=4: 1-4+4=1 -> 1%4=1.\n\n            Example: n=4, t=2, current=1: 2-1=1, 1%4=1.\n\n            But wait: what if t=1, current=2: 1-2+4=3, 3%4=3.\n\n            Now, is 3 the correct clockwise distance from 2 to 1? \n                In a ring of 4: 2->3->4->1: 3 steps. Correct.\n\n            But wait, the modulo operation is giving 3, which is correct.\n\n            However, note: the expression (t - current) % n is defined for any integers, but our values are bounded. \n\n            But the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers: \n                (-1) % 4 -> 3, (-2)%4->2, (-3)%4->1, (-4)%4->0, (-5)%4->3, etc.\n\n            So it is periodic.\n\n            But note: the clockwise distance from current to t is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) ≡ t (mod n). \n\n            However, the ring has n houses, so the positions are 1 to n. We can map the houses to 0-indexed: subtract 1, then the equation becomes:\n\n                (current_index + d) % n = t_index\n\n                where current_index = current-1, t_index = t-1.\n\n            Then d_min = (t_index - current_index) % n, but wait: \n\n                In modular arithmetic, the smallest nonnegative d is: \n                    d_min = (t_index - current_index + n) % n   ?\n\n            Actually, the standard way to compute modular displacement is:\n\n                d_min = (t_index - current_index) % n\n\n            But wait, in modular arithmetic, the displacement from current_index to t_index is (t_index - current_index) mod n, but if negative, we add n.\n\n            And then the distance is d_min, which is the same as:\n\n                d_min = (t_index - current_index + n) % n   [if we want a nonnegative representation]\n\n            However, the problem is that in the 0-indexed system, the houses are arranged in a circle of size n. The distance from current_index to t_index is (t_index - current_index) mod n, but we want the minimal positive steps (which is the same as the modular displacement).\n\n            But note: the displacement in the circle (for clockwise) is (t_index - current_index) mod n, but if negative, we add n and then mod n? \n\n            Actually, we can compute:\n\n                d_min = (t_index - current_index) % n   [in Python, this gives a result in [0, n-1]]\n\n            Then the distance is d_min.\n\n            Now, mapping back to 1-indexed:\n\n                current = 1 -> index0 = 0\n                t = 3 -> index0 = 2\n\n                d_min = (2-0) % 4 = 2 -> correct.\n\n                current = 3 -> index0=2, t=2->index0=1: (1-2) %4 = (-1)%4=3 -> correct.\n\n            Therefore, we can also compute:\n\n                total_time += ( (t-1) - (current-1) ) % n   # but wait, that's (t - current) % n, which is the same as above.\n\n            However, note: (t-1 - (current-1)) = t - current.\n\n            So (t-1 - (current-1)) % n = (t - current) % n.\n\n            Therefore, the two methods are equivalent.\n\n        But wait: the example above with n=4, current=3, t=1: (1-3)%4 = (-2)%4=2, and (t-1 - (current-1)) %4 = (0-2)%4= -2%4=2.\n\n        So the modulo method is the same.\n\n        However, the modulo operation might be more computationally expensive than an if-else? \n\n        But note: the problem constraints are 10^5, and both are O(1) per operation.\n\n        But the modulo operation for integers in the range [-(n-1), n-1] (which is [-99999,99999] for n=100000) is efficient.\n\n        However, the if-else avoids modulo and uses a branch. \n\n        But the branch might be predictable: for half the cases we do one thing, the other half the opposite.\n\n        But modulo is a single operation.\n\n        Considering clarity and correctness, the if-else is straightforward.\n\n        But the problem says \"very hard\", so maybe they expect a more mathematical solution? \n\n        However, the above if-else is the natural way.\n\n        But note: the problem says to use 64-bit integers? But in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, but the modulo operation for integers within 10^5 is fast.\n\n        I'll stick to the if-else.\n\n        However, let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3] -> 6\n        Example 2: n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3] -> 2\n\n        We'll run the code.\n\n        But wait, the example input was provided as two examples, but the problem expects two outputs.\n\n        We must output the answer for each test case. However, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is given as two lines.\n\n        But note: the example input is given as two separate strings in the example? \n\n        Actually, the example input is:\n\n            Input: \n                4 3\n                3 2 3\n\n            Output: 6\n\n            Input: \n                4 3\n                2 3 3\n\n            Output: 2\n\n        So we are to read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\n        We assume one test case per run.\n\n        The problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n        Therefore, we output the total_time for the given test case.\n\n        Code:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for t in tasks:\n                if t >= current:\n                    total_time += t - current\n                else:\n                    total_time += t - current + n\n                current = t\n            print(total_time)\n\n        Let's hope.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says the ringroad has n houses. Our code uses n for the wrap-around. \n\n        We are good.\n\n        But wait: what if the tasks list is empty? m=0. Then the for loop does nothing, and total_time=0, and we print 0. That",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ring road with `n` houses. The ring road is one-way and clockwise, so Xenia can only move in the clockwise direction. The solution involves efficiently computing the distance between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house number 1 (the initial position) and initialize the total time taken to 0.\n2. **Iterate through tasks**: For each task, determine the distance from the current position to the task's house:\n   - If the task's house number is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is simply the difference between the two.\n   - If the task's house number is less than the current position, the distance is calculated by moving clockwise from the current position to the end of the ring, then continuing from the start of the ring to the task's house. This is computed as `(task's house - current position + n) % n`, but since the result is always positive and within bounds, we can directly use `(task's house - current position + n)` without modulo for efficiency.\n3. **Update position and total time**: After calculating the distance, update the current position to the task's house and add the computed distance to the total time.\n4. **Output the result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for t in tasks:\n        if t >= current:\n            total_time += (t - current)\n        else:\n            total_time += (t - current + n)\n        current = t\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by the list of task locations.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task, it checks if the task's location is ahead of or behind the current position in the clockwise direction. If the task is ahead, the distance is straightforward. If it's behind, the distance accounts for wrapping around the circular road.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm processes each task in constant time, making the overall time complexity O(m), which is optimal given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n- **Output**: The total time accumulated from all movements is printed, providing the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular movement and ensures minimal time calculation by leveraging simple arithmetic checks and updates.",
