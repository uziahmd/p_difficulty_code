The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given: \n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   string A (Nikephoros' sequence) and string B (Polycarpus' sequence)\n\n The sequences are cyclic. In the i-th round (0-indexed), Nikephoror uses A[(i + offsetA) % m] and Polycarpus uses B[(i + offsetB) % k]. \n However, note that the problem does not specify an initial offset for either player. But from the example:\n\n Input: \n   7\n   RPS\n   RSPP\n\n We can assume that in round 1 (the first round) we use:\n   Nikephoros: A[0], Polycarpus: B[0]\n\n So the rounds are synchronized by the round index.\n\n We cannot simulate 2e9 rounds by iterating one by one.\n\n Instead, we note that the entire game is periodic with period L = lcm(m, k). But note: the rounds go from 0 to n-1, and the two sequences have periods m and k.\n\n However, we can break down the game into cycles of length L = lcm(m, k). But note: n might be very large, but m, k <= 1000, so L <= 1000*1000? Actually, the lcm(m,k) can be as large as 10^6 (since m,k<=1000). But n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over each cycle if we do it naively.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for one full cycle (of length L) the number of losses for Nikephoros and for Polycarpus.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let m = len(A), k = len(B).\n 2. Let L = lcm(m, k). But wait, the two sequences are independent and the round i uses:\n        a_i = A[i % m]\n        b_i = B[i % k]\n\n    The combined state (a_i, b_i) repeats every L = lcm(m, k) rounds.\n\n 3. However, we are only playing n rounds. We can break the n rounds into:\n        full_cycles = n // L\n        remainder = n % L\n\n 4. Then, total_red_spots_Nikephoros = full_cycles * (losses in one cycle for Nikephoros) + (losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephoros)\n    Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n 5. But note: In each round, who loses?\n        - If both choose the same: draw -> no one loses.\n        - Otherwise, we know the rules: \n            Rock beats Scissors -> if Nike has Rock and Polyc has Scissors, then Nike wins (so Polyc loses)\n            Scissors beats Paper -> if Nike has Scissors and Polyc has Paper, then Nike wins (so Polyc loses)\n            Paper beats Rock -> if Nike has Paper and Polyc has Rock, then Nike wins (so Polyc loses)\n\n        Conversely, when does Nike lose?\n            When:\n                - Nike's rock vs Polyc's paper -> Polyc wins (so Nike loses)\n                - Nike's scissors vs Polyc's rock -> Polyc wins (so Nike loses)\n                - Nike's paper vs Polyc's scissors -> Polyc wins (so Nike loses)\n\n    So we can define a function that given two moves (x, y) returns:\n        if x == y: (0, 0)   [draw]\n        else:\n            if (x, y) is (rock, scissors): (0, 1)   [because Nike wins, so Polyc loses one red spot]\n            if (x, y) is (scissors, paper): (0, 1)\n            if (x, y) is (paper, rock): (0, 1)\n\n            if (x, y) is (scissors, rock): (1, 0)\n            if (x, y) is (rock, paper): (1, 0)\n            if (x, y) is (paper, scissors): (1, 0)\n\n    Alternatively, we can check:\n\n        losses_Nike = 0\n        if x == y: \n            (0,0)\n        else:\n            if (x, y) in [('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')]:\n                (0,1)   # meaning Nike doesn't lose, Polyc loses\n            else:\n                (1,0)   # meaning Nike loses, Polyc doesn't\n\n 6. However, we must compute the losses for one full cycle (L rounds) and then multiply by full_cycles, then add the remainder.\n\n But note: L = lcm(m, k) might be very large (up to ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and each round's outcome depends on the current move in their respective sequences. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2 billion, a direct simulation of each round is impractical. Instead, we leverage the periodic nature of the sequences to compute the results efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players using cyclic sequences of moves. Each round's outcome is determined by comparing the current moves from both sequences. The key observation is that the combined state of both sequences repeats every `L` rounds, where `L` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one full cycle of `L` rounds and then extending the result to `n` rounds.\n\n2. **Insight**: For each round `i`, the moves are `A[i % m]` and `B[i % k]`. The outcome of each round depends on these moves. By identifying the pattern over one full cycle (LCM of sequence lengths), we can compute the total losses for both players over one cycle. Multiplying these losses by the number of full cycles and adding the losses from the remaining rounds gives the final result.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of sequences A and B to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For each position within one cycle, simulate the rounds and count the losses for both players.\n   - **Efficiency**: Use the periodic property to avoid simulating each of the up to 2 billion rounds individually. Instead, compute results based on full cycles and remaining rounds.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The complexity is dominated by the cycle length `L`, which is at most 1,000,000 (since the sequences' lengths are up to 1000). This ensures the solution is feasible even for the upper constraint of `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n    \n    L = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    def outcome(x, y):\n        if x == y:\n            return (0, 0)\n        elif (x, y) in [('R', 'P'), ('S', 'R'), ('P', 'S')]:\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n            \n    losses_Nike = 0\n    losses_Poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        idx_A = (i % m)\n        idx_B = (i % k)\n        move_Nike = A_str[idx_A]\n        move_Poly = B_str[idx_B]\n        add_Nike, add_Poly = outcome(move_Nike, move_Poly)\n        losses_Nike += add_Nike\n        losses_Poly += add_Poly\n        \n    total_Nike = full_cycles * losses_Nike + min(remainder, L) * [outcome(A_str[i % m], B_str[i % k]) for i in range(L)][remainder][0]\n    total_Poly = full_cycles * losses_Poly + min(remainder, L) * [outcome(A_str[i % m], B_str[i % k]) for i in range(L)][remainder][1]\n    \n    print(f\"{total_Nike} {total_Poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths is computed to determine the cycle length `L`.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total rounds `n` are divided into full cycles and a remainder to handle the partial cycle if any.\n4. **Outcome Function**: This function checks the outcome of each round based on the moves from sequences `A` and `B`, returning the number of losses for each player.\n5. **Cycle Simulation**: For each position in the cycle, the moves are compared, and losses are counted for both players over one full cycle.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The total losses for both players are computed by multiplying the full cycle losses by the number of full cycles and adding the losses from the remaining rounds.\n7. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
