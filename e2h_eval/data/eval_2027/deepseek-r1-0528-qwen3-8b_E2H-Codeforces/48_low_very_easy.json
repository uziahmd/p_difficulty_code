He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens on the first line: a and b. The second line is the number c in base a.\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the given number from base a to base 10 (if it's not already base 10) and then convert that base 10 number to Roman numerals.\n    Note: The input number c is given in base a and may contain digits (which are given as strings). We know that the base a is between 2 and 25, so digits can be from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' to ... but note: in bases above 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. However, the problem says \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n 2. Otherwise, we convert the given number from base a to base b. But note: the base a and base b are integers between 2 and 25, and the input number c has up to 1000 digits (but the example says length doesn't exceed 10^3, meaning 1000 digits) and in the case of Roman numerals the number is at most 300010 (so no huge numbers) and in any other case the number is not greater than 10^1510 (which is huge, so we cannot convert by converting the entire string to an integer if we are going to base b which might be large? Actually, we have two possibilities:\n\n However, note: the input number c is given in base a and has up to 1000 digits. But if we try to convert this to an integer, even in base 25, the number can be astronomically huge (like 25^1000). So we cannot convert the entire string to an integer.\n\n Alternative approach for non-Roman case:\n\n We need to convert from base a to base b without going through base 10 (because the numbers are too big).\n\n Steps for non-Roman conversion:\n   - Convert the string c (which is in base a) to a base 10 integer? But wait: the base a is given, and the string c contains digits (each digit is represented by a character). But note: the base a can be up to 25, so the digits in the string c must be valid in base a.\n\n   However, the problem says the number c is non-negative and has leading zeros allowed, but its length is up to 1000. And if it's not Roman, the number is not greater than 10^1510. But note: the base a is at least 2, so the maximum value of a digit is a-1 (represented by a character). \n\n   But wait, the input for non-Roman case: the number c is given in base a, and we have to output in base b. However, the number c is provided as a string. We cannot convert the entire string to an integer because it might be too long.\n\n   Instead, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Convert the base a string to base 10 using a loop, but we cannot because the number is too big (even with Python integers, 10^1510 is too big to handle as an integer for some operations? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the problem says the number is not greater than 10^1510, which is a number with about 1510 digits, which is acceptable in terms of representation but converting from base a (which is up to 25) to base 10 would require a number with up to 1510 * log10(25) ~ 1510 * 1.4 = about 2114 digits. This is acceptable for a string, but we have to do a conversion that uses exponentiation which would be O(n^2) and n=1000 (the string length) and then the base 10 number would have up to 1000 digits (actually more because base a is variable). Alternatively, we can convert from base a to base b without going through base 10 by processing the digits one by one and representing the number in base b?\n\n   However, note: the problem says that in the non-Roman case, the number is not greater than 10^1510. But 10^1510 is a very big number, but base a is at most 25. The input string has up to 1000 digits. So the maximum value of the number is (a^(n)) - 1, which",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of converting to Roman numerals. The solution involves handling two main cases: standard base conversion and Roman numeral conversion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input values for the bases (a and b) and the number (c) in base a.\n2. **Base Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base Conversion**: If the target base (b) is an integer, convert the number from base a to base 10 by processing each digit, then convert the resulting integer to base b.\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base (b) is 'R', first convert the number from base a to base 10, then convert this decimal number to Roman numerals using predefined rules for Roman numeral representation.\n3. **Output**: Print the converted number, omitting any leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except:\n        a = 25\n        \n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        # Convert from base a to base 10\n        if a == 10:\n            num_dec = int(num_str)\n        else:\n            num_dec = 0\n            power = 1\n            n = len(num_str) - 1\n            digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n            for i, char in enumerate(num_str):\n                if char == '0':\n                    continue\n                d = digits.index(char)\n                if d >= a:\n                    print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n                    return\n                num_dec += d * (a ** (n - i))\n            while num_dec % 10 == 0 and num_dec != 0:\n                num_dec //= 10\n                \n        if num_dec == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n            return\n            \n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n            ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n            ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n        ]\n        res = ''\n        for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n            while num_dec >= value:\n                res += numeral\n                num_dec -= value\n        print(res)\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except:\n            print(\"Invalid base\")\n            return\n            \n        if a == 10:\n            num_dec = int(num_str)\n        else:\n            num_dec = 0\n            power = 1\n            n = len(num_str) - 1\n            digits = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n            for i, char in enumerate(num_str):\n                if char == '0':\n                    continue\n                d = digits.index(char)\n                if d >= a:\n                    print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n                    return\n                num_dec += d * (a ** (n - i))\n                \n        if num_dec == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        if b == 10:\n            print(str(num_dec))\n        else:\n            digits_b = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n            if num_dec < 0:\n                num_dec = -num_dec\n                neg = True\n            else:\n                neg = False\n                \n            if num_dec == 0:\n                print('0')\n                return\n                \n            res = []\n            while num_dec:\n                num_dec, r = divmod(num_dec, b)\n                res.append(digits_b[r])\n                \n            res.reverse()\n            if neg:\n                res.append('-')\n            print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads two lines from standard input. The first line contains the source base (a) and target base (b), which can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line contains the number (c) in base a.\n2. **Base Conversion**:\n   - **Roman Numeral Case**: The number is first converted from base a to base 10. Then, the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number.\n   - **Standard Base Case**: The number is converted from base a to base 10. If the target base is 10, the result is printed directly. Otherwise, the decimal number is converted to the target base by repeatedly dividing by the base and collecting remainders.\n3. **Output**: The converted number is printed without leading zeros. For Roman numerals, the result is constructed by combining the appropriate symbols according to their values.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and optimal performance even for large numbers.",
