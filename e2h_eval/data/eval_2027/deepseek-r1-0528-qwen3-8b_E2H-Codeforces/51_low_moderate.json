Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is to check two things:\n 1. The combined letters of the first two names (guest and host) must be exactly the same as the letters in the pile (third line), including the frequency of each letter.\n 2. There should be no extra letters or missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, stripping newline characters.\n - Concatenate the first two strings (guest and host) and then compare the sorted list of characters of this concatenated string with the sorted list of characters of the third string (the pile).\n - If both sorted lists are identical, output \"YES\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that the pile must be exactly the letters needed for the two names (and nothing more, nothing less).\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Here, the guest's name is \"SANTACLAUS\", host's name is \"DEDMOROZ\", so together we have \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\".\n   But the example pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", which is the same multiset of letters.\n\n Let's check: \n   Guest + Host = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> 14+9 = 23 letters?\n   Pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> 20 letters? \n\n Wait, actually the example input is given as:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n But note: the example input has three lines. The example provided is:\n\n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   However, the example output is YES.\n\n Let me count the letters:\n\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1 -> total 8 letters? Actually, let's count: \n        S A N T A C L A U S -> wait, that's 10 letters? \n        Correction: S-A-N-T-A-C-L-A-U-S -> 10 letters.\n\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> D:2, E:1, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1 -> 8 letters? Actually, D-E-D-M-O-R-O-Z -> 8 letters.\n\n   So total letters: 10+8 = 18.\n\n   Now the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1 -> 17 letters? \n\n   Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the example is different.\n\n Let me look at the example again: \n   The example input is: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   But the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   But wait, the example input is one string with three parts? Or three separate lines?\n\n   The problem states: three lines.\n\n   So we have three lines. The first line is \"SANTACLAUS\", second \"DEDMOROZ\", third \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   Now, let's form the expected letters: guest + host = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   But the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   How can these be the same? \n\n   Let me sort the two:\n\n   Expected: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> sorted: \n        A, A, C, D, D, E, L, M, N, O, O, R, S, S, T, U, Z -> 17 letters? \n\n   Wait, let me count: \n        SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ: \n            S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1 -> 2+2+1+1+1+",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the total number of letters in the pile must match the combined length of the guest and host names, and each letter in the pile must appear with the same frequency as in the combined names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from standard input, representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Letter Frequencies**: Compare the sorted list of characters from the combined names with the sorted list of characters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the right letters in the right quantities, so the answer is \"YES\". Otherwise, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    sorted_combined = sorted(combined)\n    sorted_pile = sorted(pile)\n    \n    if sorted_combined == sorted_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three strings from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace or newline characters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and the host's name are concatenated into a single string called `combined`.\n3. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the combined string matches the length of the pile string. If they don't match, it immediately prints \"NO\" because there are either extra or missing letters.\n4. **Sorting and Comparison**: The characters of both the combined string and the pile string are sorted alphabetically. If the sorted versions are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters in the same quantities as the combined names, so the program prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the required conditions by leveraging sorting to compare letter frequencies, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
