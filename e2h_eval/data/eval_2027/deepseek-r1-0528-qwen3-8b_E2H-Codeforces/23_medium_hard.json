In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, s). But note: the input format is three strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']   --> but wait, actually the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n However, looking at the example, it seems that the input might be space separated? Actually, the example input is provided as three separate strings in one line, so we have to read the entire line and split appropriately.\n\n But note: the problem says \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" and each tile is represented by a string of two characters. So the input line will have three two-character strings. But how are they separated?\n\n Example: Input line could be \"1m1p1s\" or \"1m 1p 1s\"? The problem does not specify. Let me check the example:\n\n Example input: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n Wait, actually the example input is given as three separate examples? No, the problem says:\n\n   Input:\n     ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But that is just showing three examples. The actual input is one line with three strings. However, the example output is:\n\n     Output: ['0', '0', '1']\n\n And the problem says: \"Print a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\"\n\n Since there are three examples, we are expected to write code that handles one set of three tiles.\n\n How should we read the input?\n Let me assume the input is given as three space separated two-character strings? Or maybe without spaces? \n\n But the problem says: \"For each string, the first character is a digit from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p, or s.\"\n\n So each tile is two characters, and there are three tiles. There are two possibilities:\n  1. The input is a string of six characters (without spaces) representing the three tiles: e.g., \"1m2p3s\"\n  2. The input is three tokens separated by spaces: e.g., \"1m 2p 3s\"\n\n The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", meaning three tokens. So we should split the input line by spaces.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read a line from stdin.\n 2. Split the line into a list of three strings (each string is two characters).\n\n However, what if there are more than three tokens? The problem states three tiles.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says \"three strings\", so we expect exactly three tokens.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"1m 2p 3s\"\n\n 3. We then have a list of three strings: ['1m','2p','3s']\n\n But note: the example input provided in the problem statement is written as:\n      ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This seems confusing because it lists three examples. Actually, the problem says:\n\n      Input:\n          ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n      Output:\n          ['0', '0', '1']\n\n But wait, the example input is not three separate lines. It's one line? Or three lines? The problem says \"The only line\".\n\n Let me re-read: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format.\n\n The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n So we are to read one line with three strings (each two characters). So we can split by space.\n\n Approach:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   Then data should be a list of three strings.\n\n However, what if the input uses a different separator? The problem says \"strings\", so we assume space separation.\n\n But note: the example input representation in the problem is shown with spaces? Actually, the example input representation is:\n\n        ['1s 2s 3s', ... ]\n\n which suggests that the input is three two-character strings separated by spaces.\n\n So let's assume the input is given as: \"1s 2s 3s\" (for example)\n\n Now, we have three tiles. We need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we can form at least one mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu).\n\n Note: The hand initially has three tiles. We can draw any number of tiles (and any type) arbitrarily.\n\n However, we are allowed to draw one or more tiles and then use the entire hand (which now has more than three) to form a mentsu? \n\n But note: the problem says \"so that she can win\", and the win condition is having at least one mentsu. However, note that the entire hand doesn't necessarily need to be used for the mentsu? Actually, the problem says: \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand\". So we don't need to use all the tiles, just one mentsu (a triplet or a sequence) is sufficient.\n\n However, we are allowed to draw extra tiles arbitrarily. We want the minimum number.\n\n Cases:\n\n  Case 1: Already have a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) -> then answer 0.\n\n  Case 2: Not already, then consider:\n\n    Option 1: Draw 1 tile: can we form a mentsu by adding one tile?\n    Option 2: Draw 2 tiles: then we have 5 tiles. But we can also form a mentsu by drawing two tiles? Maybe sometimes we can form with one, but we are looking for minimum.\n\n We are to find the minimum number of draws.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n  0: already have a mentsu.\n\n  1: we can complete a koutsu by drawing one more tile (if we have two same, then drawing one more makes three) OR we can complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile (if we have two consecutive numbers in the same suit, then drawing the missing one completes the sequence).\n\n  However, note: for koutsu, we require three identical. So if we have [a, a, a] -> already koutsu. If we have [a, a, b] (with b != a) then we can draw an a to make [a,a,a] and discard the b? But wait, we are allowed to keep the drawn tile and not necessarily discard the others? Actually, the problem says: after drawing, we have the new hand, and we just need the hand to contain at least one mentsu.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to keep the original three and the drawn ones. So we don't have to remove any. So if we have [a, a, b] and we draw an a, then we have [a, a, b, a]. Then we have a koutsu (the three a's) and the b remains. That's acceptable.\n\n  Similarly, for shuntsu: if we have two consecutive, say [a, a+1] (same suit) then drawing a+2 would complete the sequence [a, a+1, a+2]. But note: we might have two copies of a and one copy of a+1? Then we can use one a, one a+1, and the drawn a+2. Or if we have two a and one a+1, then we can use one a, one a+1, and the other a is redundant? But the definition of shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles. So we just need three distinct tiles? Actually, the example [5p,4p,6p] is a shuntsu. But note: the example [5p,7p,6p] is also a shuntsu. So the tiles must be distinct? Yes, because the representation is distinct tiles (even if two tiles are same, they are two separate entities). However, for a shuntsu, the numbers must be consecutive and distinct.\n\n  Important: In a shuntsu, the three tiles must have distinct numbers and be consecutive.\n\n  So for koutsu: we need three identical tiles.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Check if the current three tiles form a mentsu.\n\n  2. If yes, output 0.\n\n  3. Otherwise, check if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n\n  4. Then check if we can form by drawing two tiles (if one fails, then two might be needed).\n\n  However, note: we can also consider that we might form two different mentsus by drawing the same tile? Actually, we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily, and we don't have to use all drawn tiles. So we are concerned with forming at least one mentsu.\n\n  But note: we are only drawing the minimal number. We can consider:\n\n    - 0: already done.\n\n    - 1: we can complete a koutsu by drawing one tile (if there is a tile that appears at least two times, then we can complete a koutsu by drawing one more of that tile).\n\n    - 1: we can complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile (if there is a pair of consecutive numbers in the same suit, and the next (or previous) number is available).\n\n    - 2: if we can't do with one, maybe we can do with two? But note: sometimes two tiles might be required to form a koutsu if we have two different pairs? Actually, wait: if we have three tiles that are not forming a mentsu, then:\n\n        Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> we can complete a shuntsu by drawing a 3m (then we have [1m,1m,2m,3m] and we can take one 1m, one 2m, one 3m to form a shuntsu). But also, we can complete a koutsu by drawing two more 1m (then we have [1m,1m,2m,1m,1m] and then we have a koutsu of 1m). However, that requires two draws.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: \n\n          Drawing two tiles might be necessary for two reasons:\n\n            a) To complete a koutsu from three distinct tiles: we have one of each, then we need two more of one kind.\n\n            b) To complete two parts of a shuntsu: for example, if we have [1m, 4m], then we need both 2m and 3m to complete the sequence? But wait, we can choose to complete the sequence by drawing 2m and 3m (two draws) and then we have [1m,4m,2m,3m] and then we can use 2m,3m,4m to form the shuntsu. However, note: we can also complete the sequence by drawing two tiles that are part of multiple sequences? Actually, we are allowed to form any mentsu. So we don't necessarily have to use the entire hand.\n\n          But note: we are only required to have one mentsu.\n\n        However, there is another possibility: sometimes we can form a koutsu with two draws even if we have two of the same? Actually, if we have two of the same, then we only need one more. So two draws for koutsu is when we have one copy of a tile and we need two more? Then two draws.\n\n        Actually, we can categorize the initial three tiles by:\n\n          Group by suit and number.\n\n        Let's denote:\n\n          Tiles: three tiles, each (number, suit)\n\n        We can represent a tile as (suit, number). But note: the number is a digit from '1' to '9'\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Check if already have a mentsu.\n\n          Step 2: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n\n          Step 3: Check if we can form by drawing two tiles.\n\n          Step 4: Check if we can form by drawing three tiles? Actually, note: the worst-case scenario might be that we need to draw three tiles? But let me think:\n\n          Example: [1m, 1p, 1s] -> no mentsu. We cannot form a koutsu because they are different suits. We cannot form a shuntsu because the numbers are the same and the suits are different. So we must draw two more 1m (then we have [1m,1p,1s,1m,1m]) and then we have a koutsu of 1m. So two draws.\n\n          But wait, we can also consider: what if we draw one tile? Then we have four tiles. We can form a koutsu if we draw two 1m, but that is two draws. One draw is insufficient because we only have one 1m and we need two more (so we need two 1m). Alternatively, we could form a koutsu by drawing two tiles of the same suit and same number.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily. So we can draw two 1m's and then we have three 1m's (a koutsu) and the other two remain.\n\n          But wait, is there a way to form a mentsu with one draw? \n\n          With one draw, we can only add one tile. Then we have four tiles. We can form a koutsu if we have three of a kind. Currently, we have one 1m, one 1p, one 1s. After drawing one tile, we have one of one kind increased by one. Then we have:\n\n            Two of one kind and one of the others.\n\n            Example: draw 1m -> then we have two 1m, one 1p, one 1s. Then we don't have a koutsu (we need three 1m). We have two 1m and then we still need one more. Also, we don't have a shuntsu because the numbers are 1 (all same) and the suits are different.\n\n          Another idea: we can form a shuntsu? We have no consecutive numbers. So one draw is not enough.\n\n          Then we try two draws: we can draw two 1m, then we have three 1m (a koutsu). So two draws.\n\n          But wait, the problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles. So the answer for [1m,1p,1s] is 2.\n\n          However, consider: [1m, 2p, 3s] (three different suits and consecutive numbers) -> no mentsu. We can draw two tiles: for example, two 1m to form a koutsu? Then we have [1m,2p,3s,1m,1m] and then we have three 1m (koutsu). So two draws.\n\n          Alternatively, we could draw two tiles to form a shuntsu? For example, draw 1m and 2m? Then we have [1m,2p,3s,1m,2m] and then we don't have a shuntsu. Or draw two tiles of the same suit and same number? Then we get a koutsu.\n\n          But note: we can also consider: draw two tiles of the same suit and consecutive numbers? Actually, we have no two tiles in the same suit, so we cannot form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles in one suit. We would need to draw two tiles to complete two different sequences? Actually, no, because we are only required to have one mentsu.\n\n          So the minimal number of draws is 2.\n\n          However, wait: is there a way to form a mentsu by drawing one tile in some cases? We already know that if we have two of the same (same suit and same number) then one draw is enough for koutsu. Similarly, if we have two of the same suit and consecutive numbers (like [1m,2m] and then we have a third tile that is either 3m or something else) then one draw (3m) is enough for a shuntsu.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal number of draws can be 0, 1, 2, or 3? Actually, wait: the maximum we need is 2? \n\n          Let me think: we start with three tiles.\n\n          - 0: already done.\n\n          - 1: if we can complete a koutsu (by having two of one kind) OR complete a shuntsu (by having two consecutive in the same suit) then one draw.\n\n          - 2: if we don't have two of the same, then we can try to form a koutsu by drawing two of a kind (if we have one copy of a tile, then drawing two more of that tile) OR we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles that complete a sequence (if we have one tile and the next two are missing, then we need to draw two). But wait, we might have two different ways.\n\n          However, note: we might have three distinct tiles, but we can form a shuntsu if we draw two tiles? Actually, no: to form a shuntsu we need three consecutive. We have three distinct tiles, so if they are consecutive and same suit, then we already have a shuntsu (unless they are not consecutive). \n\n          Actually, if we have three distinct tiles, same suit, and they are consecutive, then that is a shuntsu. But if they are not consecutive, then we might need to draw two tiles to complete a sequence that includes one of them.\n\n          Example: [1m, 3m, 5m] (same suit, but not consecutive). Then we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles? Actually, we can form two separate shuntsus? But we only need one. We can choose one of the numbers and complete the sequence around it? \n\n          However, note: we are allowed to draw any tiles. So we can draw two tiles that complete a sequence that uses one of the existing tiles.\n\n          But wait, we have three distinct numbers: 1,3,5. We can try to form a shuntsu that uses 3m:\n\n            We need 2m and 4m. Then we draw [2m,4m] and then we have a shuntsu [2m,3m,4m]. So two draws.\n\n          Alternatively, we can form a koutsu? We have only one of each. We would need to draw two more of one of them, say two 1m, then we have [1m,1m,1m,3m,5m] and then we have a koutsu. So two draws.\n\n          But note: we can also consider: we have three distinct tiles, so we cannot form a koutsu by drawing one (because we need three of the same, and we only have one). So two draws.\n\n          However, what about the case where we have two tiles of the same suit and same number? Then we can complete a koutsu by drawing one, and that is minimal.\n\n          Another example: [1m, 1m, 2p] (two 1m and one 2p). Then:\n\n            Check for koutsu: we have two 1m, so we can draw one 1m to complete koutsu -> 1 draw.\n\n            Check for shuntsu: we have two 1m (same suit) and one 2p (different suit). In the same suit (m), we have 1m and 1m. They are not consecutive (we need 1,2,3). We have two 1m, so we can use one 1m and then we need 2m and 3m? But wait, we don't have 2m. Alternatively, we can use two 1m and one 2m to form a shuntsu? No, because a shuntsu requires three distinct consecutive numbers. So we cannot use two 1m. \n\n            But wait, we have two 1m. We can use one 1m and then we need 2m and 3m. However, we don't have 2m. So we can draw 2m and 3m (two draws) to form the shuntsu [1m,2m,3m]. But we already have the option of drawing one 1m to complete koutsu, so the minimal is 1.\n\n          So the plan:\n\n            Step 1: Count frequency and group by suit.\n\n            Let tiles = list of three tuples: (suit, number) where number is integer.\n\n            Step 2: Check for koutsu in the hand: if there is any suit and number that appears three times.\n\n            Step 3: Check for shuntsu: for each suit, look at the distinct numbers in that suit. Sort them. Then check for consecutive triplets (n, n+1, n+2) for n from 1 to 7.\n\n            However, note: we can have duplicates. So we should consider the multiset.\n\n            Actually, for shuntsu, we require three distinct consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n            So for a given suit, we can have multiple copies. We can use at most one copy per distinct number.\n\n            Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> we can form the shuntsu [1m,2m,3m] if we have a 3m, but we don't. Alternatively, we can form a shuntsu [1m,1m,2m] is not consecutive. But wait, we have two 1m and one 2m. The consecutive sequence would be [0m,1m,2m] (but 0m doesn't exist) or [1m,2m,3m] (which we don't have). So no shuntsu.\n\n            But wait, we can use one of the 1m and then we need 2m and 3m. We have one 2m, so we need 3m. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing one 3m. But wait, we already have two 1m and one 2m. Then we draw 3m. Then we have [1m,1m,2m,3m] and we can use one 1m, one 2m, one 3m to form the shuntsu. So that is one draw.\n\n            However, we also have the option to form a koutsu by drawing one 1m (then we have three 1m). So one draw is sufficient.\n\n            So we don't need to consider the shuntsu in this case because we already found a way with koutsu.\n\n            But wait, how do we check for shuntsu in the hand? We have to check if there exists a consecutive triplet in the same suit, and we have at least one tile for each number in the triplet.\n\n            However, note: we can have duplicates. We don't need three copies of the same tile for the shuntsu, just one copy for each distinct number.\n\n            So for shuntsu: for a given suit, we can extract the set of distinct numbers (or rather, we can use the counts as long as we have at least one for each). But wait, we are not limited by the count because we can use each tile only once? Actually, the hand has three tiles. We can only use each tile once. But note: the problem doesn't say we can break the hand. We are just checking if the hand (or the hand plus drawn tiles) contains a mentsu.\n\n            However, the drawn tiles are arbitrary. So for the hand alone, we can check:\n\n              koutsu: same tile three times.\n\n              shuntsu: three consecutive numbers (distinct) in the same suit, and we have at least one tile for each number.\n\n            But wait: we have three tiles. We can use up to three tiles for the mentsu.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> shuntsu.\n\n            Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> not a shuntsu, because we don't have a 3m.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,2m] -> not a shuntsu because we don't have a 3m.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> no consecutive triplet.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m,4m] (if we had four tiles) then we can form two shuntsus? But we are only concerned with one.\n\n            But we have only three tiles. So we must use all three tiles? Actually, no: we are allowed to have the entire hand, but the mentsu is a subset of three tiles. So we don't need to use all the tiles.\n\n            However, in the hand of three tiles, we can only form a mentsu if the three tiles together form either a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n            But wait, the problem says: \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand\". So the hand (the set of tiles) must contain a mentsu. The hand is the three tiles (and then the drawn ones). \n\n            However, note: the problem does not say that we are forced to use the drawn tiles. We can ignore the drawn ones? Actually, no: the drawn tiles are added, so the hand becomes larger. But we only need one mentsu (a set of three tiles) somewhere in the hand.\n\n            So for the hand of three tiles, we can check:\n\n              koutsu: if there is a tile that appears three times.\n\n              shuntsu: if there exists a suit and three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) such that the hand contains at least one tile for each of these three numbers in that suit.\n\n            However, wait: we can have duplicates. For example, [1m,1m,1m] is koutsu. [1m,2m,3m] is shuntsu.\n\n            What about [1m,1m,2m]? We have two 1m and one 2m. For shuntsu, we would need one 1m, one 2m, and one 3m. We don't have 3m. So no.\n\n            Similarly, [1m,2m,2m]: we have one 1m and two 2m. We need one 1m, one 2m, and one 3m. We don't have 3m. So no.\n\n            Now, what if we have two pairs? [1m,1m,2p,2p] is four tiles, but we are considering three tiles. \n\n            Since we start with three, we only have three.\n\n            So algorithm for step 1 (check 0 draws):\n\n              Let tiles = list of (suit, int(number))\n\n              Create a frequency dictionary: key: (suit, number) -> count, but we don't need that for koutsu? Actually, for koutsu we need the same tile three times.\n\n              Alternatively, group by (suit, number) and see if any group has count>=3.\n\n              For shuntsu: we need to check for each suit, and for each starting number from 1 to 7, if the hand has at least one tile with number n, n+1, n+2 in that suit.\n\n            But note: we are only given three tiles.\n\n            Step 2: Check for 1 draw:\n\n              Possibility 1: Complete a koutsu.\n\n                Condition: There is a tile (suit, number) that appears at least two times. Then we can draw one more (suit, number) to make three.\n\n              Possibility 2: Complete a shuntsu.\n\n                Condition: There exists a suit and a number n (from 1 to 7) such that the hand has:\n\n                  - At least one tile with (suit, n)\n                  - At least one tile with (suit, n+1)\n                  - And we are missing one tile (suit, n+2) OR (suit, n-1) OR (suit, n-2) ? Actually, we can complete the sequence in two ways:\n\n                    Actually, we can have a sequence that ends at n+2, or starts at n-2, but wait: we have two consecutive numbers? \n\n                Alternatively, we can think: we have two consecutive numbers in the same suit. Then we can complete the sequence by drawing the third.\n\n                Example: [1m,2m] (but we have three tiles, so the third tile is either in the same suit or not). Actually, the hand has three tiles.\n\n                Let me break down:\n\n                  We are going to consider each suit separately.\n\n                  For a given suit, let S be the set of numbers present.\n\n                  We can form a shuntsu if there exists an n in [1,7] such that {n, n+1, n+2} is a subset of S (after drawing one tile).\n\n                  But initially, we have three tiles. We are going to draw one. We can choose which tile to draw.\n\n                  So we can complete a shuntsu if there exists a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) and we have two of the three. Then we can draw the missing one.\n\n                  Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we don't have two of the same consecutive. But wait, we have 1m,2m,4m. We are missing 3m for the sequence [1m,2m,3m] and we are missing 3m and 5m for [2m,3m,4m] and [4m,5m,6m]. So we don't have two consecutive. \n\n                  Another example: [1m,2m,2m] -> we have two consecutive (1m and 2m) and we have an extra 2m. Then we can complete the sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing a 3m. So we have two consecutive (1m and 2m) and we are missing 3m.\n\n                  Similarly, we can have [1m,1m,2m]: then we have two consecutive (1m and 2m) and we are missing 3m.\n\n                  But what about [1m,3m,4m]? Then we have two consecutive (3m,4m) and we are missing 2m for the sequence [1m,2m,3m] doesn't work because 1m and 3m are not consecutive. But we can form [2m,3m,4m] by drawing 2m.\n\n                  So condition for shuntsu with one draw: \n\n                    There exists a suit and a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that the hand has two of the three numbers (in that suit) and the third is missing.\n\n                  However, note: we might have two non-consecutive numbers and one repeated? Then we don't have two consecutive.\n\n                  So we need to check: for each suit, for each consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) (n from 1 to 7), check:\n\n                    Let count_in_hand = the set of numbers (in that suit) that are present.\n\n                    Then the number of numbers from {n, n+1, n+2} that are in the hand is 2. Then we can draw the missing one.\n\n                  But note: the hand has three tiles. It might have duplicates. So we must account for duplicates.\n\n                  Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> already a shuntsu (so 0 draws). \n\n                  Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> for the triplet [1,2,3]: we have two numbers (1 and 2) and the third (3) is missing. So one draw.\n\n                  Example: [1m,2m,2m] -> same.\n\n                  Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> no triplet has two numbers.\n\n                  Example: [1m,3m,4m] -> for the triplet [2,3,4]: we have two numbers (3 and 4) and missing 2. So one draw.\n\n                  Example: [1m,1m,3m] -> for the triplet [1,2,3]: we have two numbers (1 and 3) and missing 2. So one draw.\n\n                  Example: [1m,1m,4m] -> no consecutive triplet has two numbers.\n\n                  So the condition for shuntsu with one draw is: there exists a suit and a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that the hand has two distinct numbers from that triplet (in the same suit) and the third is missing.\n\n            Step 3: Check for 2 draws:\n\n              Possibility 1: Complete a koutsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                Condition: There is a tile (suit, number) that appears at least one time. Then we can draw two more of that tile to have three. But note: if we have one copy, then two draws. If we have two copies, then one draw (already considered). So we are only considering when we have one copy (then we need two draws) OR if we have zero copies, then we cannot form a koutsu by drawing two because we need three identical.\n\n                Actually, for koutsu: we need three identical. So we can only complete a koutsu by drawing two if we have one copy (then we need two more). If we have two copies, then one draw is enough.\n\n                So the two-draw koutsu condition: there is a tile (suit, number) that appears exactly once.\n\n              Possibility 2: Complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                Condition: There exists a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) and the hand has one of the three numbers (in the same suit). Then we need to draw the other two. But wait, we might have two numbers already and then one missing, then we only need one draw. So we are looking for the case where we have zero or one of the three numbers.\n\n                Actually, we need to consider: we have three tiles. We are going to draw two. We can complete a shuntsu if:\n\n                  There exists a suit and a consecutive triplet (n, n+1, n+2) such that the hand has at most one of the three numbers (in that suit). Then we need to draw the missing ones (at least two). \n\n                But note: we can also complete a shuntsu if we have two non-consecutive numbers and we complete the middle one? Actually, no, because the consecutive triplet must be consecutive.\n\n                Example: [1m,4m] (and the third tile is say 5p). Then we can draw 2m and 3m to complete the shuntsu [1m,2m,3m] and then we have four tiles: [1m,4m,2m,3m]. But wait, we started with three, so we have three: [1m,4m,5p] and then we draw two: [2m,3m]. Then we have the shuntsu [1m,2m,3m] and the 4m and 5p remain.\n\n                But note: the hand after drawing two tiles is five tiles. We can form a mentsu.\n\n                However, we must check if we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles. There are two possibilities: either by koutsu or by shuntsu.\n\n                But note: the problem allows any tile to be drawn arbitrarily.\n\n                However, we must consider: is two the minimal? We already checked for 0 and 1. So if 0 and 1 fail, then we try 2.\n\n                But wait: what if we can complete a koutsu with two draws (if we have one copy of a tile) and we can complete a shuntsu with two draws? Then we choose 2.\n\n                But note: we are only concerned with the minimal number.\n\n            Step 4: Check for 3 draws? \n\n            Actually, the minimal number of draws can be 0,1,2. Why 3?\n\n            Consider: [1m, 2p, 3s] (three different suits and consecutive numbers). We cannot form a koutsu because the suits are different. We cannot form a shuntsu because the suits are different. \n\n            Then, we can complete a koutsu by drawing two more of 1m (then we have three 1m). Or we can complete a shuntsu by drawing two tiles (say 2m and 3m) to form a shuntsu [1m,2m,3m] (but wait, we have 1m, so we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m). \n\n            But note: we can also consider: we have 1m, 2p, 3s. We can draw two tiles to form a koutsu: for example, two 1m. Then we have three 1m (koutsu). So two draws.\n\n            Or we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles: two 2m (to form [2m,2m,2m] is koutsu, but that's for the same number and same suit) OR one 2m and one 3m? Actually, for",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the current hand already contains a mentsu. A mentsu can be:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same suit and number).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n2. **Check for One-Draw Mentsu**: If no mentsu exists, we check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: If there are two identical tiles, drawing one more of the same tile forms a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: If there are two consecutive numbers in the same suit, drawing the missing number completes the sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Two-Draw Mentsu**: If no one-draw solution exists, we check if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu:\n   - **Koutsu Completion**: If there is one tile of a kind, drawing two more forms a triplet.\n   - **Shuntsu Completion**: If there is at least one tile in a consecutive sequence (but not enough to complete it with one draw), drawing the missing tiles completes the sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = []\n    for tile_str in data:\n        if len(tile_str) != 2:\n            continue\n        num = int(tile_str[0])\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        tiles.append((suit, num))\n    \n    suits = {}\n    for suit, num in tiles:\n        if suit not in suits:\n            suits[suit] = {}\n        suits[suit][num] = suits[suit].get(num, 0) + 1\n\n    def has_koutsu_in_hand():\n        for suit in suits:\n            for num, count in suits[suit].items():\n                if count >= 3:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def has_shuntsu_in_hand():\n        for suit in suits:\n            nums_set = set()\n            for num in suits[suit]:\n                nums_set.add(num)\n            nums_list = sorted(nums_set)\n            for i in range(len(nums_list) - 2):\n                if nums_list[i+1] == nums_list[i] + 1 and nums_list[i+2] == nums_list[i] + 2:\n                    return True\n            for num in range(1, 8):\n                if all(n in nums_set for n in [num, num+1, num+2]):\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def has_koutsu_with_one_draw():\n        for suit in suits:\n            for num, count in suits[suit].items():\n                if count >= 2:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def has_shuntsu_with_one_draw():\n        for suit in suits:\n            nums_set = set(suits[suit].keys())\n            for n in range(1, 8):\n                if all(x in nums_set for x in [n, n+1, n+2]):\n                    return True\n            for n in range(1, 8):\n                if len([x for x in [n, n+1, n+2] if x in nums_set]) == 2:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def has_koutsu_with_two_draws():\n        for suit in suits:\n            for num, count in suits[suit].items():\n                if count >= 1:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def has_shuntsu_with_two_draws():\n        for suit in suits:\n            nums_set = set(suits[suit].keys())\n            for n in range(1, 8):\n                present = [x for x in [n, n+1, n+2] if x in nums_set]\n                if len(present) <= 1:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    if has_koutsu_in_hand() or has_shuntsu_in_hand():\n        print(0)\n    elif has_koutsu_with_one_draw() or has_shuntsu_with_one_draw():\n        print(1)\n    elif has_koutsu_with_two_draws() or has_shuntsu_with_two_draws():\n        print(2)\n    else:\n        print(3)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual tile strings. Each tile string is parsed into a tuple of (suit, number).\n2. **Frequency Dictionary**: A dictionary groups tiles by suit and number to count occurrences.\n3. **Mentsu Checks**:\n   - **has_koutsu_in_hand**: Checks for three identical tiles in any suit.\n   - **has_shuntsu_in_hand**: Checks for three consecutive numbers in any suit.\n   - **has_koutsu_with_one_draw**: Checks if two identical tiles exist (can be completed to a triplet with one draw).\n   - **has_shuntsu_with_one_draw**: Checks if two consecutive numbers exist in a suit (can be completed to a sequence with one draw).\n   - **has_koutsu_with_two_draws**: Checks if at least one tile exists (can be completed to a triplet with two draws).\n   - **has_shuntsu_with_two_draws**: Checks if at most one tile exists in a consecutive sequence (can be completed to a sequence with two draws).\n4. **Output**: Based on the checks, the minimum number of draws (0, 1, 2, or 3) is printed. If no mentsu can be formed even after drawing three tiles, the answer defaults to 3 (though theoretically, three might not always be sufficient, but the problem constraints ensure minimal draws).",
