They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string s of length n.\n The tournament has 2^n teams, with skill levels being a permutation of [1, 2, ..., 2^n].\n The string s has n characters. Each character at index i (0-indexed) corresponds to the result in the (i+1)-th phase.\n\n In the tournament structure:\n   Phase 0: 2^(n-1) games (the first round)\n   Phase 1: 2^(n-2) games\n   ...\n   Phase n-1: 1 game (the final)\n\n However, note: the problem says \"if s_i is equal to 0\" then lower skill wins, and if 1 then higher skill wins.\n\n We are to find all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) that can be the champion for some permutation p (which is a bijection from team index to skill level) satisfying the outcome conditions.\n\n Observation:\n The tournament is structured in a single elimination bracket. The key is that the outcome of each match in each phase is determined by the string s.\n\n How does the bracket work?\n   We have 2^n teams. They are arranged in a fixed bracket. The initial matching is fixed: \n        Match 1: team0 vs team1\n        Match 2: team2 vs team3\n        ... etc.\n\n   Then, the winners of the first round (2^(n-1) winners) are then arranged again in the same way for the next round.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not specify the exact reordering of the winners. But looking at the example: \n        After the first phase, the remaining teams are the winners. Then the next phase: \n            \"the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\", then the winner of '5 vs 6' vs '7 vs 8', etc.\n\n   This means the bracket is fixed: the winners are kept in the original order (by the order of the matches) and then the next round's matches are formed by consecutive pairs.\n\n   So the entire bracket is a complete binary tree with leaves in order (from left to right).\n\n Steps:\n\n We need to determine which team numbers (from 0 to 2^n-1) must be eliminated in each phase to allow a particular skill level x to win.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to assign the skill levels arbitrarily (as long as they are a permutation). Therefore, we can choose which team is which.\n\n Conditions:\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the teams be labeled from 0 to (2^n - 1). The initial bracket: \n        Round 0: matches between (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), ... (2^(n-1)*2 - 2, 2^(n-1)*2 - 1)\n\n   Then the winners are arranged in order (without changing the relative order of the winners from the same parent node) and then the next round is played.\n\n But note: the problem says the second phase (if any) has 2^(n-2) games, and the matches are:\n        First match: winner of (0,1) vs winner of (2,3)\n        Second match: winner of (4,5) vs winner of (6,7)\n\n   So the bracket is fixed: the left subtree comes before the right subtree.\n\n We are to check for a given x (which will be the champion) if there exists an assignment p (a permutation) such that:\n\n   For each phase i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), the outcome of the matches in that phase is determined by s[i]:\n        If s[i] == '1': then in every match of that phase, the higher skilled team wins.\n        If s[i] == '0': then in every match of that phase, the lower skilled team wins.\n\n And the champion is the team with skill x.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can think of the tournament as a set of rounds (phases). The champion must survive all rounds. Moreover, in each round, the champion must win its own match and also the matches that lead to it must produce the champion.\n\n However, the complication is that the outcome of each match is determined by s. So we must assign the skills so that in the rounds where s[i]=='1', the champion must be the highest in its half (for the match that leads to it) and in rounds with '0', the champion must be the lowest in its half.\n\n But note: the bracket is fixed, so the champion must be placed in one of the leaf positions. And the condition for the champion to win is that:\n\n   In the first round (phase 0): the champion must be in a position such that in its own match, the outcome is as per s[0]. Similarly, in the next",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all possible integers \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) that can win a playoff tournament given the outcome conditions specified by the string \\( s \\). The tournament consists of multiple phases where each phase's outcome is determined by whether higher or lower skilled teams win based on the corresponding character in \\( s \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured in a single-elimination bracket with \\( 2^n \\) teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The outcome of each match in a phase depends on the corresponding character in \\( s \\): '1' means the higher-skilled team wins, and '0' means the lower-skilled team wins. The goal is to find all skill levels \\( x \\) that can emerge as champions under these conditions.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team with skill \\( x \\) to win the tournament, it must survive all phases. In each phase, the team must either be the highest or lowest in its subtree (depending on the phase's outcome condition) to win its matches. This involves checking if \\( x \\) can be positioned in a way that it meets these criteria in all relevant phases.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves simulating the tournament phases for each possible team position (leaf node) in the bracket. For each position, we determine the necessary conditions on the skill values of the teams in its path to the root. Specifically:\n   - For each phase, starting from the final phase, we determine the required range of skills for the teams in the subtree leading to the champion.\n   - If all conditions are satisfied, the skill \\( x \\) (if it fits within the required ranges) is a valid winner.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each of the \\( 2^n \\) positions. For each position, it processes up to \\( n \\) phases, performing constant-time operations per phase. Thus, the overall complexity is \\( O(n \\cdot 2^n) \\), which is feasible given \\( n \\leq 18 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    winners_required = total_teams\n    \n    res = set()\n    \n    def simulate(pos):\n        left_bound = 1\n        right_bound = total_teams\n        current_phase = n - 1\n        \n        while current_phase >= 0:\n            if winners_required == 1:\n                break\n                \n            mid = (left_bound + right_bound) // 2\n            if s[current_phase] == '1':\n                if pos % 2 == 0:\n                    right_bound = mid - 1\n                else:\n                    left_bound = mid\n            else:\n                if pos % 2 == 0:\n                    left_bound = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right_bound = mid\n                    \n            current_phase -= 1\n            winners_required //= 2\n            \n        return (left_bound <= right_bound)\n    \n    for pos in range(total_teams):\n        if simulate(pos):\n            res.add(pos + 1)\n            \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, sorted(res))))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer \\( n \\) (number of phases) and a string \\( s \\) (outcome conditions for each phase).\n2. **Initialization**: Calculate the total number of teams (\\( 2^n \\)) and initialize the number of winners required (initially \\( 2^n \\)).\n3. **Simulation Function**: For each team position (leaf node), the `simulate` function checks if the team can become the champion by verifying against the tournament's phase conditions. It adjusts bounds for the required skill values based on whether the phase requires the higher or lower skilled team to win.\n4. **Result Collection**: For each position, if the simulation succeeds, the corresponding skill level (position + 1) is added to the result set.\n5. **Output**: The valid skill levels are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each potential champion by leveraging the tournament structure and dynamic adjustment of skill value constraints based on the phase outcomes.",
