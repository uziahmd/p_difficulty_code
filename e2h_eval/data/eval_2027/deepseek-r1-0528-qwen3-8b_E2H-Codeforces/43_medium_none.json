He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string only contains 'a', 'b', 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends 'c' so there might be none initially? \n    But note: the process is:\n      - A gives a string of some 'a's.\n      - B appends some 'b's (at least one).\n      - Then C appends some 'c's, which equals either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' (or both) in the entire string at the time of appending.\n\n However, note: the entire string at the time of appending by C includes the original 'a's and the appended 'b's.\n\n Important: The order must be such that:\n   - All 'a's come first (from A), then all 'b's (from B), then all 'c's (from C).\n\n So the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: no 'b' before an 'a', no 'c' before an 'b'. Actually, we require:\n   - Only 'a's at the beginning, then only 'b's, then only 'c's.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if the string has any invalid character? The problem says it only contains 'a','b','c'\n\n 2. Check the order: the string should be divided into three segments: [a's] then [b's] then [c's]. There should be no mixing.\n\n 3. Count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n 4. Condition for the counts:\n    Let:\n        count_a = number of 'a'\n        count_b = number of 'b'\n        count_c = number of 'c'\n\n    And note: the total length is count_a + count_b + count_c.\n\n    According to the problem, the number of 'c' appended by C must be equal to either count_a (the original number of 'a') or count_b (the original number of 'b'? But wait, note the process: \n\n    Actually, when C appends, the string already has the initial 'a's and the appended 'b's. So the counts at the time of C's appending are:\n        a_count = count_a (because A only gave 'a's)\n        b_count = count_b (because B appended 'b's, and no more 'a's or 'b's are added until after C? Actually, the problem says: \n            A gives a string of 'a's -> then B appends 'b's -> then C appends 'c's.\n\n    Therefore, at the time of C's appending, the string has:\n        - All the 'a's (count_a)\n        - All the 'b's (count_b)\n        - And then C appends count_c_new, which must be either count_a or count_b.\n\n    But note: the entire string after C's appending is the original string (with 'a's and 'b's) plus the appended 'c's. However, the condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string BEFORE C appends. \n\n    However, wait: the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string here is the one that was given to C, i.e., without the 'c's. \n\n    So the condition is on the string without the 'c's: the number of 'c' (which is what C appends) is either count_a (the number of 'a' in the entire string without the 'c's, which is the same as the original 'a's) or count_b (the number of 'b' in the entire string without the 'c's, which is the same as the appended 'b's). \n\n    But note: the entire string without the 'c's is exactly the string from A and B, which has count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's.\n\n    However, the entire string we have includes the 'c's. How do we relate?\n\n    Let me re-read: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n    Here, the string at the time of C's action is the one without the 'c's. So the condition is on the string that is passed to C (which is the result of A and B). \n\n    Therefore, the condition for the entire string we have is:\n        count_c = (count_a OR count_b)   [meaning: count_c must be either count_a or count_b]\n\n    BUT: note that the entire string we have is the string from A and B plus the appended 'c's. However, the condition is about the string that was given to C (which does not include the 'c's). In that string, the number of 'a' is count_a (since A only put 'a's) and the number of 'b' is count_b (since B appended 'b's). \n\n    Now, wait: what if the string we have has more than just the initial 'a's and 'b's? Actually, no: because the process is fixed: \n        Step 1: A gives a string of 'a's (so let x = count_a)\n        Step 2: B appends y 'b's (so count_b = y)\n        Step 3: C appends z 'c's, where z must be either x or y.\n\n    And then the entire string has x+y+z characters.\n\n    However, the problem gives us the entire string. We must check two things:\n        (a) The string is composed of a block of 'a's, then a block of 'b's, then a block of 'c's.\n        (b) The number of 'c's (z) must be either x or y.\n\n    But note: the entire string we have is the one with the 'c's. How do we recover x and y?\n        x = count_a (the whole string has x 'a's, because no 'a' is added later)\n        y = count_b (the whole string has y 'b's, because no 'b' is added later)\n\n    However, the condition for the 'c's is: z (the number of 'c's) must be either x or y.\n\n    So the conditions are:\n        Condition 1: The string is non-decreasing in the sense of the blocks: no 'b' appears before an 'a', no 'c' appears before a 'b'.\n        Condition 2: The count of 'c' must be equal to either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n    But note: what if there are no 'b's? The problem states that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string after B. So we must have at least one 'b'. Similarly, the string must have at least one 'a' (from A). \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"they have made sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" (after B). So we are guaranteed at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the entire string (without the 'c's). But wait: the entire string we have includes the 'c's. However, the 'a' and 'b' counts are fixed.\n\n    Steps in code:\n\n    Let s = input string.\n\n    Step 1: Check if the string is in the form: zero or more 'a's, then zero or more 'b's, then zero or more 'c's? \n        But note: the problem says at least one 'a' and one 'b' (in the string after B, which means the string without the 'c's must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'). However, the entire string we have might have been extended by 'c's. \n\n    But wait: the condition \"at least one 'a' and one 'b'\" is about the string that B produced (without the 'c's). So the string we have must have at least one 'a' and at least one 'b' (because the 'a's and 'b's are not removed). \n\n    However, note: the problem does not say that the entire string we have must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. It says that the string after B (without the 'c's) has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Since we don't remove anything, the entire string we have has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n    So conditions for the entire string:\n        - Must contain at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'.\n\n    Step 2: Check the order. We can traverse the string and make sure that:\n        - Once we leave 'a's (i.e., see a 'b'), then we cannot have an 'a' again.\n        - Once we leave 'b's (i.e., see a 'c'), then we cannot have a 'b' again.\n\n    Alternatively, we can check:\n        - The string should not have any 'b' followed by an 'a' or 'c' that breaks the order? Actually, we require that the string is split into three contiguous parts.\n\n    We can do:\n        - Find the last occurrence of 'a': all the characters from start to last 'a' must be 'a'.\n        - Then from the next index, if there is a 'b', then all the way until the last 'b' must be 'b'.\n        - Then the rest must be 'c'.\n\n    But note: it is possible that there are no 'b's? No, because the problem states that there is at least one 'b' in the string (after B). So we must have at least one 'b'. \n\n    However, wait: the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b'\", meaning at least one. So the entire string we have must have at least one 'b'. Similarly, at least one 'a'.\n\n    But note: the entire string we have might have been built with the process, but what if the string we have is \"aaa\" (only a's)? Then the condition fails because after B there must be at least one 'b'. So the string must have at least one 'b' and at least one 'a'. \n\n    However, what if the string we have has no 'b'? Then the condition fails. Similarly, no 'a' fails.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'\" -> so at least one 'a'? Actually, the problem says \"consisting of some number\", which could be zero? \n\n    Let me read carefully: \n        \"A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'\" -> this implies the string from A is non-empty? The problem says \"some number\", and typically \"some\" implies at least one. However, the problem also says \"they have made sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" (after B). \n\n    But note: if A gives an empty string (0 'a's), then B appends at least one 'b'. Then the string has at least one 'b' but no 'a'. However, the condition requires at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string (after B). Therefore, A must have given at least one 'a'. \n\n    So the entire string must have at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'.\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n    Let s = input().strip()\n\n    Step 1: Check that the string contains at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. If not, return \"NO\".\n\n    Step 2: Check the order: \n        - Traverse the string and ensure that:\n            * The first character is 'a' (if there is any 'a') or maybe not? Actually, we can have a string that starts with 'b'? No, because A gives the string of 'a's and then B appends 'b's. So the entire string must start with 'a's (unless there are no 'a's, but we know there is at least one 'a').\n\n        We can do:\n            valid = True\n            seen_b = False\n            seen_c = False\n\n            for char in s:\n                if char == 'a':\n                    if seen_b or seen_c:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                elif char == 'b':\n                    if seen_c:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    seen_b = True\n                else: # char == 'c'\n                    seen_c = True\n\n            But note: we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n        Alternatively, we can check that the string is divided into three contiguous blocks. We can find the indices where the letter changes.\n\n    Step 3: Count the frequency of 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n    Step 4: Check that the count of 'c' is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n    However, note: the condition is that the number of 'c' (appended by C) is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string that was given to C (which is the string without the 'c's). \n\n    The string without the 'c's is the entire string we have except the 'c's. But wait, the entire string we have is the one that includes the 'c's. How do we know the string that was given to C? \n\n    The string given to C is the one that results from A and B: which is the entire string we have without the appended 'c's? \n\n    Actually, no: the process is:\n        Original A: \"a\"*x\n        Then B appends \"b\"*y -> so the string given to C is \"a\"*x + \"b\"*y.\n\n    Then C appends \"c\"*z, where z is either x or y.\n\n    Therefore, the entire string we have is \"a\"*x + \"b\"*y + \"c\"*z.\n\n    And note: the entire string we have has:\n        count_a = x\n        count_b = y\n        count_c = z\n\n    And the condition is: z must be either x or y.\n\n    So the condition is simply: \n        count_c == count_a   OR   count_c == count_b\n\n    But wait: what if the string we have is not broken into three contiguous blocks? Then even if the counts satisfy, the order is wrong and we must return \"NO\".\n\n    Example: \n        Input: \"bbacc\"\n\n        This example is given as output \"NO\".\n\n        Why? Because the order is incorrect. The string \"bbacc\" has:\n            'b' then 'b' then 'a' -> that breaks the order (we see an 'a' after a 'b').\n\n    Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n        Condition 1: The string must have at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'.\n        Condition 2: The string must be in the form: [a...a][b...b][c...c] (three contiguous blocks, with the first block being non-empty and the second block being non-empty).\n        Condition 3: The count of 'c' must be either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the string after B (without the 'c's) must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Condition 1 above ensures that the entire string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. But note: the entire string has the same 'a's and 'b's as the string given to C. So the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the entire string are the same as in the string given to C.\n\n    Therefore, we can do:\n\n        if there is no 'a' or no 'b' in the string: NO.\n\n        Check the contiguous blocks: \n            We can use:\n                if s != ''.join(sorted(s)):\n                    Then the order is not non-decreasing? But wait: the string must be in the order a, then b, then c. And sorted(s) would give ['a','a',...] then ['b','b',...] then ['c','c',...]. But note: the string might be \"aaabbbccc\", then sorted(s) is \"aaabbbccc\", which is the same. But if the string is \"abc\", then sorted(s) is \"abc\", same. However, if the string is \"aacccbb\", then sorted(s) is \"aacccbb\" -> wait, no: sorted(s) would put the 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. So if the string is \"aacccbb\", then sorted(s) is \"aaacccb\" (if the original has two 'a's, then three 'c's, then two 'b's) but wait the original string is \"aacccbb\", which is not sorted. \n\n        Alternatively, we can check by:\n\n            # Extract the blocks: \n            blocks = []\n            current = s[0]\n            count = 1\n            for i in range(1, len(s)):\n                if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                    count += 1\n                else:\n                    blocks.append((s[i-1], count))\n                    count = 1\n            blocks.append((s[-1], count))\n\n            Then we should have exactly three distinct letters in order? Actually, we might have less than three distinct letters. But note: we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', and possibly 'c'. \n\n            We require that the distinct letters in the string are either {'a','b','c'} or a subset. But the condition says the string is built by the process. \n\n            However, the process produces a string that may have all three, or only two if there are no 'c's? But wait, the problem says C appends some number of 'c's (which could be zero? Actually, the problem says \"some number\", which typically implies at least one? But note: the condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", and if the number of 'a' is 0 then that wouldn't be allowed (but we know there's at least one 'a'). However, the problem does not explicitly say C appends at least one 'c', but note: the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' (which is at least one) or the number of 'b' (which is at least one). So the number of 'c' must be at least one? Actually, yes: because the number of 'a' is at least one and the number of 'b' is at least one, and the appended 'c' is set to one of these numbers (so at least one). \n\n            But wait: what if the number of 'a' is 0? Then we don't consider that because the string must have at least one 'a'. Similarly, if the number of 'b' is 0, then we don't consider that because the string must have at least one 'b'. \n\n            However, note: the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the counts for 'a' and 'b' are at least one, so the number of 'c' (which is set to one of these) is at least one.\n\n            But wait: the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b'\", which means at least one. And A gives at least one 'a'. Then C appends a number of 'c' which is either the number of 'a' (>=1) or the number of 'b' (>=1). So the total 'c' is at least one.\n\n            Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'? Actually, no: because the condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. So if the number of 'a' is 3 and the number of 'b' is 5, then C appends 3 or 5, so the string must have 3 or 5 'c's. \n\n            However, note: the problem says \"C appends some number\", and the condition is set by the count of 'a' or 'b'. But the problem does not specify that C must append at least one. Actually, the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. If the number of 'a' is 0, then we don't consider that option (but we already know there's at least one 'a'). So the condition is defined. \n\n            But note: the problem does not say that C appends at least one 'c'. However, if the number of 'a' is 0 then the condition would require the number of 'c' to be 0 (if we consider the other option) but the problem states that the string after B has at least one 'a' and one 'b', so we don't have that situation.\n\n            Therefore, we can assume the entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Not necessarily: because the condition for the 'c' is set by the counts of 'a' and 'b'. But note: the condition is that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. Since the number of 'a' and 'b' are at least one, then the number of 'c' is at least one. So the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n            But wait: the problem says \"C appends some number\", and \"some number\" can be zero? The problem statement: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string\". The word \"some\" in programming problems often allows zero. However, the condition says the number must be equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. So if the number of 'a' is 0, then we cannot use that, but we know there's at least one 'a'. Similarly for 'b'. \n\n            However, note: the problem states that the string we have is built by the process. The process includes C appending the 'c's. So if the condition is satisfied (the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b') then the number of 'c' is positive (because the number of 'a' and 'b' are positive). \n\n            But wait: what if the number of 'a' is 0? Then we don't have that string. Similarly, the problem states that the string after B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we are safe.\n\n            However, note: the problem says the string we have is the entire string. So if the condition is met, then the number of 'c' is positive.\n\n        But wait: the example input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n        Example 1: \"aaabccc\": \n            a:3, b:1, c:3 -> condition: 3==3 (a) -> true, but also 3==1? false. So one condition holds.\n\n        Example 2: \"bbacc\": \n            This string has no contiguous blocks: \n                b, then b, then a -> invalid.\n\n        Example 3: \"aabc\": \n            a:2, b:1, c:1 -> condition: 1==2? no, 1==1? yes. So condition holds.\n\n            Now, check the order: \n                'a','a','b','c' -> valid.\n\n        Therefore, the plan:\n\n            Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. If not, print \"NO\".\n\n            Step 2: Check that the string is in the form: [a...][b...][c...]. We can do:\n\n                i = 0\n                # Read all consecutive 'a's\n                while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a':\n                    i += 1\n                # Then read all consecutive 'b's\n                j = i\n                while j < len(s) and s[j]=='b':\n                    j += 1\n                # Then read the rest, which must be 'c's\n                k = j\n                while k < len(s) and s[k]=='c':\n                    k += 1\n\n                # Now, if we have consumed the entire string and the intermediate parts are non-empty?\n                if k != len(s):\n                    # There are some characters left that are not 'c'\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n                # Also, the part of 'a' must be non-empty and the part of 'b' must be non-empty.\n                if i == 0 or j == len(s) or i == len(s): # Actually, we broke the condition: \n                    # We require that the 'a' part is non-empty and the 'b' part is non-empty.\n                    # In our reading, we started at index0 and moved i to the first non-'a'. Then from i we read 'b's until j. Then from j we read 'c's until k.\n\n                    # Conditions for the blocks:\n                    #   The 'a' block must be non-empty: so we must have read at least one 'a'. That is, i should not be 0 at the beginning? Actually, we start at 0 and read until we hit a non-'a'. If the string starts with non-'a', then i remains 0, meaning no 'a' was read. But we already checked that the string has at least one 'a'. So this method must account for that.\n\n                    # Actually, if the string has at least one 'a', then i will be at least 1 (because we read at least one 'a')? Not exactly: if the string is \"a\", then i becomes 1 (index after the 'a').\n\n                    # Conditions: \n                    #   We require that the 'a' block is non-empty: so we must have read at least one 'a'. Similarly, the 'b' block must be non-empty.\n\n                    # We can check:\n                    if i == 0: # meaning we didn't read any 'a'\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n                    if j == len(s): # meaning we didn't read any 'b'\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n\n            Step 3: Count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c'. \n                count_a = i   # because we read i 'a's (from index0 to i-1)\n                count_b = j - i   # from index i to j-1\n                count_c = len(s) - j\n\n            Step 4: Check that count_c is either count_a or count_b.\n\n            However, note: the condition is that the number of 'c' (which is count_c) must be equal to the number of 'a' (count_a) OR the number of 'b' (count_b). \n\n            But wait: the entire string we have has count_a 'a's, count_b 'b's, and count_c 'c's.\n\n            However, the condition is about the string that was given to C (without the 'c's). The string given to C has count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's. The condition says the number of 'c' appended (which is count_c) must be equal to the number of 'a' (which is count_a) OR the number of 'b' (which is count_b). \n\n            So we check: \n                if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        But wait: what if the string has no 'c'? Then we would have read the entire string in the 'a' and 'b' blocks, and then the remaining part (for 'c') would be 0. Then we would have k==len(s) and then count_c=0. Then condition: 0==count_a? (which is at least 1) -> no, 0==count_b? (at least 1) -> no. So it returns \"NO\", which is correct because the condition requires the number of 'c' to be the number of 'a' or 'b' (which are positive). \n\n        However, note: the problem states that the string is built by the process, which includes C appending 'c's. But if the condition is met, then the number of 'c' is positive. But the problem doesn't say that the string must have 'c's. Actually, the problem says \"C appends some number\", and the condition is that the number of 'c' is the number of 'a' or 'b'. Since the number of 'a' and 'b' are positive, then the number of 'c' must be positive. \n\n        Therefore, we must have at least one 'c'. \n\n        However, note: the example \"aabc\" has one 'c'. \n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"aaabccc\"\n            i: reads the first 3 'a's -> i=3\n            then from index3: reads 'b' (one 'b') -> j=4\n            then from index4: reads 3 'c's -> k=7, which is the end.\n\n            Conditions: \n                i>0 -> yes (3>0)\n                j != len(s) -> 4 != 7 -> no, but we require the 'b' part is non-empty: j-i = 1, which is >0 -> so condition holds.\n\n            Count: \n                count_a = 3\n                count_b = 1\n                count_c = 3\n\n            Condition: 3==3 OR 3==1 -> true.\n\n        Example 2: \"bbacc\"\n            We try to read the 'a' block: \n                The first character is 'b', so the while loop for 'a' doesn't run -> i=0.\n            Then we check: if i==0 -> then we return \"NO\".\n\n        Example 3: \"aabc\"\n            i: reads two 'a's -> i=2\n            then reads one 'b' -> j=3\n            then reads one 'c' -> k=4, which is the end.\n\n            Conditions: i>0 -> yes, and the 'b' part: from index2 to 3-1 (index2) is one 'b' -> non-empty.\n\n            Counts: \n                count_a = 2\n                count_b = 1\n                count_c = 1\n\n            Condition: 1==2 -> no, 1==1 -> yes.\n\n        Example 4: \"aaa\" -> fails the first condition (no 'b') -> NO.\n\n        Example 5: \"bbb\" -> fails the first condition (no 'a') -> NO.\n\n        Example 6: \"ab\" -> \n            Step 1: has at least one 'a' and one 'b' -> yes.\n            Step 2: \n                Read 'a's: i=1 (read one 'a')\n                Then read 'b's: j=2 (read one 'b')\n                Then read 'c's: k=2, which is the end. So the string is \"ab\", which is two characters. Then count_c=0.\n                Condition: 0==1 (count_a) -> no, 0==1 (count_b) -> no -> NO.\n\n        Example 7: \"aabbb\" -> \n            Step 1: has at least one 'a' and one 'b' -> yes.\n            Step 2: \n                Read 'a': i=2 (two 'a's)\n                Read 'b': j=5 (three 'b's)\n                Then no 'c': k=5, which is the end. Count_c=0 -> condition fails.\n\n        Example 8: \"aabbcc\" -> \n            Step 1: has 'a' and 'b'\n            Step 2: \n                i=2 (two 'a's)\n                j=4 (two 'b's)\n                k=6 (two 'c's) -> entire string consumed.\n\n            Counts: \n                count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2 -> condition: 2==2 OR 2==2 -> YES.\n\n        Example 9: \"aabbccc\" -> \n            Step 1: has 'a' and 'b'\n            Step 2: \n                i=2, j=4, then k=7 (so three 'c's) -> entire string consumed.\n\n            Counts: \n                count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=3 -> condition: 3==2 or 3==2 -> NO.\n\n        Example 10: \"aaabbbccc\" -> \n            counts: a=3, b=3, c=3 -> condition holds.\n\n        Example 11: \"aaabbbc\" -> \n            This string: \"aaabbbc\" (note: one missing 'c' at the end? Actually, the example is \"aaabbbc\", so the last part is not all 'c's? \n            Step 2: \n                Read 'a': i=3\n                Read 'b': j=8 (because the string is 7 characters long? Let me count: \"aaabbbc\" has 7 characters: \n                    indices: 0:a,1:a,2:a,3:b,4:b,5:b,6:c -> wait, then the 'c' is at the last, but then we break the contiguous block? Actually, no: the last character is 'c', but the previous is 'b', so the 'c' is alone. \n\n            Our method for step2: \n                We read the first three 'a's -> i=3\n                Then from index3: we read three 'b's -> j=6\n                Then from index6: we read the 'c' -> k=7 (which is beyond the string length? Actually, the string length is 7, so k=7 is the end.\n\n            Then we check: \n                i=3>0, j=6 (so the 'b' part is from index3 to 5, which is 3 'b's, so non-empty) -> okay.\n\n            Counts: \n                count_a=3, count_b=3, count_c=1 -> condition: 1==3 or 1==3 -> NO.\n\n        Example 12: \"aaabbbccc\" -> YES (as above)\n\n        Example 13: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> \n            counts: a=4, b=3, c=3 -> condition: 3==4? no, 3==3? yes -> YES.\n\n        Example 14: \"aaaabbbcccc\" -> \n            counts: a=4, b=3, c=4 -> condition: 4==4 or 4==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example 15: \"aaaabbbcc\" -> \n            counts: a=4, b=3, c=2 -> condition: 2==4 or 2==3 -> NO.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" and the condition is satisfied by the number of 'c' being the number of 'b'? Then it's YES.\n\n        However, note: the condition is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string that was given to C. The string that was given to C is \"aaaabbb\", which has 4 'a's and 3 'b's. Then C appends 3 'c's (because 3 is the number of 'b')? Then the entire string is \"aaaabbbccc\", and the condition is satisfied.\n\n        But wait: the entire string has 4 'a's, 3 'b's, and 3 'c's. The condition is about the string given to C (without the 'c's) having 4 'a's and 3 'b's, and the number of 'c' appended is 3, which equals the number of 'b's (3). So it's correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n            # Check the contiguous blocks\n            i = 0\n            n = len(s)\n            # Read all 'a's\n            while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n            # Now, from i, read all 'b's\n            j = i\n            while j < n and s[j]=='b':\n                j += 1\n            # Now, from j, read all 'c's\n            k = j\n            while k < n and s[k]=='c':\n                k += 1\n\n            # If we did not read the entire string, then there's an invalid character or mixed order.\n            if k != n:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n            # Check that we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n            if i == 0 or j - i == 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n            count_a = i\n            count_b = j - i\n            count_c = k - j   # which is n - j\n\n            if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    However, note: the condition for the entire string must have at least one 'c'?",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's, B appends some 'b's, and C appends a number of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string before appending. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the string must adhere to a specific order (all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's), and the count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of 'a' and 'b':** The string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b' as per the problem's requirements.\n2. **Validate String Order:** The string should be divided into three contiguous blocks: one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, followed by one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n3. **Check Count Condition:** The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This ensures that C appended the correct number of 'c's as per the problem's conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    n = len(s)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    j = i\n    while j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n        j += 1\n        \n    k = j\n    while k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n        k += 1\n        \n    if k != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if i == 0 or j - i == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = i\n    count_b = j - i\n    count_c = n - j\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check:** The code first checks if the string contains at least one 'a' and one 'b'. If not, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n2. **Order Validation:** The code then verifies that the string consists of contiguous blocks of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. If any part of the string does not follow this order, it outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Count Validation:** After confirming the correct order, the code checks if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, it outputs \"YES\"; otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical conditions required by the problem, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
