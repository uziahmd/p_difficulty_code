    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers: A, B, C, D (with 1 <= A <= B <= C <= D <= 500000)\n\n We are to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= D\n\n And the triangle is non-degenerate, meaning that the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third.\n\n However, note that the triangle condition for sides (x, y, z) is:\n   x + y > z\n   x + z > y   [But note: since x<=y<=z, then x+z>y is automatically true because x+y>=x+z? Let's think: Actually, since x<=y<=z, then x+z >= y+z >= y+y > y? Not necessarily. But note: the condition x+z>y is always true if x,y,z are positive and x<=y<=z because x+z >= y+z >= y+y = 2y, and 2y>y. Similarly, y+z>x is obvious. So the only non-trivial condition is x+y>z.\n\n Therefore, we require x+y>z.\n\n We have:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]   (because B<=y<=C)\n   z in [C, D]\n\n Since the constraints on A,B,C,D can be up to 500000, we cannot iterate over all possible x, y, z.\n\n Instead, we can fix x and y and determine the range of z that satisfies the triangle condition.\n\n But note: the condition is x+y>z. Since z is at least C and at most D, we require:\n   z < x+y\n\n So for fixed x and y, the valid z must be in the interval [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\n However, note that we also have the constraint that z must be at least C and at most D. So the number of z for fixed (x,y) is:\n   max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)   [if min(D, x+y-1) >= C, otherwise 0]\n\n Then the total number would be the sum over x from A to B, and for each x, sum over y from B to C, of the above.\n\n But note: the ranges for x and y can be up to 500000, so the double loop would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which can be up to 500000*500000 = 250e9, which is too slow.\n\n We need a more efficient method.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can fix the side z and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C]. However, note that we also have the condition that y must be at least B and at most C, and x from A to B.\n\n Alternatively, we can reframe the condition: For a fixed z, we require x+y > z, but note that x<=B and y<=C, so we require x+y > z. But also note that x>=A, y>=B.\n\n However, we must remember that the same z must be in [C, D].\n\n But note: the condition for a fixed z is: x+y > z, and we have:\n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C]\n\n But note: the problem does not require to fix z first. However, we can change the order.\n\n But wait: the original problem has three variables. We can try to count by iterating over z first? Then we need to count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, and then for each z from C to D.\n\n However, the condition x+y>z is independent of the ordering. But note: the ranges for x and y are fixed.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the total pairs (x,y) that satisfy A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C without the triangle condition: that's (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). But we don't want that, we want to subtract the pairs that do not satisfy x+y>z.\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can use the idea of counting pairs (x,y) such that x+y <= z, and then subtract from the total pairs (for the entire x,y range) for each z.\n\n However, note that the condition for the triangle is that for each (x,y,z) we require x+y>z. But if we fix z, then we require that (x,y) must have x+y>z. The set of (x,y) is independent of z? Actually, no: for different z, the condition changes.\n\n But note: we are iterating over z from C to D, and for each z we consider the pairs (x,y) that are in [A,B]x[B,C]. Then the condition for a particular z is x+y>z.\n\n However, note that the same (x,y) pair might be used for multiple z (as long as z < x+y) but in our counting we are fixing z and then counting the pairs that satisfy x+y>z.\n\n Then the overall count would be:\n\n   total = 0\n   for z from C to D:\n        count_z = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]\n        total += count_z\n\n But how to compute count_z quickly?\n\n We can precompute the set of pairs (x,y) that are in [A,B]x[B,C] and then for each z, we want the pairs with x+y>z.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute an array for all possible sums s = x+y (from min_sum = A+B to max_sum = B+C) and then for each z, we want the number of pairs with x+y > z.\n\n But note: the total number of pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be up to 250e9, so we cannot iterate over each pair.\n\n We need to use two pointers or cumulative sums.\n\n Steps for the alternative:\n\n   Let F(s) = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y = s.\n\n   Then for a fixed z, the condition is s > z, so we need the sum_{s=z+1}^{max_sum} F(s).\n\n   We can precompute F(s) for s from low = A+B to high = B+C.\n\n   How to compute F(s)? \n        For a fixed s, x can be from max(A, s-C) to min(B, s-B) [because y>=B and y<=C, so s-x must be in [B, C] => x in [s-C, s-B] and also x in [A, B]]\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over x and then for each x, the y must be in [B, C] and also y = s-x, so for each x, the valid y are from max(B, s-x_min) to min(C, s-x_max)? \n\n   Actually, we can use two pointers or a mathematical formula.\n\n   Let me define:\n        s_min = A+B\n        s_max = B+C\n\n   Then for a fixed s, the number of x in [A, B] such that y = s-x is in [B, C] is:\n        x must be in [s-C, s-B] (since y=s-x must be between B and C) and also x in [A, B].\n\n        So x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\n        Then the count for s is: max(0, min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1)   [if the lower bound is <= upper bound, else 0]\n\n   Then we can precompute an array F for s from s_min to s_max.\n\n   Then we build a prefix sum array for F: let G(s) = F(s) + F(s-1) + ... + F(low) [but we want to do from s_min to s_max, and then for a given z, we want the sum from s=z+1 to s_max of F(s)].\n\n   Then total_triangles = sum_{z=C}^{D} [ sum_{s=z+1}^{s_max} F(s) ]\n\n   But note: the same (x,y) pair may be used for multiple z. However, that is correct because the problem counts each (x,y,z) separately.\n\n   However, note that the condition for a fixed (x,y) is that z must be less than x+y and at least C and at most D. So for fixed (x,y) with sum s, the z must be in [C, min(D, s-1)]. Then the contribution of (x,y) is max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) if min(D, s-1) >= C.\n\n   Then the total is: \n        total = 0\n        for x from A to B:\n            for y from B to C:   # This is too slow.\n\n   So we need to avoid iterating over x and y.\n\n   Another way: we can use the fixed s and then for each s, the number of z for that s is: \n        z_range = [C, min(D, s-1)]\n        count_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)   [if min(D, s-1) >= C, else 0]\n\n   Then the total is: sum_{s = s_min}^{s_max} [ F(s) * count_z(s) ]\n\n   But note: the condition for (x,y) is that x+y = s, and then for each such (x,y) we can choose any z in [C, min(D, s-1)].\n\n   However, wait: is that correct? Actually, the problem requires that z is in [C, D] and the triangle condition is x+y>z (so z < s). So the number of z for a fixed (x,y) is indeed the number of integers in [C, min(D, s-1)].\n\n   But note: the same (x,y) gives one fixed s, so we can write:\n\n        total = 0\n        for s from s_min to s_max:\n            num_pairs = F(s)   [number of (x,y) pairs with x+y = s]\n            num_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)   [if min(D, s-1) >= C, else 0]\n            total += num_pairs * num_z\n\n   Now, how to compute F(s) for s from s_min to s_max?\n\n        s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C\n\n        For a fixed s, the condition for x is:\n            x must be in [A, B] and y = s-x must be in [B, C].\n            => x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)]\n\n        So the number of x (and hence pairs) is:\n            low_x = max(A, s-C)\n            high_x = min(B, s-B)\n\n            If low_x <= high_x, then F(s) = high_x - low_x + 1, else 0.\n\n   Then we can iterate s from s_min to s_max and compute F(s) and then the total.\n\n   However, the range of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C - A + 1) which can be up to 500000, so it's acceptable.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        s_min = A+B\n        s_max = B+C\n\n        total = 0\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n            low_x = max(A, s-C)\n            high_x = min(B, s-B)\n            if low_x <= high_x:\n                num_pairs = high_x - low_x + 1\n            else:\n                num_pairs = 0\n\n            # Now, for this s, the z must be in [C, min(D, s-1)]\n            if s-1 < C:\n                num_z = 0\n            else:\n                num_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\n            total += num_pairs * num_z\n\n   But wait: is that correct? Let me test with the example: \"1 2 3 4\"\n\n        A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4\n\n        s_min = 1+2 = 3, s_max = 2+3=5.\n\n        s=3:\n            low_x = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n            high_x = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n            num_pairs = 1 (which is (1,2) -> but wait: x+y=3, so x=1, y=2. However, note that y must be at least B (which is 2) and at most C (which is 3). So y=2 is valid.\n            Then, num_z = min(4, 3-1)=min(4,2)=2, then from C=3 to 2? -> wait, 3 to 2 is invalid. Actually, condition: s-1=2, and C=3, so 2<3 -> num_z=0.\n\n        s=4:\n            low_x = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n            high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n            num_pairs = 2-1+1 = 2. The pairs: (1,3) and (2,2). Note: (1,3): x=1,y=3; (2,2): x=2,y=2.\n            Then, num_z = min(4,4-1)=3, then from 3 to 3: 3-3+1=1? Actually, we defined: num_z = min(D, s-1)-C+1 = 3-3+1=1.\n\n            So for s=4: 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n        s=5:\n            low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n            high_x = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n            num_pairs = 1. The pair (2,3).\n            Then, num_z = min(4,5-1)=4, then from 3 to 4: 4-3+1=2.\n\n            So for s=5: 1*2=2.\n\n        Total = 0 (from s=3) + 2 (from s=4) + 2 (from s=5) = 4.\n\n        Which matches the example.\n\n        Example 2: \"1 2 2 5\"\n\n        A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5\n\n        s_min = 1+2=3, s_max=2+2=4.\n\n        s=3:\n            low_x = max(1,3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n            high_x = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n            num_pairs = 1 (x=1,y=2)\n            num_z = min(5,3-1)=min(5,2)=2 -> but then [C=2, 2] -> 2 to 2: 1? Actually, wait: condition is z>=C=2 and z<=min(D, s-1)=2, so z in [2,2] -> 1 value.\n            So 1*1 = 1.\n\n        s=4:\n            low_x = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n            high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n            num_pairs = 1 (x=2,y=2)\n            num_z = min(5,4-1)=3 -> then from 2 to 3: 3-2+1=2 values (z=2,3)\n            So 1*2=2.\n\n        Total = 1+2 = 3.\n\n        Example 3: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\n        A=B=C=D=500000\n\n        s_min = 500000+500000=1000000, s_max=500000+500000=1000000.\n\n        s=1000000:\n            low_x = max(500000,1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n            high_x = min(500000,1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000\n            num_pairs = 1.\n\n            num_z = min(500000,1000000-1)=500000, then from 500000 to 500000: 1.\n\n            Total=1.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            Read A, B, C, D\n\n            s_min = A+B\n            s_max = B+C\n\n            total = 0\n            for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n                low_x = max(A, s-C)\n                high_x = min(B, s-B)\n                if low_x > high_x:\n                    num_pairs = 0\n                else:\n                    num_pairs = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n                if s-1 < C:\n                    num_z = 0\n                else:\n                    # z from C to min(D, s-1)\n                    num_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n                    if num_z < 0:\n                        num_z = 0\n\n                total += num_pairs * num_z\n\n            print(total)\n\n   However, note that the range of s is (s_max - s_min + 1) = (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which can be up to 500000, so the loop runs about 500000 times. This is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the constraints say that A,B,C,D can be up to 500000, so the maximum s_max is 1000000 (when B and C are 500000) and s_min is 1000000 (same) so the loop runs only once in that case. However, in worst-case, when A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000, then s_min=500001, s_max=1000000, so about 500000 iterations.\n\n   But wait: the worst-case for the range of s is when A is small and C is large. Specifically, s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C, so the length is (C-A+1) which can be up to 500000 (if A=1 and C=500000, then C-A+1=500000). So the loop runs at most 500000 times, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, note that the problem says that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, and the condition A<=B<=C<=D. So the maximum value of s_max is 1000000 (if B and C are 500000) and minimum is 1+1=2 (if A=B=1, then s_min=2). \n\n   But wait: what if A=1, B=2, C=500000, D=500000? Then s_min=3, s_max=500002, which is 500000 iterations. So worst-case 500000 iterations.\n\n   But note: the example above with A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000: s_min=500001, s_max=1000000, which is 500000 iterations.\n\n   However, we can optimize the computation of F(s) by noticing that the function F(s) is piecewise linear. But the above direct iteration is acceptable for 500000 steps.\n\n   Let me check the example with A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000: \n        s_min = 1+500000 = 500001, s_max=500000+500000=1000000.\n\n        For s in [500001, 1000000]:\n            low_x = max(1, s-500000)\n            high_x = min(500000, s-1)   [because s-B = s-500000, but wait: B is 500000, so s-B = s-500000, and we take min(500000, s-500000). Also, note that s>=500001, so s-500000>=1, so low_x = s-500000 (because s-500000>=1 and >=A=1). \n            Then num_pairs = min(500000, s-500000) - (s-500000) + 1? That doesn't look right.\n\n        Actually, let me break down:\n\n            Condition for x: \n                x >= max(A, s-C) = max(1, s-500000)\n                x <= min(B, s-B) = min(500000, s-500000)\n\n            So for s from 500001 to 1000000, we have:\n                low_x = s-500000   [because s-500000 >= 1 (since s>=500001) and <=500000 (because s<=1000000, then s-500000<=500000)]\n                high_x = s-500000   [because min(500000, s-500000) = s-500000 (since s<=1000000, then s-500000<=500000)]\n\n            Then num_pairs = 1 for each s from 500001 to 1000000? Actually, no: the condition for x is that x must be at least s-500000 and at most s-500000, so only one x.\n\n            Then for each s, num_z = min(500000, s-1) - 500000 + 1, but wait: C=500000, so we require z>=500000 and z<=min(500000, s-1). \n            Since s>=500001, then s-1>=500000, so min(500000, s-1)=500000. Then num_z = 500000-500000+1=1.\n\n            Then total = (1000000-500001+1)*1 = 500000.\n\n            But wait, what is the expected? The example input was \"500000 500000 500000 500000\", but in this case we set A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000. That's a different input.\n\n            In the example input, A=B=C=D=500000, so we should set A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\n            Let me recalc for A=B=C=D=500000:\n\n                s_min = 500000+500000=1000000, s_max=500000+500000=1000000.\n\n                s=1000000:\n                    low_x = max(500000,1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n                    high_x = min(500000,1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000\n                    num_pairs=1\n\n                    num_z = min(500000,1000000-1)=500000, then from 500000 to 500000: 1.\n\n                total=1.\n\n            So the code above works for the example.\n\n   But wait, why did I get 500000 for the other example? Because the input was different. The problem states that A<=B<=C<=D.\n\n   We must ensure that the input satisfies A<=B<=C<=D.\n\n   The code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # but the problem says first line contains four integers\n            exit(0)\n        A = int(data[0]); B = int(data[1]); C = int(data[2]); D = int(data[3])\n\n   Then proceed.\n\n   However, the above approach is O(n) in the range of s, which is about (C-A+1) which is acceptable (up to 500000).\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say that A,B,C,D can be up to 500000, and the range of s is from A+B to B+C, so the number of s is (B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1, which is at most 500000 (since A>=1, C<=500000, so C-A+1 <= 500000). \n\n   However, worst-case: A=1, C=500000, then C-A+1=500000, so we do 500000 iterations.\n\n   But note: in the worst-case, the inner calculations are O(1) per s, so the total time is O(500000) which is acceptable.\n\n   Let me run the example with A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000 (which is the example I did above) and see if it gives 500000.\n\n        s_min = 1+500000 = 500001\n        s_max = 500000+500000 = 1000000\n\n        Then we iterate s from 500001 to 1000000 (inclusive) -> 500000 iterations.\n\n        For each s, we do:\n\n            low_x = max(1, s-500000)\n            high_x = min(500000, s-500000)   [because B=500000, so s-B = s-500000]\n\n            Then for s from 500001 to 1000000, we have:\n                s-500000 is from 1 to 500000.\n\n            Then:\n                low_x = s-500000   (because s-500000>=1 and <=500000)\n                high_x = s-500000   (because s-500000<=500000)\n\n            Then num_pairs = 1.\n\n            Then, num_z = min(500000, s-1) - 500000 + 1   [but wait, C=500000, so the z must be from 500000 to min(500000, s-1). \n\n            Since s>=500001, then s-1>=500000, so min(500000, s-1)=500000.\n\n            Then num_z = 500000-500000+1 = 1.\n\n            Then total += 1 * 1 = 1 for each s.\n\n            So total = 500000.\n\n        But wait, the example input \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" is different. \n\n        The example input \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" gives 1, but the example input \"1 500000 500000 500000\" gives 500000.\n\n        This is correct because the problem says: \n            Input: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" -> Output: 1\n\n        And the input \"1 500000 500000 500000\" is not provided as an example, but the problem does not say it's invalid.\n\n        However, note the condition: A<=B<=C<=D. In the example \"1 500000 500000 500000\", we have 1<=500000<=500000<=500000, which holds.\n\n        But the example output for \"1 500000 500000 500000\" is 500000.\n\n        The problem's example outputs are:\n            ['4', '3', '1']\n\n        So we must output 500000 for the input \"1 500000 500000 500000\".\n\n        However, the problem statement example inputs are only three: \n            \"1 2 3 4\" -> 4\n            \"1 2 2 5\" -> 3\n            \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" -> 1\n\n        Our code for the third example is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify that the input numbers are distinct. \n\n   So the code is:\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n\n        total = 0\n        # If s_min > s_max, then there are no pairs. But by the condition A<=B<=C, we have s_min = A+B <= B+B <= B+C = s_max, so s_min<=s_max.\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n            low_x = max(A, s - C)\n            high_x = min(B, s - B)   # Wait: here, s-B is the maximum value for y (since y<=C, but we are using y=s-x, and x<=B so s-x>=s-B, but actually we are constraining x by [A,B] and y=s-x by [B,C] -> then x must be at least s-C and at most s-B. However, note: the condition for x is: \n            # Actually, the condition for x is: \n            #   x in [A, B] and y=s-x in [B, C]  <=> \n            #   s-x >= B and s-x <= C  <=> x <= s-B and x>= s-C.\n            # So the upper bound for x is min(B, s-B) and the lower bound is max(A, s-C).\n\n            if low_x > high_x:\n                num_pairs = 0\n            else:\n                num_pairs = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n            # Now, for z: must be in [C, min(D, s-1)] and also note that s-1 must be at least C (otherwise no z)\n            if s-1 < C:\n                num_z = 0\n            else:\n                # z from C to min(D, s-1)\n                num_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n                # But if min(D, s-1) < C, then num_z becomes negative? We already checked s-1>=C, so min(D, s-1)>=C? Not necessarily: if D < C, but by condition D>=C (since A<=B<=C<=D), so D>=C. And s-1>=C, so min(D, s-1) is at least C? Actually, no: if s-1 >= D, then min(D, s-1)=D, and D>=C, so then min(D, s-1)>=C. If s-1 < D, then min(D, s-1)=s-1, and we know s-1>=C, so yes, min(D, s-1) is at least C. So we don't need the if, but the above if for s-1>=C ensures that we don't go negative.\n\n            total += num_pairs * num_z\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: in the condition for high_x, we wrote `min(B, s-B)`. But note: s-B is the condition from y>=B: because y = s-x >= B  => x <= s-B. And also x<=B. So the upper bound is min(B, s-B). \n\n   But is that correct? \n\n        Example: s=5, B=2, then s-B=3, so min(2,3)=2. Then x can be at most 2, which is correct because if x=3 then y=2, but x=3 is not allowed because B=2 (x<=B=2). \n\n   But wait: in the example \"1 2 3 4\", for s=5, we had x from 2 to 2 (because min(B, s-B)=min(2,3)=2 and max(A, s-C)=max(1,5-3)=2). \n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the upper bound is min(B, s-B). But note that s-B might be very large (if s is large) but we are bounded by B. \n\n   Let me test with the example \"1 2 3 4\" for s=5: \n        low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n        high_x = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2 -> correct.\n\n   But wait: in the condition for the lower bound, we used s-C. Is that correct?\n\n        Condition: y = s-x <= C  => x >= s-C.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   One more example: \"1 2 2 5\" (example 2):\n\n        A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5\n\n        s_min=3, s_max=4.\n\n        s=3:\n            low_x = max(1,3-2)=1\n            high_x = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> num_pairs=1\n            num_z:",

A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is strictly greater than the third side. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we need an optimized mathematical solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle with sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) (where \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\)), the only non-trivial condition to check is \\(x + y > z\\). This is because \\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\) are automatically satisfied when \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\), the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) can be determined by checking the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\) and \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\) with \\(y = s - x\\). The valid \\(x\\) values must lie within \\([max(A, s - C), min(B, s - B)]\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each sum \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\), compute the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs. Then, for each such pair, determine the number of valid \\(z\\) values (from \\(C\\) to \\(min(D, s - 1)\\)) that satisfy \\(z < s\\).
