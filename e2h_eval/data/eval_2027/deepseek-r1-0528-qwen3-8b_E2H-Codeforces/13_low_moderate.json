For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (from 0 to 11) to represent the semitone in the 12-note system.\n    Let mapping: \n        C -> 0, \n        C# -> 1, \n        D -> 2, \n        D# -> 3, \n        E -> 4, \n        F -> 5, \n        F# -> 6, \n        G -> 7, \n        G# -> 8, \n        A -> 9, \n        B -> 10, \n        H -> 11\n\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we have to consider all permutations (orderings) of the three notes.\n\n 3. For a given ordering [a, b, c] (each note mapped to a number), we can compute the distances (in semitones) between consecutive notes, wrapping around the circle (so modulo 12).\n\n    However, note: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (because going from E to the next C would be E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->C: 8 steps). But wait: the example says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", but in our cyclic system, we have:\n\n    Actually, we need to define the distance as the smallest nonnegative steps? But note: the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". However, when we are given unordered notes, we can arrange them in increasing order (with wrap-around) but note that the example for minor: \"C# B F\" is ordered as \"B C# F\".\n\n    How to compute the distance from note a to note b?\n        We can map the two notes to numbers, then the distance from a to b (without wrap) is (b - a) mod 12? But wait, the example: from E (4) to C (0) is 8 semitones because 0 - 4 = -4, then we add 12 -> 8.\n\n    Alternatively, we can think: the circle has 12 notes. The distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12, but if negative we add 12. Then the actual distance in the forward direction (without going backwards) is (b - a) % 12, but if negative we adjust.\n\n    However, note: the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest. But when we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily, we must consider the circular nature.\n\n    Actually, the definition: \"distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone\" and the example: from C to E is 4, from E to C is 8. So the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12, but if the result is negative we add 12, and then take the minimum between that and 12 - that? \n\n    But wait, the example: from E to C: \n        E=4, C=0: (0-4) mod 12 = -4 mod 12 = 8 (if we do modulo arithmetic correctly: (0-4) % 12 gives 8 in Python). \n\n    However, note: the problem does not use the shortest distance. It uses the distance along the musical scale from the lower note to the higher note, even if that goes beyond the octave. But wait: the problem says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", meaning they are taking the long way? Actually, no: in music theory, when we say the distance from E to C, we usually mean the diatonic or chromatic steps without implying direction? But the problem states: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so they are ordering the notes.\n\n    Therefore, when we have three notes, we should consider all cyclic shifts and also the linear order (but the circle is 12, so we can have multiple ways to arrange three points on a circle). However, the problem says: we can order the notes so that the first condition holds.\n\n    Steps for checking a major triad:\n        We need to check if there exists an ordering (a, b, c) such that:\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12   # This gives the distance from a to b in the positive direction (which might be more than 6, but we don't care because we are going in the circle)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither (classified as \"strange\"). The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number from 0 to 11 based on its position in the chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Checking All Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations (orderings) to consider every potential sequence.\n3. **Calculating Intervals**: For each permutation, compute the intervals (distances in semitones) between consecutive notes. The interval from the first to the second note and the second to the third note must be 4 semitones and 3 semitones respectively for a major chord, or 3 semitones and 4 semitones for a minor chord.\n4. **Modulo Operation for Circular Scale**: Since the musical scale is circular (after H comes C again), use modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the wrap-around correctly when calculating intervals between notes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_input = input().split()\n    note_to_num = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    nums = [note_to_num[note] for note in notes_input]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(nums):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes, which are split into a list for processing.\n2. **Note Mapping**: Each note is converted to its corresponding numerical value using a predefined dictionary (`note_to_num`).\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code checks all permutations of the three notes to explore every possible ordering.\n4. **Interval Calculation**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale. If any permutation satisfies the major chord condition (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones), `found_major` is set to `True`. Similarly, the minor chord condition (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones) sets `found_minor` to `True`.\n5. **Result Determination**: Based on the flags `found_major` and `found_minor`, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if neither condition is met.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type accurately.",
