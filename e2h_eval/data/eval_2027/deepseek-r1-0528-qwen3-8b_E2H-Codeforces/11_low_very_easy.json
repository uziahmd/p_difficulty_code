A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total milliliters of drink: total_drink = k * l\n    Each toast requires nl milliliters. So, the number of toasts from drink = total_drink // nl\n\n 2. Calculate the total lime slices: total_lime_slices = c * d\n    Each toast requires 1 slice. So, the number of toasts from lime = total_lime_slices\n\n 3. Calculate the salt requirement: Each toast requires np grams. The available salt is p grams.\n    So, the number of toasts from salt = p // np\n\n 4. The limiting factor is the minimum of these three values.\n\n 5. However, note that each friend must have the same amount and they are making toasts together.\n    But the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for each toast they make?\n    Actually, the problem states: \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n    However, note that when making multiple toasts, the requirement per toast is as above, but for the entire group? \n    Let me clarify from the example:\n\n    Example 1: Input '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n        Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> 20 / 3 (nl) = 6.66... -> 6 toasts (floor division)\n        Lime: 10*8 = 80 slices -> 80 toasts\n        Salt: 100 / 1 = 100 toasts\n\n        Then the answer is min(6, 80, 100) // 3? But wait, the example does: min(6,80,100) / 3 -> 6/3=2.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n    This means that for one toast, the entire group (n friends) would need n * nl milliliters? Or does each friend individually require that?\n\n    But the example calculation: \n        They say: \"the overall ... 20/3 = 6 toasts\", meaning that the entire group can make 6 toasts? \n\n    Actually, reading the problem again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n    This implies that if one friend makes one toast, then that friend uses nl ml, one lime slice, and np grams of salt.\n\n    But wait, the problem says \"each friend\" for a toast. Then if they are making toasts, and each toast is consumed by one friend, then the requirements per toast are as above.\n\n    However, the example calculation uses the total drink divided by nl (not multiplied by n). \n\n    Let me reexamine the example: \n        There are 3 friends. They want to make toasts and each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n        How many toasts can each friend make? \n\n        Conditions for a toast for a single friend: requires nl ml, 1 slice, np grams.\n\n        For all friends to have the same number of toasts, say x, then we require:\n            Total drink needed: 3 * x * nl <= 4 * 5   => x <= (4*5) / (3*nl) = 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> so x can be at most 2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n            Each toast (for one friend) requires nl ml, so for x toasts per friend, the total drink required is n * x * nl.\n            Similarly, total lime required: n * x * 1 (since each toast requires one slice and there are n friends each having x slices)\n            And total salt: n * x * np.\n\n        Then the constraints are:\n            n * x * nl <= k * l   => x <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n            n * x <= c * d         => x <= (c * d) / n\n            n * x * np <= p        => x <= p / (n * np)\n\n        Then the answer is the floor of the minimum of these.\n\n        But wait, in the example: \n            n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n            Drink: x <=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then determine how many toasts each friend can make based on these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made such that each friend consumes the same amount. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt. The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total amount of each resource (drink, lime slices, salt).\n   - Determining how many toasts can be made based on each resource.\n   - Finding the minimum number of toasts possible across all resources.\n   - Dividing this minimum by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The limiting factor is the resource that allows the fewest toasts. For example, if the drink only allows 5 toasts but limes allow 100, then the drink is the limiting factor. Each friend can then make at most the floor of the total toasts divided by the number of friends.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves straightforward arithmetic operations:\n   - Multiplication to compute total resources.\n   - Division to determine the number of toasts each resource can support.\n   - Taking the minimum of these values and dividing by the number of friends (using floor division).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The operations involved are basic arithmetic operations (multiplication and division) which are constant time operations. Hence, the solution is efficient with O(1) time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl\n    \n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices\n    \n    max_toasts_salt = p // np\n    \n    min_toasts = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    \n    result = min_toasts // n\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read as a single line of space-separated integers. These integers represent the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Resource Calculation**: \n   - **Total Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles (k) by the milliliters per bottle (l) to get the total drink available.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes (c) by the slices per lime (d) to get the total lime slices available.\n   - **Salt Usage**: Divide the total salt (p) by the salt required per toast (np) to determine the maximum toasts possible with the available salt.\n3. **Limiting Factor**: The minimum value among the toasts calculated from drink, lime, and salt determines the overall maximum toasts possible.\n4. **Result Calculation**: Divide the minimum number of toasts by the number of friends (n) using floor division to ensure each friend can make an equal number of toasts.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures the constraints are met for each friend to have an equal number of toasts.",
