And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, the average is the sum of the k consecutive days divided by k.\n But note: the problem says \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks\", meaning we have to compute the average for each week and then what? Actually, reading the example: \n Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. Then the averages are (3+4)/2 = 3.5 and (4+7)/2 = 5.5.\n However, the example output is '9.0000000000'. \n\n Let me re-read: \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n Actually, the example in the problem says: \n   \"the result is\" ... but the example output is 9.0.\n\n Wait, let's check: \n   There are two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The total sleep time for the two weeks is 3+4 + 4+7 = 3+4+4+7 = 18. Then, if we are to compute the average over the two weeks, we would do 18 / 2 = 9.0.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks\". \n\n Another way to think: \n   Each week's average is computed, then we take the average of these averages?\n\n However, note that the example output is 9.0, which is the total sleep over all days (if we count each day only once) divided by the number of weeks? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n The total sleep time over all days is not simply the same as the total over all weeks because the middle day (the second day) is counted twice.\n\n Actually, we can also think of it as:\n\n   We have n-k+1 weeks. Each week i (from 0 to n-k) has average (sum_i) / k.\n\n Then the overall average is the average of these averages?\n\n But note: \n   Overall average = ( (sum_1)/k + (sum_2)/k + ... + (sum_{n-k+1})/k ) / (n-k+1)\n\n This is the same as: (sum_1 + sum_2 + ... + sum_{n-k+1}) / [k * (n-k+1)]\n\n However, note that the entire array is covered, but the first k-1 days and the last k-1 days are only partially covered? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a different approach:\n\n   Total sleep time from all weeks = (a1 + a2 + ... + ak) + (a2 + a3 + ... + a_{k+1}) + ... + (a_{n-k+1} + ... + an)\n\n   This can be rewritten as:\n        = a1*1 + a2*2 + ... + a_{k}*(k) terms? Actually, the first day appears in 1 week, the second day appears in 2 weeks, ... until the k-th day appears in k weeks, then the next day (k+1) appears in k weeks, etc.\n\n   Actually, the pattern is:\n        The first k-1 days and the last k-1 days appear in (k) weeks? Let me index from 0 to n-1.\n\n   The element at position i (0-indexed) will appear in the weeks starting from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(n-k, i) + 1? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a sliding window and precompute prefix sums.\n\n   Let S = total sleep from all weeks = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (sum of a[i:i+k])\n\n   Then the overall average is (S) / (n-k+1) ?\n\n   But wait, the example: \n        n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n        S = (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18.\n        Then overall average = 18 / (3-2+1) = 18/2 = 9.0.\n\n   So the problem is: we are to compute the average of the entire set of weeks, where each week is considered and we average the weeks.\n\n   But note: the problem statement says: \"average sleeping time over all weeks\", meaning we take the average of the weekly averages? \n\n   However, observe: \n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. Each week is defined as a contiguous block of `k` days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks. The goal is to compute the average sleep time across all these weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing multiple overlapping windows of size `k` in an array of `n` elements. For each window, we compute the sum of its elements, then average these sums across all windows. The challenge is to efficiently compute the total sum of all window sums without recalculating each window from scratch, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The key observation is that each element in the array appears in multiple windows. Specifically, elements near the start or end of the array appear in fewer windows than those in the middle. We can leverage prefix sums to compute the total sum of all window sums efficiently.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the original array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n   - **Sliding Window Technique**: For each window starting at index `i`, the sum of elements from `i` to `i + k - 1` can be derived using the prefix sum array. The total sum of all window sums is then computed by summing these individual window sums.\n   - **Efficiency**: Using the prefix sum array reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n), making it feasible for large inputs (up to 2*10^5 elements).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Building the prefix sum array: O(n)\n   - Calculating the total sum of all window sums: O(n)\n   - Computing the average: O(1)\n   Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    total_weekly_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n - k + 1):\n        total_weekly_sum += prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n        \n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    avg = total_weekly_sum / num_weeks\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (window size), followed by `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array is constructed to store cumulative sums, enabling efficient calculation of subarray sums.\n3. **Window Sum Calculation**: For each window of size `k`, the sum is computed using the prefix array. The total sum of all window sums is accumulated.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average sleep time over all weeks is obtained by dividing the total window sum by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints by leveraging prefix sums to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large datasets.",
