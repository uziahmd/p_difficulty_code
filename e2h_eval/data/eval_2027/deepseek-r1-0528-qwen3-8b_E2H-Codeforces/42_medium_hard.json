Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 100 files, each with size between 1 and 1000 bytes.\n We have two progress bars:\n   First: for the current file i, after copying x bytes: floor(100 * x / a_i)\n   Second: overall, after copying (a_1 + ... + a_{i-1} + x) bytes: floor(100 * (sum_so_far) / total_sum)\n\n We need to find all integers p from 0 to 100 such that there exists some moment (i.e., at some byte x of some file i) \n where both progress bars show p.\n\n Note: The problem says that the second progress bar uses the cumulative sum up to the current point (so including the current file's x bytes).\n\n However, note that the second progress bar is defined as:\n   Let S = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n (total)\n   After copying x bytes in the i-th file, the cumulative sum is: (sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j) + x.\n\n Conditions for a given p and for file i (and some x in [0, a_i]):\n\n   Condition 1 (first progress bar): floor(100 * x / a_i) = p\n        => p <= (100 * x) / a_i < p+1\n        => ceil(p * a_i / 100) <= x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) ? But note: floor condition.\n\n Actually, we can write:\n        p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n        => (p * a_i) / 100 <= x < ((p+1)*a_i)/100\n\n Since x must be an integer, we have:\n        x_min1 = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   [if we want the smallest x that gives p? But note: floor rounds down so we require at least p*100%a_i?]\n\n However, note: the condition is floor(100*x/a_i)=p. This means:\n        p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n        => x >= ceil(p * a_i / 100) ? Not exactly: because if p*a_i/100 is not an integer, then x must be at least the next integer above p*a_i/100? \n\n Actually, let me define:\n        Lower bound: x >= ceil(p * a_i / 100) is not correct because if p*a_i/100 is an integer, then x can be that integer and it will yield floor(100*x/a_i)=p.\n\n But wait: floor(100*x/a_i)=p  <=>  p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n        <=> x >= (p * a_i + 99) // 100 + 1? Let's think:\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n        x_min = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   but wait: if (p*a_i) % 100 == 0, then x_min = (p*a_i)//100 is enough.\n\n Actually, we can set:\n        x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [because we want the smallest integer x such that 100*x >= p*a_i]\n        Then the condition for the first progress bar is: x_min <= x <= ( (p+1)*a_i - 1 ) // 100   [because 100*x < (p+1)*a_i]\n\n But note: the upper bound for x is the minimum of a_i and the value from the overall progress condition.\n\n However, we have two conditions simultaneously.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are going to iterate over each file i (from 0 to n-1) and consider the entire copying process of that file (from 0 to a_i bytes).\n\n For a fixed file i, and for a fixed p (from 0 to 100), we can determine the set of x (bytes copied in file i) that would satisfy the first condition.\n\n Then, we also need the second condition: \n        floor(100 * (S_prev + x) / S_total) = p, where S_prev = sum_{j=0}^{i-1} a_j, and S_total = S_prev + a_i.\n\n Condition 2: \n        p <= 100*(S_prev+x)/S_total < p+1\n        => (p * S_total) <= 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*S_total\n\n        => (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) <= 100*x < (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev\n\n        => x >= ceil( (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )\n           x <= floor( ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100 )   ??? \n\n But note: x must be an integer and we are dealing with integer arithmetic.\n\n However, note: the left side: (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) might not be divisible by 100. Similarly for the right.\n\n Let L = ceil( (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )   [but note: if negative, we take 0? Actually, since S_prev and S_total are positive, and p>=0, we have to be careful.]\n\n Actually, we can write:\n\n        Condition 2: \n          100*(S_prev+x) >= p * S_total   and   100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*S_total\n\n        => x >= ceil( (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )   if (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) is positive, but if negative then x>=0 is sufficient.\n\n However, note that the cumulative sum increases from 0 to S_total, so the overall progress starts at 0 and goes to 100. Therefore, for a given p, the overall condition requires:\n\n        x >= max(0, ceil( (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 ))   [if (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) is negative, then the lower bound is 0? But wait, the condition is automatically satisfied for x>=0? Actually, no: the condition is p<= (100*(S_prev+x))/S_total. If (100*(S_prev+x)) is less than p*S_total, then it doesn't hold. So we require:\n\n        x >= ceil( max(0, (p * S_total - 100*S_prev)) / 100 )   [but note: if (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) is negative, then we don't require any positive x beyond 0? Actually, if (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) < 0, then even at x=0 the condition holds? But wait, at x=0: 100*(S_prev)/S_total = 100*(S_prev)/S_total. Since S_prev is the sum of previous files, and S_total = S_prev+a_i, then 100*S_prev/S_total < 100*(S_prev+a_i)/S_total = 100, so it could be less than p or not. \n\n Actually, the condition must be:\n\n        x must satisfy: (p * S_total) <= 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*S_total\n\n        => x >= ceil( (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )   [if (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) > 0, otherwise 0] but actually we can use:\n\n        Lower bound for x: L2 = ceil( (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )   [if (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) is negative, then ceil(negative) might be negative, so then we take 0?]\n\n        Similarly, upper bound: R2 = floor( ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100 )? \n\n        Actually, we have: 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*S_total\n        => x < ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100\n\n        So the maximum x is floor( ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100 )? No, because we can use:\n\n        x must be an integer, so x <= floor( ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100 )? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n        Condition 2: x must be in [L2, R2] where:\n            L2 = ceil( (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )   [if (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) <=0, then L2=0? But wait: ceil can be negative and we cannot have negative x. So we set L2 = max(0, ceil((p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100))\n\n        But note: ceil function for negative: we want the smallest integer x such that x >= (p*S_total-100*S_prev)/100. Since x cannot be negative, if (p*S_total-100*S_prev) is negative, then any nonnegative x satisfies the inequality? \n\n        Actually, the condition (p*S_total <= 100*(S_prev+x)) is equivalent to (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) <= 100*x. If (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) is negative, then even x=0 satisfies. So we can define:\n\n            L2 = ceil( (p * S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )   [but then if negative, we set L2 = 0? Actually, the ceil of a negative number is negative, so we should set L2 = max(0, ceil(...)) ]\n\n        Similarly, the upper bound: \n            x < ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100\n            => x <= floor( ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100 )   [no, because floor division is for integers, but we are working with real numbers. Actually, we can use:]\n\n            R2 = floor( ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100 )   [this is incorrect]\n\n        Actually, the condition is 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*S_total, so:\n\n            x < ( (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev ) / 100\n\n        So the largest integer x is floor( ( (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1 ) / 100 )? \n\n        Example: (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev = 150, then x must be < 150/100 = 1.5 -> so x<=1. Then floor((150-1)/100)=floor(149/100)=1 -> which is correct.\n\n        But if (p+1)*S_total-100*S_prev=200, then x < 2, so x<=1 -> floor((200-1)/100)=floor(199/100)=1 -> correct.\n\n        However, if (p+1)*S_total-100*S_prev=201, then x<2.01 -> x<=2, and floor((201-1)/100)=floor(200/100)=2 -> correct.\n\n        So yes, R2 = floor( ( (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1 ) / 100 )\n\n        But note: if (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev <=0, then the condition fails for any x>=0? Then we set R2 = -1 (meaning no solution) but we are already using the lower bound and the upper bound must be at least the lower bound.\n\n However, note: the overall progress must be at least p and less than p+1. The overall progress at the beginning of the file i is floor(100*S_prev/S_total). And at the end is floor(100*(S_prev+a_i)/S_total). \n\n Now, for a given file i and a given p, we have two intervals for x:\n\n   Interval1 (from first condition): [x1_low, x1_high] where:\n        x1_low = ceil( (p * a_i) / 100 )   [but note: the condition is floor(100*x/a_i)=p, which is equivalent to x in [ceil(p*a_i/100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)]? \n\n        Actually, we can define:\n            x1_low = ceil( (p * a_i) / 100 )   [but if p*a_i is divisible by 100, then ceil(p*a_i/100) = (p*a_i)//100, and if not, then ceil gives the next integer]\n\n        However, note: the condition is p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1.\n\n        => 100*x >= p*a_i   => x >= ceil(p*a_i/100)   [because if 100*x is at least p*a_i, then floor(100*x/a_i) is at least p, and we also require 100*x < (p+1)*a_i]\n\n        => x < (p+1)*a_i/100   => x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)\n\n        So x1_high = floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)   [to avoid floating point issues, we can use integer arithmetic]\n\n        Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic without floating point:\n\n        For condition1: \n            x must be in [ceil(p*a_i/100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)]\n\n        But note: we are working with integers and a_i, p are integers. We can compute:\n\n            low_bound1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [ceiling division for positive numbers: ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b for positive a,b]\n\n        However, let's check: \n            ceil(p*a_i/100) = (p*a_i + 99) // 100\n\n        Example: p*a_i=500 -> 500//100=5, (500+99)//100 = 599//100=5 -> correct.\n                 p*a_i=501 -> 501//100=5, (501+99)//100=600//100=6 -> correct.\n\n        Similarly, for the upper bound of condition1: \n            x < (p+1)*a_i/100\n            => x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)\n\n        We can use: \n            high_bound1 = ((p+1)*a_i - 1) // 100   [because we want the largest integer strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100]\n\n        Example: (p+1)*a_i=500 -> (500-1)//100=499//100=4 -> correct (since 4.99... -> floor is 4, and 5 is not allowed because 5*100=500 which is not <500).\n\n        But wait: condition is < (p+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum integer x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = floor((p+1)*a_i/100) - 1 if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100? \n\n        Actually, if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i/100 is an integer, so the condition requires x < that integer. Then the maximum x is that integer minus 1.\n\n        We can use: \n            high_bound1 = ((p+1)*a_i - 1) // 100\n\n        However, note: if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i/100 is not an integer, and floor((p+1)*a_i/100) is the same as (p+1)*a_i//100 (using integer floor division). But then we don't subtract one? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n            Condition: 100*x < (p+1)*a_i\n            => x < (p+1)*a_i / 100\n\n        Using integer arithmetic, we can say: x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - epsilon) for any epsilon>0. The largest integer x satisfying that is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) which is the same as (p+1)*a_i//100 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0? \n\n        Actually, no: \n            Consider (p+1)*a_i = 501: then 501/100=5.01, so floor(5.01) is 5, but the condition is x < 5.01, so x can be 5. But wait, 5*100=500 < 501 -> yes, so x=5 is allowed.\n\n        How do we get 5? \n            (p+1)*a_i = 501 -> then (501-1)//100 = 500//100 = 5.\n\n        Consider (p+1)*a_i=500: then 500/100=5, so x<5 -> x<=4. Then (500-1)//100 = 499//100=4.\n\n        Consider (p+1)*a_i=499: then 499/100=4.99, so x<4.99 -> x<=4. Then (499-1)//100=498//100=4.\n\n        So indeed, high_bound1 = ((p+1)*a_i - 1) // 100\n\n        But note: we must ensure that high_bound1 is at least x1_low and at most a_i.\n\n        Now, for the second condition, we have:\n\n            Condition2: \n                x >= ceil( (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )   [but if negative, then 0] and x <= floor( ( (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1 ) / 100 )\n\n        But wait, we have to use integer arithmetic for the second condition as well.\n\n        Let me define:\n            L2 = ceil( (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) / 100 )   -> but we can use: ceil(q) = (q + 99) // 100 if q is positive? But note: if (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) is negative, then we set L2=0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            If (p*S_total - 100*S_prev) <= 0, then L2 = 0.\n            Else, L2 = (p*S_total - 100*S_prev + 99) // 100   [ceiling division for positive]\n\n        Similarly, for the upper bound of condition2:\n\n            R2 = ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) // 100   [using integer floor division, but note: we want floor of ( (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1 )/100? Actually, we did the same trick as above: subtract one to force strict inequality, then floor division]\n\n        However, wait: the condition for the second progress bar is: 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*S_total, so x < ( (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev ) / 100, so the maximum integer x is floor(( (p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1 ) / 100) is correct.\n\n        But note: the condition for the second progress bar must also be satisfied for the same x as the first condition.\n\n        Then, for a fixed file i and p, the x must be in the intersection of:\n            [x1_low, x1_high] ∩ [L2, R2]   and also x must be between 0 and a_i (inclusive).\n\n        Then, if the intersection is non-empty, then p is achieved in file i.\n\n        However, note: we must consider that the second condition depends on S_prev (the sum of the previous files) and S_total (the total sum). Also, note that the first condition's interval [x1_low, x1_high] is independent of S_prev.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Precompute the total sum S_total = sum(a_i)\n\n   For each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n        S_prev = sum(a_0) + ... + a_{i-1}\n        a_i = current file size\n\n        For each p in [0,100]:\n            Compute x1_low = ceil(p * a_i / 100) = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [if p*a_i is 0 then 0, but note: if a_i=0 then skip, but a_i>=1]\n            Compute x1_high = ((p+1)*a_i - 1) // 100\n\n            Compute L2: \n                num = p * S_total - 100 * S_prev\n                if num <= 0:\n                    L2 = 0\n                else:\n                    L2 = (num + 99) // 100   [ceiling division]\n\n            Compute R2 = ((p+1)*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) // 100\n\n            Then the valid x must be in [max(x1_low, L2), min(x1_high, R2, a_i)] and the interval must be non-empty.\n\n            But note: the second condition's L2 and R2 must be within [0, a_i] and the first condition's x1_low and x1_high are in [0, a_i] (by definition). \n\n            However, we must also ensure that the x we choose is at most a_i (for the first condition, x1_high is at most a_i? Because (p+1)*a_i-1//100 is at most (100*a_i-1)//100 = a_i-1? Not exactly: for p=100, then (100+1)*a_i-1//100 = 101*a_i-1//100, which is greater than a_i if a_i>=100? \n\n            Actually, for p=100, the first condition requires: \n                100*x/a_i >= 100  => x>=a_i, but then the condition for the first progress bar is floor(100*x/a_i)=100. \n                But note: when x = a_i, then 100*x/a_i = 100, so floor(100)=100, so condition holds. However, the upper bound formula for the first condition: \n                    x1_high = ((101)*a_i - 1) // 100.\n\n            Example: a_i=100 -> (10100-1)//100 = 10099//100 = 100 -> so x1_high=100, which is acceptable.\n\n            But wait: condition for p=100: \n                Condition1: x must be at least ceil(100*a_i/100)=ceil(a_i)=a_i, and at most (101*a_i-1)//100.\n\n            So if a_i=100, then x must be 100. Then the second condition: \n                S_prev = total - a_i, and the cumulative sum is S_prev+100 = S_total.\n                Then the overall progress: floor(100 * S_total / S_total) = 100, so condition2: \n                    Condition2: p=100: \n                        Condition2: 100*S_total <= 100*S_total < 101*S_total -> holds.\n\n            But note: the second condition's L2 and R2 for p=100:\n                L2: num = 100*S_total - 100*S_prev = 100*a_i = 100*100=10000 -> positive, then L2 = (10000+99)//100 = 10099//100=100\n                R2 = (101*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1)//100 = (101*S_total - 100*(S_total - a_i) -1)//100 = (101*S_total -100*S_total +100*a_i -1)//100 = (S_total +100*a_i -1)//100 = (100+10000-1)//100 = 10099//100=100\n\n            So the interval for condition2 is [100,100]. The first condition is [100,100]. So they meet.\n\n            However, note: the second condition's R2 calculation: \n                R2 = (101*S_total - 100*S_prev - 1) // 100\n                S_prev = S_total - a_i = 100 - 100 = 0? Actually, S_total = a_0+a_1+...+a_{n-1}. In this example, if we are processing the last file, then S_prev = total - a_i. But if there are multiple files, then S_prev is the sum of the previous ones.\n\n            The above example was for one file: n=1, a_0=100. Then S_prev=0, S_total=100.\n\n            Then for p=100 and file0 (last file):\n                Condition2: \n                    L2: 100*100 - 100*0 = 10000 -> positive, so L2= (10000+99)//100=10099//100=100\n                    R2: (101*100 - 100*0 -1)//100 = (10100-1)//100 = 10099//100=100\n\n            So the x must be 100.\n\n            But what if we have two files: [100, 100]? Then S_prev for the second file is 100, S_total=200.\n\n            For p=100 in the second file (file index1):\n                Condition1: ceil(100*100/100)=100, and ((101*100-1)//100)=10099//100=100 -> so x=100 is the only candidate.\n\n                Condition2: \n                    L2: 100*200 - 100*100 = 20000-10000=10000 -> positive, so L2= (10000+99)//100=10099//100=100\n                    R2: (101*200 - 100*100 -1)//100 = (20200-10000-1)//100=10199//100=101\n\n                Then the interval for condition2 is [100,101]. The first condition gives x=100. So 100 is in [100,101] -> valid.\n\n            However, note: the overall progress at the second file when x=100 is: (100+100)*100/200 = 100 -> floor(100)=100, so condition2 holds.\n\n            But wait: the second condition's condition is: \n                100*(S_prev+x) = 100*(100+100)=20000, and 20000/200=100 -> so floor(100)=100, which is p=100.\n\n            Now, what if we consider the first file in the two-file example?\n                File0: a0=100, S_prev=0, S_total=200.\n                Condition1 for p=100: \n                    x1_low = ceil(100*100/100)=ceil(100)=100\n                    x1_high = (101*100-1)//100=10099//100=100\n                Condition2 for p=100:\n                    L2: 100*200 - 100*0 = 20000 -> positive, so L2=(20000+99)//100=20099//100=200\n                    R2: (101*200 - 100*0 -1)//100=20199//100=201\n\n                Then the interval for condition2 is [200,201] but the first condition requires x=100, which is not in [200,201]. So no solution for the first file.\n\n            This matches: at the first file, we cannot get 100% overall progress until the entire two files are done.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll iterate for each file i, then for each p from 0 to 100, and check if there exists an x (integer) in [x1_low, x1_high] that is also in [L2, R2] and also 0<=x<=a_i (but our x1_high is at most a_i? Actually, condition1 ensures x<=a_i because x1_high = ((p+1)*a_i-1)//100, and (p+1)*a_i-1 can be larger than a_i? \n\n   Example: p=0, then x1_low=ceil(0)=0, x1_high=(1*a_i-1)//100. For a_i=100, then (100-1)//100=0, so x=0 is the only candidate. But wait: condition1 for p=0: \n        floor(100*x/a_i)=0  => 0<=100*x/a_i <1 => x in [0, (a_i-1)//100] (if a_i>=1). But note: if a_i=100, then (a_i-1)//100=0. So only x=0.\n\n   However, condition2 for p=0: \n        Condition2: 0<= (100*(S_prev+x))/S_total <1\n        => 0<=100*(S_prev+x) < S_total\n\n        => x in [0, (S_total-S_prev-1)//100]   [because 100*(S_prev+x) < S_total => x < (S_total - 100*S_prev)/100, so x <= floor((S_total-100*S_prev-1)/100)]\n\n   So we must consider that the x from condition1 must be within [0, a_i] and the condition2 interval [L2, R2] must be considered only for x in [0, a_i].\n\n   However, note: condition1 already restricts x to [0, a_i] (because x1_low and x1_high are computed from a_i). But condition2's interval [L2, R2] might extend beyond a_i. Then we should cap R2 to a_i.\n\n   Actually, the overall cumulative sum cannot exceed S_total, and the condition2 is defined for the entire process, so x is bounded by a_i (we are in the current file). But condition2's R2 is computed from the entire S_total and S_prev, so R2 might be greater than a_i. Then we should set R2 = min(R2, a_i) ?\n\n   However, note: the second condition's cumulative sum is S_prev+x, and x is at most a_i, so the cumulative sum is at most S_prev+a_i=S_total. Then the condition2 for p=100 requires 100*S_total <= 100*S_total < 101*S_total, which is true for x=a_i. But if p>100, then we don't consider (p from 0 to 100). \n\n   So we can do:\n\n        Let x_low = max(x1_low, L2, 0)\n        Let x_high = min(x1_high, R2, a_i)\n\n        Then if x_low <= x_high, then p is achieved at this file.\n\n   But note: condition2's L2 might be negative? Then we set L2=0, so we use max(x1_low, 0, ...) but we already set L2=0 if negative.\n\n   However, we set L2 = max(0, ceil(...)) so we are safe.\n\n   But wait: condition1's x1_low and x1_high are computed from a_i, and condition2's L2 and R2 are computed from S_prev and S_total.\n\n   We must consider that the same p might be achieved in multiple files. We just need to know if there exists at least one file and one x such that both conditions hold.\n\n   We can use a boolean array for p from 0 to 100, initially False. Then for each file i and each p, if we find an x that satisfies both conditions, then mark p as True.\n\n   Then, after processing all files, output all p from 0 to 100 that are marked True, in increasing order.\n\n   However, note: the overall progress bar is updated continuously, and we are only considering the moments when we are in the middle of a file. Also, note that the same p might appear at different files, but we only need to record that it appears at least once.\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: Input \"1\\n6\" -> Output \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\"\n\n   n=1, a=[6], S_total=6.\n\n   We consider file0 (only file) with S_prev=0.\n\n   We iterate p from 0 to 100.\n\n   For p=0:\n        Condition1: x1_low = ceil(0)=0, x1_high = (1*6-1)//100=5//100=0.\n        Condition2: num=0*6-100*0=0 -> L2=0, R2=((1*6-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 that can be displayed simultaneously on both progress bars at some point during the copying process of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for each file being copied, we need to check all possible percentages (0 to 100) to see if there exists a byte count in the current file such that both progress bars display the same percentage. The challenge is to efficiently compute these byte counts without resorting to brute-force methods, which would be computationally expensive given the constraints.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each file, we calculate the required byte ranges for each percentage using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies. Specifically:\n   - **First Progress Bar Condition**: The percentage for the current file is determined by the ratio of bytes copied in the current file to its total size.\n   - **Second Progress Bar Condition**: The percentage for the overall progress is determined by the cumulative bytes copied so far divided by the total bytes of all files.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each file and each percentage from 0 to 100, compute the valid byte ranges for both conditions. The intersection of these ranges must be non-empty for the percentage to be achievable during the copying of the current file.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each file once, and for each file, it checks all 101 percentages. For each percentage, it performs constant-time arithmetic operations. With up to 100 files, the total operations are manageable (100 * 101 = 10,100), making the solution efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(a_list)\n    S_prev = 0\n    result_set = set()\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        a_i = a_list[i]\n        S_total = total_sum\n        S_prev_current = S_prev\n        \n        for p in range(0, 101):\n            x1_low = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            x1_high = (p + 1) * a_i - 1\n            if x1_high < 0:\n                x1_high = 0\n            else:\n                x1_high = x1_high // 100\n            \n            num_condition2 = p * S_total - 100 * S_prev_current\n            if num_condition2 <= 0:\n                L2 = 0\n            else:\n                L2 = (num_condition2 + 99) // 100\n            \n            R2 = ((p + 1) * S_total - 100 * S_prev_current - 1) // 100\n            \n            low_bound = max(x1_low, L2)\n            high_bound = min(x1_high, R2, a_i)\n            \n            if low_bound <= high_bound:\n                result_set.add(p)\n        \n        S_prev += a_i\n\n    for p in sorted(result_set):\n        print(p)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Initialization**: Calculate the total sum of all file sizes and initialize a set to keep track of valid percentages.\n3. **Processing Each File**: For each file, compute the valid byte ranges for each percentage (0-100) where both progress bars would display the same value.\n4. **Conditions Check**: For each percentage, determine the byte ranges that satisfy both the current file's progress and the overall progress conditions.
