The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are only concerned with the parity (even or odd) of the numbers.\n Condition: a_i + b_j is odd => one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   - Chestes with even numbers (E_c)\n   - Chestes with odd numbers (O_c)\n\n Similarly for keys:\n   - Keys with even numbers (E_k)\n   - Keys with odd numbers (O_k)\n\n Now, note that:\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key (since even + odd = odd).\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key (since odd + even = odd).\n\n So, the problem reduces to matching between:\n   - The even chests and the odd keys (call this bipartite graph for even chests and odd keys)\n   - The odd chests and the even keys (call this bipartite graph for odd chests and even keys)\n\n However, note that one key and one chest can only be used once.\n\n Since the two sets are independent, the maximum matching is simply the sum of the two independent matchings.\n\n But note: we don't need to build a graph. We can use greedy counting because:\n\n We have two independent bipartitions:\n\n 1. Even chests (E_c) can only use odd keys (O_k). The maximum number of even chests we can open is min(E_c, O_k) if we were limited by the smaller side? \n    Actually, no. We cannot use the same key twice. So we are looking for the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where edges exist between every even chest and every odd key.\n\n However, note that the condition is always satisfied (if the chest is even, then we require an odd key) and there's no restriction beyond the counts. So the maximum matching from even chests to odd keys is min(E_c, O_k)? \n\n Wait, but what if we have more even chests than odd keys? Then we can only open as many even chests as there are odd keys. Similarly, if we have more odd keys than even chests, then we can open all even chests.\n\n Similarly, for the odd chests and even keys: min(O_c, E_k)\n\n Then total chests opened = min(E_c, O_k) + min(O_c, E_k)\n\n Let me test with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n     9 -> odd\n     14 -> even\n     6 -> even\n     2 -> even\n     11 -> odd\n\n   So, E_c = 3, O_c = 2.\n\n   Keys:\n     8 -> even\n     4 -> even\n     7 -> odd\n     20 -> even\n\n   So, E_k = 3, O_k = 1.\n\n   Then, even chests (3) can use odd keys (1): min(3,1)=1.\n        odd chests (2) can use even keys (3): min(2,3)=2.\n\n   Total = 1 + 2 = 3. Matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1, chests=[2,4,6,8,10], keys=[5]\n\n   Chests: all even -> E_c=5, O_c=0.\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> O_k=1, E_k=0.\n\n   Then, even chests (5) can use odd keys (1): min(5,1)=1.\n         odd chests (0) can use even keys (0): min(0,0)=0.\n\n   Total = 1. Matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4, chests=[10], keys=[20,30,40,50]\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even -> E_c=1, O_c=0.\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0.\n\n   Then, even chests (1) can use odd keys (0): min(1,0)=0.\n         odd chests (0) can use even keys (4): min(0,4)=0.\n\n   Total = 0. Matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the list of n chest numbers.\n   Step 3: Read the list of m key numbers.\n\n   Step 4: Count:\n        even_chests = count of even numbers in the chest list\n        odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n        even_keys = count of",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd. This means one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each pair consists of one even and one odd number. The solution involves counting how many chests and keys are even or odd.\n2. **Intuition**: Even-numbered chests can only be opened by odd-numbered keys, and vice versa. Therefore, the maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches for even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each chest and key once to count their parities, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking each number's parity using modulo operation.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minima: \n   - The minimum of even chests and odd keys (since even chests require odd keys).\n   - The minimum of odd chests and even keys (since odd chests require even keys).\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the total number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages simple counting and arithmetic operations to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
