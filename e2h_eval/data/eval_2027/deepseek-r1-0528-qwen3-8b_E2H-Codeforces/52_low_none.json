Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour and then becomes one burned candle.\n   - After using the initial candles, we have 'a' burned candles. Then we can make floor(a / b) new candles from these burned ones, and the remainder is left as leftover burned candles.\n   - Then we use these new candles (which are actually the same as any other candle) and they will burn and become burned again.\n\n Steps:\n   Let total_hours = 0\n   Let current_candles = a\n   Let leftover = 0\n\n   While current_candles > 0:\n      total_hours += current_candles   # because each current candle burns for an hour\n      # Now, we have current_candles burned candles from this burning\n      # So the total burned so far is leftover + current_candles\n      total_burned = leftover + current_candles\n      new_candles = total_burned // b\n      leftover = total_burned % b\n\n      current_candles = new_candles\n\n   However, note that in the example: \n        Input: 4 2 -> Output: 7\n\n   But wait, the above while loop would do:\n        First iteration: current_candles = 4 -> total_hours=4, total_burned=4+0=4, new_candles=4//2=2, leftover=0.\n        Second iteration: current_candles=2 -> total_hours=6, total_burned=2 (from the 2 candles) + 0 leftover = 2, new_candles=2//2=1, leftover=0.\n        Third iteration: current_candles=1 -> total_hours=7, total_burned=1 (from the 1 candle) + 0 leftover = 1, new_candles=1//2=0, leftover=1 -> then stops.\n\n   This gives 7, which matches.\n\n   However, let's try the second example: \n        Input: 6 3 -> Output: 8\n\n   Using the same logic:\n        Start: current_candles=6, total_hours=0, leftover=0.\n        First iteration: hours=6, total_burned=6, new_candles=6//3=2, leftover=0.\n        Second iteration: current_candles=2, hours=8, total_burned=2, new_candles=2//3=0, leftover=2 -> stops. Total hours=8.\n\n   But wait, in the example output is 8.\n\n   However, note that the above algorithm does not account for the fact that after burning the second set of candles, we get some burned candles that are left over, but then we don't use them until the next cycle? Actually, the problem says we can use the burned candles optimally. The above algorithm uses the leftover from previous cycles.\n\n   But the example input 6 3 gives 8, which is correct.\n\n   However, there is a known alternative solution that uses a while loop until current_candles becomes zero, but we must account for the leftovers.\n\n   But note: In the above code, the variable 'leftover' accumulates the burned candles that are not enough to form a new candle. Then in the next iteration, we add that leftover to the current_candles (which are the newly formed ones) to get the total_burned.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, what if we don't have any leftover at the beginning? Then we just use the current_candles to form new ones.\n\n   However, let's test with a different example: say a=1, b=2. Then:\n        current_candles=1 -> total_hours=1, total_burned=1, new_candles=0, leftover=1. Then we break. So total_hours=1.\n\n   Another example: a=5, b=3.\n        Start: current_candles=5 -> hours=5, total_burned=5, new_candles=5//3=1, leftover=2.\n        Then current_candles=1 -> hours=6, total_burned=1+2=3, new_candles=3//3=1, leftover=0.\n        Then current_candles=1 -> hours=7, total_burned=1, new_candles=0, leftover=1 -> stop. So 7 hours.\n\n   But let me verify: \n        Initially, 5 candles: burn for 5 hours, then we have 5 burned. We can make 5//3 = 1 new candle (with 2 burned left).\n        Then we burn that 1 candle for 1 hour (total 6), then we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and recycling the burned ones into new candles until no more candles can be made.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles (`a`) and the number of burned candles needed to make a new candle (`b`).\n2. **Burning Candles**: Each candle burns for one hour. For each hour, increment the total hours by the number of candles currently available.\n3. **Recycling Burned Candles**: After burning the candles, calculate how many new candles can be made from the burned ones (including any leftovers from previous cycles). The number of new candles is the integer division of the total burned candles by `b`, and the remainder becomes the leftover burned candles.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no more candles left to burn. The total hours accumulated during the process is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_hours = 0\n    current_candles = a\n    leftover = 0\n    \n    while current_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_candles\n        total_burned = leftover + current_candles\n        new_candles = total_burned // b\n        leftover = total_burned % b\n        current_candles = new_candles\n        \n    print(total_hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (burned candles needed per new candle).\n2. **Initial Setup**: Initialize `total_hours` to 0, `current_candles` to `a`, and `leftover` to 0.\n3. **Loop Until No Candles Left**: While there are candles to burn:\n   - Add the number of current candles to `total_hours`.\n   - Calculate the total burned candles (sum of `leftover` and `current_candles`).\n   - Determine the number of new candles (`new_candles`) by dividing the total burned candles by `b`.\n   - Update `leftover` to the remainder of the division.\n   - Set `current_candles` to `new_candles` for the next iteration.\n4. **Output Result**: After the loop ends, print the total hours accumulated.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles, ensuring optimal use of all available resources until no more candles can be made. The loop handles all edge cases, including when no new candles can be formed immediately after the initial set.",
