There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: n, h, m and then m lines of [l, r, x]\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities, but note that the restrictions might overlap.\n\n Idea:\n We have to assign a height for each spot i (from 1 to n) in the range [0, h] such that for every restriction (l, r, x), \n the maximum height in the interval [l, r] is <= x.\n\n The profit is the sum of squares of the heights.\n\n However, the restrictions are given as constraints on intervals. We can think of it as: each restriction defines an upper bound on the houses in its interval.\n\n We can also note that the overall maximum height for any house is at most h (given).\n\n Approach:\n Since n, m are small (<=50), we can consider iterating over the possible heights for each spot, but that would be 51^50 which is too big.\n\n Instead, we can use dynamic programming that considers the constraints. But note: the constraints are not independent and we have multiple overlapping intervals.\n\n Alternate approach: constraints are given as \"at most x\" in a contiguous interval. We can use the idea of \"active\" constraints.\n\n However, note that the problem can be transformed: We must satisfy all restrictions. So for each spot, the height must be <= the minimum x_i for which the spot is contained in the restriction (and also <= h). But wait: it's more complicated because a restriction might not cover the entire street.\n\n Actually, we can precompute for each spot i the minimum allowed height (but no, we don't want to set a lower bound, we have an upper bound). For each spot i, we must have height <= min{ x_j | i is in [l_j, r_j] } OR if there is no restriction covering i then height <= h? \n\n However, note: the restrictions are independent. But actually, if a house is in multiple restrictions, then the height must be <= the minimum x among the restrictions that cover it.\n\n So let's define:\n   For each spot i, let U[i] = min{ x_j for all j such that l_j <= i <= r_j }  and if there is no restriction, then we take h (the global maximum) as the upper bound? But wait: the problem says \"in each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h\", and then the restrictions. So the actual constraint for spot i is: height[i] <= min(U[i], h). However, note that the input gives x_i up to h, so we can just set U[i] = min( {x_j for restrictions covering i} ) and if there are none, then U[i] = h.\n\n But wait: what if a restriction has x_i > h? Then we should cap by h? Actually, the problem says: \"0 <= x_i <= h\", so x_i is at most h. Therefore, if we set U[i] = min( {x_j for restrictions covering i} ), then U[i] is at most h, and the effective upper bound for spot i is U[i]. \n\n However, there is a catch: the restrictions might not cover the entire street. But note: the problem does not require that the entire street is covered by restrictions. So we can set:\n\n   Let A[i] = the minimum x from all restrictions that cover i (if any), otherwise we set A[i] = h.\n\n Then the condition for spot i is: height[i] <= A[i].\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? Consider two restrictions: one says [1,2] must be <= 3, and another says [2,3] must be <= 2. Then for spot 2, we have A[2] = min(3,2)=2. And that is correct. However, note that the first restriction also requires that the tallest in [1,2] is <=3, but we are only setting the individual upper bounds. Is that enough?\n\n Actually, yes: if we set each house i to be at most A[i], then for a restriction (l, r, x): the maximum in [l, r] is at most max_{i in [l,r]} A[i]? But wait, that is not necessarily <= x.\n\n Example: \n   Restrictions: \n      [1,3] must be <= 2 (so x=2)\n      [1,2] must be <= 3 (so x=3)\n\n   Then for spot 1: A[1] = min(2,3)=2.\n        spot 2: A[2] = min(2,3)=2.\n        spot 3: A[3] = 2.\n\n   Now, the restriction [1,3] is satisfied because each house is <=2.\n\n   But consider:\n      Restriction1: [1,2] <= 3\n      Restriction2: [2,3] <= 2\n\n   Then A[1]=3, A[2]=min(3,2)=2, A[3]=2.\n\n   Now, the restriction [1,2]: the maximum in [1,2] is max(A[1],A[2]) = max(3,2)=3 -> okay.\n   The restriction [2,3]: the maximum in [2,3] is max(2,2)=2 -> okay.\n\n   However, wait: what if we set the house at spot1 to 3, spot2 to 2, spot3 to 2: then [1,2] has max 3, [2,3] has max 2. So it's okay.\n\n   But now, is it always true that if we set each house i to be at most A[i] then all restrictions are satisfied?\n   Consider a restriction (l, r, x). In the interval [l, r], we must have that the maximum height is <= x. But note: we set each house i to at most A[i]. However, A[i] is defined as the minimum x from restrictions that cover i. It is possible that A[i] <= x for every i in [l, r]? Not necessarily: consider a restriction (l, r, x) and some house i in [l, r] might have an A[i] that comes from a restriction that allows a value greater than x? Then we set house i to that value, which violates the current restriction.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot simply set each house to at most A[i]. \n\n   We must ensure that for each restriction (l, r, x), the maximum height in [l, r] is <= x.\n\n   How to combine both? \n\n   Alternative: We can use the idea that the restrictions impose that the entire interval [l, r] must have height <= x. So for each spot, we must have height <= the minimum x among all restrictions that cover it, but also we must have that the maximum height in each interval [l, r] (for each restriction) is <= x.\n\n   However, note that if we set a house i to height y, then for every restriction (l, r, x) that covers i, we must have y <= x. This is equivalent to saying y <= min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j. So the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n   Why? Because if we set each house i to y_i <= A[i] (where A[i] = min_{j: i in [l_j, r_j]} x_j, and if no restriction, then A[i]=h), then for any restriction (l, r, x), we have for every i in [l, r]: y_i <= A[i] <= x (because the restriction (l, r, x) covers i, so x is one of the values considered in A[i] and hence A[i] <= x). Therefore, the maximum in [l, r] is <= x.\n\n   So we can define A[i] = min( {x_j for each restriction j that covers i} ) and if there are no restrictions, then we set A[i] = h.\n\n   Then, the problem becomes: assign to each spot i a value y_i (integer) in [0, A[i]] such that the sum of squares is maximized.\n\n   Why is that? Because we are free to choose any integer in [0, A[i]] for each house i independently (since the constraints are all captured by the individual A[i]). \n\n   Then the problem reduces to: for each i, choose y_i from [0, A[i]] (integers) to maximize sum_i (y_i^2).\n\n   But note: the function f(y)=y^2 is convex and increasing for y>=0. So for each i, we would choose y_i = A[i] to maximize the square. \n\n   However, wait: is that always optimal? Yes, because if we can set y_i to A[i] and that satisfies the constraints, then we get the maximum for that house. And since the constraints are independent per house (via the definition of A[i]), we can set each house to its maximum allowed value.\n\n   Then the total profit would be: sum_{i=1}^{n} (A[i])^2.\n\n   Let's test with the example:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        Compute A[1]: only restriction [1,1,1] -> 1\n        A[2]: only restriction [2,2,3] -> 3\n        A[3]: only restriction [3,3,2] -> 2\n\n        Then profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14 -> matches.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: [2,3,8], [3,4,7]\n\n        A[1]: no restriction -> h=10\n        A[2]: restriction [2,3,8] -> 8\n        A[3]: restrictions [2,3,8] and [3,4,7] -> min(8,7)=7\n        A[4]: restriction [3,4,7] -> 7\n\n        Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> matches.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Read n, h, m.\n     2. Initialize an array A of length n+1 (indexed 1 to n) with zeros. We'll set initially A[i] = h for all i.\n     3. For each of the m restrictions (each given by l, r, x):\n            for i from l to r:\n                A[i] = min(A[i], x)\n\n     4. Then, for i from 1 to n: compute (A[i])^2 and sum them.\n\n   However, wait: what if a restriction has x=0? Then we set A[i] to 0 for all i in the restriction. That's acceptable because the problem allows height 0.\n\n   But note: the above method sets A[i] for each i to the minimum x of all restrictions covering i. This is correct.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if there are no restrictions? Then A[i] remains h for all i, and the profit is n * h^2.\n\n   Example: n=1, h=5, m=0 -> profit=25.\n\n   However, what if there is a restriction that doesn't cover some spot? We set that spot to h. Correct.\n\n   But note: the example input format: the restrictions are given and we process them.\n\n   However, wait: is it possible that a restriction has x greater than h? The problem states: \"0 <= x_i <= h\", so no.\n\n   So the above algorithm works.\n\n   But wait: what if the same spot is covered by multiple restrictions with different x? Then we take the minimum. That is correct because the spot must be <= each of the x's from the restrictions that cover it.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code as:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   # We'll create an array `arr` of size n+1 (index 0 unused, indices 1..n)\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)   # index from 1 to n\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        # We are going to update from l to r: set arr[i] = min(arr[i], x_val)\n        for i in range(l, r+1):\n            if x_val < arr[i]:\n                arr[i] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total += arr[i] * arr[i]\n\n   print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the second example input is provided as two separate lines? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   But the problem says: the first line contains n, h, m, and then m lines.\n\n   Our code reads the first line, then m lines. So for the example, we read:\n\n        First example: \n            n=3, h=3, m=3\n            Then three lines: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        Second example:\n            n=4, h=10, m=2\n            Then two lines: [2,3,8], [3,4,7]\n\n   But note: the example output is provided as two separate strings, but in the problem statement the input is given as two examples. In competitive programming, we usually read one input.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Print a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\"\n\n   And the example input is two examples. But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides two examples. In reality, we are to read one test case.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"There are m zoning restrictions\", so we read m restrictions.\n\n   However, the sample input is provided as two separate examples. But the problem expects one integer per test case.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" and the input is as described.\n\n   The sample input is given as two separate test cases. But the problem does not specify multiple test cases. The constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and then m lines.\n\n   We assume there is one test case per run.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as two separate strings. But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input is given. \n\n   Since the problem statement includes two examples, we must design for one test case.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"You are planning to build housing on a street.\" and then describes the input.\n\n   So we read one test case.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as:\n\n        Input: \n          3 3 3\n          1 1 1\n          2 2 3\n          3 3 2\n\n        Output: 14\n\n        Input:\n          4 10 2\n          2 3 8\n          3 4 7\n\n        Output: 262\n\n   But the problem says: \"Print a single integer\".\n\n   So if we are running the program, we will read one test case.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"competitive programming problem\", and often problems have multiple test cases. However, the constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and the input format is as described. There is no indication of multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. The example input is provided as two separate examples, but that is just for illustration.\n\n   We assume one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Each of the next m lines\", so we read exactly m lines.\n\n   But wait: the problem does not specify the number of test cases. It says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input. Typically, if there are multiple test cases, they would be indicated (like by a number of test cases). Here, we are to read until EOF? Or one test case?\n\n   Since the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as two separate examples. This might be a copy-paste error.\n\n   Clarification: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two inputs. However, in many competitive programming problems, the input is one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, let me see the constraints: n, h, m from 1 to 50. The input is as described.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and then the example input is provided. The example input is two separate test cases? Or is it two examples of one test case?\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"In the first example...\" and \"In the second example...\", meaning two distinct examples.\n\n   So we must handle one test case.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the number of test cases. How do we know if there are multiple?\n\n   Looking at the problem statement: it says \"the first line contains three integers n, h, m\", and then m lines.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" and the input is as described. There is no indication of multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me re-read: the input format is as described. We read one test case.\n\n   But note: the example input is provided as two separate examples. This is just for showing two different cases.\n\n   We write the code for one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Print a single integer\".\n\n   We do that.\n\n   But wait: what if there are no restrictions? Then m=0, and we still read n and h, then no restrictions, then we compute the profit as n * h^2.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the same spot is covered by multiple restrictions? Then we take the minimum x. Correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not guarantee that the restrictions are given in any particular order. But our loop for each restriction updates the array from l to r.\n\n   Since the constraints are small (n, m <=50) and the update is O(n) per restriction, the total time is O(m*n) = 50*50 = 2500, which is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)   # 1-indexed: indices 0 unused, 1..n\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        for i in range(l, r+1):\n            if x_val < arr[i]:\n                arr[i] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total += arr[i] * arr[i]\n\n   print(total)\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        arr initially: [3,3,3,3] (index0 unused, indices 1,2,3 are 3)\n\n        Process first restriction: [1,1,1] -> update index1 to 1 -> arr[1]=1\n        Process second: [2,2,3] -> update index2 to min(3,3)=3 -> stays 3\n        Process third: [3,3,2] -> update index3 to 2\n\n        Then total = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n   Example 2:\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        arr initially: [10,10,10,10,10] (indices 1..4)\n\n        First restriction: [2,3,8] -> update indices2 and 3: set to 8 -> [10,8,8,10,10]\n        Second restriction: [3,4,7] -> update indices3 and 4: \n            index3: min(8,7)=7 -> becomes 7\n            index4: min(10,7)=7 -> becomes 7\n\n        Then total = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n   So it matches.\n\n   However, wait: the second example input was given as:\n\n        Input: \n          4 10 2\n          2 3 8\n          3 4 7\n\n        But note: the restriction [3,4,7] updates indices 3 and 4. Initially, index4 was 10, and then set to 7.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if a restriction has an x_val that is larger than h? The problem states 0<=x_i<=h, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"in each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h\". Our method sets the height to the minimum x from the restrictions (or h if no restriction). But note: the minimum x from the restrictions might be negative? No, because x_i>=0.\n\n   Also, we are allowed to set the house to any integer between 0 and A[i] (which is at most h). We are setting it to A[i] (the maximum allowed) to maximize the square. \n\n   But note: the square function is increasing for nonnegative numbers. So yes, we want the maximum value allowed.\n\n   However, wait: what if we don't set to the maximum allowed? Then the profit would be less. So we set to the maximum allowed.\n\n   But what if the restrictions are conflicting? Actually, we are taking the minimum x from the restrictions that cover the spot, and that minimum is the tightest constraint. So we set to that minimum.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n   But wait: what if there is a restriction that requires a house to be at most 0? Then we set that house to 0, and 0^2=0. That is the maximum we can get (since 0 is the only allowed value). Correct.\n\n   One more test case: n=1, h=5, m=1, restriction [1,1,0] -> then arr[1]=0, profit=0.\n\n   Another test case: n=2, h=10, m=2, restrictions: [1,1,5] and [2,2,5] -> then arr[1]=5, arr[2]=5, profit=5^2+5^2=50.\n\n   What if n=2, h=10, m=2, restrictions: [1,2,5] and [1,2,3] -> then for each spot, we take min(5,3)=3. Then profit=3^2+3^2=18.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   We output the code.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is provided as two separate strings. But in reality, we are reading one test case.\n\n   But note: the problem statement example input is two separate examples. We are to write a program that reads one test case.\n\n   If the input has multiple test cases, then we would need to adjust. But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and the input format is as described, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can check the problem statement: it does not mention multiple test cases.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"Each of the next m lines\", meaning we read exactly m lines. So the input ends after m lines.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   Read n, h, m\n   Initialize an array of n+1 elements (all h)\n   For each of the m lines: read and update the array for the segment [l, r] with x_val (taking the minimum)\n   Then sum the squares.\n\n   Print the total.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is provided as two examples. But in competitive programming, the input is provided from stdin and the program reads until EOF.\n\n   But the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement, it says \"You are planning to build housing on a street.\" and then describes the input. There is no indication of multiple test cases.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   But wait, the example input is two separate test cases. This is confusing.\n\n   Actually, the problem statement example input is:\n\n        Input: \n          3 3 3\n          1 1 1\n          2 2 3\n          3 3 2\n\n        Output: 14\n\n        Input:\n          4 10 2\n          2 3 8\n          3 4 7\n\n        Output: 262\n\n   This means that the problem statement has two examples. But the program should read one test case from stdin.\n\n   In competitive programming, the input is provided from standard input. The judge will run the program and provide one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code as below.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides two examples. This might be a formatting issue.\n\n   We'll assume the input is one test case.\n\n   But wait: what if the problem intended multiple test cases? The problem does not say. We must follow the problem statement.\n\n   The problem statement says: \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\", and then m lines. So the input has exactly 1+m lines.\n\n   Therefore, we read until we have processed m lines.\n\n   Code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n   if not data:\n        print(0)\n        exit(0)\n\n   # First three integers: n, h, m\n   n = int(data[0]); h = int(data[1]); m = int(data[2])\n\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)\n\n   index = 3\n   for i in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index]); r = int(data[index+1]); x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        for j in range(l, r+1):\n            if x_val < arr[j]:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total += arr[i] * arr[i]\n\n   print(total)\n\n   But wait, the above uses sys.stdin.read().split() and then parses. This is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Read from stdin\", and the input may come from a file or pipe.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\n   But if we use input(), then for large input (though n,m<=50, so m<=50, so at most 51 lines) we can use input().\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the size of the input numbers, but they are integers from 1 to 50, so it's safe.\n\n   Let me write the code using input().\n\n   But note: the example input is provided as two separate test cases in the problem statement. In reality, we are to read one test case.\n\n   We'll assume one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says \"competitive programming\", and sometimes there are multiple test cases. But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   After checking the problem statement again: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. There is no indication of multiple test cases.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"Each of the next m lines\", so we read exactly m lines.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   We'll submit the following code:\n\n   Note: We must read the entire input.\n\n   Since the input is small, we can use:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n        for j in range(l, r+1):\n            if x_val < arr[j]:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total += arr[i] * arr[i]\n\n   print(total)\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"There are m zoning restrictions.\" and then the input. We read m lines.\n\n   However, the example input is two separate test cases. But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input. \n\n   If the judge provides multiple test cases, this code will break.\n\n   But the problem statement does not say there are multiple test cases.\n\n   We must clarify: the problem statement says \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\", and then m lines. So one test case.\n\n   We'll assume one test case.\n\n   However, if the problem intended multiple test cases, we would need to read until EOF. But the constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and the input format is as described.\n\n   Since the problem is from a competition, and the constraints are small, we assume one test case.\n\n   Let me submit the code as below.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" and we are computing for one test case.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * (n+1)   # 0-indexed we ignore index0, use 1..n\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n        for i in range(l, r+1):\n            if x_val < arr[i]:\n                arr[i] = x_val\n\n   s = 0\n   for i in range(1, n+1):\n        s += arr[i] * arr[i]\n\n   print(s)\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the spots are labeled from 1 to n. Our array is 1-indexed, so we use indices 1..n.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the example input uses 1-indexed labels.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n          3 3 3\n          1 1 1\n          2 2 3\n          3 3 2\n\n        Output: 14\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n          4 10 2\n          2 3 8\n          3 4 7\n\n        Output: 262\n\n   We run the code with example1:\n\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        arr = [3,3,3,3] (index0=3, index1=3, index2=3, index3=3, index4 unused)\n\n        First restriction: l=1, r=1, x_val=1 -> update index1: 1<3 -> set to 1 -> arr[1]=1\n        Second: l=2, r=2, x_val=3 -> update index2: 3<3? no -> arr[2]=3\n        Third: l=3, r=3, x_val=2 -> update index3: 2<3 -> set to 2\n\n        Then s = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n   Example2:\n\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        arr = [10,10,10,10,10] (index0 to index4, we use 1..4)\n\n        First restriction: l=2, r=3, x_val=8 -> update indices2 and 3: set to 8 -> [10,8,8,10] (but wait, we have 5 elements: index0..4, and we update index2 and index3)\n        Second: l=3, r=4, x_val=7 -> update index3: min(8,7)=7; index4: min(10,7)=7 -> so arr[3]=7, arr[4]=7.\n\n        Then s = 10^2 (index1) + 8^2 (index2) + 7^2 (index3) + 7^2 (index4) = 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   It matches.\n\n   However, wait: in the second example, the first restriction updates indices 2 and 3, so index1 is not updated? Yes, because the first restriction is from 2 to 3.\n\n   Then the second restriction updates index3 and index4.\n\n   So the array after first restriction: [10,8,8,10] (for indices1 to 4: index1=10, index2=8, index3=8, index4=10)\n\n   Then second restriction: index3: min(8,7)=7, index4: min(10,7)=7 -> [10,8,7,7]\n\n   Then s = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2.\n\n   But wait: the example says the house at spot1 (index1) is 10, spot2 is 8, spot3 is 7, spot4 is 7.\n\n   But note: the example output is 262.\n\n   However, the example input says: \n        \"In the second example, there are 4 houses, the maximum height of a house is 10, and there are 2 restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from 2 to 3 must be at most 8. The second restriction says the tallest house from 3 to 4 must be at most 7.\"\n\n   So the example builds houses with heights [10,8,7,7]. \n\n   But wait: the example input did not specify a restriction for the first house? Then according to our method, the first house is set to h=10. And the example says that's allowed.\n\n   Therefore, the example is consistent.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   Submit the code.\n\n   However, wait: what if a restriction has x_val greater than h? The problem says 0<=x_i<=h, so no.\n\n   Therefore, we don't need to worry.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with specific zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. Each house's height must comply with all zoning restrictions that apply to its spot, which specify that the tallest house in certain intervals must not exceed a given height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for each spot, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive zoning restriction that includes that spot. Specifically, for each spot, the height must be less than or equal to the minimum value of all the upper bounds specified in the restrictions covering that spot. If no restrictions cover a spot, the maximum height allowed is the global maximum height `h`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By setting each house's height to the maximum allowable value (which is the minimum of all restrictive bounds from covering restrictions), we ensure compliance with all zoning restrictions while maximizing the profit since the square function is increasing for non-negative values.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Reading the number of spots `n`, global maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n   - Initializing an array `arr` where each element is set to `h` (the default maximum height).\n   - For each restriction, updating the corresponding segment in the array to the minimum of the current value and the restriction's upper bound.\n   - Summing the squares of the values in the array to get the total profit.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction by iterating over the affected spots, resulting in a time complexity of O(m * n), where `m` is the number of restrictions and `n` is the number of spots. Given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50), this approach is efficient and feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    h = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    arr = [h] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        r = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        x_val = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            if x_val < arr[i]:\n                arr[i] = x_val\n    \n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total += arr[i] * arr[i]\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the small constraints. The first three values are `n` (number of spots), `h` (global maximum height), and `m` (number of restrictions).\n\n2. **Initialization**: An array `arr` of size `n + 1` is initialized with all elements set to `h`, representing the default maximum height for each spot.\n\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the relevant segment of the array to the minimum value between the current value and the restriction's upper bound. This ensures that all subsequent updates adhere to the most restrictive limit.\n\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is computed by summing the squares of the heights in the array from index 1 to `n`.\n\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging the observation that each spot's maximum allowable height is dictated by the tightest restriction covering it, thus maximizing the profit while ensuring compliance with all zoning rules.",
