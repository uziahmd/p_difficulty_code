Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. But note: we cannot swap '0' and '2' directly.\n\n This means that the relative order of the three digits is constrained by two independent chains:\n   - The '0's and '1's can be rearranged arbitrarily relative to each other (because swapping adjacent '0' and '1' allows any permutation of these two).\n   - Similarly, the '1's and '2's can be rearranged arbitrarily.\n\n However, the catch is that the '1's are common in both chains. So we can think of having two independent orders:\n\n But note: we cannot swap a '0' and a '2' directly. So the positions of the '0's and '2's are not independent.\n\n Actually, consider: \n   - The swaps allowed are only between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'.\n   - Therefore, we can move a '0' arbitrarily leftwards (by swapping with ones) until we hit the beginning or a non-'1' (like '2') on the left?\n   - Similarly, we can move a '2' arbitrarily rightwards (by swapping with ones) until we hit the end or a non-'1' (like '0') on the right?\n\n However, we cannot move a '0' past a '2' because to do so we would need to swap a '0' and a '2' at some point, which is not allowed. Similarly, we cannot move a '2' past a '0'.\n\n Therefore, the relative order of the zeros and twos must remain fixed? Not exactly: note that there might be ones in between. But actually, the zeros and twos can be separated by ones arbitrarily.\n\n Alternate approach: think of the entire string as being composed of three types: 0, 1, 2.\n\n We can break down the problem as follows:\n\n Since we can swap adjacent 0-1 and 1-2 arbitrarily, we can independently sort the 0s and 2s with respect to the 1s? \n\n However, note that the relative order of the zeros and twos is fixed by the requirement that zeros can only pass through ones (and similarly for twos). This is similar to having two separate arrays for zeros and twos that can be interleaved arbitrarily with the ones, but the zeros must all come before the twos? Actually, no: consider that we have a '0' and a '2' separated by several ones. We can move the '0' to the left arbitrarily and the '2' to the right arbitrarily, but if we have a '0' to the left of a '2' and they are separated by ones, then we cannot make the '2' go to the left of the '0' without moving the '0' and the '2' through the same ones? Actually, we can: because the '0' can move left past ones, and the '2' can move right past ones, but what if we have a situation:\n\n Example: \"012\"\n\n We can do:\n   Swap the middle '1' and the '2': becomes \"021\"\n   Then swap the '0' and the '2'? But wait, we cannot swap '0' and '2'. So from \"012\" we can only get:\n        Option 1: leave it as \"012\"\n        Option 2: swap the first two: \"102\"\n        Option 3: swap the last two: \"021\"\n\n Now, lexicographically, the smallest is \"012\", but wait: \"012\" vs \"021\" vs \"102\": \n   \"012\": first char '0'\n   \"021\": first char '0'\n   \"102\": first char '1'\n\n So the minimal is \"012\". However, we can also get \"012\" from the original by doing nothing. \n\n But note: we can also get \"021\" by swapping the last two. Is that minimal? No, because \"012\" < \"021\".\n\n How about we try to push all zeros to the left, then all ones, then all twos? But wait, we cannot swap zeros and twos. So we cannot put a zero after a two. \n\n Actually, we can use the ones to help. Consider: \n   We can move zeros to the left arbitrarily (swapping with ones) and we can move twos to the right arbitrarily (swapping with ones). However, if we have a zero and a two, then we cannot change their relative order because to move the two to the left of the zero, we would have to swap the two and the zero (which is not allowed) and also",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing any number of adjacent swaps between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key observation here is that while '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, their relative positions can be influenced through intermediate '1's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. This means '0's can move left past '1's, and '2's can move right past '1's. However, '0's and '2's cannot pass each other directly unless separated by '1's.\n2. **Insight**: The optimal solution involves grouping all '0's at the beginning, followed by '1's, and then '2's. However, because '0's and '2's can only interact through '1's, we need to ensure that '0's are placed as far left as possible and '2's as far right as possible, with '1's in between.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We can use a two-pass approach:\n   - **First Pass**: Traverse the string from left to right, collecting all '0's into a result list. During this pass, whenever we encounter a '0', we note its position and the number of '1's encountered so far.\n   - **Second Pass**: Traverse the string from right to left, collecting all '2's into the result list. Similarly, note their positions and the number of '1's encountered.\n4. **Combining Results**: After processing both passes, the remaining characters (which must be '1's) are appended to the result list. This ensures the final string has all '0's first, followed by '1's, and then '2's, which is the lexicographically smallest configuration possible under the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    res = []\n    count_ones = 0\n    zeros_to_add = []\n    twos_to_add = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            zeros_to_add.append(i)\n        elif s[i] == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == '2':\n            twos_to_add.append(i)\n\n    j = 0\n    k = 0\n    m = len(zeros_to_add)\n    p = len(twos_to_add)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if j < m and i == zeros_to_add[j]:\n            res.append('0')\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            if i < n:\n                res.append(s[i])\n            else:\n                break\n\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if k < p and i == twos_to_add[p-1-k]:\n            res.append('2')\n            k += 1\n            p -= 1\n        else:\n            if i >= 0:\n                res.append(s[i])\n            else:\n                break\n\n    print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input string is read and its length is noted. Three lists are initialized: `res` to store the result, `zeros_to_add` to keep track of indices of '0's, and `twos_to_add` for '2's. A counter `count_ones` is used to count '1's during the first pass.\n2. **Left-to-Right Pass**: The string is traversed from left to right. For each '0' encountered, its index is recorded in `zeros_to_add`. The count of '1's is incremented for each '1' found.\n3. **Right-to-Left Pass**: The string is traversed from right to left. Each '2' encountered is recorded in `twos_to_add`.\n4. **Building Result**: The result list is constructed by first placing all '0's (in their original order) followed by the remaining characters (which are '1's and any unprocessed characters). Then, '2's are placed at the end (in reverse order of their original positions to maintain their relative order correctly).\n5. **Output**: The constructed result list is joined into a string and printed, which is the lexicographically smallest string achievable under the given constraints.",
