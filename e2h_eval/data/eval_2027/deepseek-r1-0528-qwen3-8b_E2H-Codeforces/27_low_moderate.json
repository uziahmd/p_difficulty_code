On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. We want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNS) in the resulting sequence.\n\n Observation:\n Since the array only contains 1 and 2, a non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a contiguous (or non-contiguous) sequence of 1's followed by 2's.\n\n However, note that the entire sequence is just 1's and 2's, so the LNS can be broken down as:\n\n Option 1: The entire sequence might be non-decreasing (if we have all 1's or all 2's, or a mix of 1's then 2's).\n\n But we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. So we can change the arrangement of 1's and 2's arbitrarily? Not exactly: reversing an interval will swap some 1's and 2's in that segment.\n\n However, note that the goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. In fact, the entire sequence after reversal must be considered.\n\n Let's denote:\n   total_ones = total number of 1s\n   total_twos = total number of 2s\n\n In the best scenario, we would like to have as many 1's as possible at the beginning and then 2's. But note: we are allowed one reversal.\n\n Without reversal, the best LNS is min(total_ones + total_twos, ...) but actually, without reversal, the best is the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing, or we can break it into two parts: the 1's and then 2's.\n\n Actually, without reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is simply the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can take all the 1's and then the 2's. But wait: we can also have a mix. However, because the only two numbers are 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is:\n\n   LNS = (number of 1's in the left part of the sequence that are not reversed) + (number of 2's in the right part of the sequence that are not reversed) ?\n\n But note: the reversal operation can change the order arbitrarily in the chosen interval. However, the reversal operation is limited to one contiguous interval.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider that the reversal operation can help to fix the ordering of 1's and 2's. In fact, the goal is to have as many 1's as possible at the beginning and as many 2's as possible at the end.\n\n Without reversal, the sequence is fixed. With reversal, we can choose one contiguous segment to reverse. This reversal can help to bring 1's from the right to the left and 2's from the left to the right.\n\n We can consider that the final sequence should consist of:\n   Some 1's (from the original and from the reversal) at the beginning, then 2's (from the original and from the reversal) at the end.\n\n The reversal operation can be used to \"gather\" 1's from scattered positions and put them together at the beginning, and similarly for 2's at the end.\n\n However, note that the reversal is contiguous. So we are going to reverse a contiguous segment. This means that we can only reverse a contiguous set of elements.\n\n We can think of the problem as: we want to assign a direction (forward or backward) to each element such that at most one contiguous segment is reversed (the rest remains forward). Then we wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (which in this case is the entire sequence if we have all 1's then all 2's, otherwise we can take the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing, but note: the entire sequence might not be non-decreasing even if we have all 1's then 2's? Actually, the entire sequence being non-decreasing is having 1's then 2's. So the goal is to have the entire sequence as non-decreasing? Not necessarily: we are allowed to have a non-decreasing subsequence that is not contiguous. However, note that the entire sequence is only 1 and 2. So the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing (i.e., no 2 comes before a 1). Otherwise, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between:\n   - the number of 1's (if there are no 2's, then the entire sequence is non-decreasing)\n   - the number of 2's (if there are no 1's, then the entire sequence is non-decreasing)\n   - but more generally, if we break the sequence into two parts: the first part has all the 1's and the second part has all the 2's, then the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (containing only 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous interval. The key observation here is that the optimal LNDS will either be the entire sequence if it can be made non-decreasing by reversing one interval, or a combination of all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Analysis**: The sequence consists of 1s and 2s. A non-decreasing subsequence in such a sequence must start with 1s and end with 2s. The goal is to maximize the length of this subsequence by reversing one contiguous interval.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution involves transforming the sequence into one where all 1s come before all 2s. The reversal operation allows us to adjust the positions of 1s and 2s within one contiguous segment.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Case 1**: If the entire sequence is already non-decreasing (i.e., all 1s followed by all 2s), the answer is simply the length of the sequence.\n   - **Case 2**: Otherwise, we consider reversing an interval to gather all 1s to the left and all 2s to the right. The maximum LNDS will then be the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s, but constrained by the sequence length.\n4. **Edge Handling**: Handle edge cases where the sequence is entirely 1s or entirely 2s, which trivially result in the entire sequence being the LNDS.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    total_ones = sum(arr)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    if total_ones == 0 or total_twos == 0:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    left_ones = [0] * n\n    right_twos = [0] * n\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0:\n            left_ones[i] = 1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0\n        else:\n            left_ones[i] = left_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n            \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if i == n-1:\n            right_twos[i] = 1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0\n        else:\n            right_twos[i] = right_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n            \n    best = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            ones_left = left_ones[i-1] if i > 0 else 0\n            twos_right = right_twos[j+1] if j < n-1 else 0\n            \n            ones_in_interval = left_ones[j] - (left_ones[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else 0)\n            twos_in_interval = (total_twos - (right_twos[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else 0)) - (total_twos - (right_twos[j])) if j < n-1 else (total_twos - (right_twos[i-1] if i-1 >= 0 else 0))\n            \n            current_ones = ones_left + ones_in_interval\n            current_twos = twos_right + twos_in_interval\n            total_length = current_ones + current_twos\n            if total_length > best:\n                best = total_length\n                \n    if best == 0:\n        best = total_ones + total_twos\n        \n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values and checks if the sequence is empty or consists entirely of one type of element (all 1s or all 2s). In such cases, the answer is simply the length of the sequence.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: The code computes two arrays, `left_ones` and `right_twos`, which store the cumulative counts of 1s from the start up to each index and 2s from each index to the end, respectively.\n3. **Interval Processing**: The code then iterates over all possible contiguous intervals. For each interval, it calculates the number of 1s to the left of the interval and 2s to the right. The number of 1s and 2s within the interval is derived by subtracting the counts outside the interval from the total counts.\n4. **Maximization**: The maximum length of the LNDS is determined by summing the 1s from the left part and the 2s from the right part, considering all possible intervals. The result is printed as the maximum value found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios where reversing a single contiguous interval could maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the binary sequence.",
