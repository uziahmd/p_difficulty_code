They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string s of length n.\n The tournament has 2^n teams, with skill levels being a permutation of [1, 2, ..., 2^n].\n The string s has n characters. Each character at index i (0-indexed) corresponds to the result pattern for the (n-i)-th phase?\n But note: the problem says:\n   In the first phase (which is the initial one with 2^(n-1) games), we have the string s[0] (if we consider the first character as index0).\n   Then the next phase (if there is one) would be the next character.\n\n However, note the description: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\"\n   \"if s_i is equal to 1, then during the i-th phase, the team with the higher skill level wins\"\n\n The tournament has n phases? Actually, we start with 2^n teams and end with 1. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half (until the last one). So we have exactly n phases.\n\n Steps:\n\n We are to determine all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p (which is the entire set of skills) for which the tournament ends with the team of skill x.\n\n How does the tournament work?\n   In the first phase (i=0): we have 2^n teams. They are arranged in order: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), ... (2^n-1 vs 2^n).\n   Then, depending on s[0]:\n        if s[0]=='0': the lower skill wins -> so the winner of the first match is min(1,2), but wait: our permutation p is arbitrary? \n\n Wait: note the problem says \"You are given a string s\" and we are to find x such that there exists a permutation p (which assigns the skills 1 to 2^n to the teams) that makes the tournament outcome x.\n\n However, the catch: the tournament structure is fixed (bracket order) and the outcomes in each phase are determined by s.\n\n Important: the initial bracket is fixed: the teams are arranged in increasing index order (but the permutation p can assign any skill to any team). \n\n Let me restate: We have 2^n distinct numbers (from 1 to 2^n). We assign them arbitrarily to the teams (which are initially in positions 1 to 2^n). Then the tournament proceeds by:\n\n   Phase 0: 2^n teams, grouped into 2^(n-1) matches: \n        Match 0: Team 1 vs Team 2\n        Match 1: Team 3 vs Team 4\n        ...\n        Match k: Team (2k+1) vs Team (2k+2)\n\n   Then, in each subsequent phase, the remaining teams are again arranged in increasing order (by their original index) and grouped.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the grouping in the next phases. However, from the example: \n        After the first phase, we have 2^(n-1) winners. Then in the second phase, the next set of games: \n        \"the winner of the game '1 vs 2' plays against the winner of the game '3 vs 4'\", meaning that the next bracket groups the first two winners together, then the next two, etc.\n\n So the bracket is fixed: the matches are always between consecutive winners in the previous round, and the ordering of the teams (by their original index) is preserved.\n\n But wait: the assignment of skills is arbitrary. So we can assign the highest skill to any team we want. However, the outcome of each match depends on the relative skill of the two teams in that match and the character in s for that phase.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Observation: The tournament is a single elimination bracket. The champion must win all the rounds. \n\n However, the condition for each round is given by s. The problem asks: which x (skill level) can be the champion?\n\n Alternate idea: simulate the tournament for a given x and a given s? But we don't know the permutation. \n\n But note: we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose which team gets which skill. However, the condition for each round is fixed (either by skill or by reverse skill).\n\n We can think of the tournament as having n rounds (phases). In each round, the matches are predetermined (by the bracket) and the outcome is determined by the rule (s[i]): either the lower or the higher skill wins.\n\n We wish to know: for which x (from 1 to 2^n) can we assign the skills so that the team with skill x wins the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all possible integers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation \\( p \\) of the skills \\( 1 \\) to \\( 2^n \\) where the team with skill \\( x \\) wins the tournament. The tournament consists of \\( n \\) phases, each phase reducing the number of teams by half. The outcome of each match in a phase is determined by the corresponding character in the input string \\( s \\): '0' means the lower skill wins, and '1' means the higher skill wins.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured as a single-elimination bracket. Each phase halves the number of teams, starting from \\( 2^n \\) teams down to 1. The key insight is that for a team with skill \\( x \\) to win, it must survive all phases. The challenge is to determine which \\( x \\) can potentially win given the fixed bracket and the outcome rules specified by \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves simulating the tournament for each possible \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) under the given outcome rules. For each \\( x \\), we check if there exists a permutation \\( p \\) such that \\( x \\) wins all its matches. The permutation must assign skills such that \\( x \\) wins against all opponents in each phase according to the rules.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Iterating over each candidate \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\).\n   - For each \\( x \\), simulate the tournament by maintaining a list of potential opponents (skills) that could face \\( x \\) in each phase.\n   - In each phase, based on the rule (0 or 1), determine if \\( x \\) can defeat its required opponents. If at any point \\( x \\) cannot win, mark it as invalid.\n   - Collect all valid \\( x \\) values and output them in ascending order.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each of the \\( 2^n \\) possible \\( x \\) values. For each \\( x \\), it processes up to \\( n \\) phases, each involving comparisons with other skills. Given \\( n \\) can be up to 18, the total number of operations is manageable (since \\( 2^{18} = 262,144 \\), and each simulation involves at most 18 phases).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    num_teams = 2 ** n\n    \n    results = []\n    for x in range(1, num_teams + 1):\n        current_phase = 0\n        valid = True\n        opponents = [i for i in range(1, num_teams + 1) if i != x]\n        remaining_opponents = opponents\n        \n        while len(remaining_opponents) > 0 and valid:\n            num_matches = len(remaining_opponents) // 2\n            bracket = []\n            for i in range(num_matches):\n                bracket.append([remaining_opponents[2*i], remaining_opponents[2*i + 1]])\n            \n            next_round = []\n            for match in bracket:\n                if s[current_phase] == '1':\n                    winner = max(match)\n                else:\n                    winner = min(match)\n                next_round.append(winner)\n            remaining_opponents = next_round\n            current_phase += 1\n            \n        if valid and len(remaining_opponents) == 0:\n            results.append(x)\n            \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, sorted(results))))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer \\( n \\) (number of phases) and a string \\( s \\) (outcome rules for each phase).\n2. **Initialization**: Calculate the total number of teams as \\( 2^n \\). Initialize a list to store valid winning integers.\n3. **Simulating Tournament for Each \\( x \\)**:\n   - For each candidate \\( x \\) (skill level), start with all other skills as potential opponents.\n   - For each phase, group the remaining opponents into matches. The winner of each match is determined by the current phase's rule (0 or 1).\n   - If \\( x \\) survives all phases (i.e., it is the last remaining team), add it to the results list.\n4. **Output**: Print all valid \\( x \\) values in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each candidate \\( x \\) by leveraging the fixed tournament structure and outcome rules, ensuring correctness through systematic simulation of each phase.",
