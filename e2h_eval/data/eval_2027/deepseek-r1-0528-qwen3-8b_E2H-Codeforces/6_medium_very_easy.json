Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (l, r, cost)\n We need two vouchers i and j such that:\n   (1) They don't intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n   (2) The sum of their durations is exactly x: (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x.\n\n We are to minimize the total cost (cost_i + cost_j).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Note: The duration of a voucher i is d_i = r_i - l_i + 1.\n\n 2. We are looking for two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x.\n\n 3. We can group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we want to keep the minimal cost for a voucher of that duration, but note: there might be multiple vouchers with the same duration and we also have the constraint that they must not overlap.\n\n However, note: even if two vouchers have the same duration, they might overlap in different ways. So we cannot simply take two cheapest from the same duration if they are the same one? Actually, we are allowed to use two different ones (same duration is allowed as long as they don't overlap and together form two parts). But note: two vouchers of the same duration d may be stored in the same bucket, but we have to consider that they must not overlap.\n\n But wait: the problem says two vouchers i and j (i≠j) and they don't intersect.\n\n However, we are grouping by duration. Let's denote:\n   For each duration d, we want to store all vouchers (or at least the ones that are cheap and non-overlapping with others) but note: we don't know which other voucher we are combining with until we fix the other duration.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n  Let d1 + d2 = x. Then d1 can range from 1 to x-1, and d2 = x - d1.\n\n  For each duration d, we want to know the minimal cost for a voucher of duration d, but also we want to ensure that when we combine two vouchers (with durations d and x-d) they do not overlap.\n\n However, note: two vouchers with durations d and x-d might still overlap. Therefore, we cannot simply take the minimal cost for each duration and add them.\n\n We need to consider: for a fixed pair (d, x-d), we need to find two vouchers, one with duration d and one with duration x-d, such that they do not overlap.\n\n But note: the condition for non-overlap is: \n   Either: r1 < l2   OR   r2 < l1.\n\n Since the two vouchers are independent, we have two cases:\n\n   Case 1: First voucher (duration d) ends before the second starts: r1 < l2.\n   Case 2: Second voucher (duration x-d) ends before the first starts: r2 < l1.\n\n We can precompute for each duration d the best (minimal cost) voucher that ends by a certain day (for case 1) and similarly for the other duration.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute an array `min_cost_by_duration` for each duration d from 1 to max_duration (which is up to 200000) but note: x up to 200000, and the voucher's duration is at most 200000.\n\n   However, we cannot just take the minimal cost for each duration because the minimal cost voucher for duration d might not be compatible with any voucher of duration x-d (because of the non-overlap condition).\n\n   Instead, we can:\n\n   - Group the vouchers by duration, and for each duration, we can store:\n        (min_cost, list_of_vouchers)   but then how to check non-overlap?\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute two arrays:\n\n   Let's define:\n      Let A[d] = a list of (l, r, cost) for vouchers of duration d.\n\n   But storing all might be too heavy (n up to 200000, and durations from 1 to 200000, worst-case one voucher per duration, so 200000 buckets, each bucket has about 1 or few elements).\n\n   We need to efficiently query: for a given duration d and a set of vouchers of duration d, and given another set of vouchers of duration x-d, find two vouchers (one from d, one from x-d) that do not overlap and minimize the sum of their costs.\n\n   But note: the condition for non-overlap is that the intervals do not overlap. Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] do not overlap if b < c or d < a.\n\n   We can break the problem into two cases:\n\n   Case 1: The first voucher ends before the second starts: r1 < l2.\n        Then we require: for a voucher (l1, r1) of duration d and a voucher (l2, r2) of duration x-d: r1 < l2.\n\n        We can preprocess for each duration d (and similarly for x-d) to have a structure that allows us to quickly find a voucher in the other group that starts after r1.\n\n   Case 2: The second voucher ends before the first starts: r2 < l1.\n\n        Similarly: for a voucher (l1, r1) of duration d and a voucher (l2, r2) of duration x-d: r2 < l1.\n\n   Then the answer would be the minimum over all pairs (voucher1, voucher2) that satisfy either condition and have durations d and x-d.\n\n   However, the direct iteration over all pairs for a fixed (d, x-d) is too expensive.\n\n   We need to optimize.\n\n   Idea:\n\n   Precomputation for each duration d (from 1 to max_d) we can store:\n        - The minimal cost for a voucher of duration d (but we need more: we need to know the entire interval to check non-overlap)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   For each duration d, we can create two sorted lists (or one list of intervals) and then use binary search to find non-overlapping intervals.\n\n   But note: the total number of vouchers is 200000, and the total distinct durations is at most 200000, but we only care about durations d and x-d.\n\n   However, we cannot iterate over all durations d from 1 to x-1 and for each d look at the set of vouchers of duration d and x-d and then try to match them without overlap.\n\n   We need to restructure the data.\n\n   Another idea:\n\n   Instead, we can consider storing for each duration d:\n\n        best_by_duration[d] = a tuple (min_cost, min_end) ? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, we can store for each duration d:\n\n        Option 1: We want to quickly, for a given end time (or start time) from the other voucher, find the minimal cost voucher in this duration that does not overlap.\n\n   But note: the condition is either the first voucher ends before the second starts, or the second ends before the first starts.\n\n   We can split the two cases and handle separately.\n\n   Let's define:\n\n   For each duration d, we can store two sets of vouchers:\n\n        Set A: the vouchers of duration d, and we sort them by their end time (r) for one purpose and by their start time (l) for the other.\n\n   However, we are going to combine two different durations (d and x-d). So we need to consider:\n\n   Case 1: For a voucher of duration d (with interval [l1, r1]), we look for a voucher of duration x-d (with interval [l2, r2]) such that r1 < l2.\n\n        In this case, we can precompute for duration x-d: an array of all the start times (l2) and then for a given r1, we want the minimal cost voucher in duration x-d that has l2 > r1.\n\n        Similarly, for Case 2: For a voucher of duration x-d (with interval [l2, r2]), we look for a voucher of duration d (with interval [l1, r1]) such that r2 < l1.\n\n   How to do that?\n\n   We can precompute:\n\n        For each duration d (that appears in the input), we store:\n            - All the vouchers (each as (l, r, cost)) and then we can build two structures:\n\n        But note: we are only concerned with durations that are <= x (since d and x-d must be positive and <= x, but note: d and x-d must be at least 1 and at most x-1). Also, we are only going to use durations that are in the input.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and x, then the n lines.\n\n        Step 2: For each voucher (l, r, cost), compute d = r-l+1.\n\n        Step 3: Group the vouchers by d. We'll have a dictionary: \n                groups = defaultdict(list)\n                for each voucher, append (l, r, cost) to groups[d]\n\n        Step 4: Precompute for each duration d (that we have) two things:\n\n                For Case 1 (voucher1 ends before voucher2 starts): \n                    We are going to consider the other duration = x-d (if exists). \n                    We need for duration d: we want to quickly get the minimal cost for a voucher that ends at or below a certain value? Actually, no: in Case 1, the condition is that the voucher of duration d must end before the voucher of duration x-d starts.\n\n                Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n                For each duration d, we can create:\n\n                    - A sorted list of the start times (l) for the vouchers of duration d? Or maybe we need to relate the end time and the cost.\n\n                Actually, we can precompute:\n\n                    For each duration d, we want to be able to answer: \n                        Query1: Given an end time E (from the other voucher), what is the minimal cost of a voucher in duration d that ends before E? Actually, no: in Case 1, we require that the voucher of duration d ends before the voucher of duration x-d starts. So we are matching: for a voucher in duration d, we require its end time < start time of the other.\n\n                But note: we are going to fix the voucher of duration x-d and then look for a voucher in duration d that ends before the start of the x-d voucher.\n\n                Similarly, for Case 2: fix the voucher of duration d and then look for a voucher in duration x-d that ends before the start of the d voucher.\n\n        However, we are going to combine two different groups (d and x-d). So we can:\n\n            Precompute for each duration d (that is in the input) a sorted list of the end times (r) and also store the minimal cost for each voucher? But we want to minimize the total cost.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n            For each duration d, we can create a list of all the vouchers (l, r, cost) and then sort by r (the end time). Then, we can also create a structure that for a given end time E, we can get the minimal cost among all vouchers of duration d that have r <= E. But wait, that is for Case 1: we require the voucher of duration d to end at most E-1 (so that it doesn't overlap with the other starting at E). However, the other voucher starts at E (or later). Actually, we want the voucher of duration d to have r < l2 (the start of the other). \n\n        How about:\n\n            For each duration d, we want to be able to quickly, given a value T (which is the start time of the other voucher), find the minimal cost voucher in duration d that has r < T.\n\n        Similarly, for the other case (Case 2), we want to find the minimal cost voucher in duration d that has r < T, where T is the start time of the voucher from duration d? Actually, no: in Case 2, we have a voucher from duration x-d (say [l2, r2]) and we require that the voucher from duration d starts after r2. So we are looking for a voucher in duration d that has l > r2.\n\n        But note: the condition in Case 2 is: r2 < l1, so for a fixed voucher from duration x-d (which has r2), we want a voucher in duration d that has l1 > r2.\n\n        So we need two types of queries for each duration d:\n\n            Type1 (for Case1): Query by end time (r) being less than a threshold T (T is the start of the other voucher). We want the minimal cost among all vouchers in duration d with r < T.\n\n            Type2 (for Case2): Query by start time (l) being greater than a threshold T (T is the end of the other voucher). We want the minimal cost among all vouchers in duration d with l > T.\n\n        But note: the same voucher might be used in both cases, but we are using two different conditions.\n\n        However, we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n            We can create two separate structures:\n\n            Structure1: keyed by end time (r) and storing the minimal cost for a voucher with a given end time? Actually, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with end time <= some value. So we can:\n\n                Sort the list of vouchers by r (end time) and then create an array of (r, min_cost_so_far) for increasing r. Then we can do a binary search for T (threshold) and then get the minimal cost for all vouchers with r <= T-1 (since we require r < T). But note: we require strictly less than T.\n\n            Similarly, for the start time (l): we can sort by l (start time) and then create an array of (l, min_cost_so_far) for increasing l, and then for a threshold T, we want the minimal cost for vouchers with l > T. That is equivalent to: we can store the entire list and then use a Fenwick tree or segment tree? But note, we are dealing with up to 200000 distinct durations, but each duration might have many vouchers.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n            For each duration d, we have a list of vouchers. We can sort by r (for Type1) and then do:\n\n                sorted_by_r = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])   # x is (l, r, cost)\n                Then, we can create an array `min_cost_by_r` for the sorted_by_r: \n                    Traverse the sorted_by_r and keep a running minimum of cost.\n\n                Then, for a given T, we find the last index where r < T, and then the minimal cost in that prefix is the running minimum at that index.\n\n            Similarly, for Type2 (query by l > T):\n\n                sorted_by_l = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                Then, we can create an array `min_cost_by_l` for the sorted_by_l, but then we want to skip the ones with l <= T. Actually, we can do:\n\n                Alternatively, we can store the entire list and then for a given T, we want the minimal cost among vouchers with l > T.\n\n                We can sort by l and then create an array of (l, cost) and then traverse from the smallest l to the largest, and then use a suffix minimum? Actually, we want the minimal cost for vouchers with l >= some value? \n\n                But note: we want l > T. So we can:\n\n                    sorted_by_l = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                    Then, we can create an array `min_cost_from_right` that stores for each index (from high l to low l) the minimal cost from that point to the end.\n\n                However, we can also do:\n\n                    We can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree for range minimum queries, but note: the constraints are up to 200000, and we have up to 200000 distinct durations, but each duration d might have up to O(n) vouchers. But total n is 200000, so worst-case one duration having 200000 vouchers? Then the sorting and building the array for that duration would be O(n log n) for that duration, and overall O(n log n) for all durations? But the total number of vouchers is 200000, so we are doing this for each distinct duration. The distinct durations might be up to 200000, but then each duration has only a few vouchers (average 1). So worst-case, one duration has 200000 vouchers, and then we do two sorts for that one duration (O(n log n)), which is acceptable because 200000*log(200000) is around 3.5e6 * 2 (two sorts) is acceptable.\n\n        However, we are going to do this for each distinct duration. The total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, and the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum of the sizes of all groups is 200000. So we can do:\n\n            groups = {}\n            for each voucher, d = r-l+1, then append (l, r, cost) to groups[d]\n\n            Then, for each d in groups:\n                list_vouchers = groups[d]\n                sort_list_by_r = sorted(list_vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                Then, build an array for Type1: \n                    sorted_by_r = [(r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in list_vouchers] then sort by r, and then create an array `min_cost_arr` such that min_cost_arr[i] = min(cost for the first i+1 vouchers)\n\n                Similarly, sort_list_by_l = sorted(list_vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                Then, build an array for Type2: \n                    sorted_by_l = [(l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in list_vouchers] then sort by l, and then create an array for the suffix minimum: \n                    Let arr = [ (l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in sorted_list_by_l ] \n                    Then, we can do:\n                        min_from_here = [0]*len(arr)\n                        min_from_here[-1] = arr[-1][1]\n                        for i in range(len(arr)-2, -1, -1):\n                            min_from_here[i] = min(arr[i][1], min_from_here[i+1])\n\n                But note: for Type2, we want the minimal cost for vouchers with l > T. So we can binary search the first index in sorted_by_l such that l > T, and then take min_from_here at that index.\n\n            Then, we can precompute for each duration d two functions:\n\n                query_duration_d_type1(d, T): returns minimal cost for a voucher in d with r < T (if exists, else None or a large number)\n                query_duration_d_type2(d, T): returns minimal cost for a voucher in d with l > T (if exists, else None or a large number)\n\n        Step 5: Then, we iterate over the distinct durations d that are present and for which x-d is also present (or if d == x-d, then we need two distinct vouchers from the same duration? But note: the problem requires two distinct vouchers. However, if d == x-d, then we are looking for two distinct vouchers from the same duration d. But note: the condition for non-overlap must hold. And the two vouchers must be non-overlapping.\n\n        However, the problem states: two distinct vouchers (i != j). So if d == x-d, then we are looking for two distinct vouchers (both of duration d) that do not overlap.\n\n        But note: the condition for non-overlap is the same: either the first ends before the second starts or the second ends before the first starts.\n\n        We can handle the same duration separately.\n\n        Alternatively, we can handle two cases:\n\n            Case A: d != x-d\n            Case B: d == x-d\n\n        However, we can combine: we are iterating d from 1 to x-1, and for each d, we consider the other duration x-d. Then, if d <= x-d, we avoid double counting? Actually, we can iterate d from 1 to floor((x-1)/2) and then consider both (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) if d != x-d? But note: the two vouchers are chosen arbitrarily, so the order matters. Actually, we can consider:\n\n            For each d in the keys of groups:\n                if d <= x-d and (x-d) in groups:\n                    consider the pair (d, x-d)\n\n            But wait: we must consider both orders? Actually, in our conditions, we have two cases: Case1 and Case2. In Case1 we assume the first voucher is from d and the second from x-d, and in Case2 we assume the first is from x-d and the second from d. But note: the condition for Case1 is: the voucher from d must end before the voucher from x-d starts. The condition for Case2 is: the voucher from x-d must end before the voucher from d starts.\n\n        However, if we consider the pair (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) separately, we might do double work. But note: the two conditions are independent and we must check both.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n            For a given d and x-d (with d <= x-d) we do:\n\n                Case1: Use a voucher from d and a voucher from x-d such that (voucher_d.r < voucher_xd.l). Then the total duration is d + (x-d) = x.\n\n                Case2: Use a voucher from x-d and a voucher from d such that (voucher_xd.r < voucher_d.l). Then the total duration is (x-d)+d = x.\n\n            But note: these are two different conditions and we must consider both.\n\n        However, we can also consider: we are going to consider every pair (d, x-d) and then within that, we consider two orders. But to avoid double counting, we can enforce an order (like d <= x-d) and then consider the two cases independently.\n\n        But note: the two conditions are independent and the same two vouchers might be considered in one order and then the other? Actually, no: the two conditions are symmetric in the sense that we are checking two different non-overlap conditions.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            For each d (in the keys) and let d2 = x-d. If d2 is not in the groups, skip.\n\n            Then, if d != d2:\n\n                We consider two cases:\n\n                    Case1: d < d2 (then we consider the pair (d, d2) and the condition is: a voucher from d must end before a voucher from d2 starts.\n\n                    Case2: But wait, we also need to consider the condition in the opposite order? Actually, no: the condition for non-overlap is symmetric. But note: the two conditions are:\n\n                         Condition1: voucher_d.r < voucher_d2.l\n                         Condition2: voucher_d2.r < voucher_d.l\n\n                    These are two distinct conditions. However, we can also consider:\n\n                    Option: We can fix the two vouchers and then check which condition holds. But we are trying to avoid double counting.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider the two cases without regard to d and d2 ordering, but then we must ensure that we don't count the same pair twice. But note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive? Actually, they are not: a pair of intervals might satisfy both conditions? No, because if we have two intervals [a,b] and [c,d], then if b < c and d < a, then we have a < d and b < c, but then a <= d < a -> contradiction. So the two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n\n            But wait, actually they are not: Example: [1,2] and [3,4]: then 2<3 and 4>1, so only the first condition holds. Another example: [1,1] and [3,3]: then 1<3 and 3>1, so again only the first condition holds. Now consider [1,2] and [2,3]: then 2 is not < 2 (first condition fails) and 3 is not < 1 (second condition fails) so they are not disjoint. But note: the condition is \"at least one\" so they are not disjoint? Actually, [1,2] and [2,3] are adjacent and the problem says \"don't intersect\" meaning they must be completely separated. So the condition is strict: they must not share any day. So [1,2] and [2,3] do not satisfy the condition because they share the day 2? Actually, the problem says: \"don't intersect\" and the condition is: either ri < lj or rj < li. Here, ri=2, lj=2 -> 2<2 is false, and rj=3, li=1 -> 3<1 is false, so they do not satisfy. \n\n            Therefore, the two conditions are mutually exclusive and cover all disjoint pairs.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            For each distinct d (from 1 to x-1) such that d <= x-d and d in groups and x-d in groups:\n\n                Consider Case1: \n                    We want to find a voucher from d (say A) and a voucher from x-d (say B) such that A.r < B.l.\n\n                    We can iterate over the vouchers in x-d? But that is too slow.\n\n                Alternatively, we can:\n\n                    Precomputed for duration d: a structure for Type1 (by end time) and for duration x-d: a structure for Type2 (by start time) ?\n\n                Actually, we can use:\n\n                    For a fixed d and x-d (with d<=x-d):\n\n                    Case1: \n                        We need to find a voucher in d (with minimal cost) that ends before a voucher in x-d starts. But we can fix a voucher in x-d and then use the structure for d to find a voucher that ends before the start of the x-d voucher.\n\n                    But we want the minimal total cost.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    For Case1: \n                        We want to minimize (cost_d + cost_xd) for a voucher d and a voucher xd such that d.r < xd.l.\n\n                        We can fix the xd voucher and then use the structure for d to get the minimal cost for a voucher in d with end time < xd.l.\n\n                        Then, we iterate over all xd vouchers (which are in duration x-d) and for each xd voucher (l, r, cost_xd) we do:\n\n                            candidate = query_duration_d_type1(d, l)   # This returns the minimal cost for a voucher in d with r < l (because xd starts at l, so we require d voucher ends before l)\n\n                        Then, total_cost = candidate + cost_xd, and we take the minimum.\n\n                    Similarly, for Case2 (for the same pair (d, x-d)):\n\n                        We want to minimize (cost_d + cost_xd) for a voucher xd and a voucher d such that xd.r < d.l.\n\n                        We can fix the d voucher and then use the structure for x-d to get the minimal cost for a voucher in x-d with start time > d.r.\n\n                        Then, for each d voucher (l, r, cost_d) we do:\n\n                            candidate = query_duration_xd_type2(x-d, r)   # returns minimal cost for a voucher in x-d with l > r\n\n                        Then, total_cost = cost_d + candidate, and we take the minimum.\n\n                But note: we have two structures for each duration: one for Type1 (query by end time) and one for Type2 (query by start time).\n\n            However, the problem: the total number of vouchers is 200000, and we are iterating over all vouchers in x-d for Case1 and all vouchers in d for Case2, which is |x-d| + |d|, and then we do this for each distinct d (with d<=x-d). The total distinct d is about O(x) which is 200000, and the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum of the sizes of all groups is 200000. But we are iterating for each distinct d (which is at most 200000) and for each d we iterate over the entire group of d and the entire group of x-d. Then the total work is O(n^2) because we are iterating over each distinct d and then over each voucher in d and x-d.\n\n        We need to optimize.\n\n        Alternative approach for Case1:\n\n            Instead of iterating over every voucher in x-d, we can precompute for duration d the minimal cost for any voucher (regardless of the end time) and then combine with the condition that the d voucher must end before the x-d voucher starts.\n\n            But note: we cannot: because the condition depends on the start of the x-d voucher.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            For Case1: \n                We have two sets: \n                    D: all vouchers of duration d, each represented by (l_d, r_d, cost_d) and we have sorted by r_d and built a structure for Type1 (minimal cost for vouchers with r < T).\n                    X: all vouchers of duration x-d, each represented by (l_x, r_x, cost_x).\n\n                Then, we want to minimize (cost_d + cost_x) for (d_voucher, x_voucher) such that d_voucher.r < x_voucher.l.\n\n                We can iterate over the x_vouchers and for each x_voucher, we query the minimal cost_d for d_vouchers with r < x_voucher.l.\n\n                Then, the total cost is candidate_d + cost_x.\n\n                Similarly for Case2: \n                    We iterate over the d_vouchers and for each d_voucher, we query the minimal cost_x for x_vouchers (of duration x-d) with l > d_voucher.r.\n\n                Then, we take the minimum of these two cases.\n\n            The total work for Case1 is O(|X| * log(|D|)) because the query in D is a binary search and then a lookup in the precomputed array for D.\n\n            Similarly for Case2: O(|D| * log(|X|)).\n\n            Then, we do this for each distinct d (with d <= x-d). The total distinct d is at most 200000, but note: the total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum over d of (|D| + |X-d|) is 200000 (each voucher is counted once in its own duration and once in x-d? Actually, no: we are iterating d and x-d, and the same voucher appears in one duration. But note: we are processing each distinct d once (with d<=x-d). The total work is:\n\n                For each distinct d (with d<=x-d and both d and x-d exist), we do:\n\n                    Work1 = |X-d| * log(|D|)\n                    Work2 = |D| * log(|X-d|)\n\n                Then, the total work is the sum_{d} [ |D| * log(|X-d|) + |X-d| * log(|D|) ]\n\n            But note: the total number of distinct d is at most 200000, and the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the maximum size of a group is 200000. However, the sum of the sizes of the groups is 200000, so the worst-case is that one group has 200000 and the rest have 0. Then, the distinct d is only one? Actually, no: we are iterating over distinct d for which both d and x-d exist.\n\n            The total work might be O(n^2) in the worst-case because if we have many distinct d (each with a non-empty group) and each group has about sqrt(n) elements, then the total work is O(n^(3/2))? Actually, we cannot guarantee that.\n\n            But note: the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum_{d} |D| = 200000. Similarly, the sum_{d} |X-d| is also 200000 (because each voucher is assigned to one duration). However, we are iterating over distinct d (and each distinct d is processed once). The inner loop is over the size of the group for x-d and the group for d. But note: the same voucher is in one group. The total work is:\n\n                Sum_{d: d<=x-d and d,x-d in groups} [ |D| * log(|X-d|) + |X-d| * log(|D|) ]\n\n            Since the total number of distinct d is at most 200000, but the groups are disjoint and the total vouchers is 200000, the worst-case is that we have many small groups. The worst-case for the inner loop is when one group is large and the other is small. But the total work is bounded by:\n\n                For a fixed voucher, it appears in one group. When we process a distinct d, we are processing two groups (d and x-d). The total work for a fixed d is O(|D| + |X-d|) * log (max(|D|, |X-d|)). \n\n            The total work over all d is the sum_{d} [ |D| * log(|X-d|) + |X-d| * log(|D|) ].\n\n            But note: the same voucher is contained in one group and will be used in the query for other groups (x-d). However, the total number of queries is the sum_{d} (|D| + |X-d|) = 2 * (total vouchers) = 400000, because each voucher is in one group and is queried once for each distinct d that is its complement? Actually, no: we are processing each distinct d once, and for each d we query the entire group of x-d (for Case1) and the entire group of d (for Case2). \n\n            But note: the same voucher might be used in multiple pairs? \n\n            Example: a voucher of duration d1 is used in the group d1. Then, it will be used in the query for all distinct d such that x-d = d1? Actually, no: we are processing d, and the other group is x-d. So the same voucher is used only when the other duration is x-d1. And d1 is fixed. So we are processing d = d1 and d = (x-d1)? Actually, we are processing d and x-d. So the same voucher is used only in the group of d1, and then when we process d1 and x-d1 (if d1 <= x-d1) then we use the entire group d1 for Case2 (if d1 <= x-d1) and the entire group x-d1 for Case1. Then, if d1 != x-d1, then we also process d2 = x-d1 and then we use the entire group d2 for Case1 and the entire group d1 (again) for Case2? \n\n            Actually, we are processing each distinct d (with d<=x-d) only once. And the groups are fixed. So the same voucher is used in multiple queries? \n\n            Example: \n                n=2, x=4, \n                voucher1: (1,2,10) -> duration=2\n                voucher2: (3,4,20) -> duration=2\n\n                Then, d1=2, x-d1=2. Then we process d=2 (since 2<=2). Then we do:\n\n                    Case1: for each voucher in x-d (which is 2) we query d (which is 2) for vouchers with r < l (of the x-d voucher). \n                    Case2: for each voucher in d (which is 2) we query x-d (which is 2) for vouchers with l > r (of the d voucher).\n\n                Then, we use each voucher twice: once as d and once as x-d (but they are the same group). \n\n            But note: we are storing the same group for d and x-d (if d==x-d). Then, we are querying the same group twice (for the same set of vouchers). \n\n            However, we must be cautious: the condition for non-overlap requires two distinct vouchers. So if d == x-d, then we are looking for two distinct vouchers in the same group. Then, we must not use the same voucher twice.\n\n            How do we handle that? \n\n            In our query for Case1 (when d==x-d) for a fixed x-d voucher, we query the entire group d for a voucher with r < l (of the x-d voucher). But note: the x-d voucher is in the same group. Then, we must not include the same voucher? Actually, the problem says two distinct vouchers. So in the query for a fixed voucher (say v) from the same group, we should not consider v itself? \n\n            But note: the condition is that the two vouchers are distinct. However, the condition for non-overlap is defined for two distinct intervals. \n\n            How to avoid using the same voucher twice? \n\n            In the query for Case1 (when d==x-d) for a voucher v (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping the vouchers by their duration and then checking for compatible pairs that meet the non-overlapping condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration (i.e., `r_i - l_i + 1`). This allows us to quickly access all vouchers of a specific duration.\n2. **Preprocessing for Efficient Queries**: For each duration group, we preprocess the vouchers to enable efficient queries. Specifically:\n   - **Type1 Query**: For a given threshold `T`, find the minimal cost voucher that ends before `T` (i.e., `r < T`).\n   - **Type2 Query**: For a given threshold `T`, find the minimal cost voucher that starts after `T` (i.e., `l > T`).\n3. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d` and its complement `x - d` (if it exists), we check two cases:\n   - **Case 1**: A voucher from duration `d` ends before a voucher from duration `x - d` starts.\n   - **Case 2**: A voucher from duration `x - d` ends before a voucher from duration `d` starts.\n   For each case, we use the preprocessed structures to find the minimal total cost efficiently.\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no valid pair is found, we return `-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val))\n    \n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for (l, r, cost_val) in vouchers:\n        d = r -

**Type1 Structure**: Sorted by end day with a prefix minimum cost array for efficient querying of the cheapest voucher ending before a given day.\n   - **Type2 Structure**: Sorted by start day with a suffix minimum cost array for efficient querying of the cheapest voucher starting after a given day.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each duration `d` and its complement `x - d`, the solution checks two cases (vouchers ending before the other starts or vice versa) using the preprocessed structures to find the minimal total cost.\n5. **Output**: The minimal total cost is printed if valid pairs are found; otherwise, `-1` is printed indicating no solution exists.",
