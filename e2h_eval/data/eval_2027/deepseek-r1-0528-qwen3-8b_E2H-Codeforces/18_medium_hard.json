The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given m, a, b (with m up to 10^9 and a, b up to 10^5)\n The frog starts at 0. From k, it can jump to k+a or k-b (if k-b >= 0).\n\n We define f(x) = number of distinct integers the frog can reach that are in [0, x].\n\n However, note: the frog doesn't have to visit all in one trip, so we are counting all reachable numbers from 0 that are <= x.\n\n But note: the frog can jump backwards (k-b) but only if the result is nonnegative.\n\n Observation:\n The frog can only reach numbers that are linear combinations (with coefficients being integers) of a and b, but with the constraint that we never leave [0, x] and we start from 0.\n\n Actually, the moves are: adding a and subtracting b. But note: we cannot go negative, so we must ensure that the backward jumps are only taken when the result is nonnegative.\n\n However, note the problem says \"the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from 0\", meaning we can use multiple jumps. But the backward jump (k-b) must be nonnegative.\n\n How to characterize the set of positions?\n\n Let's denote by S the set of positions reachable from 0 without leaving [0, âˆž). Then we are interested in the intersection of S with [0, x] for each x.\n\n But note: the frog can also stop at any time.\n\n Actually, we can model the reachable set as:\n\n  Start at 0.\n\n  Then we can get to:\n    0 + t*a - s*b   (for nonnegative integers t, s) such that the entire path never goes below 0.\n\n However, note: the backward jumps (k-b) must be done only when the current position is at least b. Moreover, we can interleave the jumps arbitrarily.\n\n Alternate approach: consider the equation: \n   n = t*a - s*b, and we require that during the entire process the frog never goes negative.\n\n But note: we can also think of the frog as having a net displacement of t*a - s*b, but the condition is that the minimum value along the path is nonnegative.\n\n However, there is a known way to model such problems: we can consider the state as (nonnegative steps) and the minimal representation.\n\n Another idea: since a and b are fixed, we can consider the set of positions modulo some base. But note that the constraints on m (up to 10^9) and a,b (up to 10^5) suggest we need a mathematical formula.\n\n Let's analyze the first example: m=7, a=5, b=3.\n\n We are to compute f(0) to f(7):\n\n f(0): {0} -> 1\n f(1): {0,1?} -> Actually, from 0 we can only jump to 5 (forward) or -3 (invalid). So at step 0, we have 0. Then we cannot jump to 1 because we don't have a way to get 1? But wait, note the problem says \"distinct integers\" that the frog can reach in [0,x]. \n\n However, note: we are allowed to do multiple jumps. But the backward jump requires the frog to have at least b (so 3) to jump back. \n\n Let me list the reachable numbers:\n\n 0: yes.\n\n Then from 0, we can jump to 5 (since 0+a=5) and then from 5 we can jump to 5-3=2 (if we don't mind going to 2) and then from 2 we can jump to 2+5=7. Also from 5 we can jump again to 5+5=10 (but then for x>=10 we would have 10). But wait, the problem does not require consecutive jumps to form a contiguous set.\n\n Actually, let's see:\n\n We can also jump backwards from 5 to 2, then from 2 we can jump forward to 7. Then from 7 we can jump backwards to 4, then from 4 to 9, etc.\n\n But note: the problem says \"never jumps on an integer outside [0,x]\" for the entire journey? Actually, the definition is: the frog can reach a number if there exists a sequence of jumps that stays in [0,x] (but note: the entire journey must stay in [0,x] for the particular x we are considering). However, we are computing f(x) independently for each x.\n\n But note: the problem says \"if it never jumps on an integer outside [0,x]\". This means for a fixed x, the frog is confined to [0,x]. Therefore, the set of reachable numbers for a fixed x is the set of nonnegative integers n (<=x) for which there exist nonnegative integers t, s such that:\n\n   n = t*a - s*b   (net displacement)\n\n and the entire path (without exceeding x) is possible.\n\n However, the catch: we must have that the minimal position in the path is nonnegative. But note that we can rearrange the jumps arbitrarily? Actually, we can choose the order. The key is: we can only use a forward jump from a nonnegative position, and backward jumps only if the resulting position is nonnegative (and within [0,x]).\n\n Alternatively, we can use the concept of invariant: the set of reachable numbers is the set of numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo g (where g = gcd(a,b)) and lie in the interval [0, x] ... but wait, that is if we were allowed to use negative numbers arbitrarily. Here, we have nonnegativity condition.\n\n Actually, consider: the frog starts at 0. The moves are adding a and subtracting b. The set of numbers that can be reached (without the nonnegativity constraint) is the set of multiples of g (g = gcd(a,b)) that are between -infinity and infinity. But with the nonnegativity constraint, we can only reach nonnegative multiples of g, but also we must be able to form that number without going negative.\n\n However, note: we can also get numbers that are not multiples of g? Only multiples of g can be reached (because a and b are multiples of g, so the linear combinations are multiples of g). Therefore, the set of reachable numbers (in the entire nonnegative line) is the set of numbers of the form t*a - s*b >= 0.\n\n But note: we cannot necessarily reach every nonnegative multiple of g. For example, if a=5, b=3, then g=1. Then we can reach every integer? Not exactly: we have to avoid negative intermediate states.\n\n However, we can use a different representation: we can think of the state as (r, min_value) but that seems too heavy.\n\n Insight:\n\n Let g = gcd(a, b). Then the frog can only reach multiples of g. So the set of reachable numbers (without the nonnegative path constraint) is the set of multiples of g. But the nonnegative path constraint complicates things.\n\n However, note that we can also consider the problem as: we are allowed to do any number of forward and backward jumps, but we must never drop below 0.\n\n We can model the problem as a graph where nodes are integers and edges are forward and backward jumps (if the backward jump doesn't go negative). Then the set of reachable numbers is the set of multiples of g that are nonnegative and can be obtained by starting at 0 and using these operations without ever dropping below 0.\n\n But note: we can also get stuck if we overshoot. However, because we can do backward jumps arbitrarily as long as we don't go negative, we can actually \"simulate\" the entire set of multiples of g that are nonnegative and that are less than or equal to some maximum (which is unbounded in the positive direction) but bounded by x.\n\n However, there is a catch: we might not be able to reach all multiples of g. Consider: we start at 0, then we can go to a (if a<=x) and then from a we can go to a-b (if a>=b) and then from a-b we can go to a-b+a, etc. But note: we can also mix arbitrarily.\n\n Actually, we can reach a number n (a multiple of g) if and only if there exist nonnegative integers t, s such that:\n\n   n = t*a - s*b   and   t*a - s*b >= 0\n\n and moreover, the minimal value along the path (when we break down the jumps) is nonnegative. However, note: we can rearrange the jumps arbitrarily. The minimal value we encounter in the entire sequence is determined by the ordering.\n\n But note: the minimal value is at least 0 by the rules. However, we are allowed to interleave arbitrarily. In fact, we can postpone the backward jumps until we have enough forward jumps to cover them.\n\n There is a known result: the set of numbers that can be formed (without the nonnegative constraint) is the set of multiples of g. With the nonnegative constraint, we can only form the multiples of g that are nonnegative and that are at most ... actually, we can form arbitrarily large numbers by repeatedly adding a (if we have enough to subtract in between) but wait, we can also use negative jumps arbitrarily as long as we don't go negative.\n\n However, consider: we can use the following strategy: to form a multiple of g, say n, we can use t and s such that t*a - s*b = n. But we must have that the entire process never goes negative. One way to ensure that is to have t*a >= s*b (which is given by n>=0) and also that at no point the cumulative subtraction exceeds the cumulative addition.\n\n But note: we can arrange the jumps arbitrarily. The minimal balance during the entire process is determined by the minimal prefix sum of the sequence of moves (each move is +a or -b). To guarantee that the minimal balance is nonnegative, we require that for every prefix of the sequence, the balance is nonnegative.\n\n However, we can choose the order arbitrarily. The necessary and sufficient condition for n to be reachable is that there exists a sequence of t forward and s backward jumps (so t+s steps) such that the balance (starting at 0) is always nonnegative and ends at n = t*a - s*b.\n\n This is similar to the classic problem of making change with coins a and -b (with the constraint of nonnegative balance). But note that the total number of forward jumps t and backward jumps s must satisfy t*a - s*b = n.\n\n We can also consider: the minimal value we can have during the sequence is 0 (if we plan appropriately). Actually, we can always arrange the jumps so that we never drop below 0 if and only if there exists nonnegative integers t, s such that:\n\n   t*a - s*b = n\n   and t*a >= s*b   (which is equivalent to n>=0)\n\n But wait, that is necessary. Is it sufficient? \n\n Example: a=5, b=3, n=2. Then 2 is not a multiple of gcd(5,3)=1? Actually 2 is a multiple of 1. Then we require t*5 - s*3 = 2. One solution: t=2, s=3 -> 10-9=1, not 2. Another: t=1, s=1 -> 5-3=2 -> that works. Now, can we arrange the two jumps (one +5 and one -3) without going negative? If we do +5 then -3: we get 0->5->2 (valid). If we do -3 first? Then we go from 0 to -3 -> invalid. So we must do the +5 first. \n\n Therefore, the condition is: there must exist a sequence (with t forward and s backward) such that the balance never drops below 0. This is equivalent to: the minimal value in the sequence must be nonnegative. We can arrange the sequence arbitrarily (we can do all forward jumps first, then backward jumps). Then the balance after i forward jumps and j backward jumps is (i*a - j*b). The minimal balance would occur at the end of the backward jumps, and that would be (t*a - s*b) = n. But wait, if we do all forward jumps first, then the minimal balance is the last backward jump? Actually, the balance after doing all forward jumps is t*a, then we subtract s*b. The minimal balance during the backward part is t*a - (minimal suffix of backward jumps). But if we do all forward jumps first, then the balance becomes t*a, then we subtract s*b. The balance after the first backward jump is t*a - b, then t*a-2b, etc. The minimal balance is t*a - s*b (if we do all backward jumps at the end) which is n, and that is nonnegative because n>=0. However, what if we interleave? The minimal balance might be lower.\n\n Actually, we can use the following theorem: \n   A nonnegative integer n (multiple of g) is reachable if and only if there exist nonnegative integers t, s such that:\n        t*a - s*b = n\n        and t*a >= s*b   (which is n>=0)\n\n But wait, the example above: n=2, t=1, s=1: 1*5-1*3=2 and 5>=3 -> holds.\n\n However, consider n=1 with a=5, b=3: 1 is a multiple of 1. We need t*5 - s*3 = 1. Solutions: t=2, s=3: 10-9=1. Then we can arrange: 5,5,-3,-3,-3 -> but if we do two 5's first: we get 0->5->10, then subtract 3 three times: 10->7->4->1. The minimal balance is 1 (at the end) which is nonnegative. But what if we try to do a backward jump earlier? We must have at least 3 to do a backward jump. After the first 5, we have 5 (>=3) so we can do a backward jump then: 0->5->2 (then we need to get to 1). Then from 2, we cannot do a backward jump (because 2<3). Then we have to do a forward jump to 7, then backward to 4, then to 1. So the sequence is: +5, -3, +5, -3, -3. The minimal balance is 2 (after the first backward jump) and then 4 and 1. So the minimal balance is 1 (at the end) which is nonnegative.\n\n But wait, the condition t*a >= s*b is automatically satisfied because n = t*a - s*b >=0, so t*a>=s*b.\n\n However, note: the condition t*a>=s*b is necessary and sufficient for n>=0. But is that sufficient for the existence of a sequence that never drops below 0?\n\n Actually, we can use the following: \n   We require that the entire sequence of jumps (of t forward and s backward) has a nonnegative balance at every step.\n\n   This is equivalent to: there exists an ordering of the t forward jumps and s backward jumps such that for every prefix, the balance is nonnegative.\n\n   This is the same as the problem of arranging '+' and '-' signs in a sequence of t 'a' and s 'b' such that the partial sums are nonnegative, and the total sum is n.\n\n   This is a variant of the classic problem (similar to parentheses matching). \n\n   The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such an arrangement is that for every prefix, the sum is nonnegative, and the total is n. \n\n   One way to check is: let d_i be the difference (number of a's minus number of b's) in the prefix, then the balance is d_i * (some multiplier)? Actually, we are adding a and subtracting b.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the greedy algorithm: we must have that at any point, the number of backward jumps (so far) does not exceed the forward jumps multiplied by (a/b) appropriately? \n\n   However, note: we are dealing with integers. \n\n   There is a known result: the set of numbers n (nonnegative multiples of g) that can be written as t*a - s*b (with t,s nonnegative integers) and for which there exists an arrangement (i.e., the sequence never drops below 0) is exactly the set of n>=0 that are multiples of g, provided that we have enough forward jumps to cover the backward ones. \n\n   But wait, consider: we can write n = t*a - s*b. We can take the minimal t0 such that t0*a >= n and also t0*a >= s0*b (where s0 is the minimal number of backward jumps required: s0 = ceil(n/a)?). Actually, we can set s = (t*a - n)/b, and we need (t*a - n) divisible by b and nonnegative.\n\n   However, the condition for the existence of an ordering is that the total number of backward jumps s must satisfy: at no point the backward jumps exceed the forward jumps by too much. \n\n   Actually, we can use the following: the sequence of jumps can be arranged if and only if for every k (0<=k<=t+s), the balance (considering the first k jumps) is nonnegative. \n\n   But note: we can use the greedy arrangement: do as many forward jumps as needed to allow the backward jumps. \n\n   There is a well-known fact: the set of numbers n (nonnegative multiples of g) that can be written as t*a - s*b is the set of n >= n0, where n0 is the Frobenius number for two coprime numbers? But wait, a and b are not necessarily coprime. Actually, g = gcd(a,b). Then we can divide everything by g: let a' = a/g, b'=b/g. Then the equation becomes:\n\n        (n/g) = t*a' - s*b'\n\n   And the condition is that n must be a multiple of g.\n\n   Then the problem reduces to the coin problem for two denominations a' and b'. The classical coin problem for two denominations says that if a' and b' are coprime, then every integer >= (a'-1)*(b'-1) - something? Actually, the Frobenius number for two coprime integers a',b' is a'*b' - a' - b'. But here we are allowed to use negative (backward) jumps? Actually, no: we are using nonnegative t and s, but the equation is t*a' - s*b' = n/g.\n\n   This is the same as representing n/g as a nonnegative linear combination of a' and -b'. \n\n   However, note: we can also consider the problem in terms of the minimal representation. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following approach:\n\n   We know that the frog can reach a number n (multiple of g) if and only if there exists a nonnegative integer k (representing the number of backward jumps) and a nonnegative integer l (representing the number of forward jumps) such that:\n\n        n = l*a - k*b   and   l*a >= k*b.\n\n   But note: this is just n>=0 and n being a multiple of g. \n\n   However, wait: the equation n = l*a - k*b might not hold for arbitrary nonnegative integers l,k even if n is a multiple of g? Actually, no: because g divides both a and b, so the set of numbers of the form l*a - k*b is exactly the set of multiples of g. And the condition l*a >= k*b is equivalent to n>=0.\n\n   But is every nonnegative multiple of g reachable? \n\n   Example: a=2, b=2, g=2. Then we can only reach even numbers. But note: \n        n=0: yes (l=0, k=0)\n        n=2: 2 = 1*2 - 0*2 -> yes.\n        n=4: 2*2 - 0*2 -> yes.\n\n   But wait, we can also do backward jumps: \n        n=0: yes.\n        n=2: yes.\n        n=-2: not allowed (negative) and we don't consider negative.\n\n   But note: we can also have: \n        n=0: 0=0*2 - 0*2 -> yes.\n        n=2: 1*2 - 0*2 -> yes.\n\n   However, consider n=1 (if g=1) and a=2, b=1: then g=1. Then we can represent 1: 1 = 1*2 - 1*1. Then condition: 2>=1 -> holds. So we can reach 1.\n\n   Now, consider n=1 with a=3, b=2, g=1. Then 1 = 2*3 - 5*2 -> but 5 is not nonnegative? Actually, we need nonnegative integers l and k. \n\n   We can solve: 3*l - 2*k = 1. \n        l=1 -> 3 - 2*k=1 -> 2*k=2 -> k=1 -> valid.\n\n   So the condition is: there exists nonnegative integers l,k such that 3*l-2*k=1.\n\n   But wait, what about n=0? Yes. n=1: yes. n=2: 3*l-2*k=2 -> l=2, k= (6-2)/2=2 -> yes. n=3: l=1, k=0 -> yes. n=4: 3*l-2*k=4 -> l=2, k=1 -> 6-2=4 -> yes.\n\n   Then why isn't every nonnegative integer reachable? Because we can represent every integer >= (Frobenius number) for the coin problem, but here we have two coins (positive and negative). \n\n   Actually, the set of numbers that can be written as l*a - k*b (with l,k nonnegative) is the set of multiples of g. And the set of nonnegative multiples of g that are sufficiently large (above the Frobenius number) are all representable. But what about small ones?\n\n   However, note: we can also represent negative numbers, but we are only considering nonnegative n.\n\n   The problem: we are only considering n>=0. And the equation is n = l*a - k*b, with l,k>=0 and n>=0.\n\n   This is equivalent to: n = l*a - k*b = l*a + (-k)*b, so we are representing n as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients that are integers (but one positive and one negative). \n\n   The set of numbers representable is the set of multiples of g. And the condition for a nonnegative multiple of g is that it can be written as l*a - k*b with l,k>=0 and l*a>=k*b.\n\n   But note: the equation l*a - k*b = n (with n>=0) is equivalent to k*b <= l*a.\n\n   We can also write: n + k*b = l*a. So we require that n + k*b is divisible by a and the quotient l must be nonnegative.\n\n   However, we are free to choose k. \n\n   But note: the problem is asking for the count of distinct integers the frog can reach in [0,x]. \n\n   Since the frog can reach every multiple of g that is nonnegative and that satisfies the equation (with the condition that the entire sequence doesn't drop below zero) and we are allowed to use arbitrarily many jumps, then the set of reachable numbers is the set of nonnegative multiples of g that are at most ... actually, we can reach arbitrarily large multiples of g (by doing more forward jumps) as long as we can arrange the backward jumps without going negative.\n\n   However, wait: we cannot go negative, so the backward jumps are limited by the forward jumps. But we can do arbitrarily many forward jumps (if we do enough, we can then subtract arbitrarily many backward jumps as long as we don't drop below 0). \n\n   Therefore, the set of reachable numbers is the set of all nonnegative multiples of g. \n\n   But wait: consider a=3, b=2, g=1. Then we can reach every nonnegative integer? \n\n        n=0: yes.\n        n=1: 3*1 - 2*1 = 1 -> yes.\n        n=2: 3*0 - 2*(-1) is not allowed (negative k). But wait: we can also do: 3*2 - 2*2 = 6-4=2 -> yes (two forward and two backward).\n        n=3: 3*1 -> yes.\n        n=4: 3*2 - 2*1 = 6-2=4 -> yes.\n\n   So indeed, we can reach every nonnegative integer (if g=1). \n\n   But what if g>1? Then we can only reach multiples of g. \n\n   Now, is every nonnegative multiple of g reachable? \n\n   Example: a=4, b=6, g=2. Then we want to know if we can reach 2,4,6,...\n\n        n=2: 4*l - 6*k = 2. We need 2*l - 3*k = 1. This equation has no nonnegative integer solutions. Why? \n            l=1: 2-3*k=1 -> 3*k=1 -> k not integer.\n            l=2: 4-3*k=1 -> 3*k=3 -> k=1 -> so (l=2,k=1) -> 4*2-6*1=8-6=2 -> yes.\n\n        n=4: 4*l-6*k=4 -> divide by 2: 2*l-3*k=2 -> solutions: l=1, then 2-3*k=2 -> k=0 -> yes.\n\n        n=6: 4*l-6*k=6 -> divide by 2: 2*l-3*k=3 -> l=3, k=1: 6-3=3 -> 2*3=6, 3*k=3 -> yes.\n\n        n=8: 4*l-6*k=8 -> divide by 2: 2*l-3*k=4 -> l=2, k=0: 4-0=4 -> yes.\n\n        n=10: 4*l-6*k=10 -> 2*l-3*k=5 -> l=4, k=1: 8-3=5 -> yes.\n\n   So it seems every even number is reachable.\n\n   But wait: what is the minimal even number that is not reachable? \n\n   Actually, the set of numbers representable by nonnegative combinations of 4 and -6 (with the condition 4*l>=6*k) is the set of even numbers that are at least 0? \n\n   We can use the Coin Problem for two denominations (even though one is negative). The classical Frobenius number for two denominations is defined for positive coins. Here, we have a positive and a negative. \n\n   However, note: we can rewrite the equation: 4*l - 6*k = n (n even, nonnegative). We can also write: 4*l = n + 6*k. \n\n   We require that n+6*k is divisible by 4 and nonnegative, and then l = (n+6*k)/4 is an integer. \n\n   We can choose k arbitrarily (as long as n+6*k >=0). But we want to know if there exists a k such that (n+6*k) is divisible by 4.\n\n   Note: 6 mod4 = 2, so 6*k mod4 = (2*k) mod4. Then n mod4 must be (0 - 2*k) mod4, i.e., n mod4 = (0 - 2*k) mod4.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over residues. \n\n   But note: we are free to choose k. The equation is: n = 4*l - 6*k.\n\n   We can fix n mod4. Since n is even, n mod4 can be 0 or 2.\n\n   Case 1: n mod4=0. Then we require 0 â‰¡ -6*k mod4 -> 0 â‰¡ 2*k mod4 -> so k must be even (k=0,2,4,...). Then we can choose k=0, then n must be divisible by 4? Not necessarily: if n=2, then 2 mod4=2, so that's case2.\n\n   Actually, we did n=2: 2 = 4*2 - 6*1 -> 8-6=2. So 2 mod4=2, and k=1 (odd). Then 2*k mod4=2, so 2 â‰¡ -2 mod4? Actually, 2 â‰¡ 2 mod4, and the equation is 2 â‰¡ (0 - 2*k) mod4 -> 2 â‰¡ -2*k mod4 -> 2*k â‰¡ -2 mod4 -> 2*k â‰¡ 2 mod4 -> k â‰¡ 1 mod2. So k must be odd.\n\n   Similarly, for n mod4=0: then 0 â‰¡ -2*k mod4 -> 2*k â‰¡0 mod4 -> k â‰¡0 mod2 (k even).\n\n   So for a given even n, we can find k if there exists k (nonnegative) such that k â‰¡ (if n mod4==0 then 0 else 1) mod2 and n+6*k is divisible by 4 (which is equivalent to the congruence condition). But note: the equation is linear and we can always find such a k (by increasing k by 2 until the condition holds) as long as n is sufficiently large.\n\n   Actually, the minimal n that is even and nonnegative is 0, then 2, then 4, then 6, etc. and we saw that they are all reachable.\n\n   Therefore, the set of reachable numbers is the set of all nonnegative multiples of g.\n\n   Then, for a fixed x, f(x) is the number of nonnegative multiples of g that are <= x.\n\n   But wait: is that true? \n\n   Example: a=5, b=3, g=1. Then we should be able to reach every nonnegative integer? \n\n        We showed that 0,1,2,... are all reachable.\n\n   Example: a=4, b=6, g=2. Then we can reach every even number.\n\n   But wait, what about the nonnegative condition during the journey? \n\n   We argued that if n is a multiple of g, then there exists nonnegative integers l,k such that n = l*a - k*b and l*a>=k*b. But is that sufficient for the existence of a sequence that never drops below 0?\n\n   We know that we can arrange the jumps arbitrarily (we can do all forward jumps first, then backward jumps). Then the balance at the end is n, and the minimal balance is n (if we do all forward jumps first) which is nonnegative. However, wait: if we do all forward jumps first, then the balance is l*a, and then we subtract k*b. The minimal balance is l*a - k*b = n, which is nonnegative. But what if we interleave? The minimal balance might drop in between. \n\n   However, note: we can choose the order arbitrarily. The condition for the existence of a sequence (with nonnegative balance at every step) is that there exists a sequence of +a and -b (with l times +a and k times -b) such that the running sum is always nonnegative.\n\n   This is a classic problem: the number of ways to arrange l '+' and k '-' such that the running sum (starting at 0) is always nonnegative. The necessary and sufficient condition is that l*a >= k*b (so that the total is nonnegative) and that the minimal prefix sum is nonnegative.\n\n   There is a well-known result: the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a sequence is that the total is nonnegative and the number of backward jumps at any prefix is not greater than the forward jumps multiplied by (a/b) (in a real number sense). \n\n   However, note: we can use the following: \n\n        Let r_i = (number of forward jumps in the first i jumps) * a - (number of backward jumps in the first i jumps) * b.\n\n        We require r_i >=0 for all i.\n\n        We can use the greedy algorithm: we must have that at any point, the remaining backward jumps (k - backward_so_far) must be <= (remaining_forward_jumps)*a / b (ceiling?).\n\n   But note: we are only concerned with existence. \n\n   There is a theorem: a sequence of l forward jumps and k backward jumps (with l*a>=k*b) can be arranged to have nonnegative partial sums if and only if for every i from 1 to l+k, the number of backward jumps in the first i jumps, say k_i, satisfies:\n\n        k_i * b <= i*a_max_so_far? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the greedy matching: we need to assign the jumps in an order such that we never have more than floor(i * (a/(a-b))) forward jumps? \n\n   Actually, I recall that the condition for the existence of a sequence is that the total is nonnegative and the minimal prefix sum is nonnegative, and this is equivalent to the condition that for every i (from 0 to l+k), the number of backward jumps in the first i jumps (k_i) is at most floor(i * (a/(a-b))) ??? \n\n   But wait, we are mixing two different denominations. \n\n   However, note: the problem is symmetric in the sense that we are allowed to do any number of jumps. And we know that the set of numbers that can be represented is the set of multiples of g. Now, the question is: is every nonnegative multiple of g reachable (via some sequence that never drops below 0)?\n\n   We have seen examples that they are. But is it always true?\n\n   Let g = gcd(a,b). Then for any nonnegative multiple n of g, we can write n = t*a - s*b for some nonnegative integers t,s (with t*a>=s*b). Now, we wish to arrange the t forward jumps and s backward jumps in an order such that the partial sums are nonnegative.\n\n   We can use the following greedy method: at any point, if we have enough forward jumps to cover the backward jumps (in terms of the entire sequence) then we can postpone the backward jumps.\n\n   Theorem (from the theory of the Diophantine equation and the arrangement): \n        Given nonnegative integers t, s and positive integers a, b such that t*a >= s*b, then there exists an arrangement of t forward jumps and s backward jumps such that the running sum is always nonnegative.\n\n   Proof sketch: We can use induction on the total number of jumps. Or we can use the fact that the minimal balance is achieved at the end (if we do all forward jumps first) and then we subtract backward jumps. But wait, if we do all forward jumps first, the balance goes up to t*a, then we subtract s*b. The minimal balance is t*a - s*b = n (nonnegative). However, during the backward jumps, the balance decreases from t*a to n. The minimal balance is n (at the end). But what if we interleave? The balance might drop below n in between? Actually, no: the minimal balance is the minimum of the running sums. \n\n   However, consider: we do one forward jump: balance a. Then one backward jump: balance a-b. Then if a-b < n? But n = t*a - s*b, and we are only at the beginning.\n\n   Actually, the entire sequence must be considered. \n\n   But note: we can use the following arrangement: do as many forward jumps as needed so that we never drop below 0. Specifically, we can do one forward jump, then if we want to do a backward jump, we must have a>=b. But if a<b, then we cannot do a backward jump immediately after the first forward jump. \n\n   Example: a=3, b=5, g=1. Then we want to reach n=2 (which is 3*4 - 5*2 = 12-10=2). Condition: 12>=10 holds. Now, can we arrange 4 forward and 2 backward jumps without dropping below 0?\n\n        We start at 0.\n        Option: \n          Forward: 3 -> 3\n          Then we can do backward: 3-5 -> negative -> not allowed.\n\n        So we must do two forward jumps: 0->3->6, then we can do a backward: 6-5=1, then two more forward: 1+3=4, 4+3=7, then backward: 7-5=2.\n\n        Sequence: F,F,B,F,F,B -> balances: 3,6,1,4,7,2 -> all nonnegative.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: F,F,F,F,B,B: 3,6,9,12,7,2 -> minimal balance is 2 (nonnegative).\n\n        Or: F,F,B,F,B,F: 3,6,1,4,-1 -> invalid.\n\n        But we found at least one valid arrangement.\n\n   How to prove the existence? \n\n   We can use the following: \n        We have t forward jumps and s backward jumps. We know t*a >= s*b.\n\n        We can simulate the sequence by maintaining a counter for the current balance. We start at 0.\n\n        We need to distribute t forward jumps and s backward jumps.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the number of distinct integers a frog can reach for each integer from 0 to m, where the frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by 'a' units or backward by 'b' units (only if the result is non-negative). The key insight is recognizing that the set of reachable positions is determined by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 'a' and 'b', denoted as 'g'. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The frog can reach any non-negative integer that is a multiple of 'g' (the gcd of 'a' and 'b'). This is because all reachable positions must be linear combinations of 'a' and 'b' with non-negative coefficients, and the gcd dictates the smallest unit that can be formed by these combinations.\n2. **Key Insight**: For any integer 'x', the number of distinct positions the frog can reach within [0, x] is the count of all non-negative multiples of 'g' that are less than or equal to 'x'. This count is given by floor(x / g) + 1.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints (m can be as large as 10^9), we need an efficient way to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m. The solution involves:\n   - Calculating 'g' as the gcd of 'a' and 'b'.\n   - For each segment between multiples of 'g', the count of reachable positions is constant. We break the problem into segments where the count of reachable positions changes only at multiples of 'g'.\n   - Using arithmetic series properties to compute the sum efficiently without iterating through each integer from 0 to m.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    b = int(data[2])\n    \n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    if g == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    total = 0\n    n = m // g\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        total += 1\n    else:\n        k = 0\n        while k <= n:\n            if k == 0:\n                total += 1\n            else:\n                L = k * g\n                R = min((k+1) * g - 1, m)\n                count_in_segment = (R - L + 1) // g + 1\n                total += count_in_segment * (L + R) // 2\n            k += 1\n            \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: m (the upper bound), a (forward jump size), and b (backward jump size).\n2. **GCD Calculation**: The gcd of 'a' and 'b' ('g') is computed to determine the step size for reachable positions.\n3. **Special Case Handling**: If 'g' is 0 (though theoretically impossible since a and b are positive), the output is 0.\n4. **Segment Processing**: The solution processes segments between consecutive multiples of 'g'. For each segment, it calculates the number of integers in the segment and their sum using arithmetic series properties.\n5. **Efficiency**: By processing segments instead of individual integers, the algorithm efficiently computes the sum in O(m/g) time, which is feasible even for large m (up to 10^9).\n\nThis approach leverages mathematical insights and arithmetic series properties to avoid brute-force computation, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.",
