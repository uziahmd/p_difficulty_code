Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n, and two strings l and r of length n.\n We need to form pairs (one left boot, one right boot) such that:\n   - The colors are compatible: \n        ('?', '?') -> compatible\n        ('x', 'x') -> compatible\n        ('?', 'x') -> compatible\n        ('x', '?') -> compatible\n   - Each boot can be used at most once.\n\n However, note: the problem is to compute the maximum number of compatible pairs and then output those pairs.\n\n Since there are n left boots and n right boots, the maximum pairs cannot exceed n.\n\n But note: the matching must be between a left boot and a right boot.\n\n Approach:\n\n We have two types of boots: definite and indefinite (with '?').\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that a '?' in either string can match with any color.\n\n 2. We want to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n Idea:\n\n Let's break down the boots:\n\n   Left boots: \n      Some are specific letters, some are '?'.\n   Right boots: similarly.\n\n However, note: we have two separate strings.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   - First, we can try to match as many definite matches as possible (both specific and one being '?').\n   - Then, use the remaining '?' to form pairs.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to match by index? Actually, we are given two strings and we can assign any left boot to any right boot arbitrarily (as long as they are compatible). So we are allowed to rearrange? However, the output requires to specify the indices of the boots (the i-th left boot is index i+1, and j-th right boot is index j+1).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"The j-th of these lines should contain the index a_j of the left boot in the j-th pair and index b_j of the right boot in the j-th pair.\"\n\n But wait: the input gives two strings, and the indices are from 0 to n-1 for the array, but the problem indexes from 1 to n.\n\n Important: We are allowed to choose any matching, so we can choose which left boot goes with which right boot.\n\n However, the problem does not require to output the matching in a particular order. But we must output distinct indices.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Step 1: Count the total '?' in both strings.\n\n Step 2: We can form pairs in two ways:\n\n   a) Matching a definite left boot (non '?') with a definite right boot (non '?') that has the same letter OR with a '?' in the right (if left is non '?') OR vice versa.\n\n   But note: actually, the rule is:\n\n        - If left[i] is a letter and right[j] is a letter: then they must be the same.\n        - If left[i] is '?' or right[j] is '?', then they are compatible.\n\n   However, we are allowed to use each boot only once.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We can try to first match as many definite boots as possible, then use the remaining '?' to form pairs.\n\n   However, note: a '?' can act as a wildcard. But we have to be careful because we might use a '?' from the left with a '?' from the right, and that is allowed.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let:\n      L = list of left boots with their index (from 0 to n-1)\n      R = list of right boots with their index (from 0 to n-1)\n\n   We can separate:\n\n      Left: \n          definite_left = [ (color, index) for index, color in enumerate(l) if color != '?']\n          q_left = [index for index, color in enumerate(l) if color == '?']\n\n      Similarly, right:\n          definite_right = [ (color, index) for index, color in enumerate(r) if color != '?']\n          q_right = [index for index, color in enumerate(r) if color == '?']\n\n   Now, we can also consider: we can match definite_left with definite_right if they have the same color.\n\n   But note: we can also match definite_left with q_right (since '?' in right is compatible), and q_left with definite_right.\n\n   However, the goal is to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n   What is the maximum?\n\n   We can form:\n\n      - All definite matches: for each color c, let f(c) be the frequency of c in definite_left and g(c) the frequency in definite_right. Then the maximum definite matches we can form without using wildcards is the minimum of the two counts (but note: we can also use the same color from different sets). Actually, we can use a greedy matching for definite boots: we don't need to worry about the same color being used multiple times? Actually, we can form a bipartite graph for definite boots: left definite nodes and right definite nodes, and edges when the color",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is defined based on their colors: a specific color matches another specific color if they are the same, and an indefinite color ('?') matches any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs while ensuring each boot is used at most once. The solution involves efficiently matching definite colors (non '?') first and then using the remaining '?' boots to form additional pairs.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Definite Matches**: First, match left boots with definite colors to right boots with the same definite color. This ensures we use as many boots as possible without relying on wildcards.\n   - **Wildcard Matches**: After matching all possible definite boots, use the remaining '?' boots from either side to form pairs. Each '?' can pair with any remaining boot, so the number of additional pairs is limited by the minimum count of remaining '?' boots.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Greedy Matching for Definite Boots**: Use a frequency map to count occurrences of each color in both left and right boots. For each color, the number of definite matches is the minimum of its counts in left and right boots.\n   - **Handling Wildcards**: The remaining '?' boots can be paired together or with unmatched definite boots. The total number of pairs is the sum of definite matches and wildcard pairs.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    q_left = []\n    definite_left = defaultdict(int)\n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            q_left.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            definite_left[char] += 1\n            \n    q_right = []\n    definite_right = defaultdict(int)\n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            q_right.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            definite_right[char] += 1\n            \n    total_definite_matches = 0\n    for color in definite_left:\n        if color in definite_right:\n            total_definite_matches += min(definite_left[color], definite_right[color])\n            \n    remaining_left_q = [idx for idx in q_left]\n    remaining_right_q = [idx for idx in q_right]\n    \n    result_pairs = []\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n    \n    for color in definite_left:\n        if color in definite_right:\n            count_left = definite_left[color]\n            count_right = definite_right[color]\n            m = min(count_left, count_right)\n            for _ in range(m):\n                found_left = False\n                found_right = False\n                while not found_left and not found_right:\n                    for idx, char in enumerate(l_str):\n                        if char == color and (idx+1) not in used_left:\n                            result_pairs.append((idx+1, None))\n                            used_left.add(idx+1)\n                            found_left = True\n                            break\n                    for idx, char in enumerate(r_str):\n                        if char == color and (idx+1) not in used_right:\n                            result_pairs[-1] = (result_pairs[-1][0], idx+1)\n                            used_right.add(idx+1)\n                            found_right = True\n                            break\n            definite_left[color] -= m\n            definite_right[color] -= m\n    \n    total_pairs = total_definite_matches + len(remaining_left_q) + len(remaining_right_q)\n    k = total_pairs\n    print(k)\n    \n    for i in range(len(result_pairs)):\n        if result_pairs[i][1] is not None:\n            print(f\"{result_pairs[i][0]} {result_pairs[i][1]}\")\n    \n    for i in range(len(remaining_left_q)):\n        print(f\"{remaining_left_q[i]} {remaining_right_q[i]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots and two strings representing the colors of left and right boots.\n2. **Processing Boots**: Separate the boots into definite (non '?') and wildcard ('?') categories for both left and right boots.\n3. **Definite Matches**: For each color, match the minimum count of its occurrences in left and right boots to form definite pairs.\n4. **Wildcard Matches**: Pair the remaining '?' boots from left and right.
