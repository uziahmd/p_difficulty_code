There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: n, h, m and then m lines of [l, r, x]\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use a direct approach.\n\n However, note: the restrictions might conflict. But the problem says we must satisfy all restrictions.\n\n Approach:\n We have to assign a height for each house (from 1 to n) such that for each restriction i (from l_i to r_i) the maximum height in that range is <= x_i.\n\n The profit is the sum of squares of the heights.\n\n We can think of it as: we want to set each house's height to some value between 0 and h, but also satisfying all restrictions.\n\n Since n, m are small (<=50), we can try to use dynamic programming or even iterate over possibilities? But the state space is too big if we consider each house independently.\n\n Alternatively, we can use linear programming relaxation? But we need an integer solution and the constraints are small.\n\n Another idea: the restrictions are on contiguous segments. We can think of having an array a[1..n] (each element from 0 to h) and we have constraints: for each restriction i, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] <= x_i.\n\n How to enforce the constraints? We can use the idea of \"at most\" constraints. Note that if we set a house at position j to a value greater than x_i for any restriction i that covers j, that would break the constraint.\n\n Actually, for a given house j, what is the maximum allowed height? It is the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover j. But wait: there might be multiple restrictions that cover j. However, note that one restriction might say the entire segment must be <= x_i, so if we set a house j to a value higher than the minimum x_i of all restrictions covering j, then the constraint for the segment that requires the max <= x_i (which is the smallest x_i among the restrictions covering j) will be broken.\n\n So, let M[j] = min{ x_i | the restriction i covers j }\n\n Then, the condition is that for every j, a[j] <= M[j]. Moreover, for each restriction i (covering [l_i, r_i]), the maximum in that segment must be <= x_i. But note: if we set each house j to at most M[j], then in particular, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] would be at most the maximum of M[j] for j in [l_i, r_i]. However, we require that the maximum is <= x_i. Therefore, we must have:\n\n   max_{j in [l_i, r_i]} M[j] <= x_i\n\n But wait: actually, we defined M[j] as the minimum x_i over restrictions that cover j. Then, for a restriction i, we require that the maximum height in [l_i, r_i] <= x_i. However, if we set a house j to M[j] (or less) then the maximum in [l_i, r_i] would be the maximum M[j] for j in [l_i, r_i]. But note: we are free to set each house to any value from 0 to M[j]. So the condition for the restriction i is automatically satisfied if the maximum M[j] in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i? Not exactly: because if we set a house j to a value lower than M[j] (which is allowed) then the maximum in [l_i, r_i] might be less than the maximum M[j] in [l_i, r_i]. However, we must ensure that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\n But here's a catch: our definition of M[j] is the minimum x_i over the restrictions that cover j. Now, consider: if we set house j to M[j] (the maximum allowed by all restrictions covering j), then for a restriction i, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is at least the maximum of M[j] for j in [l_i, r_i]. However, if the maximum of M[j] for j in [l_i, r_i] is > x_i, then setting house j to M[j] would break the restriction i. But note: we don't have to set every house to M[j]. We can set some houses to less than M[j]. However, the problem is that we cannot set a house to more than M[j] (because of the restrictions). Therefore, the condition for the restriction i is necessary and sufficient that the maximum M[j] in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. Why?\n\n If the condition holds, then we can set every house j to M[j] and satisfy the restriction i (because the maximum in [l_i, r_i] would be <= x_i). But if the condition does not hold, then there",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height \\( h \\), but must comply with all zoning restrictions that specify the maximum allowed height in certain segments of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that each house's maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive zoning restriction that includes it. Specifically, for each house at position \\( j \\), the maximum height it can have is the minimum \\( x_i \\) among all restrictions that cover \\( j \\). \n\n2. **Restriction Validation**: For each zoning restriction, we need to ensure that the maximum height in its segment does not exceed \\( x_i \\). This translates to checking that the highest value of \\( M[j] \\) (the minimal \\( x_i \\) covering \\( j \\)) in the segment \\( [l_i, r_i] \\) is less than or equal to \\( x_i \\). If any restriction's condition is violated, the solution is impossible, and we return 0 profit.\n\n3. **Profit Calculation**: Once all restrictions are satisfied, the optimal strategy is to set each house's height to its maximum allowable \\( M[j] \\), because the profit function \\( a^2 \\) increases monotonically with \\( a \\) for \\( a \\geq 0 \\). Summing the squares of these heights gives the maximum possible profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n        \n    M = [h] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for l, r, x in restrictions:\n        for j in range(l, r + 1):\n            if x < M[j]:\n                M[j] = x\n                \n    for l, r, x in restrictions:\n        current_max = 0\n        for j in range(l, r + 1):\n            if M[j] > current_max:\n                current_max = M[j]\n        if current_max > x:\n            print(0)\n            return\n            \n    total_profit = 0\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        total_profit += M[j] * M[j]\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of spots \\( n \\), the maximum height \\( h \\), the number of restrictions \\( m \\), and the restrictions themselves.\n2. **Initialization**: An array \\( M \\) of size \\( n+1 \\) is initialized with the default maximum height \\( h \\).\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates \\( M[j] \\) for each spot \\( j \\) in the restriction's range to the minimum \\( x_i \\) among all restrictions covering \\( j \\).\n4. **Validation Check**: For each restriction, the code checks if the maximum value in its range (from \\( M \\)) is within the allowed limit \\( x_i \\). If any restriction is violated, the profit is 0.\n5. **Profit Calculation**: If all restrictions are satisfied, the profit is computed by summing the squares of the values in \\( M \\), which represent the optimal heights for each house.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures compliance with all zoning restrictions while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of quadratic functions and careful constraint validation.",
