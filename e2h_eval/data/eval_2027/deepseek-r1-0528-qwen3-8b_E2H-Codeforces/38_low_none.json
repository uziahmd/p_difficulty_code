    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two integers: \n   n = minimum number of nodes required to have exactly p pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability.\n   m = maximum number of unidirectional pairs (over all edges in the graph) in such graphs with n nodes.\n\n Let's break down the problem:\n\n 1. Understanding the \"p-reachable\" condition:\n    We require that the graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are mutually reachable.\n    Note: The problem says \"ordered pair (u, v)\" but then specifies \"u < v\". So we are counting unordered pairs? Actually, note: \n        - The condition is for u != v, and mutual reachability (both ways). But then the problem says \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other\".\n        - So actually, for each unordered pair {u, v} with u != v and mutual reachability, we count one ordered pair (u, v) only when u < v? \n\n    However, note: the definition of the graph being p-reachable is defined by having exactly p such pairs (with u < v) that are mutually reachable.\n\n    In fact, the mutual reachability condition is symmetric, so if (u, v) is a mutual pair then (v, u) is also a mutual pair? But note: the condition for the graph being p-reachable counts only the pairs with u < v. So if we have k strongly connected components (SCCs) and they form a condensation graph, then the mutual reachability pairs are the edges within the same SCC. But wait, the problem does not require the entire graph to be one SCC. \n\n    Actually, note: the condition is about mutual reachability. In graph theory, mutual reachability defines an equivalence relation? Not exactly, because the graph is directed. But note: if there's a path from u to v and from v to u, then we say u and v are in the same strongly connected component (SCC). However, the entire graph might have multiple SCCs.\n\n    The condition is that the graph must have exactly p pairs (u, v) (with u < v) that are mutually reachable.\n\n    But note: the graph can have more than just these p pairs? Actually, the condition is that the graph is p-reachable meaning it must have exactly p mutual pairs (with u < v). \n\n    How do we achieve exactly p mutual pairs? \n\n    Consider: In a directed graph, we can partition the nodes into strongly connected components (SCCs). Then, two nodes are mutually reachable if and only if they lie in the same SCC. Therefore, the number of mutual pairs (with u < v) is the sum over each SCC of C(size_i, 2) (the number of unordered pairs in that SCC).\n\n    So, we are to assign n nodes into several SCCs (say k SCCs) such that the total number of pairs is p, i.e., \n        p = sum_{i=1}^{k} [ C(size_i, 2) ]\n\n    And we want the minimum n (total nodes) to achieve at least one way to form p mutual pairs.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to have a graph that is not necessarily the disjoint union of SCCs. But the key is that mutual reachability is only within the same SCC. So we can design the graph as a DAG of SCCs, but the condition only requires that the graph has exactly p mutual pairs (i.e., the total number of edges (in terms of mutual reachability) is p, which is the sum of C(size_i, 2) for each SCC).\n\n    Now, what is the minimum n (number of nodes) to represent p as a sum of C(x_i, 2) for some positive integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_k (each x_i>=1) and we want to minimize the total n = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k.\n\n    Why? Because each SCC of size x_i contributes x_i nodes and C(x_i, 2) = (x_i*(x_i-1))//2.\n\n    So the problem reduces to: represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (triangular numbers are T_x = x*(x-1)//2 for x>=1) and minimize the total number of nodes (which is the sum of the x_i's) used.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to use any decomposition of p into triangular numbers. But note: the triangular numbers are nonnegative and we can use the same triangle number multiple times? Actually, we can have multiple SCCs of the same size.\n\n   ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, meaning it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are mutually reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional node pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Mutual Reachability**: Two nodes u and v are mutually reachable if there exists a path from u to v and from v to u. In a directed graph, mutual reachability defines strongly connected components (SCCs). The number of mutual pairs (u < v) is the sum of combinations of sizes of these SCCs taken two at a time.\n   - **p-Reachable Graph**: The graph must have exactly p such mutual pairs. This translates to partitioning the total number of nodes into SCCs such that the sum of C(size_i, 2) for each SCC equals p, where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n   - **Unidirectional Pairs**: These are pairs (u, v) where there is a path from u to v but not from v to u. The goal is to maximize these pairs in the graph with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we should use SCCs as large as possible because larger SCCs contribute more triangular numbers (C(n, 2)) per node. The optimal strategy involves using the largest possible triangular numbers (i.e., largest SCC sizes) to cover the sum p with the fewest nodes.\n   - **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: After determining the minimal number of nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is derived from the structure of the graph. Specifically, it involves considering all possible edges between different SCCs in a condensation graph (DAG of SCCs) and ensuring no cycles exist between them, thus maximizing asymmetric paths.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Triangular Number Decomposition**: The problem reduces to decomposing p into a sum of triangular numbers (T_n = n*(n-1)/2) such that the sum of the corresponding n's (the sizes of the SCCs) is minimized. This is solved by greedily selecting the largest possible triangular numbers first.\n   - **Edge Calculation**: For the unidirectional pairs, the total edges between nodes in different SCCs are considered. The maximum unidirectional pairs are calculated by considering all possible directed edges between nodes in different SCCs minus the edges that would create cycles (which are not allowed in a DAG condensation).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n_nodes = 0\n    remaining = p\n    i = 1\n    while remaining > 0:\n        tri_val = i * (i - 1) // 2\n        if tri_val <= remaining:\n            count = remaining // tri_val\n            n_nodes += count * i\n            remaining %= tri_val\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n    if remaining != 0:\n        n_nodes += remaining\n\n    total_pairs = n_nodes * (n_nodes - 1) // 2\n    uni_pairs = total_pairs - p\n\n    print(f\"{n_nodes} {uni_pairs}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer p, which represents the number of mutual pairs required.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the solution is trivially 0 nodes and 0 unidirectional pairs.\n3. **Triangular Number Decomposition**: The algorithm decomposes p into a sum of triangular numbers (each representing an SCC) by greedily taking the largest possible triangular numbers first. This minimizes the total number of nodes needed.\n4. **Remaining Pairs Handling**: Any residual pairs after the greedy decomposition are accounted for by adding individual nodes.\n5. **Edge Calculation**: The total possible edges in the graph is given by the combination of all nodes taken two at a time. The unidirectional pairs are derived by subtracting the mutual pairs (p) from the total possible edges.\n6. **Output**: The solution outputs the minimal number of nodes and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nThis approach efficiently addresses both parts of the problem by leveraging mathematical insights into triangular numbers and graph theory principles.",
