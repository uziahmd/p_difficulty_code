    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element from the array will remove either the minimum or the maximum (or somewhere in between) and then the instability is the new max minus the new min.\n\n However, note: the instability is defined as max - min of the remaining array. We are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n Observation:\n  After removal, the array has n-1 elements.\n\n  The instability of the resulting array can be thought of as:\n    Option 1: Remove an occurrence of the current minimum (if there are multiple, we can remove one and the next smallest becomes the new min)\n    Option 2: Remove an occurrence of the current maximum (if there are multiple, we can remove one and the next largest becomes the new max)\n\n  But note: sometimes the best move is not necessarily removing the global min or global max? Actually, consider:\n\n  Let the sorted array be b[0..n-1].\n\n  Removing one element, we have two possibilities for the overall instability:\n\n  Possibility 1: Remove an element that is not the only occurrence of the min or max. Then the min might remain the same (if we don't remove the last min) and similarly for the max.\n\n  However, note that the instability is determined by the entire set. We can also consider that the instability of the array without one element is:\n\n      max(b without element) - min(b without element)\n\n  We can consider two types of removals:\n\n  Type 1: Remove the first occurrence (min) or the last occurrence (max) but note: if we remove an element from the middle, then the min and max might remain unchanged.\n\n  Actually, the key observation is that the resulting array's min and max must be chosen from the original array's elements (except one removed).\n\n  Since we are only removing one element, the min of the remaining array can only be:\n      - either the original min (if we didn't remove all occurrences of the min) OR \n      - a value greater than the original min (if we removed the last occurrence of the min)\n\n  Similarly, the max of the remaining array can only be:\n      - either the original max (if we didn't remove all occurrences of the max) OR \n      - a value less than the original max (if we removed the last occurrence of the max)\n\n  But note: we are only removing one element. So if the array has duplicate values, we can remove one duplicate and the min or max might still be present.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum over:\n\n      candidate1: the instability after removing the first element (which is the min) -> then the new min is the next distinct value? Actually, we have to consider duplicates.\n\n  Alternate approach:\n\n  Sort the array. Then, the instability of the entire array is b[-1] - b[0]. When we remove one element, we are effectively considering two cases:\n\n  Case 1: Removing an element from the left side (so the new min is the next available element, but the max remains the same unless we remove the max too? Actually, no: we remove only one.)\n\n  However, note: the min and max of the remaining array are:\n\n      Let the sorted array be b.\n\n      If we remove an element at index i, then the min is:\n          if i==0: then the new min is b[1] (unless there are duplicates, then we might have to check the next distinct min, but actually the next element might be same as b[0]? Then the min remains b[0] until we remove all of them. But we remove only one.)\n\n      Actually, the min of the remaining array is:\n          if we remove an element that is not the last occurrence of the min, then the min remains the original min.\n          else, the min becomes the next distinct value.\n\n  But wait: what if we remove the only occurrence of the min? Then the new min is the next smallest.\n\n  Similarly, for the max.\n\n  However, we can also think: we are going to consider every possible removal (but n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot simulate each removal). \n\n  Instead, note that the instability of the remaining array is:\n\n      (max of the remaining) - (min of the remaining)\n\n  And the remaining array is the original array without one element.\n\n  We can consider that the min and max of the entire array are fixed. The removal of one element might:\n\n      Option A: Remove the global min, then the new min is the next smallest (which is the second smallest distinct value, but note: duplicates matter).\n      Option B: Remove the global max, then the new max is the next largest.\n\n  However, there's another possibility: we might remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the potential new min and max values after removing any element.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If all elements in the array are the same, removing any element will result in an instability of zero.\n3. **Sliding Window Consideration**: For each possible removal (except the first and last elements in the sorted array), the instability can be calculated as the difference between the element following the removed element and the element preceding it. This is because removing an element from the middle leaves the min and max unchanged unless the removed element was the only occurrence of the min or max.\n4. **Minimize Instability**: The solution involves checking all possible instabilities when removing each element and selecting the smallest value among them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a.sort()\n    \n    if a[0] == a[-1]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    best = float('inf')\n    for i in range(1, n-1):\n        candidate = a[i+1] - a[i-1]\n        if candidate < best:\n            best = candidate\n            \n    best = min(best, a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1])\n    print(best)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Cases**: If the array has only one element (though the problem constraints ensure `n >= 2`), the instability is zero. If all elements are the same, removing any element results in zero instability.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the min and max elements and their neighbors.\n4. **Sliding Window Check**: For each element in the sorted array (except the first and last), the instability is calculated by considering the next and previous elements. This simulates removing the current element and observing the new min and max.\n5. **Final Check**: The minimal instability is determined by comparing the results from the sliding window check with the scenarios where either the original min or max is removed.\n6. **Output**: The smallest instability value found is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking a few critical scenarios, leveraging sorting and a linear scan to handle large input sizes within feasible time complexity.",
