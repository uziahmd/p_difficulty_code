After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has two integers n and m, then n lines each with m characters (without spaces)\n We need to count the number of successful students. A student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best.\n A student is the best at a subject if no other student has a higher mark for that subject.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input.\n 2. We have a grid of n rows and m columns. Each row is a string of m digits (each from '1' to '9').\n\n For each subject j (column j), we can find the maximum mark. Then, the best students for subject j are those who have that maximum mark.\n\n However, note: multiple students can be best in a subject if they all have the maximum mark.\n\n But the problem says: \"successful\" if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best.\n\n Approach:\n We can do the following:\n\n Option 1:\n   For each subject j, let max_mark = maximum in that column.\n   Then, for each student i, check if in subject j, the mark equals max_mark. If yes, then mark student i as being best in subject j.\n\n However, we don't need to know for every subject, we just need to know for each student if there's at least one subject where they are best.\n\n Alternatively, we can create an array `best_in_subject` for each subject, but then how to assign?\n\n Another idea:\n   For each student, we want to know: is there at least one subject j for which his mark is the maximum in column j.\n\n But note: the same student might be best in multiple subjects, but we only need one.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if a student has the maximum in at least one subject, then he is successful.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Let's create a list `successful` of booleans for each student, initially False.\n\n For each subject j (column index from 0 to m-1):\n   Find the maximum mark in that column (as a character, then convert to int? Actually, we can compare as characters because '1'<'2'... etc.)\n   Then, for each student i (row index from 0 to n-1):\n        if the mark at [i][j] == max_mark (for that column) and not yet marked successful for this student, then mark him as successful.\n\n However, wait: it's possible that a student is best in multiple subjects, but we only need to count once. So we can set a flag for the student as soon as we find one subject where he is best.\n\n But note: we must not mark a student more than once. So we can break early for a student if we already found one subject? However, we are iterating over subjects. We can do:\n\n   success_flags = [False] * n\n\n   for j in range(m):\n        col_max = max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == col_max and not success_flags[i]:\n                success_flags[i] = True\n\n   Then, the answer is the count of True in success_flags.\n\n However, note: what if a student is best in two subjects? Then we set his flag to True in the first subject we encounter, and the second subject doesn't matter.\n\n But wait: what if we process a subject and set a student as best, but then in a later subject we don't set it again? That's okay because we only need one.\n\n But note: the order of subjects doesn't matter.\n\n However, consider: what if we set a student as best in a subject, but then in a different subject we have a higher requirement? Actually, no: the condition for being best is independent per subject.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      2 2\n      12\n      21\n\n   Student0: ['1','2']\n   Student1: ['2','1']\n\n   For subject0: max is '2' -> so student1 is best in subject0.\n   For subject1: max is '2' -> so student0 is best in subject1.\n\n   Then both are successful.\n\n This matches.\n\n But consider: \n   Input:\n      3 3\n      223\n      232\n      112\n\n   Student0: '223'\n   Student1: '232'\n   Student2: '112'\n\n   For subject0: max is '2'. So student0 and student1 are best in subject0 -> mark them as successful.\n   For subject1: max is '3'. Only student1 has '3', so mark student1 (already marked) and student0 and student2 are not best in subject1 for now.\n   For subject2: max is '3'. Only student0 has '3', so mark student0 (already marked).\n\n   Then successful students: student0 and student1 -> count=2.\n\n   This matches the sample.\n\n But wait: the sample output is 2.\n\n However, note: the example says:\n     student1 is best at subjects 1 and 3 -> actually, let me re-index the subjects (0-indexed vs 1-indexed):\n\n   In the example, they say:\n        student number 1 (which is index0) is the best at subjects 1 and 3 -> wait, but our grid:\n\n        Subject0: column0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2' -> so student0 and student1 are best in subject0 (which they call subject1?).\n        They probably consider the first subject as subject1. \n\n   But the problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\n   And then: \"Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.\"\n\n   So regardless of labeling, we count the student if in at least one subject they are best.\n\n   Our method is correct.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a string: '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'\n\n   We read: \n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n   But wait, the example input format: the first line is two numbers, then next n lines.\n\n   The sample input is provided as: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   But note: the problem says: \n        \"The first input line contains two integers n and m ... Next n lines each containing m characters\"\n\n   So we can read from stdin.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, in the problem statement, the example input is given as:\n\n        Input:\n          3 3\n          223\n          232\n          112\n\n        Output:\n          2\n\n   So we'll read from stdin.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Edge cases: n=1, m=1; or all marks same.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n          1 1\n          5\n\n        Then: \n          There is one student and one subject. He is best because no one else has a higher mark (and the maximum is 5). So successful.\n\n        Code: \n          n=1, m=1\n          grid = ['5']\n\n          For subject0: col_max = '5'\n          Then for student0: grid[0][0]=='5' -> mark success_flags[0]=True -> count=1.\n\n   Another edge: \n        Input:\n          2 1\n          5\n          5\n\n        Then: \n          Two students, one subject. Both have 5. Then for subject0: col_max='5'. Then student0: set to True, then student1: set to True. Then count=2.\n\n   So the method works.\n\n   However, note: we are using the entire grid to compute the column maximum. Since n, m <= 100, it's efficient.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Read n, m from the first line.\n   Then read n lines, each of length m (without spaces)\n\n   Then, create an array `success` of n booleans, initially False.\n\n   For each column j in range(m):\n        col_max = the maximum value in the j-th column (across rows)\n        For each row i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == col_max and not success[i]:\n                success[i] = True\n\n   Then, print the sum of the `success` list (number of True values).\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n        Input: \n          3 3\n          223\n          232\n          112\n\n        Grid:\n          row0: '223'\n          row1: '232'\n          row2: '112'\n\n        Column0: ['2','2','1'] -> max='2'\n            i0: '2'=='2' -> success[0]=True\n            i1: '2'=='2' -> success[1]=True\n            i2: '1'!='2' -> skip\n\n        Column1: ['2','3','1'] -> max='3'\n            i0: '2'!='3' -> skip\n            i1: '3'=='3' -> but success[1] is already True, so leave it.\n            i2: '1'!='3' -> skip\n\n        Column2: ['3','2','2'] -> max='3'\n            i0: '3'=='3' -> success[0] is already True, so leave it.\n            i1: '2'!='3' -> skip\n            i2: '2'!='3' -> skip\n\n        Result: [True, True, False] -> count=2.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \n          3 5\n          91728\n          11828\n          11111\n\n        According to the sample, output is 3.\n\n        Let me check:\n\n        We have three students and five subjects.\n\n        Student0: '91728'\n        Student1: '11828'\n        Student2: '11111'\n\n        For each column:\n\n        Column0: ['9','1','1'] -> max='9' -> student0 is best -> mark student0 as successful.\n        Column1: ['1','1','1'] -> max='1' -> all are best, so mark student1 (if not already) and student2. But student0 is already marked, then we mark student1 and student2.\n\n        Then we have all three marked.\n\n        So output 3.\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as:\n\n            Input: \n                3 5\n                91728\n                11828\n                11111\n\n            Output: 3\n\n        So it matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input string in the problem statement is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n        This is a list of two strings, but actually in the problem the input is two separate lines for the first example and then two separate lines for the second example.\n\n        But wait, the example input format is:\n\n            Input:\n                3 3\n                223\n                232\n                112\n\n            and\n\n                3 5\n                91728\n                11828\n                11111\n\n        So we are reading from stdin. We assume that the input is provided in standard input.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the problem says the input has two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data: \n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(1, 1+n):\n            grid.append(data[i].strip())\n\n   But the problem says: first line is n and m, then n lines.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   Since n and m are up to 100, and the grid is 100x100, this is safe.\n\n   Let me write the complete code.\n\n   However, note: the example input may be provided in a file or from the console. We assume standard input.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        success = [False] * n\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            # Extract the j-th character of each row to form a list for the column\n            col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            col_max = max(col)\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max and not success[i]:\n                    success[i] = True\n\n        print(sum(success))\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings in the problem, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format.\n\n   We are following the input format.\n\n   Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=3, m=3, grid = ['223','232','112']\n\n        Column0: [ '2','2','1'] -> max='2'\n            i0: '2'=='2' -> success[0]=True\n            i1: '2'=='2' -> success[1]=True\n            i2: '1' != '2' -> skip\n\n        Column1: [ '2','3','1'] -> max='3'\n            i0: '2' != '3' -> skip\n            i1: '3'=='3' -> but success[1] is already True -> no change\n            i2: '1' != '3' -> skip\n\n        Column2: [ '3','2','2'] -> max='3'\n            i0: '3'=='3' -> success[0] is already True -> no change\n            i1: '2' != '3' -> skip\n            i2: '2' != '3' -> skip\n\n        Success flags: [True, True, False] -> sum=2.\n\n   Example 2: \n        n=3, m=5, grid = ['91728','11828','11111']\n\n        Column0: ['9','1','1'] -> max='9'\n            i0: '9'=='9' -> success[0]=True\n            i1: '1' != '9' -> skip\n            i2: '1' != '9' -> skip\n\n        Column1: ['1','1','1'] -> max='1'\n            i0: '1'=='1' -> success[0] already True -> skip (but we set it again? Actually, we check condition: if grid[i][j]==col_max and not success[i] -> so if already True, we skip. So no harm.\n            i1: '1'=='1' -> success[1] becomes True\n            i2: '1'=='1' -> success[2] becomes True\n\n        Then, success = [True, True, True] -> sum=3.\n\n   It works.\n\n   But wait: in the second example, we set student1 and student2 in the second column (column1). However, note that in the second column, all are 1, so they are all best. But the problem says: \"successful if there exists a subject\". So even if they are best in multiple subjects, we only need one. \n\n   However, note: the first column already set student0 as successful, but the others were not set until the second column.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   One more edge: when multiple columns have the same maximum, but we set a student in the first column and then in the second column we don't need to set again.\n\n   The code is efficient and handles the constraints (n, m <= 100).\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, so the max function will work.\n\n   But note: the marks are given as characters. The max of a list of characters? Yes, because '9' > '1', etc.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        success = [False] * n\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_max = max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))\n            for i in range(n):\n                if grid[i][j] == col_max and not success[i]:\n                    success[i] = True\n\n        print(sum(success))\n\n   Alternatively, we can use list comprehensions for the column, but the above is clear.\n\n   Let me try without storing the entire column as a list:\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_max = max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n   This is efficient and uses a generator.\n\n   But note: we are doing this for each j (m times) and each time we iterate n, so total operations O(m*n). With n, m <= 100, worst-case 10000, which is acceptable.\n\n   I think we are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves analyzing a grid where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject. Each cell contains a mark (from '1' to '9') indicating the student's performance in that subject.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject (column), identify the highest mark. Students who have this highest mark in any subject are deemed successful.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Read the input values for the number of students (n) and subjects (m).\n   - Read the grid of marks.\n   - For each subject (column), find the maximum mark.\n   - For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, mark them as successful.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each column and each student once, leading to a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m are up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    grid = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grid.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    success = [False] * n\n\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_max = max(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == col_max and not success[i]:\n                success[i] = True\n                \n    print(sum(success))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the dimensions (n students and m subjects), followed by n lines of m characters each representing the marks.\n2. **Initialization**: A boolean list `success` is initialized to keep track of which students are successful.\n3. **Processing Columns**: For each subject (column), the maximum mark is determined. Then, for each student, if their mark in the current subject matches the maximum and they haven't been marked successful yet, they are marked as successful.\n4. **Output**: The total number of successful students is printed, which is the count of `True` values in the `success` list.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons.",
