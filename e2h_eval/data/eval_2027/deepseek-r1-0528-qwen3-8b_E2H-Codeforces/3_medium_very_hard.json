Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers ai (lantern positions)\n The street is from 0 to l.\n Each lantern lights the interval [a_i - d, a_i + d]. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps that might require the maximum d.\n\n However, note that the entire street must be covered. There are two types of gaps:\n   a) From the start (0) to the first lantern.\n   b) Between consecutive lanterns.\n   c) From the last lantern to the end (l).\n\n But note: if we have multiple lanterns, the coverage can overlap.\n\n How to think:\n   The entire street [0, l] must be covered by the union of intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d].\n\n We can also consider:\n\n   Let d_min = max_gap / 2, but what defines the gaps?\n   Actually, we need to cover the entire street.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. If there are no lanterns (n=0), then we need d at least l/2? Actually, if there are no lanterns, then we have one lantern? No, n>=1 per constraints.\n\n   2. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n\n   3. Consider the leftmost gap: from 0 to the first lantern at a0.\n        The first lantern must cover from 0 to a0+d. To cover 0, we require d >= a0/2? Actually, we require that the first lantern's left side reaches 0: so d >= a0 (if we don't consider overlapping). But wait, if we set d = a0/2, then the first lantern would cover [a0-d, a0+d] = [a0/2, 3*a0/2]. This might not cover 0 unless a0==0.\n\n   Actually, we can break the problem into:\n\n   - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is a0. The lantern at a0 must extend to the left to cover 0. So the required d for the leftmost part is at least a0/2? Actually, the entire segment [0, a0] must be covered. The leftmost point 0 must be within [a0-d, a0+d]. Therefore, a0-d <= 0 => d >= a0. But wait, that would be too much because if there's another lantern to the left? Actually, no. Since 0 is the beginning, we require that the first lantern covers from 0 to a0. The leftmost coverage of the first lantern is a0-d, so we require a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0. However, consider: if we have multiple lanterns, we can use the entire set. But note: the condition is that the entire street [0, l] must be lit.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the necessary d as the maximum of:\n\n   - The distance from 0 to the first lantern divided by 2 (because the first lantern must cover from 0 to its position).\n   - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: for each i from 0 to n-2, the gap between a[i] and a[i+1] is (a[i+1]-a[i]). The midpoint between these two is (a[i]+a[i+1])/2, but actually the lanterns must cover the entire gap. The worst-case for the gap between two consecutive lanterns is when we require that the left lantern covers up to a[i] + d and the right lantern covers from a[i+1] - d. Then the entire gap is covered if a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d, i.e., 2*d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]), so d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   - The rightmost gap: from the last lantern at a[n-1] to l. We require that the last lantern extends at least (l - a[n-1]) to the right, so d >= (l - a[n-1]).\n\n   Therefore, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n\n      candidate1 = a[0]/2.0   (to cover from 0 to a[0])\n      candidate2 = (a[n-1] - 0) ? Wait, no. Actually, for the rightmost, we look at the gap from a[n-1] to l: we require d >= (l - a[n-1])\n\n      candidate3 = for each i from 0 to n-2: (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0\n\n   But wait, let's test with the sample: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n      n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n\n      candidate1 = 2/2.0 = 1.0\n      candidate2 = (5-0) ? Actually, for the rightmost we have the gap from 5 to 5? Actually, the last lantern is at 5, so the gap to the end (which is 5) is (5-5)=0? That doesn't sound right.\n\n   Correction for the rightmost: the last lantern must cover from its position to l. The condition is that the last lantern's right side (a_last + d) must be at least l. So d >= (l - a_last). For the sample: 5 - 5 = 0, which is not correct because we already have the lantern at 5, but the street ends at 5. Actually, the condition is that the entire street up to 5 must be covered. The lantern at 5 covers [5-d, 5+d]. But the street ends at 5, so we require 5+d >= 5 -> d>=0, which is always true. However, what if the last lantern is not at 5? Then we require the lantern to cover from a_last to l.\n\n   Actually, the rightmost gap is from a_last to l: the distance is (l - a_last). The last lantern must extend at least (l - a_last) to the right, so d >= (l - a_last). Similarly, the leftmost gap is from 0 to a0: d must be at least (a0 - 0) = a0? But wait, no: the leftmost lantern must cover from 0 to a0, so the distance from the lantern to 0 is a0, so the radius d must be at least a0. However, if we have two lanterns at 0 and 10, then for the leftmost we require d>=0 (since 0 is covered by the first lantern at 0) and for the rightmost we require d>= (l-10). But wait, in the example: \"2 5\\n0 5\": \n        n=2, l=5, lanterns at [0,5]\n        candidate1 = 0/2 = 0\n        candidate2 = (5-0)/2 = 2.5? Actually, wait: the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, so (5-0)/2 = 2.5. Then the entire street must have d>=2.5.\n\n   However, the sample input was \"2 5\\n2 5\", and the expected answer is 2.0.\n\n   Let me reexamine the sample \"2 5\\n2 5\":\n\n        The street is from 0 to 5.\n        Lantern at 2: covers [2-d, 2+d]\n        Lantern at 5: covers [5-d, 5+d]\n\n        Conditions:\n          - The first lantern must cover 0: 2-d <= 0 -> d>=2. But wait, that would be d>=2. However, the second lantern must also cover the entire street. The second lantern at 5: to cover 5, we have 5-d <= 5 (always) and 5+d >=5 (always). But what about the point 0? The first lantern must cover 0: so d>=2.\n\n        However, wait: the entire street must be covered. With d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4] and the second lantern covers [3,7]. Then the segment [0,5] is covered because [0,4] and [3,5] (since 5 is included in [3,7] but note our condition is up to 5, and the second lantern covers from 3 to 7, so 5 is covered). But wait, the gap between 4 and 5? The first lantern goes to 4, and the second lantern starts at 3, so from 3 to 4 is covered by both. The critical point is 0 and 5. 0 is covered by the first lantern (d=2 gives [0,4]), and 5 is covered by the second lantern (d=2 gives [3,7] which includes 5). So d=2 works.\n\n        Why did we get 2.5 in the gap between the two lanterns? The gap between the two lanterns is from 2 to 5, which is 3 units. The condition for the gap between two consecutive lanterns is that the two lanterns must together cover the entire gap. The left lantern extends to 2+d and the right lantern extends to 5-d. The condition is that 2+d >= 5-d -> 2*d >= 3 -> d>=1.5. However, the leftmost condition requires d>=2. So the answer is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: sort the lantern positions.\n\n        Step 2: Consider three parts:\n\n          left_gap = a[0] - 0   -> then d must be at least left_gap / 2? Actually, no: we require that the first lantern's left coverage (a0-d) <= 0, so d>=a0. But wait, that is not symmetric. Actually, the condition is that the entire street [0, l] is covered. The first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The farthest point from the first lantern on the left is 0, so we require d >= a0 - 0? Actually, the distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0, so the lantern must have a radius of at least a0 to cover 0.\n\n        However, wait: if we set d = a0, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*a0]. But then the next lantern must cover from 2*a0 to ... but note, we might have multiple lanterns.\n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n          The requirement for the leftmost part: the first lantern must cover 0. The distance from the first lantern (at a0) to 0 is a0. So the radius must be at least a0.\n\n        Similarly, the rightmost part: the last lantern must cover l. The distance from the last lantern (at a_last) to l is (l - a_last). So the radius must be at least (l - a_last).\n\n        And for the gaps between consecutive lanterns: for two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y (x<=y), the gap between them is from x to y. The left lantern must cover up to y, or the right lantern must cover from x. The condition is that the entire segment [x, y] is covered. The left lantern covers from x-d_left to x+d_left. The right lantern covers from y-d_right to y+d_right. But we use the same d for all. So the condition is that the left lantern must cover at least up to y? Actually, we require that the entire [x, y] is covered. The left lantern covers up to x+d, and the right lantern covers from y-d. Therefore, we require x+d >= y-d, i.e., d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n        So the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n          candidate1 = a[0]   (leftmost: from 0 to first lantern)\n          candidate2 = l - a[-1] (rightmost: from last lantern to l)\n          candidate3 = for each consecutive pair (a[i], a[i+1]): (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0\n\n        Then d = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n        Now test with the sample \"2 5\\n2 5\":\n\n          candidate1 = 2\n          candidate2 = 5-5 = 0\n          candidate3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n          Then d = max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> matches.\n\n        Now test with the other sample: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n          First, sort the lanterns: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\n          candidate1 = 0 -> wait, the first lantern is at 0, so leftmost gap is 0, so candidate1=0.\n          candidate2 = 15-15=0.\n          candidate3: \n            gaps: \n              3-0=3 -> 1.5\n              5-3=2 -> 1.0\n              7-5=2 -> 1.0\n              9-7=2 -> 1.0\n              14-9=5 -> 2.5\n              15-14=1 -> 0.5\n\n          Then d = max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5\n\n        The sample output is 2.5.\n\n        But wait, let me check with d=2.5:\n\n          The first lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> so from 0 to 2.5 (but the street starts at 0, so we cover [0,2.5]).\n          Next lantern at 3: covers [0.5, 5.5] -> so from 0.5 to 5.5.\n          Then 5: [2.5, 7.5]\n          Then 7: [4.5, 9.5]\n          Then 9: [6.5, 11.5]\n          Then 14: [11.5, 16.5]\n          Then 15: [12.5, 17.5]\n\n          Now, check the entire street [0,15]:\n\n          0 to 2.5: covered by first.\n          2.5 to 5.5: covered by second (starting at 0.5, so from 0.5 to 5.5) -> wait, but 2.5 is covered by the first lantern and the second lantern. Then from 5.5 to 7.5: covered by third, etc.\n\n          However, what about the gap between the first and second lantern? The first lantern only goes to 2.5 and the second lantern starts at 0.5. So the entire [0, 0.5] is covered by the second lantern? Actually, the second lantern at 3 with d=2.5 covers from 0.5 to 5.5. So the point 0 is covered by the first lantern (from 0 to 2.5) and the second lantern (from 0.5 to 5.5) overlaps. The point 0.5 is covered by both. But wait, what about the point 0? The first lantern at 0 with d=2.5 covers [0-2.5,0+2.5] = [-2.5,2.5] so 0 is covered.\n\n          However, the sample input says the answer is 2.5.\n\n        But wait, there is a gap from 0 to 3: \n          The first lantern covers [0, 2.5] and the second lantern covers [0.5,5.5]. So the entire [0,5.5] is covered by the first two. But the street goes to 15, and the last lantern is at 15, so we require the last lantern to cover 15. The last lantern is at 15, so with d=2.5 it covers [12.5,17.5] which includes 15. \n\n        However, there is a gap between 14 and 15: \n          The lantern at 14 covers [14-2.5, 14+2.5] = [11.5,16.5] -> so 15 is covered (since 15<16.5). But wait, the last lantern is at 15, so it covers [12.5,17.5] which also covers 15.\n\n        The potential issue is the gap between 9 and 14: \n          The lantern at 9 covers [6.5,11.5] and the next at 14 covers [11.5,16.5]. So the point 11.5 is covered by both. But the gap between 9 and 14 is 5, and we require d>=2.5 (which is 5/2) so that the two lanterns together cover the gap. Indeed, 9+2.5 = 11.5, and 14-2.5=11.5, so they meet exactly.\n\n        Therefore, the formula is:\n\n          d = max( \n                a[0], \n                l - a[-1],\n                max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0 for all i from 0 to n-2 )\n              )\n\n        However, wait: the leftmost condition is a[0] (distance from 0 to the first lantern) but actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a[0], so the radius must be at least a[0] (so that the left side of the first lantern reaches 0). Similarly, the last lantern must cover from a[-1] to l, so the radius must be at least (l - a[-1]).\n\n        But wait, in the sample \"2 5\\n2 5\": \n            a[0]=2, so candidate1=2, candidate2=0, and the gap between 2 and5 is 3, so (3)/2=1.5 -> so max(2,0,1.5)=2.\n\n        Another sample: \"1 10\\n5\" -> one lantern at 5, then:\n            candidate1 = 5 (because from 0 to 5: the lantern must cover 0, so d>=5)\n            candidate2 = 10-5=5\n            candidate3: no consecutive gaps (n=1, so no i from 0 to n-2)\n            so d=5.\n\n        Check: the lantern at 5 with d=5 covers [0,10] (since 5-5=0, 5+5=10). Correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the lantern is at 0? Then candidate1=0, candidate2 = l - 0 = l, and then the gaps (if any) might be considered. However, if the lantern is at 0 and we have multiple lanterns, then the leftmost is covered by the first lantern (at 0) and the rightmost by the last.\n\n        However, consider a case where the first lantern is at 0 and the last lantern is at l, then candidate1=0, candidate2=0, and the gaps in the middle: we take the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\n        Example: \"3 10\\n0 5 10\"\n            candidate1 = 0\n            candidate2 = 0\n            gaps: 5-0=5 -> 2.5; 10-5=5 -> 2.5\n            so d=2.5\n\n        Check: \n            Lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> so [0,2.5] (since negative is beyond the start, we only care about [0,2.5])\n            Lantern at 5: covers [2.5,7.5]\n            Lantern at 10: covers [7.5,12.5] -> so [7.5,10] (since 10 is the end)\n\n            Now, the entire street [0,10] is covered because:\n                [0,2.5] by first, [2.5,7.5] by second, [7.5,10] by third.\n\n        However, note that the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, and 5/2=2.5. The condition for the gap between 0 and 5 is that the first lantern must cover up to 5? Actually, the first lantern only covers to 2.5, and the second lantern starts at 2.5 (from 5-2.5=2.5). So the entire [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But wait, the condition for the gap between consecutive lanterns is that the two lanterns together must cover the gap. The condition is: d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2. For the gap between 0 and 5: (5-0)/2=2.5, so d>=2.5. And that is what we have.\n\n        However, what if the first lantern is at 0 and the next is at 1? Then the gap is 1, so (1)/2=0.5. Then the entire street requires d>=max(0, (last-lantern), 0.5). But if we have only two lanterns: [0,1] and the street length is 1, then the last lantern is at 1, so candidate2=0. Then d=0.5.\n\n        Check: d=0.5\n          First lantern: [-0.5,0.5] -> so [0,0.5]\n          Second lantern: [0.5,1.5] -> so [0.5,1] (since the street ends at 1)\n          The entire street [0,1] is covered because the first lantern covers [0,0.5] and the second [0.5,1]. At the boundary 0.5, both cover.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n        However, note: the leftmost condition is a[0] (the distance from 0 to the first lantern). But wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then the condition is d>=0 (which is always true). But if the first lantern is at 0, then we don't require the first lantern to cover a positive distance to the left (since 0 is already the start). The condition is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to its position (which is 0) so d>=0. Similarly, the rightmost condition is l - a[-1]. \n\n        But wait, the leftmost condition: the entire street from 0 to the first lantern must be covered. The first lantern is at a0. The distance from 0 to a0 is a0. The first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The leftmost point is 0, so the condition is that a0 - d <= 0, so d>=a0. But if a0=0, then d>=0, which is fine.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n          sorted_ai = sorted(ai)\n          d1 = sorted_ai[0]  # leftmost gap: from 0 to the first lantern\n          d2 = l - sorted_ai[-1]  # rightmost gap: from the last lantern to l\n          d3 = 0.0\n          for i in range(len(sorted_ai)-1):\n              gap = sorted_ai[i+1] - sorted_ai[i]\n              if gap > d3*2:   # we can avoid division until we know the maximum gap\n                  d3 = gap / 2.0\n\n          Then answer = max(d1, d2, d3)\n\n        However, note: if there are duplicate lanterns, the gap might be 0, but that's okay.\n\n        But wait, what if there are multiple lanterns at the same location? Then the gap between two consecutive same locations is 0, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let's test with duplicate: \"2 5\\n2 2\" -> two lanterns at 2. Then:\n\n          sorted_ai = [2,2]\n          d1 = 2\n          d2 = 5-2=3\n          d3: gap between 2 and 2 is 0 -> 0\n\n          Then d = max(2,3,0)=3.\n\n        Check: with d=3, the first lantern at 2 covers [-1,5] (which covers [0,5] because the street is [0,5]). Actually, the entire street [0,5] is covered by the first lantern (and the second lantern is redundant). But wait, the condition for the leftmost: the first lantern must cover 0, so d>=2. The condition for the rightmost: the last lantern (which is at 2) must cover 5, so d>=3. So the minimal d is 3.\n\n        This makes sense.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n        One more edge: n=0? But the problem states n>=1.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Read n and l.\n        Read the list of n integers.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          a.sort()\n\n          # If there's only one lantern, then we have two conditions: left and right, and no consecutive gaps.\n          d1 = a[0]   # leftmost condition\n          d2 = l - a[-1]  # rightmost condition\n          d3 = 0.0\n\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n              if gap > d3*2:   # we can also do: d3 = max(d3, gap/2.0)\n                  d3 = gap / 2.0\n\n          ans = max(d1, d2, d3)\n\n          Print ans with formatting to have 10 decimal places.\n\n        However, note: the above d3 calculation uses the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\n        But wait, what if the street is [0, l] and the lanterns are only at the beginning? Then d1=0, d2=l, and d3=0, so answer=l. But that is correct: if there is only one lantern at 0, then we require d>=l to cover the entire street from 0 to l.\n\n        But wait, if we have one lantern at 0 and the street length is l, then the condition for the rightmost is l - 0 = l, so d>=l. Also, the leftmost condition is 0 (so no constraint). Then the answer is l.\n\n        However, consider: one lantern at 0, then the lantern covers [-l, l] (if d=l) but the street is [0, l]. The leftmost is covered (0 is included) and the rightmost is covered (l is included). But is l the minimal? Actually, we require that the entire street [0,l] is covered. The lantern at 0 with d=l covers [0, l] (because from 0-d = -l to 0+l = l). So yes, d=l is the minimal.\n\n        But wait, can we have a smaller d? Suppose d=l/2, then the lantern at 0 covers [-l/2, l/2]. Then the street from 0 to l/2 is covered, but from l/2 to l is not. So we must have d>=l.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is correct.\n\n        However, note that the condition for the leftmost is d>=a[0] (the distance from 0 to the first lantern). But if the first lantern is at 0, then d>=0, which is trivial. The condition for the rightmost is d>=l - a[-1]. And the gaps between lanterns.\n\n        But wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then we require d>=a[0] (to cover 0). Similarly, if the last lantern is not at l, we require d>=l - a[-1] (to cover l). And for the gaps between lanterns, we require d>= (gap)/2.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there is only one lantern, then we have two conditions: left and right, and no consecutive gaps.\n        # But note: the consecutive gaps loop runs for n-1 times, so for n=1, the loop does nothing and d3 remains 0.\n\n        d1 = a[0]  # leftmost condition\n        d2 = l - a[-1]  # rightmost condition\n        d3 = 0.0\n\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            if gap > d3 * 2:\n                d3 = gap / 2.0\n\n        ans = max(d1, d2, d3)\n\n        # Format the answer to have 10 decimal places.\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n          Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n          d1 = 0\n          d2 = 15-15=0\n          d3: \n            gaps: 3,2,2,2,5,1 -> the maximum gap is 5, so d3=5/2=2.5\n          ans = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5 -> \"2.5000000000\"\n\n        Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n          Sorted: [2,5]\n          d1=2\n          d2=0\n          d3: gap=5-2=3 -> d3=1.5\n          ans = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> \"2.0000000000\"\n\n        But wait, the sample input is given as two separate lines for the two examples? Actually, the problem says:\n\n          Input\n          ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n        This is two separate test cases. In competitive programming, we usually read one test case. But the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides two examples.\n\n        However, the problem expects one input: two integers n, l, then a list of n integers.\n\n        Our code reads one test case.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Print the minimum light radius d\", meaning for one test case.\n\n        So the code is complete.\n\n        However, wait: the example input in the problem is given as two separate strings, but we are reading from stdin. So we assume one test case per run.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The next line contains n integers ai\", meaning the next line after the first line.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Let me test with the sample: \"1 10\\n5\", which we did above.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n=1, l=10, a=[5]\n        d1=5, d2=10-5=5, d3=0 (since no consecutive gaps)\n        ans=5 -> \"5.0000000000\"\n\n        Another test: \"3 10\\n0 5 10\"\n          d1=0, d2=0, d3 = max( (5-0)/2, (10-5)/2 ) = max(2.5,2.5)=2.5 -> \"2.5000000000\"\n\n        It seems correct.\n\n        However, wait: the condition for the leftmost is that the first lantern must cover 0, so d>=a[0]. But if the first lantern is at 0, then d>=0 is always satisfied. Similarly, if the first lantern is at 1, then d>=1.\n\n        But note: if the first lantern is at 1, then the condition is d>=1. However, what if we have two lanterns: [1,3] and the street is [0,3]? \n          Conditions:\n            leftmost: d>=1 (to cover 0: 1-d<=0 -> d>=1)\n            rightmost: d>=3-3=0\n            gap: (3-1)/2=1 -> so d>=1.\n\n          Then d=1.\n\n          Check: \n            First lantern at 1: covers [0,2]\n            Second lantern at 3: covers [2,4] (but the street ends at 3, so [2,3])\n            Together: [0,2] U [2,3] = [0,3] -> covered.\n\n        But wait, the entire street [0,3] is covered. However, note that the first lantern covers [0,2] (because 1-1=0, 1+1=2) and the second lantern covers [3-1=2, 3+1=4] (but we only care up to 3). So the point 2 is covered by both, and the entire [0,3] is covered.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the leftmost is d>=a[0] (the first element). But wait, what if the first lantern is at 0? Then d>=0. What if the first lantern is at 0 and the next is at 1, and the street is [0,10]? Then the leftmost condition is 0, so no constraint, and the rightmost condition is 10-1=9, and the gap between 0 and 1 is 1/2=0.5, then the answer is 9.\n\n        Check: \n          First lantern at 0: covers [-9,9] (if d=9) -> so from 0 to 9 is covered by the first lantern? Actually, the first lantern at 0 with d=9 covers [0-9,0+9] = [-9,9]. Then the second lantern at 1: with d=9 covers [1-9,1+9] = [-8,10]. The street [0,10] is covered because the first lantern covers [0,9] and the second lantern covers [0,10] (actually, the entire street is covered by the first lantern alone). But wait, the condition for the rightmost is 10-1=9, so we require d>=9. And indeed, without d=9 the first lantern would only cover up to 9, so the point 10 is not covered by the first lantern. The second lantern at 1 with d=9 covers up to 10, so 10 is covered.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        One more: \"3 10\\n0 1 10\"\n          Conditions:\n            d1 = 0\n            d2 = 10-10=0\n            gaps: 1-0=1 -> 0.5, 10-1=9 -> 4.5\n            so d=4.5\n\n        Check: d=4.5\n          First lantern at 0: covers [-4.5,4.5] -> so [0,4.5] (since negative is beyond 0)\n          Second lantern at 1: covers [-3.5,5.5] -> [0,5.5] (since negative is beyond 0)\n          Third lantern at 10: covers [5.5,14.5] -> [5.5,10] (since street ends at 10)\n\n          Now, check the entire street [0,10]:\n            [0,4.5] is covered by first and second.\n            [4.5,5.5] is covered by second and third (the second goes to 5.5, and the third starts at 5.5).\n            [5.5,10] is covered by third.\n\n          But wait, the gap between the second and third lantern is 10-1=9, so we require d>=4.5. And that is the value we set.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the gaps is that the two adjacent lanterns must cover the gap between them. The condition is that the left lantern must extend at least to the right lantern's position, i.e., a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d -> d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimal light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The street is represented as a straight line from 0 to `l`, with `n` lanterns placed at specific positions. Each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` on either side of its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to ensure every point on the street from 0 to `l` is covered by at least one lantern's light. The challenge is to find the smallest `d` that satisfies this condition for all points.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal `d` is determined by three main factors:\n   - **Leftmost Gap**: The distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The first lantern must extend far enough to the left to cover 0, so `d` must be at least this distance.\n   - **Rightmost Gap**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`). The last lantern must extend far enough to the right to cover `l`, so `d` must be at least this distance.\n   - **Consecutive Lanterns**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. Specifically, the light from the left lantern should reach at least as far as the right lantern's position minus its light radius, and vice versa. This translates to `d` being at least half the distance between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the lantern positions to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - Calculate the leftmost and rightmost gaps.\n   - Determine the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns and compute half of this value.\n   - The solution is the maximum value among the leftmost gap, rightmost gap, and half the largest consecutive gap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nd1 = a[0]\nd2 = l - a[-1]\nd3 = 0.0\n\nif n > 1:\n    for i in range(len(a)-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        if gap > d3 * 2:\n            d3 = gap / 2.0\n\nans = max(d1, d2, d3)\nprint(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`, followed by the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order.\n3. **Leftmost and Rightmost Gaps**: \n   - `d1` is the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover this distance, so `d` must be at least `d1`.\n   - `d2` is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`). The last lantern must cover this distance, so `d` must be at least `d2`.\n4. **Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The required `d` to cover this gap is half the gap distance. The largest such value across all consecutive pairs is stored in `d3`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal `d` is the maximum value among `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, ensuring all parts of the street are covered.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal light radius by considering the critical gaps that must be covered, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n).",
