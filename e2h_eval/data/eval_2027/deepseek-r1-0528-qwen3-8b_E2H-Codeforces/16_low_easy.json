Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation: \n Moving from one block to another is allowed if they share a nonzero common border. This means that crossing one road at a time is allowed. However, if we cross multiple roads at an intersection (i.e., several roads meet at a point), then we are crossing multiple roads at once? But note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n Actually, the problem is equivalent to: we start in a block, and we want to get to the university's block by crossing roads. Each road we cross changes the block. However, if two blocks share a common border of infinite length (which would be a half-plane), then we are effectively crossing one road. But note: the borders are segments of the roads, so the common border is part of a road. \n\n However, note that the problem states: \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\", meaning that if two blocks share a segment (not just a point) then we can cross. \n\n There is a well-known fact: the entire plane is divided by the n lines. The regions (blocks) are separated by the lines. The minimal steps required to go from one block to another is the number of roads that separate the two points. But note: if the two points are separated by k distinct roads, then we must cross each one of those k roads. However, we cannot cross multiple roads at once (unless they are all passing through the same point? but even then, we still have to consider that crossing multiple roads at the same point might not be allowed because the common border must be nonzero). \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". So, if two blocks are separated by a road, then they share a common border (a half-plane). Therefore, moving from one side of the road to the other is one step. \n\n But wait: what if two blocks are separated by two different roads? Then you need two steps. However, note that the entire journey is from the home block to the university block. The minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points, but with a caveat: if the two points are separated by a set of roads, then the minimal steps is the number of roads that are between the two points, and you must cross each one.\n\n However, there is an alternative view: the problem is similar to counting the number of roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides. Because if two points are on the same side of a road, then that road does not separate them. If they are on opposite sides, then that road separates them and must be crossed.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the roads divide the plane into connected regions\", and the movement is from one block to an adjacent one (sharing a border). The minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. However, wait: is that always true?\n\n Example: \n   Input 1: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), roads: [0 1 0] and [1 0 0]\n   Output: 2\n\n Explanation: \n   The first road: x = 0 (vertical line)\n   The second road: y = 0 (horizontal line)\n\n   The home is at (1,1) (first quadrant) and the university at (-1,-1) (third quadrant). \n   To get from (1,1) to (-1,-1), we must cross the vertical road (x=0) and the horizontal road (y=0). So two steps.\n\n   Now, consider if the two points are separated by a set of roads. Each road that separates the two points must be crossed exactly once.\n\n   However, what if two roads are such that both separate the two points? Then we must cross two roads, so two steps.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the number of roads i for which the two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) lie on opposite sides.\n\n   How do we check for a road (a, b, c)? \n        For a road: ax + by + c = 0.\n        We can evaluate:\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        Since the points are not on the road, val1 != 0 and val2 != 0.\n\n        The two points are on the same side if val1 * val2 > 0, and on opposite sides if val1 * val2 < 0.\n\n   Then, the answer",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing the university, given that each step involves crossing a road (an infinite line) that separates the two blocks. The key observation here is that each road that separates the home and university must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate two points in a plane. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. A point lies on one side of a road if the value of the line equation (ax + by + c) at that point is positive or negative. If the two points lie on opposite sides of a road, then that road must be crossed to move from one point to the other.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check whether the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, increment the step count. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps needed.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the line equation at both points. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points and must be crossed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `n` roads exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 300`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the line equation (ax + by + c) is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: If the evaluations of the line equation at the two points have opposite signs, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed.\n4. **Counting Steps**: The total number of such roads is counted and printed, representing the minimal steps needed to reach the university's block from the home's block.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the minimal path between the two points.",
