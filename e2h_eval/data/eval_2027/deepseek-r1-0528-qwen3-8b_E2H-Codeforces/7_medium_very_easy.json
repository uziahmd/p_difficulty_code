The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given a number `n` (from 1 to 10^18) and we need to check whether there exists an integer `k > 1` and an integer `r >= 1` (number of expansion steps) such that the total number of vertices is `n`.\n\n The construction:\n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Step 1: Add k new vertices connected to the center -> total = 1 + k.\n   Step 2: Each of the k leaves from step 1 now each have degree 1 (so they will be expanded) and each adds k new vertices -> total = 1 + k + k*k.\n\n In general, after `r` steps, the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least once\" meaning r>=1. However, note that the smallest snowflake for k=4 has 1 + 4 = 5? Actually, wait: the example says the smallest for k=4 is shown, but the example input includes 6 and 13, etc.\n\n Let me re-read: \n   Step 0: 1 vertex.\n   Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new ones (so step 1: 1+k).\n   Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (which at step 1 are the k leaves) is connected to k more new vertices. This step is done at least once.\n\n So actually, we have at least two layers: the center and the first ring. Then we can do more rings.\n\n The formula for the total number of vertices after r layers (with r>=1) is:\n\n   n = 1 + k * (1 + k * (1 + ... ))   [r times]\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   n = (k^(r+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n But note: the problem says the step of connecting to k new vertices must be done at least once. So r>=1.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to stop after the first step? Then r=1: n = 1 + k.\n\n But also we can have more than one step. So the equation is:\n\n   n = (k^(r+1) - 1) / (k-1)   for some integer k>1 and integer r>=1.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the same k for every expansion? Actually, the model uses the same k for every expansion. So k is fixed.\n\n Now, the challenge: Given n (which can be up to 10^18), we need to check if there exists an integer k>1 and an integer r>=1 such that:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r.\n\n However, note that the series is geometric. We can also consider:\n\n   n = 1 + k*(n')   where n' = (k^r - 1)/(k-1) [but that might not help directly].\n\n But note: we can also think of the process as having multiple layers. The center is always present, and then each node from the previous layer adds k children.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire graph as having:\n   Layer0: 1 node (the center)\n   Layer1: k nodes\n   Layer2: k^2 nodes\n   ...\n   Layer r: k^r nodes\n\n So the total is the sum of a geometric progression with ratio k, from exponent 0 to r.\n\n Therefore, n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r = (k^(r+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n We are to check for existence of integers k>1 and r>=1 such that this holds.\n\n However, note that k must be an integer greater than 1, and r is a positive integer (at least 1).\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since n can be up to 10^18, we cannot iterate over k from 2 to n.\n\n Let's rearrange the equation:\n\n   n = (k^(r+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n For a fixed k (>=2) and varying r, the value n must be an integer and the equation must hold.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix the number of layers r (which is at least 1) and then try to solve for k.\n\n But note: r can be very large because k is at least 2, so the smallest n for a given r is when k=2: then n = 2^(r+1)-1. For n=10^18, the maximum r is about log2(10^18) which is around 60. So we can iterate over possible r from 1 to about 60 (since 2^60 is already around 1e18).\n\n However, note: the base k might be larger than 2. But observe that for a fixed r, the equation becomes:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r.\n\n For fixed r, we can write:\n\n   n = (k^(r+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n This is equivalent to:\n\n   n*(k-1) = k^(r+1) - 1\n\n Then:\n\n   k^(r+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n But note: we are trying to see if there exists an integer k>=2 and integer r>=1 satisfying this.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n   Since the snowflake must have at least 1 + k (for r=1) and k>=2, the minimum n is 3 (if k=2, then n=1+2=3). However, note that the problem says k>1, so k>=2.\n\n But wait, the example input: \n     1 -> NO\n     2 -> NO\n     3 -> NO   (because for n=3: 1+k=3 => k=2, but then we must do at least one expansion step, and the expansion step is done at least once. However, note the definition: the first step is to connect the center to k new ones (so we get 1+k). Then the next step: each leaf (which are k in number) must connect to k new ones. But the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must do the expansion step at least once. However, wait: the problem says:\n\n        Step 0: 1 vertex.\n        Step 1: connect the center to k new ones.\n        Then, each vertex with degree 1 (the leaves) must be expanded (each connected to k new ones). And this expansion step should be done at least once.\n\n     So the first expansion (step 1) is mandatory, and then we must do at least one more expansion? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\n     This is ambiguous. Let me read again: \n\n        \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1).\"\n\n        Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n     So the first expansion (center to k) is the first part, then the second part (expanding the leaves) is the step that must be done at least once.\n\n     Therefore, the entire process must have at least two expansions? Or is the first expansion considered separately?\n\n     Actually, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1).\" — this is the first expansion.\n\n     Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" — meaning that after the first expansion, we must do at least one more expansion (on the leaves).\n\n     Therefore, the minimal snowflake (r=2) has:\n\n        Layer0: 1\n        Layer1: k\n        Layer2: k^2\n\n        Total n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n     But wait, the example says: \"The smallest possible snowflake for k = 4\" — which would be 1 + 4 + 4^2 = 21? \n\n     However, the example input includes 6 and 13. Let me check:\n\n        n=6: 1 + k + k^2 = 6? Then k^2 + k -5 =0 -> k=( -1 + sqrt(21) )/2, not integer.\n\n        But wait, maybe we can have different numbers of layers? Actually, the problem says the expansion step (the one that adds k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. That means we must have at least two expansions: the center expansion (step1) and then one expansion for the leaves (step2). However, what if we stop after the first expansion? \n\n        The problem says: \"This step [expanding the leaves] should be done at least once.\" — meaning we must do the expansion step (on the leaves) at least once. So the first expansion (from center) is mandatory, and then the expansion of the leaves (which are the first ring) is mandatory at least once. Therefore, the minimal snowflake must have at least two expansions (so three layers: center, first ring, second ring). \n\n        Then the minimal n is for k=2: 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7.\n\n        But wait, the example output includes:\n\n            Input: 6 -> Output: NO\n            Input: 13 -> Output: YES\n\n        How can 13 be achieved?\n\n        With k=3: 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1+3+9=13.\n\n        Then 13 is achieved with k=3 and r=2 (two expansions: center, then two rings? Actually, the center is layer0, then layer1 and layer2: so two expansions beyond the center? But note: the center is the initial vertex, then we do the first expansion (to k) and then the second expansion (on the leaves) is the next step. So yes, two expansions (steps) after the center.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the first expansion is the center to k, and then the expansion of the leaves (which are the ones with degree 1) must be done at least once. So that's two expansions: the center expansion and then one expansion for the leaves.\n\n        Therefore, the total number of expansions (layers) is 2 (center is layer0, then layer1 and layer2). So the formula is:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2\n\n        Then why is 3 (which would be k=2 and only the first expansion) not allowed? Because we must do the leaf expansion at least once. So 3 is not allowed.\n\n        Similarly, 1 and 2 are too small.\n\n        Then what about n=7? 1+2+4=7 -> YES.\n\n        However, the example input also has:\n\n            Input: 1 -> NO\n            Input: 2 -> NO\n            Input: 3 -> NO\n            Input: 6 -> NO\n            Input: 13 -> YES\n            Input: 15 -> YES\n            Input: 255 -> YES\n            Input: 10101 -> YES\n            Input: 1000000000000000000 -> NO\n\n        Let's check 15:\n\n            We can have two layers: 1 + k + k^2 = 15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> k=( -1 ± sqrt(57) )/2 -> no integer.\n\n            Three layers: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 = 15 -> k^3+k^2+k-14=0. Try k=2: 8+4+2-14=0? 8+4+2=14 -> 14-14=0 -> yes, so k=2 and r=3 (three layers: center, then two expansions) -> n=1+2+4+8=15.\n\n        So 15 is YES.\n\n        Now, 255: \n            Two layers: 1+k+k^2=255 -> k^2+k-254=0 -> k ~ (-1+sqrt(1+1016))/2 ~ (-1+sqrt(1017))/2 ~ (31.9)/2 ~ 15.95 -> no.\n            Three layers: 1+k+k^2+k^3=255 -> k^3+k^2+k-254=0. \n                k=6: 6^3=216, 216+36+6=258 -> too big.\n                k=5: 125+25+5=155 -> too small.\n                k=6 gives 258, so no.\n            Four layers: 1+k+k^2+k^3+k^4=255 -> k^4+k^3+k^2+k-254=0.\n                k=3: 81+27+9+3 = 120 -> too small.\n                k=4: 256+64+16+4 = 340 -> too big.\n            Five layers: k^5+...+k+1=255. \n                k=2: 1+2+4+8+16+32=63 -> too small.\n                k=3: 1+3+9+27+81+243 -> wait, we are only doing five layers? Actually, five layers would be exponents 0 to 4: 1+3+9+27+81 = 121 -> too small.\n                k=4: 1+4+16+64+256 = 341 -> too big.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe we missed a k? \n\n            Note: the formula is for a fixed k and a fixed r (number of layers, which is the exponent going up to r). \n\n            Let me try with two layers for k=2: 1+2+4=7, three layers: 15, four layers: 31, five layers: 63, six layers: 127, seven layers: 255.\n\n            So for k=2 and r=7: n= (2^8-1)/(2-1) = 255. So 255 is YES.\n\n        Now 10101:\n\n            We need to find an integer k>=2 and an integer r>=2 (since at least two layers) such that:\n\n                (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) = 10101\n\n            Alternatively, we can factorize 10101? Or iterate over possible r (from 2 to maybe 50, because 2^50 is about 1e15, but 10101 is about 10^4, so r won't be very high).\n\n            Alternatively, note: the equation is:\n\n                n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n            We can try small r and then solve for k.\n\n            Let r=2: 1+k+k^2 = 10101 -> k^2+k-10100=0 -> k ~ (-1+sqrt(40401))/2. sqrt(40401)=201.0 (approx) -> k=(200)/2=100 -> 100^2+100+1=10101. Yes.\n\n            So 10101 is YES.\n\n        And 1000000000000000000 (1e18) is NO.\n\n Approach:\n\n   Since n can be as large as 10^18, we cannot iterate over all k from 2 to n.\n\n   However, note that the number of layers (r) is at most about 60 (because even for k=2, 2^60 is about 1e18, and the formula is (2^(61)-1) which is about 2e18, so we can set a limit on r: from 1 to about 60 or 61).\n\n   But wait: the problem requires at least two layers (r>=2, because the first expansion is the center, then the leaves expansion is the second layer). Actually, the minimal is two layers (r=2). However, note: the problem states:\n\n        Step0: 1\n        Step1: add k new ones (so now 1+k) -> this is the first expansion (layer1)\n        Then, we must do the expansion step (on the leaves) at least once -> so we must have at least layer2.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal r is 2.\n\n   So we can iterate over the number of layers from 2 up to about 60 (or until the minimal n for k=2 exceeds 10^18). For each r, we need to check if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n        n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   Rearranged:\n\n        n*(k-1) = k^(r+1) - 1\n\n   For fixed r, we can try to solve for k. Note that k must be an integer>=2.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: for a fixed r, the left side is linear in k and the right side is exponential. We can use binary search for k? But note: k must be an integer.\n\n   But note: the equation is:\n\n        k^(r+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   We can try to find an integer k such that k^(r+1) is approximately n*k (if n is large). \n\n   However, note that the left side grows much faster. We can set:\n\n        Let f(k) = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) = n.\n\n   We can also note that for a fixed r, the function f(k) is strictly increasing for k>=2.\n\n   So for fixed r, we can try to find an integer k such that f(k)=n.\n\n   How to find k for fixed r? \n\n        We know that k must be at least 2.\n\n        Also, note that the minimal value for n (with fixed r) is when k=2: n_min = (2^(r+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(r+1)-1.\n\n        Then, we can set an upper bound for k: \n\n            Since (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) >= k^r (because the series is dominated by the last term) and we know k^r <= n, so k <= n^(1/r).\n\n        But note: we are iterating over r from 2 to about 60, and for each r we can solve for k by taking the (r+1)th root? Actually, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, ceil(n^(1/r)) + 1] (but n can be 1e18, and r is at least 2, so n^(1/r) is at most 1e9 for r=2, which is too many to iterate over).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that for fixed r, we can compute k by solving:\n\n        k^(r+1) - (n)*(k-1) - 1 = 0\n\n   But note: we are not required to find the exact k for every r, but just to check existence.\n\n   Another idea: for fixed r, we can use the equation:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\n        => n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        We can rearrange to:\n\n        k^(r+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        Now, for k>=2, we can try to see if there exists an integer k such that the equation holds.\n\n   But note: we can also consider the following: \n\n        For a fixed r, we can consider the equation:\n\n            k^r + k^(r-1) + ... + k + 1 = n\n\n        This is a polynomial in k of degree r. We can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] but that is too broad.\n\n   However, note that k must be roughly around the (r+1)th root of n? Actually, the dominant term is k^r (if we ignore the lower ones) so k is approximately the (r)th root of n? \n\n   Actually, since the entire sum is about k^r (if k is large) then k is roughly around n^(1/r). \n\n   Steps for fixed r (from 2 to about 60):\n\n        Let low = 2, high = 2 (initially) but we need an upper bound.\n\n        We know that k^r <= n (because the last term alone is k^r and the entire sum is bigger than k^r). So k <= n^(1/r).\n\n        We can set high = int(round(n**(1/r))) + 10   [but n is 10^18, and r is at least 2, so for r=2, high is about 10^9+10, which is too many to iterate over by linear search.\n\n   We need a better way.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that the equation is:\n\n        k^(r+1) - (n*(k-1)+1) = 0\n\n   and we can use binary search for k in the range [2, min(10**6, n)]? But wait, for r=2, k might be as large as 10^9 (if n=10^18, then k^2 ~ 10^18, so k ~ 10^9). We cannot iterate from 2 to 10^9.\n\n   Another idea: for fixed r, we can use Newton-Raphson or simply use the fact that k must be an integer and check the candidate k0 = floor((n)^(1/r)) and then check k0 and k0+1, k0-1? But wait, the equation is not the same as k^r = n.\n\n   Actually, the entire sum is:\n\n        S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r.\n\n   We can approximate k by the solution to k^r ≈ n (ignoring the lower terms). Then the actual k might be around n^(1/r). Then we can check the candidate k0 = floor(n^(1/r)) and k0+1, and also consider that the sum might be slightly less than k^(r+1)/(k-1) (but we have the exact equation).\n\n   However, note that the equation is:\n\n        S = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n   We can try:\n\n        Let k_low = 2, k_high = 10**6   (but for r=2, k_high might be 10^9, which is too high)\n\n   We need to set k_high appropriately. Note that:\n\n        k^r <= n   (because the last term is k^r and the whole sum is at least k^r)\n\n        So k <= n**(1/r)\n\n   But n can be up to 10^18, so for r=2, k_high = 10^9, which is too big to iterate.\n\n   Instead, we can use a mathematical observation:\n\n        We have two cases:\n\n        Case 1: r=2 (two layers: center and two expansions). Then:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n            => k^2 + k + (1-n) = 0.\n\n            Then k = [-1 + sqrt(1+4*(n-1))]/2 = [-1 + sqrt(4*n-3)]/2.\n\n            We need 4*n-3 to be a perfect square and the result to be an integer >=2.\n\n        Case 2: r>=3.\n\n        But wait, we can use the same idea for any r: the equation is a polynomial of degree r. However, note that we are only iterating over r from 2 to about 60, and for each r we can use a root-finding method for the equation:\n\n            (k^(r+1)-1) = n*(k-1)\n\n        But note: the equation is nonlinear and we are looking for integer k.\n\n        However, note that k must be an integer and the left side is exponential. We can use binary search for k in the range [2, ceil(n**(1/r)) + 1] (but the range might be too large for large n and small r).\n\n        Alternative for fixed r: \n\n            Let f(k) = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)   for k>=2.\n\n            We want to know if there exists integer k>=2 such that f(k)=n.\n\n            We can use binary search for k in the range [2, min(10**6, n)]? But again, for r=2, k can be up to 10^9.\n\n        We need a smarter way.\n\n        Notice that the equation for fixed r can be rewritten as:\n\n            k^(r+1) - (n*(k-1)+1) = 0.\n\n        We can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] but that is too big.\n\n        However, note that k is at most about n^(1/r). For r=60, k is at most about 2 (because 2^60 is around 1e18, and 3^60 is huge). So for large r, k is small. But for small r (like r=2,3,...,50) k might be large.\n\n        We can split the cases:\n\n          Case 1: r is large (say r>=50) then k must be 2 (because 3^50 is already 3^50 ~ 1e23, which is greater than 1e18, so k=2 is the only possibility for large r). Then we just check if for k=2, n = (2^(r+1)-1) and then check if n equals (2^(r+1)-1) for some r (which is the same as checking if n+1 is a power of 2 and n+1>=5).\n\n          Case 2: r is small (from 2 to say 50) then k might be large. But note: the minimal k is 2, and the maximal k is n^(1/r). However, we cannot iterate over k from 2 to n^(1/r) because n^(1/r) can be very large.\n\n        Another idea: for fixed r, we can solve for k by considering that k must satisfy:\n\n            k^(r+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        and note that k must be an integer. We can use the following:\n\n            Let k_min = 2\n            Let k_max = min(10**6, int(round(n**(1/r)))+10)   # but for r=2, n=1e18, k_max=10**9+10 -> too big.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n            Since the function f(k) = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] but that range is too big.\n\n        However, note that k is at most around n^(1/r). We can set:\n\n            k_low = 2\n            k_high = 2\n            while (k_high)**r < n:\n                k_high *= 2\n\n            Then we have an interval [k_low, k_high] that contains the solution (if exists). Then we can do binary search in the logarithmic of the exponent (base 2) of n, which is about log2(n^(1/r)) = (log2(n))/r, which is acceptable because r is at least 2 and at most 60.\n\n        Steps for fixed r (from 2 to max_r, where max_r is about 60):\n\n            Step 1: Check if n < (2^(r+1)-1): then no solution for this r.\n\n            Step 2: Set k_low = 2, k_high = 2.\n\n            Step 3: Double k_high until (k_high)^(r+1) > n*(k_high-1)+1? Actually, we can use the condition that the minimal value for the sum with k=k_high is (k_high^(r+1)-1)/(k_high-1) and we want to find k such that this equals n.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                We know that k must satisfy: k^r <= n (because the last term is k^r and the entire sum is at least k^r). \n\n                Then set k_high = min(10**7, int(round(n**(1/r)))+10)   # but 10**7 is arbitrary and for r=2, n=1e18, then k_high=10**9+10, which is too big.\n\n        We need to avoid iterating over too many k.\n\n        Insight: for fixed r, the equation is:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r.\n\n        We can use the fact that k is the integer root of the equation:\n\n            k^r <= n < (k+1)^r * (something) ? Not exactly.\n\n        But note: the entire sum is (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1). We can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] but the range is too big.\n\n        However, we can use the following: \n\n            We know that k must be at least 2 and at most n (obviously). But note that the growth is exponential, so we can break early.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n            We are iterating over r from 2 to about 60. For each r, we can compute:\n\n                k_approx = round(n**(1/r))\n\n            Then check k_approx, k_approx-1, k_approx+1, and also note that the equation is not exactly k^r = n, but the entire sum.\n\n        But wait, the entire sum is about k^r (if k is large) but actually the entire sum is (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) ~ k^(r+1)/(k-1) for large k. \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            k^(r) <= n <= (k+1)^(r)   ? Not necessarily, because the entire sum is more than k^r.\n\n        However, we can use the following: \n\n            We know that k is an integer and the equation is:\n\n                n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r.\n\n            We can compute the sum for a candidate k and compare to n.\n\n        Since we are iterating over r (which is at most 60) and for each r we only need to check a few candidate k's (maybe 3 or 4), we can do:\n\n            Step 1: For the current r, we want to find an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n                    n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n            Step 2: We can set k_min = 2, k_max = None.\n\n            Step 3: We can use the approximation: k = floor(n^(1/r)) might be too high? \n\n            Alternatively, note that the entire sum is at least k^r (the last term) and at most (k^(r+1))/(k-1) (by the geometric series formula). \n\n            We can set:\n\n                k_low = 2\n                k_high = 10**6   # but for r=2, k_high might be 10^9 which is too big.\n\n        We need a way to get an upper bound for k without iterating.\n\n        Observation: \n\n            The equation: (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n            => k^(r+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n            For k>=2, we have k^(r+1) >= 2^(r+1). \n\n            Also, k^(r+1) <= n*k   (since n*(k-1)+1 <= n*k, and for k>=2, n*(k-1)+1 <= n*k)\n\n            Then k^r <= n.\n\n            So k <= n^(1/r)\n\n        So we can set k_high = int(round(n**(1/r))) + 1\n\n        But note: n can be 10^18, and for r=2, k_high = 10^9, which is too big to iterate from 2 to 10^9.\n\n        However, we don't need to iterate. We can check candidate k's by:\n\n            candidate1 = floor(n**(1/r))\n            candidate2 = ceil(n**(1/r))\n            candidate3 = floor(n**(1/(r+1)))? Not sure.\n\n        But note: the entire sum is (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1). We can check:\n\n            Let candidate_k = [floor(n**(1/r)), ceil(n**(1/r)), floor(n**(1/r))-1, floor(n**(1/r))+1, floor(n**(1/r))-2, floor(n**(1/r))+2]   and then check each candidate_k that is at least 2.\n\n        However, is that sufficient? \n\n            Example: n=13, r=2: \n                candidate_k = floor(13^(1/2)) = floor(3.6055) = 3, then 3,4,2.\n\n                Check k=2: (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7 -> not 13.\n                Check k=3: (3^3-1)/(3-1)= (27-1)/2=26/2=13 -> works.\n\n            Example: n=15, r=3:\n                candidate_k = floor(15^(1/3)) ~ floor(2.466)=2, then 2,3,1 (but k>=2, so 1 is skipped).\n                Check k=2: (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15 -> works.\n\n            Example: n=7, r=2: \n                candidate_k = floor(7^(1/2))~2, then 2,3,1 -> k=2: (2^3-1)/1=7 -> works.\n\n            Example: n=6, r=2: \n                candidate_k = floor(sqrt(6))~2 -> k=2: 7 !=6 -> no.\n\n            Example: n=1e18, r=2: \n                candidate_k = floor(sqrt(1e18)) = 10^9, then check k=10^9, 10^9-1, 10^9+1.\n\n                But note: the equation for k=10^9 and r=2: \n                    n = 1 + k + k^2 = 1 + 10^9 + 10^18.\n\n                But 1+10^9+10^18 is 1000000000000000001, which is greater than 10^18.\n\n                Actually, n=10^18, so we are checking if 10^18 = 1+k+k^2.\n\n                Then k^2+k+1-10^18=0 -> k = (-1±sqrt(1-4*(1-10^18)))/2 = (-1±sqrt(4*10^18-3))/2.\n\n                But 4*10^18-3 is almost a perfect square? \n\n                Let x = sqrt(4*10^18-3) -> x is very close to 2*10^9. \n\n                But 2*10^9 squared is 4e18, so sqrt(4e18-3) is very close to 2e9, but not an integer.\n\n                Then we check k=10^9-1 and 10^9+1? \n\n                k=10^9-1: \n                    n = 1 + (10^9-1) + (10^9-1)^2 = 1 + 10^9-1 + (10^18 - 2*10^9 + 1) = 10^18 - 10^9 + 1 ->",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a central vertex, and each subsequent layer adds \\( k \\) new vertices connected to the vertices in the previous layer. The key observation is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must satisfy the equation \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^r \\) for some integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( r \\geq 1 \\). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to checking if \\( n \\) can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with ratio \\( k \\geq 2 \\) and at least two terms (since \\( r \\geq 1 \\)). The minimal case is when \\( r = 1 \\), but the problem requires at least one expansion beyond the initial connection, so \\( r \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible number of layers \\( r \\) (from 2 up to a maximum where \\( 2^{(r+1)} \\) exceeds \\( n \\)), we can compute the required \\( k \\) using binary search or direct computation. However, given the constraints \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we need an efficient method.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over possible values of \\( r \\) (number of layers) from 2 to a maximum of 60 (since \\( 2^{60} \\) is around \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n   - For each \\( r \\), compute the candidate \\( k \\) values by solving the equation \\( n = (k^{(r+1)} - 1)/(k-1) \\). This involves checking if \\( n \\) can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with integer \\( k \\geq 2 \\).\n   - Use mathematical properties to limit the range of \\( k \\) values checked for each \\( r \\). Specifically, \\( k \\) must satisfy \\( k^r \\leq n < (k+1)^r \\times \\text{something} \\), but more precisely, \\( k \\) is approximately \\( n^{1/r} \\).\n\n4. **Optimization**: For each \\( r \\), instead of iterating over all possible \\( k \\), we compute a candidate \\( k \\) based on \\( n^{1/r} \\) and check nearby integers. This avoids the high computational cost of exhaustive search.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_geometric_series(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n        \n    max_r = 0\n    temp = n\n    while temp >= 5:\n        temp //= 2\n        max_r += 1\n        \n    found = False\n    for r in range(2, max_r + 1):\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        while (high ** (r + 1)) <= n * (high - 1) + 1:\n            high *= 2\n            \n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            total = (mid ** (r + 1) - 1) // (mid - 1)\n            if total == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif total < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n                \n        if found:\n            break\n            \n    return found\n\nt = int(input().strip())\nresults = []\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n_val = int(input().strip())\n    if n_val < 7:\n        results.append(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if is_geometric_series(n_val):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n\nfor res in results:\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if the given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a valid snowflake graph.\n2. **Edge Cases**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it immediately returns \"NO\" because the smallest valid snowflake has 7 vertices (for \\( k=2 \\) and \\( r=2 \\)).\n3. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each possible number of layers \\( r \\) (from 2 to a maximum determined by the logarithm of \\( n \\)), the code performs a binary search to find an integer \\( k \\) such that the sum of the geometric series equals \\( n \\).\n4. **Efficiency**: The binary search limits the number of checks per \\( r \\), making the solution feasible even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n5. **Output**: For each test case, the code outputs \"YES\" if a valid \\( k \\) is found, otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of constructing a snowflake graph with \\( n \\) vertices by leveraging mathematical properties of geometric series and binary search.",
