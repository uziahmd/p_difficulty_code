Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S.\n\n Note: There are 26 English letters, and the Morse code strings for these letters have lengths from 1 to 4. The set of invalid strings (of length 1 to 4) is given: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n However, note that the problem states that each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 that is not one of the four invalid ones corresponds to a distinct English letter.\n\n But note: We are allowed to use any substring of S. And we are counting sequences (i.e., words) that are represented by some contiguous substring? Actually, note: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". \n\n Let's read the example: \n   S = \"111\"\n   They list: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n However, note that:\n   \"T\" -> \"1\"\n   \"M\" -> \"11\"\n   \"O\" -> \"111\"\n\n Then \"TT\" is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", but wait: \"11\" is also the representation for \"M\". So the same Morse string can represent different letters? Actually, no: the mapping from Morse to letters is fixed. But note: the problem says \"distinct English letter\", meaning that each valid string of length 1 to 4 (excluding the four invalid ones) maps to one letter.\n\n However, the example counts the same Morse string multiple times if they appear in different ways? But note: the example counts:\n\n   \"T\": represented by \"1\"\n   \"M\": represented by \"11\"\n   \"O\": represented by \"111\"\n\n   Then \"TT\" is two T's: so the word \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\" (which is the same as the representation of \"M\"). Similarly, \"TM\" is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", which is \"M\", and \"MT\" is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", again \"M\". And \"TTT\" is \"111\", which is \"O\".\n\n So actually, the problem is: we are to count every distinct sequence (word) of one or more English letters such that the word's Morse code representation (which is the concatenation of the Morse codes of the letters) appears as a contiguous substring in S?\n\n But wait, the example output after \"111\" is 7. The example lists 7 words.\n\n However, note: the example does not say that the word must be represented by a substring that is exactly the concatenation of the Morse codes without breaking the substring arbitrarily. Actually, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\".\n\n This means: we are allowed to break the substring arbitrarily? Actually, no. The Morse code representation of a letter is fixed (for example, 'T' is \"1\", and 'M' is \"11\"). Then a word is a sequence of letters, and its Morse code representation is the concatenation of the Morse codes of the letters. Then we require that this entire concatenated string appears as a contiguous substring in S.\n\n But note: the example counts \"TT\" as a word. The Morse code for \"TT\" is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\". And \"11\" is a substring of \"111\". Similarly, \"TM\" is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", and \"MT\" is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\". So the word \"TT\", \"TM\", and \"MT\" all have the same Morse code \"11\", which is present.\n\n However, what about the word \"T\"? It is represented by \"1\", which is also a substring. Similarly, \"M\" by \"11\", and \"O\" by \"111\".\n\n But then why are there only 7? The example counts:\n   \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n Now, note that the word \"TT\" is two T's, and the word \"TTT\" is three T's.\n\n However, the word \"T\" is already counted, and the word \"TT\" is two T's, which is different from \"T\". Similarly, \"TTT\" is different.\n\n But wait, what if the word \"MM\"? Its Morse code is \"11\"+\"11\" = \"1111\", which is invalid because \"1111\" is one of the excluded strings? Actually, the excluded strings are only the four: \"0011\",",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a given string S, where each modification to S (appending a '0' or '1') is processed one at a time. The solution involves efficiently tracking valid Morse code sequences and their counts after each modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each English letter corresponds to a unique Morse code string of length 1 to 4, excluding four invalid strings. The problem requires counting all possible sequences (words) formed by concatenating these valid Morse code strings, where the entire concatenated string appears as a contiguous substring in S.\n\n2. **Insight**: For each prefix of S, we can check if it forms a valid Morse code string (either as a single letter or part of a longer word). We use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid words ending at each position in S. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Dynamic Programming Array (dp)**: `dp[i]` represents the number of valid words ending at position `i` in S.\n   - **Valid Word Check**: For each position `i`, we check substrings ending at `i` of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid (not in the excluded list), we update `dp[i]` by adding the counts from previous positions.\n   - **Modulo Operation**: Since results can be large, all counts are maintained modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in S once, and for each character, checks up to 4 previous positions. Thus, the time complexity is O(m * 4) = O(m), which is efficient for the given constraints (m ≤ 3000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    total_chars = ''.join(s_list)\n    n = len(total_chars)\n    dp = [0] * n\n    excluded = {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}\n    ans = []\n    total_count = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        char = total_chars[i]\n        current = 0\n        j = i\n        while j >= max(0, i-3) and j >= 0:\n            candidate = total_chars[j:i+1]\n            if len(candidate) <= 4 and candidate not in excluded:\n                prev_index = j-1 if j-1 >= 0 else None\n                if prev_index is None:\n                    current += 1\n                else:\n                    current = (current + dp[j-1]) % MOD\n            j -= 1\n        dp[i] = current\n        total_count = (total_count + current) % MOD\n        ans.append(total_count)\n    \n    for a in ans:\n        print(a)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `m` followed by `m` lines of '0' or '1'. These characters are combined into a single string `total_chars`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of valid words ending at each position in `total_chars`. The `excluded` set contains the four invalid Morse code strings.\n\n3. **Processing Each Character**: For each character in `total_chars`, the algorithm checks all possible substrings ending at the current position (up to length 4). If a substring is valid, it updates the `dp` value for the current position by adding the counts from valid substrings of shorter lengths ending before the current position.\n\n4. **Tracking Total Valid Words**: After processing each character, the total number of valid words encountered so far is updated and stored in `ans`.\n\n5. **Output**: The results for each modification are printed sequentially, showing the cumulative count of valid words modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and substring validation, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.",
