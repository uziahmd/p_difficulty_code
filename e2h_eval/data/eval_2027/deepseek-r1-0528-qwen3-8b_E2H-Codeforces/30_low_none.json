Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We need to assign each digit in the original number (from left to right) to either Homer (H) or Marge (M) for exactly n moves each.\n\n The catch: the total prize is the sum of two numbers S1 and S2 (each built by taking the leftmost available digit and appending it to their own number).\n\n However, note that the game proceeds by removing the leftmost digit each time. The players choose who goes first? Actually, the problem states: \"Before each turn players determine who will make the next move.\" and each must make exactly n moves.\n\n But note: the example input ['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911'] and output ['HHMM', 'HMHM'].\n\n How does the total prize work?\n   - In the end, S1 is a number of n digits (possibly with leading zeros) and similarly for S2.\n   - The total prize is the sum of the two numbers (S1 + S2) but wait, no: the problem says \"the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars\", so the total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n However, note: the example outputs are strings of length 2n, containing H and M.\n\n Alternate interpretation: the problem is asking for the sequence of moves (i.e., which player takes which digit) such that the total money they get (S1 + S2) is maximized.\n\n But note: the assignment of digits to H and M matters because:\n   - The digits are taken from the left of A one by one, and the order in which they are assigned to S1 and S2 matters (because the value of S1 and S2 is determined by the order of digits: the first digit assigned to a player becomes the most significant digit of their number).\n\n However, the problem does not specify that the players can see the entire number A at the time of move? Actually, they know A beforehand, so they plan the entire sequence.\n\n The key: we have to assign the 2n digits to two players, each getting n digits. The assignment must be such that the digits are taken in order (from left to right). So we are partitioning the digits into two subsequences (each of length n) in the order they appear.\n\n Then, S1 is the number formed by the digits assigned to H (in the order they were taken) and S2 by the digits assigned to M.\n\n The goal: maximize the sum (S1 + S2).\n\n But note: the entire sequence of moves is fixed by the assignment. Since the digits are removed from left to right, the assignment is just choosing for each position (from 0 to 2n-1) whether it goes to H or M, with exactly n of each.\n\n However, the value of S1 and S2 depend on the order of assignment. Specifically, the first digit assigned to a player becomes the most significant.\n\n How to think about it?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the entire sequence of digits be D[0], D[1], ..., D[2n-1].\n\n We are to assign each digit to either H or M, with |H| = n and |M| = n.\n\n Then, the value of S1 is the number formed by the digits assigned to H, in the order of increasing index (since we take from left to right).\n Similarly, S2 is the number formed by the digits assigned to M, in the order of increasing index.\n\n Therefore, the total prize is: \n   S1 + S2 = (sum over all digits assigned to H, multiplied by appropriate power of 10) + (same for M)\n\n But note: the position in the number for a digit depends on when it was assigned.\n\n Example: n=2, A=\"1234\"\n\n Option 1: HHMM -> \n   H takes the first two: so S1 = 1*10 + 2 = 12, and S2 = 3*10 + 4 = 34, total = 12+34 = 46.\n\n Option 2: HMHM ->\n   H: first digit (1) and third digit (3) -> 13, M: second (2) and fourth (4) -> 24, total = 13+24 = 37.\n\n But wait, the example output for A='9911' is 'HMHM'. Let me check:\n\n Input: n=2, A='9911'\n   Option 1: HHMM -> S1=99, S2=11 -> total 110.\n   Option 2: HMHM -> S1=91, S2=91 -> total 182.\n\n Why is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns selecting digits from a given number A. The players each make exactly n moves, and the goal is to assign the digits to them in such a way that the sum of the numbers formed by their respective digits is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning the 2n-digit number A into two subsequences of length n each. Each subsequence forms a number where the order of digits is preserved as they appear in A. The total prize is the sum of these two numbers. The challenge is to find the optimal assignment of digits to the two players (Homer or Marge) such that this sum is maximized.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal strategy involves prioritizing higher digits for the most significant positions. Specifically, the first player (Homer) should aim to get the highest possible digits in the most significant places of his number, while the second player (Marge) should similarly prioritize high digits for her number. However, since both players are competing, we need a balanced approach where neither player gets a digit that would unnecessarily reduce the total sum.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a dynamic programming approach combined with backtracking to explore all possible ways to assign digits to the players. The solution involves:\n   - **Backtracking**: To try all possible assignments of digits to the two players, ensuring each makes exactly n moves.\n   - **Memoization**: To store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations, optimizing the backtracking process.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The problem has a state space of O((2n choose n)), which is manageable for n up to 18 (as 18 choose 9 is around 48,620). The backtracking with memoization efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging stored states.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_length = 2 * n\n    \n    memo = {}\n    \n    def dp(pos, taken1, taken2):\n        if pos == total_length:\n            return 0, 0\n        \n        key = (pos, taken1, taken2)\n        if key in memo:\n            return memo[key]\n            \n        res1 = None\n        res2 = None\n        \n        # Option 1: assign current digit to H\n        if taken1 < n:\n            s1, s2 = dp(pos + 1, taken1 + 1, taken2)\n            num_val = int(A[pos]) * (10 ** (total_length - pos - 1)) if taken1 == 0 else (s1 // (10 ** (total_length - pos - 1 + taken1 % (total_length - pos)))) * 10 + int(A[pos])\n            new_s1 = s1 + int(A[pos]) * (10 ** (total_length - pos - 1)) if taken1 > 0 else int(A[pos]) * (10 ** (total_length - pos - 1))\n            s1_val = new_s1\n            s2_val = s2\n            candidate = s1_val + s2_val\n            if res1 is None or candidate > res1:\n                res1 = candidate\n                res2 = s2_val\n        # Option 2: assign current digit to M\n        if taken2 < n:\n            s1, s2 = dp(pos + 1, taken1, taken2 + 1)\n            new_s2 = s2 + int(A[pos]) * (10 ** (total_length - pos - 1)) if taken2 > 0 else int(A[pos]) * (10 ** (total_length - pos - 1))\n            s2_val = new_s2\n            s1_val = s1\n            candidate = s1_val + s2_val\n            if res2 is None or candidate > res2:\n                res2 = candidate\n                res1 = s1_val\n                \n        best_val = max(res1, res2) if res1 is not None and res2 is not None else res1 if res1 is not None else res2\n        \n        memo[key] = (best_val, res1, res2)\n        return best_val, res1, res2\n\n    _, _, _ = dp(0, 0, 0)\n    del memo[(0, 0, 0)]\n    \n    result_string = []\n    \n    def backtrack(pos, taken1, taken2):\n        if pos == total_length:\n            return True\n            \n        key = (pos, taken1, taken2)\n        val, res1, res2 = memo[key]\n        \n        if taken1 < n and res1 is not None:\n            prev_val, _, _ = memo.get((pos-1, taken1+1, taken2), (None, None, None))\n            if prev_val is not None:\n                result_string.append('H')\n                return backtrack(pos+1, taken1+1, taken2)\n                \n        if taken2 < n and res2 is not None:\n            prev_val, _, _ = memo.get((pos-1, taken1, taken2+1), (None, None, None))\n            if prev_val is not None:\n                result_string.append('M')\n                return backtrack(pos+1, taken1, taken2+1)\n                \n        return True\n\n    backtrack(0, 0, 0)\n    print(''.join(result_string))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store the best possible sum of numbers formed by both players at each position in the string, along with the counts of digits assigned to each player.\n3. **Backtracking**: After computing the optimal sum, the `backtrack` function reconstructs the sequence of moves (H for Homer and M for Marge) that achieves this sum by checking which assignments led to the optimal solution.\n4. **Output**: The reconstructed sequence of moves is printed, ensuring the total prize is maximized.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible digit assignments using dynamic programming and backtracking, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of n=18.",
