In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'. But note: the input is given as three separate strings in one line? Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", but looking at the example input:\n\n Input: \n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n However, the problem actually says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning one line with three space-separated strings? Or one string containing three tiles? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n But note: the example input is given as three examples, each being a string of three tiles? Actually, the example input format is ambiguous. The example shows three test cases, each on a separate line.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The only line\" (meaning one test case per run) and the input is three strings. Actually, wait: the input has three tiles? Or three strings (each string being a tile)? \n\n The problem says: \"the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand\" — which are three tiles. So the input is three tiles, but represented as three strings? Or as one string with three tokens?\n\n Looking at the example: \n   Input: \"['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\"\n\n This seems to be three test cases. But the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input format is: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n Clarification: Actually, the example output is given as ['0','0','1'] for the three inputs. Therefore, we have one test case per run? Or multiple? The problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n Let's re-read: \"The only line\" — meaning that the entire input is one line. But what is in that line? It says \"three strings\", so we can split the line by spaces? Or maybe the three tiles are separated by spaces?\n\n Example input format: \n   \"1s 2s 3s\"\n   \"9m 9m 9m\"\n   \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But wait, the example input is shown as three separate lines. However, the problem says: \"The only line\". \n\n Actually, the problem statement says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n This could mean that there is one line and in that line there are three strings (tiles). But note: each tile is two characters. So if we have three tiles, then the line would look like \"1s1s1s\" or \"1s 2s 3s\"?\n\n The example input is given as three separate examples, but the problem says \"the only line\", so we assume one test case per run.\n\n However, the example output has three numbers. So perhaps the problem expects multiple test cases? Or maybe the example input was provided in a different way.\n\n Let's check the note: \"In the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu. In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu. In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile\"\n\n So the input has three test cases? But the problem says \"The only line\", meaning one test case per program run.\n\n But wait, the example input is written as:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is actually an array of three strings, each string representing one of the test cases? \n\n Clarification from the problem: The input format is exactly as described. So we must read one line, which contains three strings (each string being a tile representation). \n\n However, wait: the problem says \"three strings\", but each tile is two characters. So how do we represent three tiles as three strings? Each tile is two characters, so three tiles would be six characters without spaces. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that there are three tiles, and they are separated by spaces. Then the input line would be: \"1s 2s 3s\", meaning three tokens.\n\n But the problem says: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n So each tile is represented by a two-character string. Then we have three such strings in the line. How are they separated? The problem does not specify. \n\n However, looking at the example: \n   Example 1: ['1s 2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking if the given three tiles can form a mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) with the help of drawing additional tiles. The solution involves evaluating all possible ways to form a mentsu by considering the existing tiles and potential draws.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Triplet (Koutsu)**: Three identical tiles. If any tile appears three times, a triplet is already present.\n   - **Sequence (Shuntsu)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, [1m, 2m, 3m] forms a sequence.\n   - **Drawing Tiles**: We consider drawing up to two additional tiles (since the maximum needed is two to complete a sequence or triplet).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the hand already contains a triplet or a sequence.\n   - **Check for One-Draw Mentsu**: Determine if drawing one tile can form a triplet or sequence.\n   - **Check for Two-Draw Mentsu**: If no mentsu can be formed with zero or one draw, check if two draws can form a mentsu.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution efficiently checks all possible combinations by leveraging frequency counts and sequence checks, ensuring optimal performance with constant time operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for triplet\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        freq[tile] += 1\n        \n    if any(count >= 3 for count in freq.values()):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for sequence\n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    for suit in suits:\n        for num in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [str(num) + suit, str(num+1) + suit, str(num+2) + suit]\n            if set(seq).issubset(set(tiles)):\n                print(0)\n                return\n                \n    # Check for one draw\n    for suit in suits:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            new_tile = str(num) + suit\n            drawn = 1\n            temp_freq = freq.copy()\n            temp_freq[new_tile] = temp_freq.get(new_tile, 0) + 1\n            if any(count == 3 for count in temp_freq.values()):\n                print(drawn)\n                return\n                \n            for start in range(1, 8):\n                seq = [str(start) + suit, str(start+1) + suit, str(start+2) + suit]\n                s = set(seq)\n                if s.issubset(set(tiles) | {new_tile}):\n                    print(drawn)\n                    return\n                    \n    # Check for two draws\n    for suit1 in suits:\n        for num1 in range(1, 10):\n            new_tile1 = str(num1) + suit1\n            for suit2 in suits:\n                for num2 in range(1, 10):\n                    new_tile2 = str(num2) + suit2\n                    drawn = 2\n                    temp_set = set(tiles) | {new_tile1, new_tile2}\n                    temp_freq = defaultdict(int)\n                    for t in temp_set:\n                        temp_freq[t] += 1\n                    if any(count == 3 for count in temp_freq.values()):\n                        print(drawn)\n                        return\n                    for suit_temp in suits:\n                        for start_temp in range(1, 8):\n                            seq_temp = [str(start_temp) + suit_temp, \n                                        str(start_temp+1) + suit_temp, \n                                        str(start_temp+2) + suit_temp]\n                            if set(seq_temp).issubset(temp_set):\n                                print(drawn)\n                                return\n                                \n    print(3)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check for Triplet**: The code first checks if any tile appears three times, indicating a triplet mentsu is already present.\n2. **Initial Check for Sequence**: It then checks if any three consecutive numbered tiles in the same suit form a sequence.\n3. **One-Draw Check**: The code checks if adding one tile can complete a triplet or sequence. This involves iterating over all possible tiles and checking if the resulting set forms a mentsu.\n4. **Two-Draw Check**: If no mentsu can be formed with one draw, the code checks all combinations of two draws to see if they can form a mentsu.\n5. **Default Case**: If no mentsu can be formed even with two draws, the answer is 3, though theoretically, forming a mentsu with three draws is unnecessary as four tiles can always form a mentsu (though not required here).\n\nThis approach efficiently covers all possible scenarios to determine the minimum number of draws needed, leveraging combinatorial checks and set operations for clarity and correctness.",
