The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers.\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) and we start at house 1, we can move only clockwise.\n\n Observation:\n The tasks must be done in the order given. But note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" before task i, but that is just to say that the tasks are sequential.\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" leads to output 6.\n\n Steps:\n Let's denote the current position as `cur`. Initially, cur = 1.\n\n For each task location `a_i`:\n   If `a_i` is >= cur, then we can move from cur to a_i by going clockwise without wrapping around the entire circle? Actually, because it's a ring, we have two ways? But note: the movement is only clockwise. So we can only go from a lower number to a higher one until we wrap from n to 1.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 4 3\n           3 2 3\n\n   Steps: \n     Start at 1.\n     First task at 3: \n        We can go 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n     Then from 3 to 2: \n        Since 2 is behind 3 in the clockwise direction (from 3 we can only go to 4, then 1, then 2) but wait, the ringroad is one way and clockwise. So from 3, moving clockwise: \n          3 -> 4 (step 1), then 4->1 (step 2), then 1->2 (step 3). But that would be 3 steps. Alternatively, note the example says the optimal sequence is 1->2->3->4->1->2->3, which is 6 steps.\n\n However, note: the example output is 6, so the total time is the sum of the steps for each segment.\n\n But wait, the example says: \n   1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3.\n\n This is 6 moves (each arrow is one unit). But note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one takes one unit\". So each arrow is one unit.\n\n However, we don't need to go all the way from 3 to 2 by going through 4,1. Actually, the ring is circular and we can also consider the direct distance in the circular manner.\n\n Actually, because the ringroad is one-way and clockwise, we cannot move counterclockwise. Therefore, from a house x to a house y, the clockwise distance is:\n   If y >= x: then distance = y - x.\n   If y < x: then we have to go from x to n, then from n to 1, and then from 1 to y. But note: from x to y when y < x, we can break the journey as:\n        from x to n: (n - x) steps\n        then from n to 1: actually, the ring goes from n to 1? But wait, the houses are numbered 1 to n in clockwise. After n comes 1? Yes.\n\n        So the entire circle is n houses. The total steps from x to y (with y < x) is (n - x + y) because:\n            x -> (x+1) ... n (that's n-x steps) and then n->1 (which is 1 step? but wait, from n to 1 is 1 step? Actually, no: from n to 1 is 1 step (neighboring). Then from 1 to y: (y-1) steps? But wait, if we break down:\n\n        Alternatively, think of the circle as having total length n. The clockwise distance from x to y is:\n            d = (y - x) mod n, but if y < x then (y - x) mod n = n - (x-y) = n + y - x.\n\n        However, let me verify: \n            From 3 to 2 in a ring of 4: \n                We can do: 3->4->1->2. That's 3 steps.\n                Alternatively, the formula: n + y - x = 4 + 2 - 3 = 3. Correct.\n\n        Also, if y>=x, then distance = y-x. For example, from 1 to 3: 3-1=2.\n\n Therefore, the distance from x to y is:\n        if y >= x: y - x\n        else: n - (x - y) = n - x + y\n\n But note: we can write this as: (y - x) % n, but wait: \n        (3-2)%4 = 1, which is not 3. So that doesn't work.\n\n Actually, we can define:\n        distance(x, y) = (y - x) % n   [but modulo n might give negative?]\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n        distance = (y - x) if y >= x else (n - x + y)\n\n But note: we are only allowed to move clockwise, so we can't take a shorter path by going backwards.\n\n Now, the problem is: we start at 1 and we have a sequence of task locations. We must complete the tasks in the given order.\n\n We can simulate:\n   current = 1\n   total_time = 0\n   for each task_location in tasks:\n        if task_location >= current:\n            steps = task_location - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + task_location   # because from current to n, then from n to 1, then from 1 to task_location? Actually, wait: from current to task_location when task_location < current: \n            # But note: from current, we move clockwise: we pass current+1, current+2, ... until n, then 1, then 2, ... until task_location.\n            # How many steps?\n            # From current to n: n - current\n            # Then from n to 1 is 1 step? Actually, no: from n to 1 is one step? But wait, the next house after n is 1. So the entire segment from current to task_location is (n - current) + (task_location) because from current to n is (n - current) steps, then from n to 1 is 1 step? Actually, no: we don't need to break the circle at 1. The next step from n is 1, so the next step from current to the next house is increasing until n, then wraps.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can think of the entire circle as a linear array of n houses, and the positions are 1-indexed. The distance from current to task_location in a circle of n houses (clockwise) is:\n            #   steps = (task_location - current) % n   -> but that gives negative if task_location < current, so we adjust.\n\n            # Actually, we can compute as: \n            #   steps = (task_location - current + n) % n\n            # But wait, if task_location < current, then (task_location - current + n) is positive and less than n? \n            #   Example: current=3, task_location=2, n=4: (2-3+4)=3, which is correct.\n            #   Example: current=1, task_location=3: (3-1+4)%4 = 6%4=2 -> but 2 is correct? Actually, 3-1=2, so (3-1+4)%4=2 is correct, but we don't need modulo if we know the condition.\n\n        Then update current = task_location.\n\n However, note: the above formula for the distance when task_location < current is n - (current - task_location) = n - current + task_location, which is the same as (task_location - current + n) but without modulo.\n\n But wait, the modulo formula: (task_location - current + n) % n is not the same as n - current + task_location because:\n        (task_location - current + n) % n = (n + task_location - current) % n\n        and since n + task_location - current is between 0 and 2n (because task_location and current are between 1 and n) and if task_location < current then n + task_location - current is between 1 and n-1 (so modulo n is the same) and if task_location>=current then it is between 0 and n-1, but wait: if task_location==current, then (current - current + n) % n = n%n=0, which is correct (0 steps). But if task_location>current, then (task_location-current+n)%n = (task_location-current) % n, but task_location-current is positive and less than n (if task_location <= n and current>=1, then task_location-current <= n-1) so modulo n is the same.\n\n However, we can avoid modulo by using the conditional. But note: we are doing 10^5 tasks, so performance is not an issue with conditionals.\n\n But wait: what if we do:\n\n        steps = (task_location - current) if task_location >= current else (task_location - current + n)\n\n Then update current = task_location and add steps to total_time.\n\n However, let's test with the example: \n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        Task1: 3\n            3>=1 -> steps = 3-1 = 2. total_time=2, current=3.\n\n        Task2: 2\n            2<3 -> steps = 2-3+4 = 3. total_time=5, current=2.\n\n        Task3: 3\n            3>=2 -> steps=3-2=1. total_time=6.\n\n        This matches the example.\n\n        Another example: \n            Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n            Expected Output: 2\n\n            Steps: \n                Start at 1.\n                Task1: 2 -> steps=2-1=1, current=2, total_time=1.\n                Task2: 3 -> steps=3-2=1, current=3, total_time=2.\n                Task3: 3 -> steps=0, total_time=2.\n\n            So output 2.\n\n        However, wait: the example input was provided as two examples: \n            Example1: ['4 3\\n3 2 3'] -> 6\n            Example2: ['4 3\\n2 3 3'] -> 2\n\n        But the second example input in the problem statement is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\", and the expected output is 2.\n\n        So our simulation works for these examples.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning that the tasks are given in order, and we must do them in the given order. Our simulation does exactly that.\n\n        But wait: what if the tasks are not in increasing or decreasing order? \n\n        Example: n=5, tasks=[1,5,2,4,3]\n\n        Step1: 1->1: 0 steps.\n        Step2: from 1 to 5: 5>=1 -> 5-1=4 steps.\n        Step3: from 5 to 2: 2<5 -> steps=2-5+5=2 steps? \n            Actually: 5->1 (1 step), then 1->2 (1 step) -> total 2 steps. Correct.\n\n        Step4: from 2 to 4: 4>=2 -> 4-2=2 steps.\n        Step5: from 4 to 3: 3<4 -> steps=3-4+5=4 steps.\n\n        Total: 0+4+2+2+4 = 12.\n\n        Let me check manually: \n            Start at 1.\n            Stay at 1 (0).\n            Move from 1 to 5: 1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps). Now at 5.\n            Then from 5 to 2: 5->1->2 (2 steps). Now at 2.\n            Then from 2 to 4: 2->3->4 (2 steps). Now at 4.\n            Then from 4 to 3: 4->5->1->2->3 (4 steps).\n\n            Total: 0+4+2+2+4 = 12.\n\n        So the code should be:\n\n        Read n and m.\n        Read the list of m integers.\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for each task in the list:\n            if task >= current:\n                steps = task - current\n            else:\n                steps = task - current + n   # because we are adding n to make it positive\n\n            total_time += steps\n            current = task\n\n        Print(total_time)\n\n        However, note: the above formula for the else part: \n            steps = task - current + n\n\n        But wait, in the example from 5 to 2: \n            task=2, current=5, so steps=2-5+5=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait, why is that? \n            When task < current, the clockwise distance is (n - current + task) because:\n                We move from current to the end (n) and then from 1 to task. The number of steps from current to n is (n - current), and then from 1 to task is (task - 1) but wait, that would be (n - current) + (task - 1) + 1? Because from n to 1 is one step, and then from 1 to task is (task-1) steps. So total: (n - current) + 1 + (task-1) = n - current + task.\n\n        So the formula is consistent.\n\n        However, note: the modulo formula is (task - current + n) % n, but we don't need the modulo because we know the distance is positive and we are using the condition to choose the formula. But the above formula does not require modulo.\n\n        But wait: what if we use the modulo formula without condition? \n            steps = (task - current + n) % n\n            However, if task>=current, then (task - current + n) % n = (task - current) % n, but task-current is between 0 and n-1 (since task<=n and current>=1, and task>=current, so task-current is at most n-1) so modulo n is the same.\n\n            But if task<current, then (task - current + n) % n = (n + task - current) % n, and n+task-current is between 1 and n-1 (because task-current is negative, and adding n makes it positive and less than n because task-current is at least -(n-1) so n+task-current is at most n + (n-1) - 1 = 2n-2, but wait: task>=1, current<=n, so worst case: task=1, current=n -> n+1-n = 1, which is correct. And the maximum value when task<current: task=1, current=2 -> n+1-2 = n-1, which is < n, so modulo n is the same as the value.\n\n        However, the modulo operation is more expensive than a conditional? But for 10^5 operations, it's negligible. But the problem says n and m up to 10^5, so we can use either.\n\n        But note: the problem requires 64-bit integers, but in Python integers are arbitrary precision and the modulo operation for two numbers up to 10^5 is cheap.\n\n        However, the conditional is straightforward.\n\n        I'll stick with the conditional.\n\n        But wait, there is a catch: the problem says the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 to n. So the distance from house n to house 1 is 1, and from house 1 to house n is n-1? Actually, no: from house 1 to house n: \n            If we are at 1 and want to go to n: \n                In a clockwise ring: 1->2->...->n: that's n-1 steps.\n\n            But according to our formula: \n                If n>=1, then n>=1 -> steps = n-1.\n\n            Similarly, from house n to house 1: \n                Condition: 1<n, so steps = 1-n+n = 1 step.\n\n            That matches.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                total_time += t - current\n            else:\n                total_time += t - current + n\n            current = t\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3]\n            t=3: 3>=1 -> add 2, current=3, total=2.\n            t=2: 2<3 -> add 2-3+4=3, total=5, current=2.\n            t=3: 3>=2 -> add 1, total=6.\n\n        Example2: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3]\n            t=2: 2>=1 -> add 1, total=1, current=2.\n            t=3: 3>=2 -> add 1, total=2, current=3.\n            t=3: 3>=3 -> add 0, total=2.\n\n        Example3: n=5, tasks=[1,5,2,4,3] -> 12, as above.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\", so initially she is at 1.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", but the tasks are given in order. Our simulation uses the given order and updates the current position to the last task's house.\n\n        This should be correct.\n\n        However, wait: the problem states that the ringroad is circular and one-way. Our calculation of the clockwise distance is correct.\n\n        One more edge: when n=2, m=1, task=[2]\n            Steps: 2>=1 -> 1 step. total_time=1.\n\n        n=2, m=1, task=[1]: 0 steps.\n\n        n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]:\n            Start at 1.\n            t=2: 2>=1 -> 1 step, total=1, current=2.\n            t=1: 1<2 -> steps=1-2+2=1, total=2.\n\n        Manually: \n            From 1 to 2: 1 step.\n            From 2 to 1: 1 step (clockwise: 2->1). So total 2.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one\" takes one unit. So yes, from 2 to 1 is one step.\n\n        Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n        But wait: the example input format: \n            Input: \n                4 3\n                3 2 3\n\n            We read the first line as n=4, m=3, then the second line as [3,2,3].\n\n        We assume the input is given as described.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say that m can be up to 10^5, and n up to 10^5, so we are doing a simple loop of 10^5 iterations, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Note: We must use sys.stdin if we want to be faster? But 10^5 integers is acceptable even with input().\n\n        But let me use sys.stdin to be safe for large inputs.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        n = int(data[0]); m = int(data[1])\n        tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n        But the problem says the second line contains m integers.\n\n        However, the input format is two lines. We can do:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n        n = int(data[0])\n        m = int(data[1])\n        tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n        But the problem says the first line has two integers, the second line has m integers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split())   # but input() reads the next line.\n\n        However, the problem says the second line is the list of m integers.\n\n        But what if the input is provided via standard input and we are reading from a file? It doesn't matter.\n\n        Since the problem says \"The second line contains m integers\", we can read the second line.\n\n        But wait: the sample input is given as a string in the example, but we are to read from stdin.\n\n        Let me use:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        if len(data) < 2:\n            # but the problem says there are two integers in the first line, so we assume there are at least two\n            print(0)\n            sys.exit(0)\n\n        n = int(data[0])\n        m = int(data[1])\n        # The next m integers are from index 2 to 2+m-1\n        tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split())) if m > 0 else []\n\n        But the problem says m>=1, so we can rely on there being a second line.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"The second line contains m integers\", so we can read the second line.\n\n        Since the problem constraints are high, but the input is two lines, we can read the two lines.\n\n        I'll choose the two-line approach.\n\n        But note: the problem says that the first line has two integers, the second line has m integers.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        Then the rest.\n\n        However, if m is 0, then the second line is empty? But the problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n        for t in tasks:\n            if t >= current:\n                total_time += t - current\n            else:\n                total_time += t - current + n\n            current = t\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n        This should be the solution.\n\n        However, wait: there is an alternative way to compute the distance without condition?\n\n        We can use: \n            steps = (t - current) % n   but if t>=current then (t-current) % n is t-current (if t-current < n) and if t<current then (t-current+n) % n = t-current+n (because t-current+n is positive and less than n? Actually, no: if t<current, then t-current+n is between 1 and n-1 (as shown above) so modulo n is the same.\n\n        But wait: if t=current, then (t-current) % n = 0, which is correct.\n\n        However, modulo operation for negative numbers in Python: \n            (t - current) might be negative, so we do (t - current) % n, but note: \n            In Python, negative modulo is handled by adding multiples of n until positive.\n\n            Example: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3, which is the same as our else branch.\n\n            So we can also write:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n   # but wait, if t>=current, then (t-current) is nonnegative and less than n? \n            Actually, t>=current and t<=n, current>=1, so t-current <= n-1, so modulo n is the same as the value.\n\n            But if t<current, then (t-current) % n is the same as (t - current + n) % n, but note: the modulo operation for negative adds n until the result is in [0, n-1]. So:\n\n            steps = (t - current) % n   won't work because if t>=current, then (t-current) is positive and less than n, so modulo n is the same. But if t<current, then (t-current) is negative, and (t-current) % n = (t-current + k*n) such that the result is in [0, n-1]. But note: the distance we want is the clockwise distance, which is (n - (current-t)) if t<current? Actually, no: we want the clockwise distance from current to t, which is (t - current + n) if t<current, and that is exactly (t - current) % n? \n\n            Let me test: \n                current=3, t=2, n=4: (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3. Correct.\n                current=1, t=3, n=4: (3-1)%4=2. Correct.\n\n            But wait: the modulo operation gives the smallest non-negative residue. However, the clockwise distance in a circle of n is defined as the minimal positive steps? But note: the problem does not allow going the other way. And the clockwise distance from a to b is defined as the number of steps going clockwise from a to b. \n\n            However, note: the modulo operation gives the same result as our if-else condition.\n\n            But wait, what if we have a circle of n=10, current=5, t=5: (5-5)%10=0 -> correct.\n            n=10, current=5, t=15? but t must be between 1 and n, so t=15 is invalid.\n\n            Since the input ensures 1<=ai<=n, we are safe.\n\n            However, note: the modulo operation does not account for the fact that the distance from current to t might be the entire circle? Actually, no: the clockwise distance from current to t is always between 0 and n-1, and (t - current) % n gives a value in [0, n-1]. But wait: \n\n            The clockwise distance from current to t is defined as:\n                if t>=current: t-current (which is in [0, n-1])\n                if t<current: t - current + n (which is in [1, n-1])? Actually, the minimum steps to go from current to t is the minimal positive steps. But note, we are forced to go clockwise, and the circle is of n houses, so the distance is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (current + d) % n == t % n, but we are working in 1-indexed.\n\n            However, note: the houses are 1-indexed. The modulo arithmetic here is a bit tricky because the houses are 1..n, not 0..n-1.\n\n            Let me reframe: \n                We can map the houses to 0-indexed: subtract 1. Then the houses become 0 to n-1.\n\n                Then the clockwise distance from a to b (in 0-indexed) is (b - a) % n, but again, if b<a then (b-a+n)%n.\n\n            But wait, in 0-indexed, from a to b: \n                if b>=a: b-a\n                else: b - a + n\n\n            And in 0-indexed, (b - a) % n doesn't work the same because we are mapping 1->0, 2->1, ..., n->n-1.\n\n            Actually, if we map:\n                current0 = current - 1\n                t0 = t - 1\n\n            Then the distance from current0 to t0 in a circle of n nodes (0-indexed) is (t0 - current0) % n, but wait, no: the circle is of n nodes, and the distance from a to b in a circle of n nodes (0-indexed) is (b - a + n) % n.\n\n            However, note: in 0-indexed, the clockwise distance from a to b is (b - a) if b>=a, else (b - a + n). And that is the same as (b - a + n) % n, because if b>=a then (b-a+n)%n = (b-a)%n = b-a (since b-a is in [0, n-1]), and if b<a then (b-a+n)%n = (b-a+n) which is in [0, n-1] and equals the distance.\n\n            So the 0-indexed version is the same.\n\n            But wait, in our 1-indexed code we did:\n\n                if t>=current: steps = t - current\n                else: steps = t - current + n\n\n            Which is the same as (t - current + n) % n? Not exactly, because if t>=current, then (t - current + n) % n = (t - current) % n, but since t-current is positive and less than n (because t<=n and current>=1, and t>=current, so t-current <= n-1) then modulo n is the same as t-current.\n\n            However, the modulo operation in the else branch gives the same value. But the if branch doesn't use modulo.\n\n            But wait, if we do:\n\n                steps = (t - current + n) % n\n\n            Then for the if branch, t>=current: (t - current + n) % n = (t - current) % n, and since t-current is in [0, n-1], then (t - current) % n = t - current.\n\n            For the else branch: (t - current + n) % n = (t - current + n) (because t-current+n is positive and less than n? Actually, t-current+n is in [n - (n-1) + 1?] Let me see: \n                t is from 1 to n, current from 1 to n, and t<current, so t-current is negative and between -(n-1) and -1. Then t-current+n is between 1 and n-1, which is less than n, so modulo n is the same.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                steps = (t - current + n) % n\n\n            But wait, what if t-current+n is greater than or equal to n? \n                t is at most n, current is at least 1, so t-current+n <= n - 1 + n = 2n-1, which is greater than n. But we are taking modulo n, so it will reduce.\n\n            However, note: in the else branch, t<current, so t-current+n is at most n-1 (if t=1, current=n: then 1-n+n = 1, which is <n) and at least 1 (if t=n-1, current=n: then (n-1)-n+n = n-1, which is <n). Actually, wait: the minimum value in else branch: \n                t=1, current=n: then 1-n+n = 1.\n                t=1, current=2: then 1-2+n = n-1.\n\n            But wait, we are only in the else branch when t<current, so the maximum t is current-1, then the expression t-current+n = (current-1)-current+n = n-1.\n\n            So in the else branch, the expression is in [1, n-1] (if n>=2) and in the if branch, [0, n-1]. \n\n            Then modulo n doesn't change the value because the result is in [0, n-1]. So we can do:\n\n                steps = (t - current + n) % n\n\n            But wait, if t==current, then (t - current + n) % n = n % n = 0, which is correct.\n\n            However, note: the modulo operation is more expensive than the if-else. But for 10^5 operations, it's negligible.\n\n            But the problem says we can use cin, cout in C++, but in Python, we can choose.\n\n            However, the problem does not specify which is faster, and the if-else is straightforward.\n\n        I'll keep the if-else for clarity and efficiency.\n\n        But wait, there is a possibility that the modulo version is simpler and avoids branching? \n\n        However, in Python, branching is generally fast.\n\n        Let me compare the two methods in terms of code simplicity: the if-else is clear, the modulo is one line.\n\n        But the problem is small enough (10^5) that either is acceptable.\n\n        However, I have already written the if-else version. Let me stick to that.\n\n        But wait, there is a known issue: the modulo method might be confusing because the distance is the clockwise distance, and the modulo operation gives the same result as the if-else.\n\n        I'll use the if-else.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        pos = 1\n        ans = 0\n        for a in tasks:\n            if a >= pos:\n                ans += a - pos\n            else:\n                ans += a - pos + n\n            pos = a\n\n        print(ans)\n\n        This is the final code.\n\n        Let me run the examples again.\n\n        Example1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3] -> 6\n        Example2: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3] -> 2\n\n        It passes.\n\n        Submit.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\", so we start at 1.\n\n        And the tasks are given in the order they must be done.\n\n        There's one more edge: what if the task list is empty? \n            m=0, then tasks=[] -> we do nothing, output 0.\n\n        But the problem says m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n        We are good.\n\n        However, the problem says m>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\" \n            Example: [1,1,1] -> \n                Start at 1.\n                First task: 1>=1 -> 0, current=1.\n                Second: 1>=1 -> 0, current=1.\n                Third: 1>=1 -> 0, current=1.\n                Total 0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Another example: [1,2,1] for n=2:\n            Start at 1.\n            First: 1>=1 -> 0, current=1.\n            Second: 2>=1 -> 1, current=2, total=1.\n            Third: 1<2 -> steps=1-2+2=1, total=2.\n\n        Manually: \n            Start at 1.\n            First task: 1 (stay)\n            Second task: 1->2 (1 step)\n            Third task: 2->1 (1 step) -> total 2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        We'll output the code as below.\n\n        IMPORTANT: The problem expects the answer as a single integer.\n\n        We are printing the integer.\n\n        Done.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 through n.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad with houses numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between neighboring houses takes one unit of time. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house number 1.\n2. **Iterate through tasks**: For each task location in the given sequence:\n   - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is simply the difference between the task location and the current position.\n   - If the task location is less than the current position, the distance is calculated by moving from the current position to the end of the ring (house n) and then from house 1 to the task location. This distance is computed as `(task_location - current_position + n)`.\n3. **Update current position**: After each task, update the current position to the task's location.\n4. **Sum the distances**: Accumulate the distances for all tasks to get the total time required.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal path by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and ensures optimal movement without backtracking.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    pos = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= pos:\n            total_time += a - pos\n        else:\n            total_time += a - pos + n\n        pos = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for the number of houses (n) and the number of tasks (m), followed by the list of task locations.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task location, it checks if the task is ahead or behind the current position in the clockwise direction. If the task is ahead, the distance is straightforward. If the task is behind, it calculates the distance by wrapping around the ring from the current position to the end and then to the task location.\n- **Output**: The accumulated total time, which is the sum of all individual task distances, is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular movement constraints and ensures the minimal time is computed by always moving in the allowed clockwise direction. The solution is optimal with a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks, as each task is processed in constant time.",
