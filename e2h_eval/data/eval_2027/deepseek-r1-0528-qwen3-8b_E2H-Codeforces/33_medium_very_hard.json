You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings: the first is the integer `a` (which can be up to 10^5 digits) and the second is the sequence of digits `s` (also up to 10^5 digits).\n\n We can replace at most one digit in `a` per element in `s`, and each element in `s` can be used at most once.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use not all elements. We want to maximize the number.\n\n Important: The operations can be performed arbitrarily (any order, any positions) but each replacement uses one digit from `s` and replaces one digit in `a`.\n\n Since we want the maximum value, we should consider:\n\n - The leftmost digit has the highest place value. So we should try to improve the leftmost digits first.\n\n But note: we have a multiset of digits (from `s`) and we can assign them to any positions. However, we cannot assign the same element of `s` twice.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Idea:\n 1. We are allowed to do at most m replacements, but we don't have to use all. We can choose which ones to use.\n\n 2. We want to maximize the number. This means that we should try to make the leftmost digits as large as possible.\n\n 3. However, sometimes we might have to leave a digit unchanged even if we have a larger digit available, because using that larger digit might not necessarily lead to the maximum number? Actually, no: because the leftmost digit is the most significant.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's break down:\n\n - We have an initial string `a` (without leading zeros, so the first character is not '0' unless the number is \"0\", but note: the problem says the given number doesn't contain leading zeros).\n\n - We have a string `s` (digits only) of length up to 10^5.\n\n We can think greedily:\n\n We want to assign the best available replacement digit to the leftmost position where we can get an improvement.\n\n But note: we can also skip some digits. Also, we have multiple replacements and we can assign one replacement per position (each position can be replaced at most once).\n\n However, the catch: we have a multiset of digits from `s`. We can sort `s` to get the best digits for replacement.\n\n But wait: we are not forced to use the largest digits first. For example, consider:\n\n   a = \"123\"\n   s = \"987654\"\n\n We can only replace one digit. Then we would replace the first digit with '9'. But what if we have two replacements? Then we can replace the first two digits.\n\n However, we must consider: we can assign the largest available digits to the most significant positions.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n 1. Sort the sequence `s` in descending order. But wait, we are allowed to use at most one per position, and we can use a digit only once.\n\n 2. We can consider: for each position from left to right, we want to know the best digit we can put there. However, we cannot change the same position twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Step 1: Precompute the frequency or sort the multiset of `s`.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use any subset of `s`. So we have a set of digits (with duplicates) and we can choose up to min(n, m) replacements.\n\n However, we are constrained by the fact that we can only replace each digit in `a` once.\n\n We can do:\n\n - We'll traverse the digits of `a` from left to right.\n - For each position, we want to consider: if we replace this digit with a digit from `s`, then we want the largest digit available that is greater than the current digit, because replacing with a larger digit will increase the number.\n\n But note: we might not want to use the very largest digit if it's needed for a more significant position? Actually, we are going from left to right, so we are handling the most significant first.\n\n However, we have a fixed multiset. We can use a greedy matching:\n\n Let's sort `s` in descending order (so the largest digits first). Then, we want to assign the largest digits we have to the leftmost positions.\n\n But here's the catch: we don't necessarily have to assign the largest digit to the first position. We have to assign a digit that is greater than the current one to get an improvement. And we want the maximum overall.\n\n However, we can consider: we are going to use some set of replacements. The goal is to maximize the entire number.\n\n Since the number is determined by the leftmost differing digit, we should focus on making the leftmost digit as large as possible, then the next, etc.\n\n But note: we can use the same digit from `s` only once, and we are limited by the total multiset.\n\n Alternate plan:\n\n 1. We are going to collect the digits from `s` and sort them in descending order.\n\n 2. We are going to consider: for each digit in `a` (from left to right), we can decide to replace it with one of the available digits from `s` that is greater than the current digit.\n\n 3. However, we want to reserve the largest digits for the leftmost positions. So we can do:\n\n    - Sort `s` in descending order.\n    - Then, for each position i (from 0 to n-1) in the original `a`, we check: if we have any digit in `s` (that we haven't used) that is greater than the current digit, then we use the smallest digit in `s` that is greater than the current digit? Why the smallest? Because we want to save the larger ones for the positions that we cannot improve by a small amount.\n\n But wait, let me clarify: \n\n Example: \n   a = \"123\"\n   s = \"9 8\"\n\n   We have two replacements. But we can only replace one digit because the number has 3 digits and we have two, so we can do two? Actually, we can do at most two, but we are allowed to do less.\n\n However, we want the maximum number. \n\n If we replace the first digit: \n   Option1: replace with '9' -> \"923\" (then we have one replacement left, but we can't use it because the rest are already maximum? Actually, we can use the remaining '8' on the next digit: \n        \"923\" -> if we replace the second digit with '8', we get \"983\", which is better than \"923\". \n   But wait: we are processing from left to right. We want to use the largest digits for the leftmost improvements.\n\n Actually, we should use the largest digits first for the leftmost positions. \n\n However, the catch: we are not forced to use a replacement if it doesn't improve the digit. \n\n Proposed algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Count frequency of digits in `s` (but since we have duplicates, we can use a multiset or just sort and then use two pointers).\n\n  Step 2: We are going to consider the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit, we want to see if we can replace it with a digit from `s` (that is greater than the current digit). But we want to use the smallest available digit from `s` that is greater than the current digit? \n\n  Why smallest? Because if we have two options: say current digit is '1' and we have '2' and '3' available, then using '2' now leaves '3' for a later position. But if we don't use '2' now, maybe we can get a bigger overall number? \n\n  Actually, we want to use the smallest digit that is greater than the current one because we want to save the larger digits for the positions that are less significant. \n\n  However, consider: \n\n      a = \"123\"\n      s = \"9 2\"\n\n      We have two digits in s: [9,2] (sorted descending: [9,2])\n\n      At the first digit: current digit is '1'. We can replace it with '9' or '2'. Using the smallest greater digit (which is '2') gives \"223\", and using the largest gives \"923\". Clearly, 923 is better.\n\n  So we don't want to use the smallest available digit that is greater, we want to use the largest? \n\n  But wait, we are trying to maximize the entire number. The first digit is the most significant. Therefore, we should use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one for the first digit.\n\n  Then, for the next digit, we use the next largest available digit that is greater than the current one.\n\n  However, what if we have:\n\n      a = \"123\"\n      s = \"9 8 7\"\n\n      We can replace the first digit with '9', then the second with '8', then the third with '7'. That gives \"987\", which is the maximum.\n\n  But what if:\n\n      a = \"123\"\n      s = \"9 1 2\"\n\n      We have: [9,1,2] (descending: [9,2,1])\n\n      First digit: we can replace with '9' -> becomes 9, then we have [2,1] for the remaining. Then second digit: we can replace '2' with '2' (no improvement) or with nothing? Actually, we can replace with 2 but that doesn't change. But wait, we can also consider: we have a '2' and the current digit is '2' so no improvement. Then third digit: we have '1', which is less than '3', so we don't want to use it.\n\n      Alternatively, if we use the '9' for the first digit, then the second and third remain. But what if we use the '2' for the second digit? Then the second digit becomes 2 (same) and then we have '9' and '1' left for the third? Then the third digit becomes 1 (worse). So that's worse.\n\n      But wait, we have two possibilities for the first digit: we can use '9' or not. If we don't use '9' for the first digit, then we can use the other digits for the subsequent digits. \n\n      Actually, we are allowed to choose any subset. So we don't have to use all.\n\n      However, we want the maximum number. \n\n      Option 1: use '9' for the first digit: then we have two replacements left. Then for the second digit: we have [2,1]. We can use '2' for the second digit? Then the second digit becomes 2 (same) and then third digit: we have [1] which is less than 3, so we don't use. Then we get \"923\".\n\n      Option 2: use '2' for the second digit? Then the second digit becomes 2 (same) and then we have [9,1] for the first and third. Then we can use '9' for the first digit: then we get \"923\" (same). Or we use '9' for the first digit and then '1' for the third: then we get \"921\", which is less than \"923\".\n\n      Option 3: use '9' for the first digit and then '1' for the third? Then we get \"921\", which is worse than \"923\".\n\n      So the best is \"923\".\n\n  How do we decide for the first digit? We use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one. Then for the second digit, we use the next largest available digit that is greater than the current one. \n\n  But note: we are allowed to skip a replacement if we don't want to use a digit. So we should only use a digit if it improves the current digit.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n    Step 1: Sort `s` in descending order and remove duplicates? Actually, we need to keep duplicates because we have multiple same digits.\n\n    Step 2: We are going to use a pointer (or a multiset) for the available digits.\n\n    We can use a two-pointer or a heap? But note, we are processing from left to right and we want to assign the best digit we have for the current position.\n\n    Alternatively, we can pre-sort `s` and then for each digit in `a` (from left to right) we look for the smallest digit in `s` that is greater than the current digit (if we want to save the big ones for later) OR the largest? \n\n    Actually, we want to maximize the entire number. We have a fixed multiset of `s`. We can use the following:\n\n    We'll traverse the digits of `a` from left to right. We'll maintain a sorted list (or a multiset) of the available digits.\n\n    For each digit d in `a`:\n        Let current_digit = d\n        We want to find the smallest digit in the available multiset that is greater than d. Why smallest? Because we want to save the larger ones for the next positions (which are less significant). However, we are at a very significant position. \n\n    But wait: we are going from left to right, so the current digit is the most significant we haven't processed. We want to use the smallest digit that is greater than d to minimize the waste of large digits. \n\n    However, consider: if we use a small digit to replace a digit, then we save the larger digits for the next positions. But the next positions are less significant, so it's okay to use a small digit now if we can only use a large digit for a later position if we need it? \n\n    Actually, we are free to assign any digit from `s` to any position. The goal is to maximize the entire number.\n\n    We can think of it as: we have a set of digits to assign (from `s`). We want to assign as many as possible (but we don't have to) and we want to assign the largest digits to the leftmost positions that we can.\n\n    But note: we are not forced to assign a digit to the first available opportunity. We can assign a digit to a later position even if we can use it earlier. However, we are processing from left to right and we want the maximum number.\n\n    Standard greedy for such problems (like making the largest number by replacing some digits) is:\n\n        We are going to use the available digits (from `s`) to replace digits in `a` in such a way that we get the lexicographically largest result.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Sort the available digits (from `s`) in ascending order and then use a two-pointer or simply use a multiset and then for each position, we look for the smallest digit that is greater than the current one.\n\n        However, wait: \n\n            Example: \n                a = \"123\"\n                s = \"987654321\"\n\n            We want to replace the first digit with '9'. Then the second digit: we have the next largest digit? Actually, we have all digits from '9' down to '1'. But we want to use the smallest digit that is greater than the current digit to save the larger ones for the next positions.\n\n        But if we do:\n\n            Position0: current digit '1'. We have available digits: ['9','8','7','6','5','4','3','2','1'] (but we are going to use the smallest digit greater than '1' which is '2'? Then we get \"223\", but that is not the maximum.\n\n        So that approach is wrong.\n\n    Let me re-think:\n\n        We want the entire number to be as large as possible. The leftmost digit is the most important. So we should use the largest available digit for the first digit if it is greater than the current. But then the next digit: we should use the next largest available digit that is greater than the current digit.\n\n        However, we have a fixed set of digits. We can use each only once.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Sort `s` in descending order.\n          2. We are going to traverse the digits of `a` from left to right.\n\n          3. For the current digit, we look for the largest digit in `s` that is greater than the current digit and that we haven't used. But if we use the largest, then we might not have enough for the next positions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a greedy matching from left to right with a multiset of `s` (sorted in descending order). We use a pointer that goes through the sorted `s` (from largest to smallest) and for each digit in `a` (from left to right) we check if the current digit can be improved by any digit in `s` (that is greater than the current digit). But we want to use the smallest improvement (i.e., the smallest digit that is greater than the current one) to save the larger ones? \n\n        Actually, no. We want to use the largest digit that is greater than the current one for the current digit? \n\n        But consider: \n\n            a = \"123\"\n            s = \"9 2\"\n\n            We have two digits in `s`: [9,2] (descending order).\n\n            First digit: we can replace with 9 (which is greater than 1) -> then the number becomes 9XX. Then we have [2] left. Now for the second digit: we have 2 and the current digit is 2 -> no improvement. Third digit: 2<3 -> no improvement. Result: \"923\".\n\n            But what if we use 2 for the first digit? Then the first digit becomes 2, and then we have [9] for the second digit: then we can replace the second digit with 9 -> \"293\", which is less than \"923\". So that's worse.\n\n        So we should use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one for the current digit.\n\n        However, what if we have:\n\n            a = \"123\"\n            s = \"9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2\"\n\n            We want to use the largest available digit for the first digit: 9 -> then the rest of the digits become the next largest that are greater than the current digit.\n\n        But wait, we have many digits. We are allowed to do at most one replacement per digit. So we can replace the first digit with 9, then the second digit with 8, then the third with 7. But we don't have to replace all. But if we replace the first with 9, then we can still use 8 and 7 for the next two.\n\n        However, the catch: we don't have to replace the second digit if 8 is not greater than the current second digit (which is 2). Similarly, we don't have to replace the third if 7 is not greater than 3.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Read `a` and `s`.\n            Step 2: Convert `s` to a list of integers? Or keep as string? We can keep as string and then sort.\n\n            Step 3: Sort `s` in descending order.\n\n            Step 4: We are going to use a pointer (say `j`) that starts at 0 (for the sorted `s` from largest to smallest). Then, we traverse the digits of `a`:\n\n                For each digit in `a` (from left to right):\n                    While `j` < len(s) and s[j] > current_digit:\n                        Then we can replace this digit with s[j] (because it's the largest available that is greater) and then we move `j` forward and break out of the while loop for this digit.\n\n                    But wait, if we use the largest available digit, then we use one and remove it from the multiset.\n\n            However, we cannot break the while loop because we might have multiple digits that are greater than the current one. Actually, we want to use the largest one available for the current digit.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to use only one replacement per digit. So we should use one replacement for the current digit if there is any digit in `s` (that we haven't used) that is greater than the current digit.\n\n            However, we want to use the largest one because that will give the maximum improvement at this position.\n\n            But then we have to mark that digit as used. Then we move to the next digit.\n\n            However, what if we have multiple digits in `s` that are greater than the current digit? We are going to use the largest one for the current digit, and then for the next digit we use the next largest one that is greater than the next digit's current value.\n\n            But wait: the next digit might not require the next largest one. We are going to do the same: for the next digit, we use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit.\n\n            This seems to work.\n\n            However, consider:\n\n                a = \"123\"\n                s = \"98\"   (two digits)\n\n                Step 1: sort `s` descending -> ['9','8']\n\n                Step 2: j=0\n                For the first digit '1': \n                    s[0] = '9' > '1' -> we replace it with '9', then j becomes 1.\n                Then the number so far is \"9??\"\n\n                For the second digit '2':\n                    Now j=1, s[1]='8' > '2' -> we replace it with '8', then j becomes 2.\n                Then the number becomes \"98?\".\n\n                For the third digit '3':\n                    j=2 -> out of bounds, so we don't replace.\n\n                Result: \"983\"\n\n                But is that the maximum? Yes.\n\n            Another example:\n\n                a = \"123\"\n                s = \"91\"   (two digits)\n\n                Sort `s` descending: ['9','1']\n\n                First digit: '1' -> replace with '9', j becomes 1.\n                Second digit: '2' -> we have '1' left, but '1' < '2', so we don't replace.\n                Third digit: '3' -> no replacement.\n\n                Result: \"923\"\n\n                But wait, we could have used the '1' to replace the third digit? Then we would get \"121\", which is worse. Or if we don't use the '9' for the first digit, then we can use the '1' for the second digit (which is '2') -> no improvement, and then use the '9' for the third digit: then we get \"129\", which is worse than \"923\".\n\n            But note: we are allowed to use at most one replacement per digit. And we are going from left to right, and we are using the largest available digit for the first digit. \n\n            However, is it always optimal to use the largest available digit for the current digit?\n\n            Consider:\n\n                a = \"129\"\n                s = \"9 8 7\"\n\n                Without any replacement: \"129\"\n                With replacements: \n                    Option: use '9' for the first digit -> \"929\" (then we have '8','7' for the rest: but we can use '8' for the second digit? Then \"989\", and then '7' for the third: \"987\")\n                    Option: use '9' for the third digit: then we get \"129\" -> same as without, so not useful.\n\n                So we use the largest for the first digit.\n\n            But consider:\n\n                a = \"129\"\n                s = \"9 2\"\n\n                We can only do two replacements. \n                Option1: use '9' for the first -> \"929\", then use '2' for the second -> \"929\" (same) or for the third -> \"922\", which is worse.\n                Option2: use '2' for the second -> \"129\" (second digit becomes 2, so \"129\" becomes \"129\") -> same, and then use '9' for the first -> \"929\". \n\n                But note: we are processing from left to right. We are allowed to use the '9' for the first digit and then the '2' for the third? Then the third digit becomes 2, so \"922\". \n\n                Actually, we are only allowed one replacement per digit. So we can replace the first and the third independently.\n\n                The algorithm above:\n\n                    Sort `s` descending: ['9','2']\n                    First digit: '1' -> we use '9' (because 9>1) -> becomes '9', then j=1 (next digit in s is '2')\n                    Second digit: '2' -> we compare with s[1]='2': 2 is not greater than 2, so we don't replace.\n                    Third digit: '9' -> we compare with s[1]='2': 2<9, so we don't replace.\n\n                Result: \"929\"\n\n                But wait, we didn't use the '2' at all. Why? Because when we are at the second digit, we have the digit '2' and the current digit is '2', so we don't replace. Then we move on. The '2' remains unused.\n\n                But we are allowed to leave it unused. So that's okay.\n\n            However, what if we have:\n\n                a = \"129\"\n                s = \"9 2 8\"\n\n                Then we sort `s` descending: ['9','8','2']\n\n                First digit: use '9' -> \"929\", then j=1 (digit '8')\n                Second digit: '2' -> we have '8' which is greater than '2', so we replace the second digit with '8' -> \"989\", then j=2 (digit '2')\n                Third digit: '9' -> we have '2' which is less, so we don't replace.\n\n                Result: \"989\"\n\n            Now, what if we did:\n\n                First digit: use '8' (the next largest) -> then we get \"829\", then use '9' for the third digit? Not allowed because we can only use one replacement per digit. \n\n            Actually, we are allowed to use at most one replacement per digit. So the above algorithm uses the largest available digit for the first digit, then the next largest for the second, etc.\n\n            But is that the best? \n\n            Consider: \n\n                a = \"129\"\n                s = \"9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2\"\n\n                We want to replace the first digit with 9, then the second with 8, then the third with 7 -> \"987\"\n\n            The algorithm does:\n\n                j=0, s_desc = [9,8,7,...]\n                First digit: 9>1 -> replace, j=1\n                Second digit: 8>2 -> replace, j=2\n                Third digit: 7<9 -> no replace\n\n            So result is \"987\"\n\n            Now, what if we have:\n\n                a = \"129\"\n                s = \"9 7 6 5 4 3 2\"\n\n                Then we replace the first digit with 9, then the second digit: the next largest is 7, which is greater than 2 -> replace, then the third digit: 6<9 -> no replace -> \"979\"\n\n            But wait, is there a better way? \n\n            We have the option to not use the 7 for the second digit and use it for the third digit? \n\n            But the second digit is more significant. We want to maximize the second digit. \n\n            However, the algorithm above uses the largest available digit for the current digit. \n\n            But what if we skip a digit in `s`? \n\n            We are allowed to use any subset. So we don't have to use the largest available digit for the current digit if we want to save it for a later one? \n\n            Example:\n\n                a = \"129\"\n                s = \"9 7\"\n\n                Option1: use 9 for the first -> \"929\", then use 7 for the second -> \"979\" (since second digit becomes 7) -> wait, but the second digit is originally 2, so replacing with 7 gives 7, and the third digit remains 9 -> \"979\".\n                Option2: use 9 for the first -> \"929\", then don't use 7 for the second (because 7<2? no, 7>2, so we would use it) -> but wait, we did use it.\n\n            Now, consider:\n\n                a = \"129\"\n                s = \"9 2\"\n\n                As before, we get \"929\".\n\n            Now, consider:\n\n                a = \"129\"\n                s = \"2 9\"\n\n                Then we sort descending: [9,2]\n\n                First digit: 9>1 -> use 9 -> \"929\", then j=1, then second digit: 2>2? no, so leave it.\n\n            But what if we don't use the 9 for the first digit? Then we use the 2 for the second digit? Then the second digit becomes 2 (same) and then we use the 9 for the first digit? But we already used the 9? No, we didn't use the 9 until we decide to use it.\n\n            Actually, we are traversing the sorted `s` from largest to smallest. We use each digit only once.\n\n            The algorithm above uses the largest available digit for the first digit. \n\n            However, is it always beneficial to use the largest available digit for the current digit? \n\n            Consider:\n\n                a = \"123\"\n                s = \"9 8\"\n\n                We use the 9 for the first digit -> \"923\", then 8 for the second digit -> \"983\"\n\n                But what if we use the 8 for the first digit? Then we get \"823\", and then 9 for the second digit -> \"893\", which is less than \"983\".\n\n            So we must use the largest for the first digit.\n\n            But what if we have:\n\n                a = \"123\"\n                s = \"9 1\"\n\n                Then we use 9 for the first -> \"923\", and leave 1 unused.\n\n            Now, what if we have:\n\n                a = \"123\"\n                s = \"9 1 0\"\n\n                Then we use 9 for the first -> \"923\", then we have [1,0] for the rest. We don't use them.\n\n            Now, consider a more tricky example:\n\n                a = \"132\"\n                s = \"9 4 0\"\n\n                Without replacement: \"132\"\n                We want to maximize.\n\n                Option: use 9 for the first -> \"932\" (then we have [4,0] for the rest: but 4>3? no, 4>3 is false (4>3 is true) -> wait, 4>3 -> yes, so then we can use 4 for the second digit: \"942\", then third digit: 0<2 -> no.\n\n                But wait, the algorithm:\n\n                    Sort s descending: [9,4,0]\n\n                    First digit: '1' -> 9>1 -> use 9 -> j=1, current digit becomes 9 -> \"932\"\n                    Second digit: '3' -> 4>3 -> use 4 -> j=2, current digit becomes 4 -> \"942\"\n                    Third digit: '2' -> 0<2 -> no.\n\n                Result: \"942\"\n\n                Is there a better way? \n\n                What if we don't use 9 for the first digit? Then we use 4 for the second digit: \"142\", then use 9 for the first digit? Then we get \"942\" (same as above). \n\n                Or, if we use 9 for the first and then 4 for the second, we get \"942\".\n\n                But wait, we are allowed to use the 9 for the first and then the 4 for the second. \n\n            However, what if we have:\n\n                a = \"132\"\n                s = \"4 9\"\n\n                Then we sort: [9,4]\n\n                First digit: 9>1 -> use 9 -> \"932\"\n                Second digit: 4>3 -> use 4 -> \"942\"\n\n            But wait, we have two digits. \n\n            The algorithm uses the largest available digit for the current digit. \n\n            However, what if we have:\n\n                a = \"132\"\n                s = \"4 3\"\n\n                Then we sort: [4,3]\n\n                First digit: 4>1 -> use 4 -> \"432\"\n                Second digit: 3>3 -> no, so leave as 3 -> \"432\"\n\n                But what if we don't use the 4 for the first digit? Then we can use the 3 for the second digit? Then the second digit becomes 3 (same) and the first digit remains 1 -> \"132\", which is worse.\n\n                Or we use the 3 for the third digit? Then the third digit becomes 3, so \"133\", which is worse than \"432\".\n\n            So the algorithm seems to work.\n\n            However, note: we are not required to use all digits. We are only required to use at most one replacement per digit in `a`. \n\n            But the algorithm uses the digits in `s` in descending order for the digits in `a` from left to right, and for each digit in `a`, we use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit (and if there are multiple, we use the largest one). \n\n            But wait, we don't check if the digit is greater than the current one? We just check if the digit is greater? \n\n            Actually, the condition is: we use the digit if it is greater than the current digit. And we take the largest one (because we are traversing from largest to smallest). \n\n            However, what if the current digit is '9'? Then we don't use any digit from `s` because no digit in `s` is greater than '9'. \n\n            This is correct.\n\n            Implementation:\n\n                Let a_str = input().strip()\n                Let s_str = input().strip()\n\n                We convert `s_str` to a list of characters (or digits) and sort in descending order.\n\n                Then, we iterate over each digit in `a_str`:\n\n                    For the current digit, we look at the next available digit in the sorted `s` (starting from the largest we haven't used). \n\n                    But note: we are going to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. However, we don't need to check all; we can use a pointer that moves from the beginning of the sorted `s` (largest first) and for the current digit, we use the first digit in the sorted `s` that is greater than the current digit (but we want the largest one, so we can just take the first one we find? Actually, the sorted `s` is in descending order, so the first one we meet is the largest.\n\n                However, we are not removing the digit from the multiset until we use it. We are using a pointer `j` that goes from 0 to len(s)-1.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    j = 0\n                    sorted_s = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)   # This is the multiset of digits in descending order.\n\n                    But wait, if we have duplicates, we need to consider that we can use each occurrence only once.\n\n                Actually, the above example with duplicates: \n\n                    a = \"111\"\n                    s = \"222\"\n\n                    Then we want to replace all three digits with 2? Then we get \"222\".\n\n                    The algorithm:\n\n                        sorted_s = ['2','2','2'] (descending)\n                        j=0\n                        First digit: current='1', then compare with sorted_s[0]='2' -> 2>1 -> use it, then j=1, then the digit becomes '2'\n                        Second digit: current='1', then compare with sorted_s[1]='2' -> 2>1 -> use it, j=2, digit becomes '2'\n                        Third digit: current='1', then compare with sorted_s[2]='2' -> 2>1 -> use it, j=3, digit becomes '2'\n\n                    Result: \"222\"\n\n                But what if we have:\n\n                    a = \"111\"\n                    s = \"3 2\"\n\n                    Then we want to use the largest for the first: 3 -> \"311\", then for the second: 2>1 -> \"321\", then third: no -> \"321\"\n\n                But wait, we have two digits in `s`. The algorithm:\n\n                    sorted_s = ['3','2'] (descending)\n                    j=0\n                    First digit: 3>1 -> use, j=1 -> \"311\"\n                    Second digit: 2>1 -> use, j=2 -> \"321\"\n                    Third digit: no digit left -> \"321\"\n\n            But note: we are allowed to use at most one replacement per digit in `a`. The above algorithm uses one replacement per digit in `a` (if available) and we are not forced to stop when we run out of digits in `s`.\n\n            However, we must note: we are iterating over each digit in `a`. We don't have to replace a digit if we don't have a digit from",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number `a` by performing a series of digit replacements using digits from a sequence `s`. Each digit in `s` can be used at most once, and each digit in `a` can be replaced at most once. The goal is to determine the optimal replacements to achieve the highest possible number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the leftmost digits have the highest place value. Therefore, to maximize the number, we should prioritize improving the leftmost digits first. For each digit in `a` (from left to right), we should replace it with the largest available digit from `s` that is greater than the current digit. This ensures that the most significant digits are maximized first, leading to the highest possible number.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: We first sort the digits of `s` in descending order to easily access the largest available digits.\n   - **Greedy Replacement**: We iterate through each digit of `a` from left to right. For each digit, we check if there are any digits in `s` (that haven't been used yet) which are larger than the current digit. If such a digit exists, we replace the current digit with the largest one available (which is the next in the sorted list) and mark it as used.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Sorting `s`**: The time complexity for sorting `s` is O(m log m), where m is the length of `s`.\n   - **Iterating through `a` and `s`**: The time complexity for iterating through each digit in `a` and checking the corresponding digit in `s` is O(n + m), where n is the length of `a`.\n   - Overall, the solution efficiently handles the constraints with a time complexity of O(m log m + n), which is feasible given the problem constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    sorted_s = sorted(s_str, reverse=True)\n    \n    j = 0\n    n = len(a_str)\n    m = len(sorted_s)\n    result = list(a_str)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if j >= m:\n            break\n            \n        current_digit = result[i]\n        while j < m and sorted_s[j] <= current_digit:\n            j += 1\n            \n        if j < m and sorted_s[j] > current_digit:\n            result[i] = sorted_s[j]\n            j += 1\n            \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the initial number `a` and the sequence `s` from standard input.\n2. **Sorting**: The digits of `s` are sorted in descending order to facilitate the selection of the largest available digits first.\n3. **Processing Digits**: The algorithm processes each digit of `a` from left to right. For each digit, it checks if there are any unused digits in `s` that are larger than the current digit. If found, it replaces the current digit with the largest such digit and moves to the next digit in `a`.\n4. **Output**: The modified digits of `a` are joined into a string and printed, resulting in the maximum possible number after all replacements.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number by leveraging a greedy strategy, ensuring the most significant digits are optimally replaced first. The sorting step ensures quick access to the largest available digits, and the linear pass through `a` ensures optimal performance.",
