Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing an element from the array will remove one occurrence of that element, and then we look at the new min and max.\n\n Observation:\n The instability is defined as (max - min). After removing one element, the instability can be calculated as the difference between the new max and new min.\n\n However, note that the entire array might have duplicate values. So we cannot simply remove one and recalculate the entire min and max for every removal.\n\n Instead, we can consider:\n\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. Notice that the minimum value in the original array must come from the sorted array's beginning, and maximum from the end.\n\n What happens when we remove one element?\n\n Let the sorted array be b[0..n-1].\n\n Consider two cases:\n\n Case 1: Remove an element that is not the current minimum or maximum. Then the new min is still b[0] and the new max is still b[n-1]. The instability remains the same.\n\n Case 2: Remove the only occurrence of the current minimum (if there are multiple, then we have to consider which one to remove) or similarly the maximum.\n\n Actually, if we remove an element, the new min and max may change only if we remove the smallest element (then the new min becomes the next smallest) or the largest element (then the new max becomes the next largest) or both.\n\n Therefore, we can think: \n\n Option 1: Remove the first element (the smallest). Then the new array's min is b[1] and max is b[n-1], so instability = b[n-1] - b[1].\n Option 2: Remove the last element (the largest). Then the new array's min is b[0] and max is b[n-2], so instability = b[n-2] - b[0].\n Option 3: Remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest? Then the min and max remain the same, so instability = b[n-1] - b[0].\n\n But wait, what if there are duplicates? For example, [1,1,3,7]. \n   Removing a 1: then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n   Removing a 3: then [1,1,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n   Removing a 7: then [1,1,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n However, note that the problem says we remove exactly one element. So we have to consider the possibility that removing an occurrence of the minimum might leave behind other minima. Similarly for the maximum.\n\n Actually, the key is that the instability after removal is the difference between the maximum of the remaining numbers and the minimum of the remaining numbers.\n\n How can we compute this without checking every element?\n\n Insight: The instability is determined by the overall min and max. Removing an element can only help if we remove one of the extreme values. But note:\n\n  If we remove a value that is not the global min or global max, then the min and max of the entire array remain unchanged.\n\n  However, if we remove the global min, then the new min becomes the next smallest distinct value (or the same if there was a duplicate). Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, the candidate answers are:\n\n   candidate1 = b[n-1] - b[1]   [remove the first occurrence of the smallest, but note: if there are multiple smallest, then even if we remove one, the smallest remains until we remove all? Actually, no: if there are multiple smallest, then the smallest is still present until we remove all of them. However, we are only removing one. So:\n\n   Let the sorted array be b.\n\n   The instability after removal is:\n\n     If we remove an element that is the current min (but not necessarily the only one) and there is at least one min left, then the new min is still b[0] (unless we remove the last occurrence of the min, then the new min becomes the next value). But wait: if we remove one occurrence of the min, and there is another min, then the min remains b[0]. Only when we remove all min occurrences? But we are only removing one. So:\n\n   Actually, the min of the array after removal is:\n      If we remove an element that is greater than the current min, then min remains b[0].\n      If we remove the only occurrence of the min (i.e., if the first occurrence is unique and we remove it, then the new min becomes b[1]).\n\n   Similarly for the max.\n\n   Therefore, the instability after removing an element at index i (in the sorted array) is:\n\n        new_min = \n            if i == 0 and the frequency of b[0] is 1, then b[",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in easily identifying the potential candidates for removal that could affect the min or max values of the array.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: If the array has all elements the same, removing any element will leave the instability as zero.\n3. **Evaluate Candidates for Removal**:\n   - **Removing the Smallest Element**: The new minimum becomes the next smallest element in the sorted array, while the maximum remains unchanged.\n   - **Removing the Largest Element**: The new maximum becomes the next largest element in the sorted array, while the minimum remains unchanged.\n   - **Removing Any Other Element**: The min and max remain the same, so the instability does not change.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Instability**: The solution involves computing the instability for each candidate removal (smallest, largest, and other elements) and selecting the smallest value among them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr.sort()\n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if arr.count(arr[0]) == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n    candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n    candidate3 = arr[-1] - arr[0]\n    \n    result = min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the array has all elements identical, removing any element results in zero instability.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **candidate1**: Instability when the smallest element is removed (new min is the second smallest).\n   - **candidate2**: Instability when the largest element is removed (new max is the second largest).\n   - **candidate3**: Instability if any other element is removed (min and max remain unchanged).\n4. **Result Selection**: The minimum value among the three candidates gives the optimal solution, ensuring the least instability after removal.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only the relevant candidates for removal, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to determine the minimal instability. The complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
