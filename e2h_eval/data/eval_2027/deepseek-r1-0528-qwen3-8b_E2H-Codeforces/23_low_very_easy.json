In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, s). But note: the input format is three strings? Actually, the example input is given as:\n ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']   --> but wait, actually the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n However, looking at the example input, it seems like the input is given as one string that contains three tiles, each tile being two characters. But the example input is written as having three separate strings. Let me read the problem again.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n So, the input is one line with three strings? Or three tokens? The example input is written as:\n\n Input: \n     ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But note: the example input has three examples. Actually, the problem says:\n\n     Input\n         ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n     Output\n         ['0', '0', '1']\n\n However, the actual input is just one line with three strings? Or three lines? The problem says \"The only line\", meaning one line.\n\n Let me re-read: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning one line with three strings separated by spaces or something? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n     \"1s 2s 3s\"\n     \"9m 9m 9m\"\n     \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as a list of three strings. How should we read?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\". So the input is a single line with three strings. However, the example input is written in a confusing way.\n\n Looking at the example: \n     Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This might mean that there are three test cases? But the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and then the input is three strings.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — so the input is one line with three strings. But wait, the example input has three separate examples? \n\n Clarification from the problem: \n     Example Input:\n        ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n     Example Output:\n        ['0', '0', '1']\n\n This suggests that the input is a single line with three strings, but the example input is shown as a list of three strings. In reality, the input for the program would be:\n\n     For the first example: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n     For the second example: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n     For the third example: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n However, the problem states that the input is one line. So if we are to write a program that reads one line, then splits that line into three tokens, then process each token as a tile.\n\n But wait, the example input has three tiles per test case, but the example shows three different test cases? \n\n Actually, the problem does not specify multiple test cases. It says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\" \n\n So the input is three strings on one line? Or one string containing three tiles?\n\n Let me read the example again: \n     Input: \n        ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is ambiguous. But note: the problem says \"three strings\", meaning three tokens. And the example output has three answers.\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n So, the input format is: one line, which has three strings. Each string is a tile (like \"1m\", \"9m\", etc.). \n\n But wait, the example input is given as three separate strings. However, the example input is written as a list of three strings. \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n And note: the example input is: \n        ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n   - The goal is to check if the given three tiles already form a mentsu. If not, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form one.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Triplet Check**: If there are three identical tiles, no tiles are needed (answer is 0).\n   - **Sequence Check**: For sequences, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. Since we have only three tiles, we can check all possible sequences.\n   - **Edge Cases**: \n     - If the three tiles are already a triplet or a sequence, answer is 0.\n     - If two tiles are the same and the third is different, we might need one more tile to complete a triplet or part of a sequence.\n     - If all tiles are of different suits or numbers, we might need more tiles.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Check for Triplet**: Count occurrences of each tile. If any tile appears three times, return 0.\n   - **Check for Sequence**: Group tiles by suit. For each suit, sort the numbers. Check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n   - **Calculate Minimum Tiles Needed**: \n     - If no triplet or sequence exists, determine the minimal tiles required to form either by considering possible completions (triplet or sequence).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = [tile[:2] for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for triplet\n    from collections import Counter\n    count_tile = Counter(tiles)\n    if any(count == 3 for count in count_tile.values()):\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for sequence\n    suits = set(tile[1] for tile in tiles)\n    if len(suits) == 1:\n        numbers = sorted(int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles)\n        if len(numbers) == 3:\n            if numbers[2] - numbers[0] == 2:\n                print(0)\n                return\n                \n    # Check for two same and one different\n    if any(count == 2 for count in count_tile.values()):\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    # Check for two different suits but one has two same\n    if len(suits) == 2:\n        count_by_suit = Counter()\n        for tile in tiles:\n            suit = tile[1]\n            num = int(tile[0])\n            count_by_suit[suit] += 1\n            count_by_suit[(suit, num)] += 1\n            \n        for suit, total_count in count_by_suit.items():\n            if isinstance(suit, tuple):\n                continue\n            seq = []\n            for num in range(1, 10):\n                if count_by_suit.get((suit, num), 0) > 0:\n                    seq.append(num)\n            if len(seq) >= 3:\n                for i in range(len(seq) - 2):\n                    if seq[i+2] - seq[i] == 2:\n                        print(0)\n                        return\n                        \n        print(2)\n        return\n        \n    # If there are three different suits\n    print(2)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read as a single line split into three strings, each representing a tile.\n2. **Triplet Check**: Uses a counter to check if any tile appears three times. If found, it prints 0.\n3. **Sequence Check**: Groups tiles by suit and checks for three consecutive numbers in the same suit. If found, it prints 0.\n4. **Two Same Tiles**: If two tiles are the same, it suggests drawing one more tile to complete a triplet, hence prints 1.\n5. **Different Suits**: If tiles are in two different suits, it checks for possible sequences within each suit. If no sequence is found, it suggests drawing two tiles (prints 2).\n6. **Three Different Suits**: If all tiles are of different suits, it requires drawing two tiles to form a sequence or triplet (prints 2).\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimal tiles needed, ensuring optimal performance with straightforward checks and counts.",
