The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given a mathematical model for the snowflake graph. The construction is as follows:\n   - Start with 1 vertex (step 0).\n   - Then, each vertex that has degree 1 (i.e., connected to only one other) must be connected to k new vertices (with k>1). This step must be done at least once.\n\n However, note that the example for k=4 shows the smallest snowflake. Let's break down the steps:\n\n Step 0: 1 vertex.\n Step 1: Add k new vertices, each connected to the central one. Now we have 1 + k vertices.\n\n But then, according to the rule: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (which now are the k leaves) must be connected to k more new vertices. So we do Step 2 on these k leaves.\n\n However, note: after Step 1, the center has degree k (so not degree 1 anymore). The leaves now have degree 1 (each leaf is connected only to the center). So in Step 2, we add k * k = k^2 new vertices. Now total vertices = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n Then Step 3: we look at the new leaves (from Step 2) and they have degree 1? Actually, no: the leaves from Step 1 were expanded and now the leaves from Step 2 are connected to their parent (from Step 1) and then to k new ones, so they have degree 1 only if we consider that we are going to do Step 3. But wait: the rule says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" \n\n Actually, the process can be continued arbitrarily, but the problem is: does there exist some integer k>1 and some integer m>=1 (number of expansion layers) such that:\n\n n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n However, note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning m>=1. But note that the initial step (Step 1) is mandatory, so m>=1. But wait: the initial step is the first expansion. Actually, the problem says:\n\n   Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). \n   Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\n So the minimal snowflake (after the first expansion) has n = 1 + k. But then we can also have more expansions.\n\n However, note: the rule for expansion applies to every vertex that currently has degree 1. After the first expansion, the center has degree k (which is >=2) so it doesn't get expanded again. Then the leaves (k in number) have degree 1, so we expand each of them, adding k*k new leaves. Then the leaves from the second expansion (k*k of them) have degree 1, so we can continue.\n\n Therefore, the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m   for some m>=1.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire process to stop after m steps? Actually, the problem states that the construction is defined by these rules and the process is done at least once (meaning we must do the expansion at least until the first layer). However, we can stop at any expansion step.\n\n So the question is: for a given n (which can be up to 10^18), is there an integer k>1 and an integer m>=1 such that:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n Note: the above is a geometric series. We can write:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n Since k>1 and m>=1, then k^(m+1) = (n)*(k-1) + 1.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all k and m because n can be up to 10^18.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We note that the representation of n as a geometric series is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n and note that k must be at least 2 (since k>1).\n\n Also note that the minimal n for a fixed k and m is:\n\n   m=1: n = 1 + k, so k = n-1 (and we require k>=2 -> n>=3)\n   m=2: n = 1 + k + k^2, so k^2 + k + 1 = n\n\n But wait: the problem says we must do the expansion at least once (so m>=1). However, note that the expansion step is applied at least once, so the minimal form is just the first expansion (m=1). But the problem allows more than one expansion.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the entire expansion must be completed, but the rule says: we start with the center, then we do the expansion at least once (which gives the first ring). Then, if we do more, we add more rings.\n\n So the equation holds for m>=1.\n\n How to check?\n\n Since n can be as large as 10^18, we cannot iterate over m or k.\n\n Observation:\n\n   For a fixed base k (integer >=2), the geometric series must sum to n. But note that k can be any integer from 2 up to about n^(1/m) and m is the number of terms (excluding the 1). \n\n Alternatively, we can think: the representation of n as a geometric series with ratio k (integer>=2) and at least two terms (because m>=1: so at least 1 + k) is required.\n\n But note: we can also have m=0? No, because the problem requires at least one expansion (so m>=1). So we must have at least two terms: the 1 and then k.\n\n However, note: the series is of m+1 terms (from exponent 0 to m). The condition is m>=1, so the series has at least two terms.\n\n Another observation: the base k must be at least 2 and the largest term is k^m, which is less than n.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   n = 1 + k*(1 + k*(1 + ... ))   [m times]\n\n How to solve without iterating too much?\n\n Since n can be very large, we can try to bound the possible k and m.\n\n Note: the series is increasing in both k and m.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   For a given n, what are the possible bases k? Note that k must be at least 2.\n\n   The minimal value of the series for a fixed k is when m=1: n_min = 1+k (so k<=n-1). But k can be as large as n-1 (then m=1). However, if k is large, then m must be small.\n\n   In fact, the series with base k and m terms (m>=1) must satisfy:\n\n        k^m <= n < (k^(m+1))/(k-1)   [but actually, the series is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)]\n\n   Alternatively, we can fix m (the exponent, i.e., the number of expansion steps) and then solve for k.\n\n   Since m>=1, and note that the maximal m we can have is when k=2, then the series is 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^m = 2^(m+1)-1.\n\n   We require 2^(m+1)-1 <= n, and m can be at most about log2(n). But n can be 10^18, so m can be up to around 60 (since 2^60 ~ 1e18). \n\n   However, note: we don't know k. But we can iterate over the possible exponents m (from 1 up to about floor(log2(n)) + 1) and for each m, solve for k.\n\n   But note: the equation for fixed m:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n        => n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   Then, k must be an integer >=2.\n\n   How to solve for k? We can rearrange:\n\n        k^(m+1) = (n)*(k-1) + 1\n\n   Alternatively, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] (but n can be 10^18, so we cannot iterate over k). However, note that k is the base and the series grows quickly, so k is at most around the (m+1)-th root of n.\n\n   But note: we are iterating over m (which is at most ~60). For each m, we can use binary search on k (in a range [2, n]) to find an integer k such that the geometric series sum equals n.\n\n   However, note that the equation is:\n\n        S(m, k) = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1) = n\n\n   And k must be an integer.\n\n   We can also note that k must satisfy:\n\n        k^m <= n < (k^(m+1))/(k-1)   [actually, the series is bounded by k^m * (1 - (1/k)^(m+1)) / (1-1/k) )? ]\n\n   Actually, the entire series is:\n\n        S(m, k) = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   So we have:\n\n        (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n   This equation can be rewritten as:\n\n        k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   But note: k must be an integer.\n\n   However, we cannot easily solve this equation algebraically for k. But we can use the following:\n\n   For a fixed m, we can set:\n\n        Let f(k) = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n   Then we are looking for an integer k>=2 such that f(k)=n.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider that the minimal k is 2 and the maximal k is n-1 (for m=1). But for larger m, k must be smaller.\n\n   But note: the geometric series with base k and m+1 terms must equal n.\n\n   We can use binary search for k for each m, but the range of k might be too big (from 2 to n) and n is 10^18.\n\n   However, note: for a fixed m, the base k must satisfy:\n\n        k^m <= n   (because the last term is k^m and the entire series is at least k^m)\n\n        and also, since the series is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n, we can approximate k by the (m+1)-th root of something.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that:\n\n        (k-1)*n = k^(m+1) - 1\n\n        => k^(m+1) = (k-1)*n + 1\n\n   We can also note that k must be roughly the (m+1)-th root of (n*(k-1)+1). Since k is the base, we can use an approximation:\n\n        k^(m+1) ≈ n*(k-1)\n\n        => k^m ≈ n/(k-1)\n\n        => k^(m+1) ≈ n*k   (if we ignore the constants) -> not exactly.\n\n   Actually, we can use:\n\n        k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   For large k, k^(m+1) dominates, so k is roughly the (m+1)-th root of (n*k). This is circular.\n\n   Another idea: for fixed m, we can set:\n\n        Let L = 2, R = n   (but n can be 10^18, and m is at most ~60, but the k we are looking for for a given m is actually much smaller than n because the series grows exponentially).\n\n        Actually, we know that k^m <= n, so k <= n**(1/m). Since m>=1, and the maximum m we consider is about 60, then for m=60, k <= n**(1/60) which is at most around 10^(18/60) ~ 10^0.3 ~ 2 (for n=10^18) so actually for large m, k is very small.\n\n   Therefore, we can set:\n\n        For a fixed m, the base k must be at least 2 and at most:\n\n            k_max = min(n, int(round(n**(1/m))) + 10)   # but wait, the series has m+1 terms, so we have:\n\n            Actually, the series is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, so the last term is k^m, and the entire series is about k^m (if k>=2 and m is large, then k^m dominates). So k^m <= n.\n\n        So k <= n**(1/m). But note: n**(1/m) is the m-th root of n.\n\n        Since m is at least 1 and at most about 60, then for n=10^18:\n\n            m=1: k_max = 10^18 (which is too big to iterate)\n            m=2: k_max = 10^9 (still too big to iterate by linear scan)\n            m=3: k_max = 10^6 (too big)\n            ... until m=60: k_max = 10^(18/60) ~ 10^0.3, which is about 2.\n\n   So we cannot iterate k from 2 to k_max for m=1 or m=2.\n\n   We need a better way to solve for k for a fixed m.\n\n   Since the function f(k) = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, k_max] (where k_max = min(n, int(n**(1/m))+10) ) but note: k_max might be very large for small m.\n\n   However, note that for a fixed m, the equation:\n\n        (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n   can be solved by binary searching k in [2, k_max] (with k_max being the m-th root of n, which for m=1 is n, and for m=2 is sqrt(n), etc.)\n\n   But even for m=1, k_max = n, and n can be 10^18, so we cannot iterate from 2 to n.\n\n   However, note that for m=1, the equation becomes:\n\n        n = 1 + k   => k = n-1.\n\n   So for m=1, we only need to check k = n-1. Then we must check if k>=2 (which it is if n>=3) and then if the equation holds (it does by definition).\n\n   Similarly, for m=2:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2\n\n        => k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0\n\n        => k = (-1 + sqrt(1+4*(n-1))) / 2\n\n        Then we check if this k is an integer >=2.\n\n   So we can handle each m separately with specific methods:\n\n   Case 1: m=1\n        k = n-1, and we require k>=2 (so n>=3) and then the equation holds.\n\n   Case 2: m>=2\n        We can use binary search for k in the range [2, int(round(n**(1/m)))+10] (but note: the series has m+1 terms, so the last term is k^m, and k^m <= n, so k <= n**(1/m))\n\n        However, note: the series is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n. We can compute the left-hand side for a candidate k and compare to n.\n\n        But the exponentiation k^(m+1) for k up to n**(1/m) and m up to 60 might be too expensive? However, note that for m>=2, k is at most about the m-th root of n. For n=10^18 and m=2, k_max=10^9, and then k^(m+1) = k^3 which is 10^27, which is too big to represent? Actually, we are dealing with numbers up to 10^27, but Python integers can handle that, but we must be careful with performance.\n\n        However, note that the binary search for m=2 would run over a range from 2 to 10^9, which is 1e9 iterations, which is too slow.\n\n   We need a more efficient way.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that for a fixed m (>=2), we are solving:\n\n        k^(m+1) = (n)*(k-1) + 1\n\n   We can rearrange to:\n\n        k^(m+1) - (n)*(k-1) - 1 = 0\n\n   But still, we are looking for an integer k.\n\n   Since m is small (at most 60) and k is the base, we can use binary search on k, but the range for k is [2, floor(n**(1/m))] (which for m=2 is 10^9, which is too many for binary search? Actually, binary search will take about log2(10^9) which is about 30 iterations. So for each m, we do about 30 iterations. But we are iterating m from 2 to about 60, so 59*30 ~ 1770 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, wait: for m=1 we already handled, and for m>=2, we do a binary search for k in [2, n**(1/m)].\n\n   But note: the exponentiation k^(m+1) for k up to 10^9 and m+1=3 (for m=2) is 10^27, which is a big integer but Python can handle. However, for m=3, the exponent is 4, and k_max = n**(1/3) for n=10^18 is 10^6, so 10^6^4 = 10^24, which is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: what is the maximum m? We can only go up to m such that 2^(m+1)-1 <= n. For n=10^18, the maximum m is about 60 (as 2^60 ~ 1e18). For m=60, k_max = n**(1/60) ~ 10^(18/60) ~ 10^0.3, so about 2. So we can set:\n\n        m_min = 1\n        m_max = floor(log2(n))   [because 2^(m+1)-1 <= n] -> m+1 <= log2(n+1), so m <= floor(log2(n+1))-1.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        t = number of test cases.\n\n        For each test case:\n          read n.\n\n          if n == 1: \n             Then we cannot have any expansion (because the expansion requires k>1 and at least one expansion, so n>=3). But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", so the minimal n is 1+k (with k>=2) so at least 3. But wait, what about the initial state? The problem says: initially the graph has one vertex. Then the expansion is done at least once. So the graph must have at least 1+k (with k>=2) = 3. However, note the input n=1 is given. According to the problem, we must output \"NO\" for n=1.\n\n          So we can say:\n\n            if n < 3: then NO.\n\n          Now, consider:\n\n          Option 1: Check for m=1: then k = n-1, and we require k>=2 (so n>=3) and then the equation holds. So for any n>=3, we have a solution with m=1 and k=n-1.\n\n          But wait, is that always true? For example, n=3: then k=2, and the equation: 1 + 2 = 3, so yes.\n\n          Then why the sample input:\n\n                Input: 1 -> NO\n                       2 -> NO\n                       3 -> NO   ??? wait, the sample output for 3 is NO.\n\n          Let me check the sample:\n\n                Input: \n                  ['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n                Output: \n                  ['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\n          So for n=3, the answer is NO.\n\n          Why? Because the problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n          But wait, the minimal snowflake is built by:\n\n            Step 0: 1 vertex.\n            Step 1: add k new vertices (k>1) -> now we have 1+k.\n\n          However, the rule says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must do Step 1 (which we did). But then, is that the entire process? Then n=1+k should be allowed.\n\n          But the problem also says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph.\" and then the rule about connecting leaves. But note: the rule says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (the leaves) must be connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step must be done at least once.\n\n          Wait, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the entire construction must include at least two expansions? Or does the first expansion count as the first step and then the second expansion is the one that must be done at least once?\n\n          Let me read again:\n\n            \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n\n            Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n          The key: the entire process must include the first expansion (which is the one that connects the center to k new vertices) and then the second expansion (on the leaves) must be done at least once.\n\n          So the minimal snowflake is after two expansions? \n\n          Actually, the problem says:\n\n            Step 0: one vertex.\n            Step 1: connect the center to k new vertices (so now we have 1+k vertices). Now, the center has degree k (>=2) and the k leaves have degree 1.\n            Step 2: then, we must do the step (expanding the leaves) at least once. So we must add k*k new vertices. Then the total vertices become 1 + k + k^2.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal snowflake must have at least 1 + k + k^2 vertices, with k>=2, so minimal n = 1+2+4 = 7.\n\n          But wait, the example figure for k=4 shows a snowflake with 1+4+16 = 21? Actually, the figure is minimal for k=4: the center, then 4, then each of the 4 expands to 4, so 1+4+16=21.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"The smallest possible snowflake for k=4\". \n\n          But the problem statement says: \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of the leaves must be done at least once. So the first expansion (from the center) is mandatory, and then the expansion of the leaves (the second expansion) is mandatory. So the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n          Therefore, we must have m>=2 (meaning the expansion of the leaves is done at least once, so the series has at least three terms: 1, k, k^2).\n\n          Then the equation is:\n\n                n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, for m>=2.\n\n          Then the minimal n is 1+2+4=7.\n\n          Now, let's check the sample:\n\n                n=1 -> NO\n                n=2 -> NO\n                n=3 -> NO (because 3 is less than 7)\n                n=6 -> NO (because 6<7, and the next candidate is 7, then 8,9,...)\n\n          But wait, the sample output for n=6 is 'NO', and for n=13 is 'YES'. \n\n          How can n=13 be YES? \n\n          We require: 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = 13, with k>=2 and m>=2.\n\n          Let's try m=2: 1+k+k^2=13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=(-1±sqrt(1+48))/2 = (-1±7)/2 -> k=3 (since k>0). Then 1+3+9=13 -> valid.\n\n          So n=13 is YES.\n\n          But then why n=6 is NO? \n\n          With m>=2, the smallest n is 7 (for k=2: 1+2+4=7). Then n=6 is less than 7, so no.\n\n          Now, the sample output:\n\n              1: NO\n              2: NO\n              3: NO\n              6: NO\n              13: YES\n              15: YES\n              255: YES\n              10101: YES\n              1000000000000000000: NO\n\n          Let's check n=15:\n\n            m=2: 1+k+k^2=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> discriminant=57, not a perfect square -> no integer k.\n            m=3: 1+k+k^2+k^3=15 -> k^3+k^2+k-14=0. Try k=2: 8+4+2-14=0 -> yes, 15 = 1+2+4+8. So k=2, m=3.\n\n          Then n=255:\n\n            Let's try m=2: 1+k+k^2=255 -> k^2+k-254=0 -> discriminant=1+4*254=1017, not a perfect square.\n            m=3: 1+k+k^2+k^3=255 -> k^3+k^2+k-254=0. \n                k=6: 216+36+6 = 258 -> too big.\n                k=5: 125+25+5=155 <254 -> no.\n                k=6 is too big, so no for m=3.\n            m=4: 1+k+k^2+k^3+k^4=255 -> k=3: 1+3+9+27+81=121 <255; k=4: 1+4+16+64+256=341>255 -> no.\n            m=5: 1+k+...+k^5=255. k=2: 1+2+4+8+16+32=63; k=3: 1+3+9+27+81+243=364>255 -> no.\n\n          But wait, maybe k=2 and m=7: 2^8-1 = 255 -> (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255. So m=7 (exponent goes from 0 to 7, so 8 terms) -> then n=255 = (2^8-1)/(2-1). \n\n          So we must consider all m>=2 (or m>=1?) but note: the problem says the expansion of the leaves (the second step) must be done at least once. In our model, the first expansion is the center to k, and then the second expansion is the leaves to k each, so two expansions (two layers) meaning the series goes up to k^2. But the problem allows more than two expansions. \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" \n\n          This means that after the first expansion (which gives the center and the first ring of k leaves), we must do the expansion on the leaves (which are k in number) at least once. But then, after that, we can choose to stop or continue. \n\n          However, note: after the first expansion, the leaves have degree 1. Then we do the expansion on the leaves (second expansion) and then the new leaves (from the second expansion) have degree 1, and we are allowed to stop. \n\n          But the problem does not say we must do the expansion until we can't. It says we do the expansion (on the leaves) at least once. So the minimal snowflake has two expansions (center, then first ring, then second ring). But we can also have more than two expansions.\n\n          Therefore, the equation is:\n\n                n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m,   with m>=2 (because we must do the expansion of the leaves at least once, so the series must have at least three terms: m+1>=3 -> m>=2)\n\n          However, wait: the expansion steps:\n\n            Step 0: 1 vertex.\n            Step 1: add k -> now we have 1+k.\n            Step 2: add k*k -> now we have 1+k+k^2.\n\n          So the minimal m (number of expansions beyond the center) is 1 (for the leaves) but the total number of layers (including the center) is 3 (exponents 0,1,2). \n\n          Alternatively, we can think of the exponent m as the highest power, so the series has exponents from 0 to m, and m must be at least 1 (because we must do the expansion of the leaves at least once, so the highest power is at least 2? Actually, the leaves are at exponent 1, and expanding them adds exponent 2). \n\n          But wait: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion of the leaves (which is the second expansion) must be done at least once. So the series must have at least the terms for exponent 0 (the center), exponent 1 (the first ring), and exponent 2 (the second ring). \n\n          Therefore, the minimal representation is for m=2 (the highest exponent is 2) and the series is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n          So we require m (the highest exponent) to be at least 2.\n\n          Then the equation is:\n\n                n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)   for some integer k>=2 and integer m>=2.\n\n          Now, let's reexamine the examples:\n\n          n=13: m=2, k=3 -> 1+3+9=13 -> YES.\n\n          n=15: m=3, k=2 -> 1+2+4+8=15 -> YES.\n\n          n=255: m=7, k=2 -> 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128 = 255? Actually, the formula is (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255. So m=7 (exponent from 0 to 7) -> so the highest exponent is 7, so m=7. Then k=2, and 255 = (2^8-1)/(2-1). \n\n          Now, how to check for n=255?\n\n          We must iterate m from 2 up to the maximum m such that the minimal series (with k=2) is <= n.\n\n          The minimal series for a fixed m is when k=2: (2^(m+1)-1). We require (2^(m+1)-1) <= n.\n\n          For n=255, m_max: 2^(m+1)-1 <=255 -> 2^(m+1)<=256 -> m+1<=8 -> m<=7.\n\n          So we iterate m from 2 to 7 (inclusive) and for each m, we try to find an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n                (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n          How to solve for k for a fixed m?\n\n          We can use binary search for k in the range [2, floor(n**(1/m)) + 1] (but note: the entire series has m+1 terms, so k^m <= n, so k <= n**(1/m)).\n\n          But note: the equation is:\n\n                (k^(m+1)-1) = (k-1)*n\n\n          We can also use the fact that k must be an integer, so we can compute the left-hand side for a candidate k and check if it equals n*(k-1)+1.\n\n          However, note: the series is (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1). We can compute the series sum by:\n\n                s = 1\n                term = 1\n                for i in range(1, m+1):\n                    term *= k\n                    s += term\n\n          But k can be up to 10^9 for m=2, and then the series has 3 terms: 1, k, k^2 -> so we can compute k^2 for k=10^9 (which is 10^18, which is acceptable in Python for one multiplication, but we are doing binary search for k and for each candidate k we do m multiplications. The number of candidates is about 30 (binary search steps) and m is at most 60, so 30*60=1800 multiplications per test case? But we have up to 10^4 test cases, so 10^4 * 1800 = 18e6 multiplications, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be cautious.\n\n          However, note: n can be up to 10^18, and the exponentiation for k^(m+1) for k=2 and m=60 is 2^61 which is about 2e18, which is acceptable. But for k=10^9 and m=2, we compute k^3 = 10^27, which is a big integer but Python can handle. But 10^27 is the maximum for k_max? Actually, for m=2, k_max = floor(sqrt(n)) which for n=10^18 is 10^9, and then k^3 is 10^27, which is a big integer but Python integers are arbitrary precision, so we can do it.\n\n          But the problem: we have up to 10^4 test cases, and for each test case we iterate m from 2 to m_max (which is about 60) and for each m we do a binary search (about 30 iterations) and for each candidate k we do a loop of m multiplications (m<=60). Then total operations per test case: 60 * 30 * 60 = 108000 operations, which is 108000 * 10^4 = 1.08e9 operations, which might be borderline in C++ but in Python might be too slow.\n\n          We must optimize.\n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid iterating over all m from 2 to m_max for each test case.\n\n          Note: the equation for a fixed m is:\n\n                n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n          We can solve for k by considering that k must be an integer and the series is strictly increasing with k. We can use binary search for k for a fixed m.\n\n          Steps for a fixed test case n:\n\n            if n < 7: then NO (because minimal n is 7)\n\n            Then, we want to know if there exists an integer k>=2 and an integer m>=2 such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n            We can iterate",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a central vertex, and each subsequent layer adds vertices connected to the previous layer's leaves. The key insight is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be a sum of a geometric series with at least two expansions (since the expansion of leaves must be done at least once).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph starts with one central vertex. The first expansion adds \\( k \\) new vertices connected to the center. The second expansion adds \\( k^2 \\) vertices (each of the \\( k \\) leaves from the first expansion adds \\( k \\) new vertices). This process can continue for more layers, but the minimal graph requires at least two expansions (so the smallest graph has \\( 1 + k + k^2 \\) vertices, with \\( k \\geq 2 \\)).\n2. **Key Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( m \\geq 2 \\) such that \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\). This is equivalent to \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case, if \\( n < 7 \\), output \"NO\" because the smallest valid snowflake has 7 vertices (when \\( k=2 \\)). Otherwise, iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) (from 2 up to the maximum \\( m \\) where \\( 2^{m+1} - 1 \\leq n \\)). For each \\( m \\), use binary search to find an integer \\( k \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\).\n4. **Optimization**: To handle large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)), we limit the range of \\( k \\) for each \\( m \\) using the \\( m \\)-th root of \\( n \\). This ensures the binary search is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        max_m = 0\n        temp = n\n        m_val = 2\n        while temp >= 2**(m_val+1) - 1:\n            m_val += 1\n        max_m = m_val\n        \n        for m in range(2, max_m + 1):\n            low_k = 2\n            high_k = int(round(n ** (1/m))) + 10\n            if high_k < 2:\n                high_k = 2\n                \n            k_candidate = None\n            while low_k <= high_k:\n                mid_k = (low_k + high_k) // 2\n                total = 1\n                term = 1\n                overflow = False\n                for i in range(1, m + 1):\n                    term *= mid_k\n                    if term > n * (mid_k - 1) + 1:\n                        overflow = True\n                        break\n                    total += term\n                    if total > n:\n                        overflow = True\n                        break\n                if total == n:\n                    k_candidate = mid_k\n                    break\n                elif total < n:\n                    low_k = mid_k + 1\n                else:\n                    high_k = mid_k - 1\n                    \n            if k_candidate is not None:\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it immediately outputs \"NO\" since no valid snowflake can be formed with fewer than 7 vertices.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each possible number of expansions \\( m \\) (from 2 up to the maximum feasible \\( m \\)), the code performs a binary search to find an integer \\( k \\) such that the sum of the geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\) equals \\( n \\).\n4. **Efficiency**: The binary search limits the range of \\( k \\) using the \\( m \\)-th root of \\( n \\), ensuring the solution remains efficient even for very large \\( n \\).\n5. **Output Result**: For each test case, the result (\"YES\" or \"NO\") is stored and printed at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the snowflake graph by leveraging geometric series properties and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
