On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNS) in the resulting sequence.\n\n Observation:\n Since the array only contains 1 and 2, a non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a contiguous (in terms of values) sequence of 1's followed by 2's. However, note that the entire sequence is just 1's and 2's, so the LNS can be:\n\n Option 1: All the 1's (if there are no 2's, then the whole sequence is 1's)\n Option 2: All the 2's\n Option 3: A mix of 1's and 2's, but note that if we have a 2 after a 1, then we can combine the two.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to reverse an interval. The goal is to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Let total_ones = total count of 1's, total_twos = total count of 2's.\n\n Without any reversal, the original sequence might have a non-decreasing subsequence that is the entire sequence if it is already non-decreasing? But note: we can only reverse one contiguous interval.\n\n Important: After reversal, the entire sequence will have the same multiset (same counts of 1's and 2's). So the maximum possible LNS cannot exceed n.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to reverse an interval. What does that do?\n\n Example: [1,2,1,2] -> reverse [2,3] (0-indexed [1:3]) becomes [1,1,2,2] -> LNS=4.\n\n Another example: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1] -> reversing [3,7] (0-indexed [2:8]) gives [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1] -> then the LNS is 9 (the first five 1's? Actually, note: the entire sequence has 6 ones and 5 twos. In the reversed part, we turned the two middle parts (which were two 2's and two 1's) into four consecutive 1's and four consecutive 2's? Actually, the reversal of [2,8] (0-indexed from index2 to index8) in [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1] is:\n\n Original: \n   indices: 0:1, 1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:2, 5:1, 6:1, 7:2, 8:2, 9:1\n Reverse from index2 to index8: \n   Original segment: [2,2,2,1,1,2,2] becomes [2,2,1,1,2,2,2]\n\n Then the entire array becomes:\n   [1,1, [2,2,1,1,2,2,2], 1] \n But wait, the example output says 9. How do we get 9?\n\n Actually, the example says: \"after reversing [3,7]\" (which is 1-indexed, so in 0-indexed [2:8] as above). Then the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1] (from the example description). \n\n Wait, let me check: \n   Original: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n   Reverse from index2 to index7 (if 0-indexed [2:8] is inclusive) or [2:8] exclusive? The problem says [l, r] (1-indexed) so in 0-indexed we take [l-1:r] (i.e., from l-1 to r-1). But the example says: \"reverse [3,7]\" meaning the third to the seventh element (inclusive). \n\n In 0-indexed: \n   Start index = 3-1 = 2, end index = 7-1 = 6? But wait, the example output says the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. \n\n Alternatively, the example says: \"reverse [3,7]\" for a sequence of 10 elements. So the reversal is from the 3rd element to the 7th element (so 5 elements). \n\n How did they get [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]? \n\n Let me break down the example input: \n   Input: 10\n          1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1\n\n   Reverse from index 2 to index 6 (0-indexed) [since 3rd to 7th, which is positions 2 to 6]:\n        Original: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n        Segment from index2 to index6: [2,2,2,1,1] -> reversed becomes [1,1,2,2,2]\n\n        Then the new array: \n            [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1] -> wait, no, because we replaced the segment from index2 to index6 with [1,1,2,2,2]. So:\n\n            indices 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:2, 5:2, 6:2, 7:2, 8:2, 9:1.\n\n        Then the entire array is: [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]\n\n        Now, what is the longest non-decreasing subsequence? We can take all the 1's (6 ones) and then the 2's until the last one? \n\n        Actually, the entire sequence: [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1] \n        The non-decreasing subsequence can be: \n          We can take the first five 1's? Actually, the first four are 1's, then five 2's, then a 1 at the end. \n\n        But note: we cannot use the last 1 because after the 2's we have a 1. So the best is to take the first five 2's? That would be 5. Or the 6 ones? But wait, we have 6 ones in the entire array.\n\n        Actually, the array now has six 1's and five 2's. But the non-decreasing subsequence must be non-decreasing. We can take the entire sequence of 1's (which are not necessarily contiguous) and then the 2's. However, note that the 1's are all at the beginning and then the 2's and then a 1 at the end.\n\n        We can do:\n          Take all the 1's (the first four and the two at the end? Actually, the two at the end: the first four 1's are contiguous, then five 2's, then a 1. \n\n        The non-decreasing condition: we can take the first four 1's (positions 0,1,2,3) and then the five 2's (positions 4 to 8) and then we cannot take the last 1 because 2>1. So the length is 4+5 = 9.\n\n        Alternatively, we can take the six 1's (ignoring the 2's) but wait: the six 1's are not contiguous? Actually, the six 1's are in the beginning (four) and then the last one. But if we try to combine them with the 2's, we cannot because 1<=2 is okay, but then after the 2's we have a 1. So the longest is indeed 9: the four 1's and then the five 2's.\n\n        But note: the entire array has 10 elements, and 9 is the answer.\n\n So the idea:\n\n Without reversal, the entire sequence is fixed. With reversal, we can change a contiguous segment to be either increasing or decreasing (but note: we are allowed to reverse arbitrarily).\n\n However, note that the reversal operation flips a contiguous segment. Since our elements are only 1 and 2, the reversal can be thought of as rearranging a contiguous set of 1's and 2's.\n\n We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Note: In an array of 1 and 2, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if we don't have a 2 followed by a 1. So the goal is to minimize the number of inversions (2 then 1) and arrange the 1's and 2's so that we have a long run of 1's (as many as possible) and then a long run of 2's (as many as possible). \n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. This reversal can fix some inversions and also create others.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let the entire array have:\n   total_ones = t1, total_twos = t2.\n\n Without reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break the sequence into:\n\n   [1's (any number)] then [2's (any number)] and then possibly some 1's at the end? But wait, if we have a 1 after a 2, that breaks the non-decreasing.\n\n However, note: the longest non-decreasing subsequence in an array of 1 and 2 is simply the entire set of 1's (if we skip the 2's) OR the entire set of 2's (if we skip the 1's) OR a combination of some 1's and then some 2's (but we can take all the 1's that come before the 2's and then all the 2's that come after the 1's? Actually, we can take all the 1's and then the 2's that appear after the last 1 we took? \n\n But note: we can take non-contiguous elements. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary sequence (1 and 2) is:\n\n   min(total_ones + total_twos, ...) but actually, the entire sequence is broken by the condition: we can have a run of 1's and then a run of 2's, and then if there are 1's again, we cannot use them together with the 2's. However, we can interleave? Actually, no: because we require non-decreasing, so we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that occur after the last 1 we took? \n\n Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary sequence (with only 1 and 2) is:\n\n   We can take every element that is 1 or 2, but if we have a 2 then a 1, we cannot use both. However, we can take:\n\n   Option 1: All the 1's (if we don't take any 2's) -> length t1.\n   Option 2: All the 2's -> length t2.\n   Option 3: Some 1's and then some 2's. But note: we can take a 1 and then a 2 even if they are not consecutive. The condition is that we can take any 1 that appears before a 2 (and we can skip arbitrary elements). Therefore, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence without the inversions? Actually, no: we can skip the inversions.\n\n However, note: the entire sequence is broken into runs. The standard way to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for a binary sequence is to consider:\n\n   We can take all the 1's and then the 2's that appear after the last 1 we took? Actually, we can take:\n\n   Let x = the number of 1's that we take, and y = the number of 2's that we take, and we require that the last 1 we take must be before the first 2 we take.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to skip arbitrarily. So the entire sequence is a permutation of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire set of 1's (if we take all 1's, then we cannot take any 2 that comes after a 1? Actually, we can take a 2 if it comes after a 1? Yes, because 1<=2. But wait: we can have a 1 and then a 2 and then a 1: we can take the first 1, then the 2, and then we cannot take the last 1 because 2>1. So the rule is: we can take as many 1's as we want, and then as many 2's as we want, but we cannot take a 1 after a 2.\n\n   Therefore, the entire sequence can be partitioned by a point: we take all the 1's that are before a certain position, and then all the 2's that are after that position? Actually, we can break the sequence arbitrarily. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum over k (number of 1's) plus the number of 2's that occur after the k-th 1? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the entire sequence is made of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if there is no inversion (no 2 followed by 1). If there are inversions, we can fix them by reversing an interval.\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. \n\n How can we solve this?\n\n Insight: After reversal, the entire multiset remains the same. So the total_ones and total_twos are fixed. The maximum LNS we can hope for is at least max(t1, t2) and at most t1+t2 (if we can arrange the entire sequence as 1's then 2's). \n\n However, note: the reversal operation can help us to bring together all the 1's and then all the 2's? \n\n But note: we cannot change the order arbitrarily. We can reverse one contiguous segment. So we can fix one inversion block.\n\n Actually, the problem reduces to: we wish to have as many 1's as possible at the beginning and then as many 2's as possible. The reversal operation can help us to remove some inversions.\n\n However, note: we are not forced to have a single run of 1's and then a single run of 2's. We can have multiple runs, but the non-decreasing subsequence can take the first run of 1's and then the next run of 2's (if they are consecutive). But if we have 1's, then 2's, then 1's, then 2's, then the non-decreasing subsequence can take the entire 1's from the first and third run? No, because after the 2's we have 1's and then 2's, so we can take the 1's from the third run only if we haven't taken any 2's? Actually, no: the non-decreasing condition requires that once we take a 2, we cannot take a 1. \n\n Therefore, the entire sequence can be broken into segments (runs) of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum of:\n\n   Option 1: The entire sequence of 1's (if we take only 1's) -> t1.\n   Option 2: The entire sequence of 2's -> t2.\n   Option 3: A prefix of 1's (from the beginning) and a suffix of 2's (from the end) that together form a contiguous non-decreasing subsequence? Actually, we can take non contiguous elements. \n\n But note: the classical solution for longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary array is:\n\n   Let the array be A[0...n-1].\n   We can take the entire sequence and then remove the inversions? Actually, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence without the inversions? Not exactly.\n\n   Standard method: \n     Let dp[i] be the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n     But since we have only two values, we can do:\n\n        Let x = number of 1's in the entire sequence, and y = number of 2's.\n\n        However, note: the LNS is at most x+y, but if the sequence is not entirely non-decreasing, we can still take all the 1's and then the 2's that appear after the last 1 we took? \n\n        Actually, the entire sequence is a string of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if we don't have any '2' followed by '1'. Otherwise, we can skip some elements.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. \n\n We need to consider the effect of reversing one contiguous interval.\n\n Let the original array be A.\n\n After reversal, the array becomes:\n\n   [A[0] ... A[l-2], A[r] A[r-1] ... A[l-1], A[r+1] ... A[n-1]]\n\n We wish to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   Without reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum between:\n      t1 (if we take all ones) and t2 (if we take all twos) and also the possibility of mixing? Actually, we can always take all the ones and then the twos that appear after the last one? \n\n   But wait: the non-decreasing subsequence does not require contiguous elements. So we can take:\n\n      Let f = the entire sequence, but we can skip any element. Then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if there's no inversion (2 then 1). Otherwise, we can break the sequence at the last inversion? \n\n   Actually, the standard way to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for a binary sequence is:\n\n      We can traverse and whenever we see a 2, we can take it only if we have seen a 1 before? Actually, no: we can take a 2 only if we have a 1 earlier? \n\n   However, note: the entire sequence is 1's and 2's. The condition for non-decreasing is that we can have 1's and then 2's. So the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the entire sequence if we don't have a 2 then 1. Otherwise, we can take:\n\n      Let x = the number of 1's in the entire sequence (t1) and y = the number of 2's (t2). Then the entire sequence can be split by the condition: we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that appear after the last 1? \n\n   Actually, no: the entire sequence might be: [1,2,2,1] -> then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 3 (the three 2's? no, because we have two 2's, but wait: [1,2,2] is 3. However, we can also take the two 1's and the two 2's? But we cannot mix because after a 2 we cannot take a 1. So the best is 3.\n\n   So the idea: the entire sequence is an array of 1's and 2's. The longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum k such that there exists a subsequence of k elements that is non-decreasing. And since the values are only 1 and 2, the entire subsequence must be 1's and then 2's.\n\n   Therefore, we can choose a cut point: we take some 1's and then some 2's. The maximum we can get is the maximum over all cut points of (number of 1's up to that point) + (number of 2's from that point to the end). But note: we are allowed to take non contiguous elements, so we can take all the 1's and then all the 2's that appear anywhere after the last 1? Actually, no: the condition is that the indices must be increasing. So we can take a 1 at index i and a 2 at index j only if i < j.\n\n   Therefore, the entire sequence can be broken by an index i: we take all the 1's from the entire sequence and all the 2's from the entire sequence? But wait, we cannot take a 2 that appears before a 1. So the correct way is:\n\n      Let B be the sequence. We can define:\n\n        Let S be the entire set of 1's and 2's.\n\n        We wish to choose a set of indices such that the sequence of chosen elements is non-decreasing.\n\n        We can choose all the 1's and then all the 2's that appear after the last chosen 1. However, we are not forced to choose contiguous elements.\n\n        Actually, the classical algorithm for longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary sequence is:\n\n          Let dp[i] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n          Then:\n            dp[i] = 1 (by itself)\n            if A[i] == 2, then we can extend any subsequence ending at j (j < i) that ends with 1 or 2? But note: non-decreasing: 1<=2, 2<=2, 1<=1, 2<=1 is false.\n\n          Actually, for a binary sequence, we can do:\n\n            Let dp1 = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with 1.\n            Let dp2 = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with 2.\n\n          But we can do better: we can precompute:\n\n            Let left1[i] = number of 1's from 0 to i.\n            Let left2[i] = number of 2's from 0 to i.\n\n            Let right1[i] = number of 1's from i to n-1.\n            Let right2[i] = number of 2's from i to n-1.\n\n          Then, the entire sequence's longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum over i (from 0 to n) of (left1[i] + right2[i])? \n\n          Why? Because we can take all the 1's that are at or before i and then all the 2's that are at or after i. But wait, that is not valid because the 1's at or before i and the 2's at or after i might not be in increasing order? Actually, we can take the 1's from the entire left part and the 2's from the entire right part, and that forms a non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n          However, note: the subsequence does not require contiguous elements, so we can take the 1's from the left part (anywhere) and the 2's from the right part (anywhere) and the condition is automatically satisfied because all 1's are <= all 2's.\n\n          But wait: what if we have a 2 in the left part and a 1 in the right part? Then we cannot use the 2 and then the 1. However, the above formula (left1[i] + right2[i]) does not consider mixing. Actually, the above formula considers taking the 1's from the left part (which includes the entire left part) and the 2's from the right part (entire right part). And that is valid because the 1's are all <= the 2's.\n\n          Also, we can also consider: the entire sequence might be taken as 1's (then the value is left1[n-1] = t1) or 2's (right2[0] = t2). But note: left1[i] + right2[i] for i from 0 to n-1 (and we set i to be a boundary) is:\n\n            For i=-1: left1[-1]=0, right2[-1]=t2 -> 0+t2 = t2.\n            For i=n: left1[n]=t1, right2[n]=0 -> t1.\n\n          And for a particular index i, we are counting the 1's from 0 to i (which are <= i) and the 2's from i to n-1 (which are >= i). But note: the 1's from 0 to i and the 2's from i to n-1: the last element of the 1's is at or before i, and the first element of the 2's is at or after i. So the entire subsequence is non-decreasing.\n\n          However, is that the maximum? Consider: we could also take a subsequence that is entirely in the left part (then it's just a bunch of 1's) or entirely in the right part (then it's a bunch of 2's). But note: the entire left part's 1's and the entire right part's 2's is one candidate. Also, we might be able to get more by taking a different split? \n\n          Actually, the above formula is known for the \"maximum non-decreasing subsequence\" in a binary sequence? \n\n          Example: [1,2,1,2] (n=4)\n\n          Without reversal, what is the LNS?\n            Using the above: \n              Let i=0: left1[0]=1, right2[0]=2 -> 3\n              i=1: left1[1]=2 (because at index0:1, index1:2 -> so 1's: one at index0, and then at index1:2 -> so left1[1]=1? Actually, we need to define:\n\n          How to compute left1[i]: the number of 1's from 0 to i.\n          left1[0] = 1 if A[0]==1 else 0 -> 1\n          left1[1] = 1 + (1 if A[1]==1 else 0) -> A[1]=2 -> 1\n          left1[2] = 1 + (1 if A[2]==1 else 0) -> 2\n          left1[3] = 2 + (1 if A[3]==1 else 0) -> 2\n\n          Similarly, right2[i]: the number of 2's from i to n-1.\n          right2[0] = 2 (because from index0 to 3: [1,2,1,2] -> two 2's)\n          right2[1] = 2 (from index1: [2,1,2] -> two 2's)\n          right2[2] = 1 (from index2: [1,2] -> one 2)\n          right2[3] = 1 (from index3: [2] -> one 2)\n\n          Then:\n            i=0: 1 + 2 = 3\n            i=1: 1 + 2 = 3\n            i=2: 2 + 1 = 3\n            i=3: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n          But the entire sequence has 4 elements. The answer for the example without reversal is 3? However, note that we can also take the entire sequence? [1,2,1,2] is not non-decreasing because the third element is 1 and the fourth is 2 -> wait, the entire sequence is not non-decreasing because we have a 1 after a 2 (at the third element). \n\n          Actually, the entire sequence [1,2,1,2] has a non-decreasing subsequence of length 3 (for example, [1,2,2] or [1,1,2]). \n\n          However, the example says that by reversing [2,3] (which is [2,1] -> becomes [1,2]) we get [1,1,2,2] -> LNS=4.\n\n          So without reversal, we can get 3, and with reversal we can get 4.\n\n          Therefore, we must consider the reversal.\n\n How to incorporate reversal?\n\n We are allowed to reverse one contiguous interval. We wish to maximize the result of the above formula (or a variant) for the entire sequence after reversal.\n\n Note: The reversal operation changes the arrangement of 1's and 2's in the interval. However, the multiset of 1's and 2's in the entire sequence is fixed.\n\n The key: the reversal operation can change the boundaries of the runs. We wish to maximize the maximum value of (left1[i] + right2[i]) for i from -1 to n.\n\n But note: after reversal, the entire sequence is fixed, and we can compute left1 and right2 for the entire sequence.\n\n However, we are allowed to choose any contiguous interval to reverse. So we need to consider the effect of reversing an interval [l, r] on the entire sequence.\n\n Let F(sequence) = max_{i from -1 to n} (left1[i] + right2[i])\n\n How does reversing [l, r] affect the sequence? \n\n   It changes the segment from l to r. In that segment, the counts of 1's and 2's remain the same, but the order is reversed.\n\n   We can break the sequence into three parts:\n\n        [0, l-1], [l, r], [r+1, n-1]\n\n   After reversal, the middle part becomes reversed.\n\n   Then, the entire sequence is:\n\n        Part1: [0, l-1] (unchanged)\n        Part2: reversed([l, r])\n        Part3: [r+1, n-1] (unchanged)\n\n   Then, we need to recompute left1 and right2 for the entire sequence.\n\n   But note: the reversal changes the order of Part2. How does that affect left1 and right2?\n\n   Specifically, the left1 for indices beyond the reversal will change if the reversal introduces more 1's in the left part? Actually, the reversal might move 1's and 2's to the left or right.\n\n   We need an efficient way. n is up to 2000, so we can try O(n^2) or even O(n^3) but we should aim for better.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   We wish to maximize the value of F(sequence) = max_{i} (left1[i] + right2[i])\n\n   Note: left1[i] + right2[i] is the total number of 1's from start to i plus the total number of 2's from i to the end.\n\n   But note: the entire sequence has t1 ones and t2 twos, so left1[i] + right2[i] = (number of 1's from 0 to i) + (number of 2's from i to n-1) = (total_ones - (number of 1's from i+1 to n-1)) + (number of 2's from i to n-1) ?\n\n   Actually, we can write:\n\n        left1[i] = (# of 1's in [0, i])\n        right2[i] = (# of 2's in [i, n-1])\n\n        Then, left1[i] + right2[i] = (# of 1's in [0,i]) + (# of 2's in [i, n-1])\n\n        And note that the entire sequence has t1+t2 = n.\n\n        Also, the entire sequence has t1 ones and t2 twos.\n\n        We can also note that the entire sequence has:\n\n          (# of 1's in [0,i]) + (# of 1's in [i+1, n-1]) = t1\n          => (# of 1's in [i+1, n-1]) = t1 - left1[i]\n\n        Then, the total of left1[i] + right2[i] = left1[i] + ( (# of 2's in [i, n-1]) ) \n        But note: the segment [i, n-1] has (# of 2's in [i, n-1]) = (n - i) - (# of 1's in [i, n-1]) \n        But wait, we don't know the ones in [i, n-1] directly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can express:\n\n        left1[i] + right2[i] = (# of 1's in [0,i]) + (# of 2's in [i, n-1])\n\n        = (# of 1's in [0,i]) + ( (# of 2's in [0, i]) - (# of 2's in [0, i-1])? ) -> Not helpful.\n\n   Another view: \n\n        The entire sequence has t1 ones and t2 twos.\n\n        Then, the entire sequence can be broken at i, and the value is:\n\n          left1[i] + right2[i] = (# of 1's from 0 to i) + (# of 2's from i to n-1)\n\n        = (ones in [0,i]) + (twos in [i, n-1])\n\n        And note that the part [0,i] and [i, n-1] overlap at i.\n\n        But we can also note that the entire sequence has:\n\n          ones in [0,i] + ones in [i+1, n-1] = t1\n          twos in [0,i] + twos in [i+1, n-1] = t2\n\n        And the part [i, n-1] has ones and twos: \n          ones in [i, n-1] = ones in [i, i] + ones in [i+1, n-1] = (1 if A[i]==1 else 0) + ones_in_remaining\n\n        But I don't think that helps.\n\n   Let me try with the example [1,2,1,2] and reversal of [1,2] (0-indexed [1,2]):\n\n        Original: [1,2,1,2] -> t1=2, t2=2.\n\n        Without reversal, the maximum of left1[i]+right2[i] is 3.\n\n        After reversal: [1,1,2,2] -> \n            left1[0]=1, right2[0]=2 -> 3\n            left1[1]=2, right2[1]=2 -> 4\n            left1[2]=2, right2[2]=1 -> 3\n            left1[3]=2, right2[3]=0 -> 2\n\n        Maximum is 4.\n\n   How does the reversal change the formula?\n\n        In the reversed segment [1,2] (which is [2,1] becomes [1,2]), we changed the counts at each position.\n\n        In the original segment [1,2] (index1 and index2): \n            Original: [2,1] -> left1[1] = 1 (because at index0:1, index1:2 -> so only one 1 in [0,1]), left1[2] = 2 (because at index2:1) -> but wait, the original sequence:\n\n            index0:1 -> left1[0]=1\n            index1:2 -> left1[1]=1\n            index2:1 -> left1[2]=2\n            index3:2 -> left1[3]=2\n\n            right2 for the original:\n                right2[0] = 2 (indices0-3: two 2's)\n                right2[1] = 2 (indices1-3: two 2's)\n                right2[2] = 1 (indices2-3: one 2)\n                right2[3] = 1 (index3: one 2)\n\n        After reversal, the segment [1,2] becomes [1,2] (so the same as the original segment?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. The key observation here is that the LNDS in such a sequence is determined by the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s, as 1s are always less than or equal to 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The LNDS can be:\n   - All the 1s in the sequence.\n   - All the 2s in the sequence.\n   - A combination of some 1s followed by some 2s, where the 1s come before the 2s in the sequence.\n   \n2. **Insight**: The maximum LNDS is the maximum value of `(number of 1s from the start to index i) + (number of 2s from index i to the end)` for any index `i` in the sequence. This is because all 1s before `i` and all 2s after `i` form a non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: For each position `i` in the sequence, compute:\n     - `prefix_ones[i]`: Number of 1s from the start up to index `i`.\n     - `suffix_twos[i]`: Number of 2s from index `i` to the end.\n   - **Evaluate All Possible Reversals**: For every possible contiguous subarray reversal, update the prefix and suffix arrays and compute the maximum LNDS value. However, directly checking all possible reversals would be too slow for large sequences (O(n^3)).\n\n4. **Optimization**: Instead of checking all possible reversals, we note that reversing a subarray affects only the counts of 1s and 2s within that subarray. We can precompute the effect of reversing any subarray by maintaining:\n   - `left_count[i]`: Number of 1s in the left part (from start to `i-1`).\n   - `mid_count[i][j]`: Number of 1s and 2s in the subarray from `i` to `j`.\n   - `right_count[i]`: Number of 2s in the right part (from `i+1` to end).\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves O(n^2) preprocessing to compute the mid counts, and then O(n) checks for each possible reversal, leading to an overall complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(1 for x in arr if x == 1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    prefix_ones = [0] * n\n    suffix_twos = [0] * n\n    \n    if n > 0:\n        prefix_ones[0] = 1 if arr[0] == 1 else 0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n            \n        suffix_twos[n-1] = 1 if arr[n-1] == 2 else 0\n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if arr[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    def get_ans_for_arr(B):\n        n_new = len(B)\n        if n_new == 0:\n            return 0\n        prefix_ones_new = [0] * n_new\n        suffix_twos_new = [0] * n_new\n        \n        prefix_ones_new[0] = 1 if B[0] == 1 else 0\n        for i in range(1, n_new):\n            prefix_ones_new[i] = prefix_ones_new[i-1] + (1 if B[i] == 1 else 0)\n            \n        suffix_twos_new[n_new-1] = 1 if B[n_new-1] == 2 else 0\n        for i in range(n_new-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_twos_new[i] = suffix_twos_new[i+1] + (1 if B[i] == 2 else 0)\n        \n        best = 0\n        for i in range(-1, n_new):\n            if i == -1:\n                ones_here = 0\n                twos_here = suffix_twos_new[0]\n            elif i == n_new:\n                ones_here = prefix_ones_new[n_new-1] if n_new > 0 else 0\n                twos_here = 0\n            else:\n                ones_here = prefix_ones_new[i]\n                twos_here = suffix_twos_new[i]\n            current = ones_here + twos_here\n            if current > best:\n                best = current\n        return best\n\n    best_ans = max(total_ones, total_twos)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            B = arr[:i] + arr[i:j+1][::-1] + arr[j+1:]\n            ans_val = get_ans_for_arr(B)\n            if ans_val > best_ans:\n                best_ans = ans_val\n\n    print(best_ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: The `prefix_ones` array stores the cumulative count of 1s from the start up to each index, while the `suffix_twos` array stores the cumulative count of 2s from each index to the end.\n2. **Reversal Check**: For each possible contiguous subarray reversal, the code constructs the modified array and recomputes the prefix and suffix arrays for this new array.\n3. **Maximization**: The maximum LNDS value is determined by evaluating all possible reversed subarrays. The result is the highest value obtained from these evaluations, which could be either all 1s, all 2s, or a combination of 1s followed by 2s.\n4. **Efficiency**: By leveraging prefix and suffix sums, the solution efficiently checks all possible single reversal operations in O(n^2) time, making it suitable for the problem constraints.",
