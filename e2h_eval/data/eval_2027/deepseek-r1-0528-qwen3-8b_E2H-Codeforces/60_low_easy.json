Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S.\n\n Observation: \n Each Morse code string is composed of 1 to 4 characters (each being '0' or '1'). There are 30 possible strings of length 1 to 4, but 4 of them are invalid. So total valid Morse codes are 26.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire string to be broken down into distinct letters? Actually, we are counting all non-empty sequences of English letters. But note: a sequence of English letters is just a concatenation of one or more letters.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\" that are represented by some substring of S. \n\n Important: A substring of S (which is built by appending m characters) might represent multiple letters if it is longer than 4? Actually, each letter is represented by at most 4 bits. However, the substring might be longer than 4, but then we break it into consecutive letters? Or note: the problem does not say that the Morse code representation must be contiguous without breaking. However, the example does not break the string arbitrarily.\n\n Let's read the example: \n   S = \"111\" -> substrings that are valid: \n        \"1\" -> T\n        \"11\" -> M (but also note: two T's would be \"11\", which is same as M. However, the problem counts sequences: so \"TT\" is a sequence of two T's, and \"TM\" is a sequence of T then M, etc.)\n\n But note: the example lists:\n      \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n How do we count?\n We have to consider every substring of S, and for each substring, we try to break it into segments (each segment being a valid Morse code string, i.e., length between 1 and 4) such that the entire substring is partitioned into these segments.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"represented with some substring\", meaning that the substring should be exactly the Morse code for one or more letters. But the Morse code for multiple letters is just the concatenation of their individual codes.\n\n Therefore, we are to count the distinct sequences (i.e., the distinct words in the Morse code alphabet) that appear as a substring of S? But note: the same Morse code word (sequence of letters) might appear in multiple ways (overlapping substrings). However, the problem does not specify distinct sequences. It says \"the number of non-empty sequences\", but note: the example counts:\n\n   \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n However, note that \"TT\" is the same as \"11\", which is also the representation for \"M\". But wait, the example says:\n   \"T\" (from \"1\")\n   \"M\" (from \"11\")\n   \"O\" (from \"111\")\n   \"TT\" (from \"11\") -> but wait, \"11\" is the same as \"M\", so how is \"TT\" different from \"M\"? \n\n Actually, the problem does not say distinct sequences. It says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\n\n But note: the example output for the first sample is 7. And the example lists 7 sequences. However, if we break down:\n\n   Substrings of \"111\":\n     - \"1\": corresponds to T -> one sequence: [T]\n     - \"11\": corresponds to M, but also can be broken as [T, T] (since \"1\" and \"1\" again). So two different sequences: [M] and [T,T]? But wait, the example lists both \"TT\" and \"M\". Are these considered different?\n\n However, note: the example output is 7, and the list includes:\n   \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n So they are counting the sequences (words) of letters. The word \"M\" is one letter, and the word \"TT\" is two letters. They are different words.\n\n But wait: the Morse code for the letter T is \"1\", and for M is \"11\". So the substring \"11\" can be interpreted as either:\n   - one letter: M\n   - two letters: T and T\n\n Similarly, \"111\" can be:\n   - three T's: \"TTT\"\n   - one M and one T: \"MT\" (if we break after the first two: \"11\" and then \"1\")\n   - one T and one M: \"TM\" (if we break after the first one: \"1\"",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a given string S, which is built incrementally by appending '0's or '1's. Each English letter is represented by a Morse code string of length 1 to 4, composed of '0's (dots) and '1's (dashes). The solution involves efficiently tracking valid sequences as the string S grows with each new character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that any valid sequence of English letters must be represented by a substring of S that can be broken down into segments of lengths 1 to 4, where each segment corresponds to a valid Morse code for an English letter. The invalid Morse code strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string S. Additionally, we maintain a set or list of valid Morse codes (excluding the four invalid strings).\n\n3. **Sliding Window and Bitmasking**: For each new character added to S, we check all possible substrings ending at the current position. These substrings must be of length 1 to 4. For each substring, we verify if it is a valid Morse code. If it is, we update our DP array by considering the sequences formed by this substring and previous valid sequences.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently checks all possible valid substrings up to length 4 for each new character, leveraging dynamic programming to avoid recomputation. The solution processes each character in O(m) time per character, where m is the total number of characters, making the overall complexity O(m^2), which is feasible given the constraint m ≤ 3000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    s_str = ''.join(s_list)\n    \n    valid_codes = set()\n    for l in range(1, 5):\n        total = 1 << l\n        for j in range(total):\n            bin_str = bin(j)[2:].zfill(l)\n            if bin_str not in {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}:\n                valid_codes.add(bin_str)\n    \n    n = len(s_str)\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    ans = [0] * (n + 1)\n    seen = set()\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        start = max(0, i - 4)\n        substr = s_str[start:i+1]\n        if substr in seen:\n            continue\n        seen.add(substr)\n        \n        if len(substr) == 1 and substr in valid_codes:\n            dp[i+1] += 1\n        elif len(substr) == 2 and substr in valid_codes:\n            dp[i+1] += 1\n        elif len(substr) == 3 and substr in valid_codes:\n            dp[i+1] += 1\n        elif len(substr) == 4 and substr in valid_codes:\n            dp[i+1] += 1\n        \n        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n            if i - j > 4:\n                break\n            substr_prev = s_str[j:i+1]\n            if substr_prev in seen:\n                continue\n            seen.add(substr_prev)\n            if len(substr_prev) <= 4 and len(substr_prev) >= 1:\n                if substr_prev in valid_codes:\n                    dp[i+1] += dp[j]\n            else:\n                pass\n        \n        total_ans = 0\n        for j in range(1, i+2):\n            total_ans = (total_ans + dp[j]) % MOD\n        ans[i+1] = total_ans\n    \n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        print(ans[i])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values, initializes the valid Morse code strings, and sets up arrays for dynamic programming (`dp`) and answers (`ans`).\n\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each character in the string S, the code checks all possible substrings ending at the current position, with lengths from 1 to 4. It verifies if these substrings are valid Morse codes.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each valid substring, the DP array is updated to reflect the number of new sequences ending at the current position. This involves checking all valid prefixes of the current substring.\n\n4. **Answer Calculation**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences up to that point is computed by summing the DP array values, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n5. **Output**: The results after each modification (appending each character) are printed sequentially.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
