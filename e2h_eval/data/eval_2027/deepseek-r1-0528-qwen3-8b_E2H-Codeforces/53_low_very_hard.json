Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length <= 100, so we can use a simpler approach.\n The idea is to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates. However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can try to check for each possible substring length (from the maximum possible down) whether there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. If the string length is n, then the maximum possible duplicate substring length is floor(n/2) but actually we can have duplicates even when overlapping, so we consider from n-1 down to 1 (but note: if we find one duplicate at length L, then we can output L and stop? Actually, we want the longest, so we should check from the maximum possible (which is n//2? Actually, no: the maximum duplicate substring cannot be longer than the entire string, but note: two occurrences must be distinct. However, they can overlap. So the maximum length of a substring that appears twice could be as long as n - k (if we have two non-overlapping ones) but actually we can have two overlapping ones: e.g., \"aaa\" has duplicate substring \"aa\" (at positions 0 and 1) and \"a\" (at multiple positions). But the problem says: the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n However, note: the entire string might not appear twice. In fact, the maximum length of a substring that appears twice is at most floor((n+1)/2) ??? Let me think: \n Example: \"ababa\": \n   substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2 -> so length 3.\n\n Actually, we can consider: if we have two occurrences of a substring of length L, then the two occurrences must start at indices i and j (i < j) and we require that the substring starting at i of length L equals the substring starting at j of length L.\n\n The condition for overlapping: the second occurrence can start at j = i + k, where k from 1 to L (so that they overlap). But note: the substring must be contiguous.\n\n Since the string is small (<=100), we can do:\n\n Approach:\n  - We'll consider all possible substring lengths from the maximum (which is n) down to 1.\n  - For a given length L, we'll collect all distinct substrings of length L and check if any count >=2.\n  - But note: the problem does not require non-overlapping. So two occurrences can be overlapping.\n\n However, note: if we have a substring of length L, then we can have multiple occurrences. We just need at least two.\n\n But wait: what is the maximum L? It cannot exceed the length of the string. However, if we take a substring of length L, then we need at least two starting indices i and j (with i<j) such that the substring from i to i+L-1 equals the substring from j to j+L-1.\n\n However, note: if the string is \"aaa\", then:\n   n=3, maximum L for which there is a duplicate is 2 (because \"aa\" appears at [0:2] and [1:3]). \n   But also, for L=1, \"a\" appears three times.\n\n But we want the longest. So we start from the largest possible L (which is n) and go down until we find an L for which there's at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n However, for L = n, the entire string appears only once (unless the string is repeated, but then it would be of length 2*n, but our string is of length n). So we skip L=n because we cannot have two non-overlapping (or even overlapping) occurrences of the entire string? Actually, for overlapping: the two occurrences must be the same contiguous substring. For example, in \"aaa\", the entire string \"aaa\" is only at index0. But if we have \"aaaa\", then the entire string \"aaaa\" appears only once. However, note: the substring \"aaa\" (length=3) appears twice: at index0 and index1.\n\n Actually, the maximum L for which a substring appears twice is at most n-1. Why? Because to have two occurrences of a substring of length L, the two occurrences must start at two different indices. The first occurrence occupies L characters, the second occurrence must start at an index at least 1 (so that they can overlap) and the last character of the first occurrence must be at index i+L-1, and the second occurrence goes from j to j+L-1. The condition is that j must be in [i+1, i+L] (so that they overlap or are adjacent).",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which adds a layer of complexity but also allows for longer substrings to be considered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string that appears at least twice. The key observation here is that the two occurrences can overlap, meaning they can share some characters. For example, in the string \"ababa\", the substring \"aba\" appears twice starting at positions 0 and 2.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each length, we check if any substring of that length appears at least twice. The first length (from the largest) where this condition is met is our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints (string length ≤ 100), a straightforward approach is feasible. We iterate over all possible substring lengths from the string length down to 1. For each length, we generate all unique substrings of that length and check their frequencies. If any substring appears more than once, the current length is our answer.\n4. **Optimization**: By processing substring lengths in descending order, we can immediately return the largest valid length upon finding it, thus optimizing the solution by avoiding unnecessary checks for smaller lengths once the largest valid length is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n <= 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace. The length of the string is stored in `n`.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string length is 1 or less, the output is 0 since no substring can appear twice.\n3. **Substring Length Check**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. For each length `L`, it generates all substrings of length `L` in the string.\n4. **Frequency Tracking**: Using a dictionary, it tracks each substring encountered. If a substring is seen more than once, its length `L` is printed as the result, and the program exits.\n5. **Result Output**: If no duplicate substring is found for any length, the program outputs 0 after checking all possible lengths.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging the constraint that the string length is manageable (≤100), ensuring optimal performance without excessive computational overhead.",
