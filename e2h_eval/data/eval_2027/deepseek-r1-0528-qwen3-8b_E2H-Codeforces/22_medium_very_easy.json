After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the first line with two integers n and m, then n lines each containing a string of m characters (digits from '1' to '9')\n We have to count the number of successful students. A student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., no one has a higher mark in that subject).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines (each line is a string of m digits).\n 3. We can represent the gradebook as a list of strings (each string is a row for a student).\n\n How to determine if a student is the best in a subject?\n For a fixed subject j, let the marks be [mark1, mark2, ..., markn] (from the j-th character of each string).\n The best mark for subject j is the maximum in that column.\n\n Then, for subject j, every student who has the mark equal to the maximum in that subject is a candidate for being the best in subject j.\n\n However, note: a student might be best in multiple subjects. We only need one subject where he is best to be successful.\n\n Approach:\n We can do the following:\n\n Option 1:\n For each student i, check for each subject j: \n   If student i's mark in subject j is the maximum in subject j, then we can mark this student as having at least one best subject.\n\n But note: if we do this naively, we have to check for each student and each subject the maximum of the entire column. We can precompute the maximums for each subject.\n\n Steps:\n  - Precompute for each subject j (column) the maximum mark (which is a char from '1' to '9'). Since the marks are digits, we can convert to int or compare as characters (because '9' > '1').\n\n However, note: the input gives the marks as characters, and the maximum of characters in the same subject (converted to int or not?) but actually, the characters are from '1' to '9', so we can compare them as characters because the ASCII value increases with the digit.\n\n Alternatively, we can convert each character to an integer for the calculation, but then we have to compare integers.\n\n Let me do:\n\n Let gradebook = list of strings (each string length m)\n Let max_marks = [] # for each subject j, the maximum mark (as char) in that subject.\n\n But wait: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9. So the maximum in a subject is the highest digit.\n\n However, we can also do without converting to int by comparing the characters.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   We can compute for each column j the maximum character.\n\n   Then, for each student i and each subject j, check if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]. If yes, then student i is best in subject j.\n\n   Then, we can mark student i as successful if for any subject j, the condition holds.\n\n But note: we have to avoid double-counting? Actually, we just need to know if at least one exists.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and m.\n  Step 2: Read the n lines.\n\n  Step 3: For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum mark in that column.\n\n        max_marks[j] = max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n  Step 4: For each student i (from 0 to n-1), check for any subject j (from 0 to m-1) if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j].\n\n        If such a j exists, then student i is successful.\n\n  Step 5: Count the number of successful students.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a string that includes the first line and then the rows. But the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n But wait, the actual input will come from stdin. We don't know how many test cases? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\n\n This implies that there is one test case per run.\n\n But note: the example input is given as two separate examples. However, the problem statement says:\n\n        Input\n        The first input line contains two integers n and m ... \n\n So we read one test case.\n\n However, the example output is two numbers, but the problem says \"Print the single number\", meaning one test case at a time.\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as a list of two strings. That might be because the problem's example input was given as two separate examples. In competitive programming, typically we read one test case per run.\n\n But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two examples. This means that the program should handle one test case.\n\n However, the sample input format in the example is two strings, but actually the input is from stdin.\n\n Let me assume the input is given as:\n\n        First line: \"3 3\"\n        Next three lines: \"223\", \"232\", \"112\"\n\n But the example input is given as a string that includes the whole thing. So if we run the program, we will get:\n\n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Output: 2\n\n        And for the second example:\n\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n However, the problem does not specify multiple test cases. We are to read from stdin and output the answer.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Read the first line to get n and m.\n\n  Then, read the next n lines.\n\n  But note: the first line has two integers, so we split the first line.\n\n  Then, we have n lines, each of length m.\n\n  Then, we do:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      gradebook = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          gradebook.append(s)\n\n  Then, we can proceed.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, and they are given as characters (without spaces). So the string we read for each student is exactly m characters long.\n\n  Then, for each subject j (column index), we want to get the maximum character in that column.\n\n      max_marks = [max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n  Then, for each student i, we check:\n\n      successful = False\n      for j in range(m):\n          if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n              successful = True\n              break\n\n      Then, count this student if successful.\n\n  But note: we can use a list comprehension or a generator to count directly.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      count = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(m):\n              if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                  count += 1\n                  break   # no need to check other subjects for this student\n\n  However, note: we break out of the inner loop once we found one subject j where the student is best.\n\n  But wait: what if the student is best in multiple subjects? We still only count him once.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Let's test with the first example:\n\n      gradebook = [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]\n\n      Compute max_marks for each column:\n\n          Column0: ['2','2','1'] -> '2'\n          Column1: ['2','3','1'] -> '3'\n          Column2: ['3','2','2'] -> '3'\n\n      Now, check each student:\n\n        Student0: \"223\"\n          j0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful, count=1.\n\n        Student1: \"232\"\n          j0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful, count=2.\n\n        Student2: \"112\"\n          j0: '1' != '2' -> skip.\n          j1: '1' != '3' -> skip.\n          j2: '2' != '3' -> skip. -> not successful.\n\n      So total count is 2.\n\n  Second example:\n\n        Input: \n          3 5\n          91728\n          11828\n          11111\n\n        gradebook = [\"91728\", \"11828\", \"11111\"]\n\n        Compute max_marks for each column:\n\n          Column0: ['9','1','1'] -> '9'\n          Column1: ['1','1','1'] -> '1'\n          Column2: ['7','8','1'] -> '8'\n          Column3: ['2','2','1'] -> '2'\n          Column4: ['8','8','1'] -> '8'\n\n        Now, check each student:\n\n          Student0: \"91728\"\n            j0: '9' == '9' -> True -> successful.\n\n          Student1: \"11828\"\n            j0: '1' != '9' -> no.\n            j1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n          Student2: \"11111\"\n            j0: '1' != '9' -> no.\n            j1: '1' == '1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        So all three are successful.\n\n  Therefore, output is 3.\n\n  Code:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      gradebook = []\n      for _ in range(n):\n          gradebook.append(input().strip())\n\n      # If there are no students, then we return 0.\n      if n == 0:\n          print(0)\n          exit(0)\n\n      # Precompute the maximum for each subject (column)\n      max_marks = []\n      for j in range(m):\n          col_max = '0'  # start with something lower than '1'\n          for i in range(n):\n              if gradebook[i][j] > col_max:\n                  col_max = gradebook[i][j]\n          max_marks.append(col_max)\n\n      # Alternatively, we can use list comprehensions to compute max for each column.\n\n      # Now, count the successful students.\n      count = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          successful = False\n          for j in range(m):\n              if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                  successful = True\n                  break\n          if successful:\n              count += 1\n\n      print(count)\n\n  Let me write it more concisely:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      gradebook = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n      # Precompute max_marks for each column\n      max_marks = [max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n      # Then, for each student i, check if any column j has gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n      count = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(m):\n              if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                  count += 1\n                  break\n\n      print(count)\n\n  However, wait: the above list comprehension for max_marks uses the fact that the max function over a list of characters (strings) works because we are comparing characters. Since the marks are digits from '1' to '9', the lexicographical order is the same as numerical.\n\n  But note: the max function on a list of one-character strings will work because the character '9' is greater than '1'. This is safe.\n\n  Let me test with the example:\n\n      max_marks[0] = max(['2','2','1']) -> '2'\n      max_marks[1] = max(['2','3','1']) -> '3'\n      max_marks[2] = max(['3','2','2']) -> '3'\n\n  Correct.\n\n  But wait, the second example:\n\n      max_marks[0] = max(['9','1','1']) -> '9'\n      max_marks[1] = max(['1','1','1']) -> '1'\n      max_marks[2] = max(['7','8','1']) -> '8'\n      max_marks[3] = max(['2','2','1']) -> '2'\n      max_marks[4] = max(['8','8','1']) -> '8'\n\n  Correct.\n\n  However, note: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n  But our code reads from stdin. So we are reading the first line and then the next n lines.\n\n  But wait, the input is provided as two separate test cases in the example? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input\n        The first input line contains two integers n and m ...\n\n  So the example input is two separate runs.\n\n  But the problem says \"Print the single number\", so we are printing one number per run.\n\n  However, the sample input provided in the example is two separate examples. Our code must work for one test case.\n\n  But note: the problem constraints say n, m between 1 and 100, so we are safe.\n\n  Let's run the code with the first sample input:\n\n      Input: \n          3 3\n          223\n          232\n          112\n\n      Output: 2\n\n  And the second sample input:\n\n      Input:\n          3 5\n          91728\n          11828\n          11111\n\n      Output: 3\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, note: there might be a possibility that the input has leading/trailing spaces? The problem says \"Next n lines each containing m characters\". We use strip() to remove any extraneous whitespace. But the problem says the marks are given without spaces.\n\n  Alternatively, we can read without stripping, because the input is exactly m characters per line.\n\n  But the problem says: \"each containing m characters\", so we assume each line has exactly m characters.\n\n  However, to be safe, we can use:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n  But if the input has spaces, then the length of s might be m+some spaces. But the problem says the marks are given without spaces.\n\n  Let me stick to the problem statement: the marks are given without spaces. So we can read the line and take the first m characters? Or we assume the input is formatted correctly.\n\n  Since n and m are given, and then n lines of m characters, we can rely on that.\n\n  But if we use input().strip(), then if the input line has trailing newline, we remove it. But the marks are exactly m characters, so we can do:\n\n      s = input().strip()[:m]   # but if the input has less than m, then we get error. The problem says each line has m characters.\n\n  Actually, the problem says \"each containing m characters\", so we can simply read the entire line and then take the first m characters? Or trust the input.\n\n  But the problem says: \"each containing m characters\", so we can read the entire line and it should be exactly m characters (without spaces). However, the input might have been given with spaces by mistake? The problem does not specify.\n\n  Since the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9 and the row has m characters, we can assume that the input line has exactly m characters (if there are extra spaces, then the problem is broken). But to be safe, we can use:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      if len(s) > m:\n          s = s[:m]\n      else:\n          # if less, then we need to pad? but the problem says m characters, so we assume we have at least m?\n          # Actually, the problem says \"each containing m characters\", so we assume the input has m characters.\n\n  But the constraints say n, m from 1 to 100, so we can also read the line and take the first m characters.\n\n  Alternatively, we can read the entire line and then take the first m characters.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"each containing m characters\", meaning the input provides m characters. But if the input provides more, we take the first m.\n\n  But the example input does not have spaces.\n\n  I'll change the reading part to:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      gradebook = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          s = input().strip()\n          # It's possible that the input line has more than m characters? According to the problem, no.\n          # But to be safe, we take the first m characters if available.\n          if len(s) > m:\n              s = s[:m]\n          else:\n              # If there are fewer, then we cannot form a row of m. But the problem says m characters, so we assume we have enough.\n              # We can pad with zeros or something? But the problem says m characters, so we break.\n              # However, the problem states the input format, so we assume the input is correct.\n              pass\n          gradebook.append(s)\n\n  But the problem says the input is correct, so we don't need to worry.\n\n  Alternatively, we can simply read the entire line and use the first m characters.\n\n  Let me stick to:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      gradebook = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n  Because the problem says the input is correct.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      n, m = map(int, input().split())\n      gradebook = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n      # Precompute the maximum for each subject (column)\n      max_marks = [max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n      # Count successful students\n      count = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(m):\n              if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                  count += 1\n                  break\n\n      print(count)\n\n  However, wait: the above list comprehension for max_marks uses the same j for each i. That is correct.\n\n  But note: the list comprehension for max_marks is:\n\n        [max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n  This is equivalent to:\n\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: \n          3 3\n          223\n          232\n          112\n\n      Output: 2\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input:\n          3 5\n          91728\n          11828\n          11111\n\n      Output: 3\n\n  So we are good.\n\n  But wait: what if there is only one student? Then n=1, m=1, and the gradebook is one string of length 1.\n\n      n=1, m=1\n      gradebook = ['5']   (for example)\n\n      max_marks = [max(['5'])] = ['5']\n\n      Then for the only student: \n          j=0: '5' == '5' -> True, so count=1.\n\n  Another edge: n=1, m=0? But m>=1 per constraints.\n\n  Constraints: n, m from 1 to 100.\n\n  So we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n  Code is ready.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, but the input is given as characters. We are comparing characters. Since the marks are single-digit, the character comparison is the same as integer comparison.\n\n  Example: '9' > '5' is True, and also in integer: 9>5 is True.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  Let me submit the code.\n\n  Note: There is an alternative way: we can for each student, check if there exists a column j such that the student's mark is the maximum in that column. But we already did that.\n\n  One more edge: if two students have the same maximum mark in a subject, then both are best in that subject? \n\n  The problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\"\n\n  So if two students have the same maximum mark, then there is no student with a higher mark, so both are best in that subject.\n\n  However, note: we are counting a student as successful if he is best in at least one subject. So if two students are best in the same subject, then both will be counted (if they are best in that subject and maybe others). \n\n  Example: \n        n=2, m=1\n        gradebook = [\"2\", \"2\"]\n\n        Then, for subject0: max_marks[0] = '2'\n        Student0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n        Student1: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n\n        So output is 2.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But note: the problem does not require to assign the best subject uniquely.\n\n  So our method is correct.\n\n  Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of each student in all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student in that subject.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, count them as successful.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total count of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        gradebook.append(s)\n    \n    max_marks = [max(gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n    \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                count += 1\n                break\n                \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code calculates the highest mark by comparing all students' marks in that subject. This is stored in a list `max_marks`.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful, and the loop moves to the next student.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple loops and comparisons for clarity and correctness.",
