There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^18) and we need to compute the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n The tournament is single elimination (knockout). The rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one has played differs by no more than one from the other.\n\n We are to assume that the audience wants to know the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner must win log2(n) games (if n is a power of two). However, the problem allows for a grid that might not be perfectly balanced? But note the constraint on the grid: two players can only play if they have played almost the same number of games.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input 2 -> Output 1\n   Input 3 -> Output 2\n   Input 4 -> Output 2\n\n Why for n=3 the answer is 2? Because the winner plays 2 games. But wait, in a standard tournament with 3 players, one of them gets a bye. Then the winner would have to win one game and then if he wins the next, that would be two? Actually, the problem states:\n\n \"two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\"\n\n And the winner must have beaten everyone.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n For n=2: one game. Winner plays 1 game.\n\n For n=3: \n   We have three players. One common way is to have two players play first, then the winner plays the third.\n   But then the winner of the second game (the one who beat the third) has played 2 games, while the winner of the first game (who didn't play the third) has played 1 game. However, the condition must hold for every match.\n\n Alternatively, we can arrange as: \n   First, match between player2 and player3. Then the winner (say player2) plays player1.\n\n   Now, when player1 (with 0 games) plays player2 (with 1 game): |0-1| <= 1 -> allowed.\n\n   So the winner (player1) has played 1 game? But wait, then the total wins for the winner is 1? But the example output for n=3 is 2.\n\n Wait, let me read the example again: \"In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3.\" \n So the winner (player1) beats two players. How?\n\n   Game1: player1 vs player2 -> player1 wins (now player1 has 1 win)\n   Game2: player1 vs player3 -> player1 wins (then player1 has 2 wins)\n\n But wait, can we do that? After the first game, player1 has 1 game, and then we want to play player3. The condition: |1 - 0| = 1 -> allowed. \n\n However, note that after the first game, the other players (player3) hasn't played any game. So the condition holds. Then the winner has 2 wins.\n\n But then why for n=4 the answer is 2? \n\n   Standard tournament: \n        Round1: two semifinals (each match: one win, so two winners)\n        Then the final: two wins for the winner.\n\n   So the winner should have 2 wins, which matches the example.\n\n   But wait, why is the answer for n=10 equal to 4?\n\n   Let me think: The winner must win k games. In a knockout tournament, the total number of games is n-1. But we are only concerned about the winner.\n\n   How many wins does the winner have? Exactly the number of rounds he wins. In a balanced tournament, the number of rounds is floor(log2(n)) + 1? Not exactly.\n\n   However, the constraint on the grid: two players can play if their number of games played differs by at most one.\n\n   This condition is similar to a heap structure or a tournament where the bracket is built by levels.\n\n   We can model the tournament as follows:\n\n   Let f(k) be the maximum number of players that can be arranged so that the winner (root) can have k wins, under the condition.\n\n   How do we build the tournament tree?\n\n   Condition: In order to have a match, the two players must have played almost the same number of games. This suggests that the tournament is built in rounds, but the rounds are defined by the number of wins (or games played). \n\n   We can consider that the winner will have k wins, so he must have played k games. Then the two opponents he faced in the last two games must have had k-1 wins. Then the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a single-elimination tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the constraint that any two players playing each other must have played almost the same number of games. This resembles a binary tree structure where each level represents a round in the tournament.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \\( n \\). The winner's maximum games correspond to the depth of this balanced binary tree. For numbers not fitting perfectly into a power of two, we adjust by considering the nearest lower power of two and then recursively determining the maximum games.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm uses a recursive approach to break down the problem. For a given \\( n \\), if \\( n \\) is a power of two, the answer is the exponent plus one (since the winner plays in all rounds). Otherwise, the problem is split into two parts: the largest power of two less than \\( n \\) and the remaining players, which are processed recursively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    def find_winner_games(n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return 0\n        if n == 2:\n            return 1\n        if n == 3:\n            return 2\n        exp_val = n.bit_length() - 1\n        total_players = (1 << exp_val)\n        if n == total_players:\n            return exp_val + 1\n        else:\n            return find_winner_games(total_players) + find_winner_games(n - total_players)\n    \n    result = find_winner_games(n)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Cases**: \n   - If \\( n \\) is 1, the winner hasn't played any games.\n   - If \\( n \\) is 2, the winner plays 1 game.\n   - If \\( n \\) is 3, the winner plays 2 games (as explained in the problem statement).\n2. **Recursive Case**: \n   - For \\( n > 3 \\), find the largest power of two less than \\( n \\) (using bit manipulation for efficiency).\n   - If \\( n \\) is exactly a power of two, the winner's games are the exponent of 2 plus one (since the winner plays in every round).\n   - If \\( n \\) is not a power of two, the problem splits into two subproblems: one for the largest power of two players and another for the remaining players. The solution combines these results recursively.\n3. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently handles very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)) using recursion with bit manipulation, ensuring logarithmic depth in the recursion stack. This approach leverages the properties of binary trees to model the tournament structure optimally.",
