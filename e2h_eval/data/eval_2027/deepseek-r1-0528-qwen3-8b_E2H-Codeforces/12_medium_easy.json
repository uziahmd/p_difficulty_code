The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are moving in a circular ring road (clockwise) with n houses.\n We start at house 1 and we have m tasks, each requiring to be at house a_i (the i-th task's house).\n Since the ringroad is circular and clockwise, we can only move clockwise. However, note that we can also consider the possibility of moving from a higher house to a lower one by going around the circle.\n\n But note: the problem says that initially Xenia is at house 1, and we must complete the tasks in order (i.e., for task i, we must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i). Also, the tasks list is given as a sequence of house numbers.\n\n Important observation: \n The ringroad is circular, so the distance from house x to house y (if we are moving clockwise) is:\n   If x <= y: then distance = y - x.\n   If x > y: then we go from x to n and then from n to 1 and then to y? Actually, wait: but we are moving clockwise and the houses are in a circle. Alternatively, we can think of the circle as having n houses, and the clockwise distance from x to y is:\n        (y - x) mod n, but if we do modulo arithmetic, we want the positive distance. Actually, we can define:\n\n However, note: we are allowed to pass through house n and then house 1. So the clockwise distance from x to y is:\n        If x <= y: d = y - x\n        If x > y: d = (n - x) + y\n\n But wait, let's check: \n   Example: n=4, from house 3 to house 2: \n        x=3, y=2 -> since 3>2, then d = (4-3) + 2 = 1+2 = 3. \n        Alternatively, we can compute: (2 - 3) % n doesn't work because negative modulo.\n\n Another way: total houses in circle, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but if negative we add n? Actually, we can do:\n        distance = (y - x) % n   [but this gives a value between 0 and n-1] but wait, if y-x is negative, then (y-x) % n will be y-x+n. However, we don't want to use modulo that way because we are counting steps.\n\n Actually, the problem says: moving from a house to a neighboring one takes one unit. So we can break down the movement:\n\n We can also note: since the ringroad is circular, we can consider the entire circle as a linear array of n houses, but the last step from n to 1 is just 1 step.\n\n Alternatively, we can flatten the circle: but note that we are starting at 1 and we have to complete tasks in order.\n\n However, note: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> output 6.\n\n Steps for the example:\n   Start at 1, then go to 3: \n        From 1 to 3: 2 steps (1->2->3)\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        Since 3>2, we do: 3->4 (1 step), 4->1 (1 step), 1->2 (1 step) -> total 3 steps for this segment? But wait, the example says the whole sequence is 1->2->3->4->1->2->3 (which is 6 steps).\n\n Let me break down the example:\n   Start at house 1.\n   Task 1: house 3 -> move from 1 to 3: 2 steps. Now time=2, at house 3.\n   Then from 3 to 2: \n        Option 1: go clockwise: 3->4 (1 step), 4->1 (1 step), 1->2 (1 step): total 3 steps. Then time=5, at house 2.\n   Then from 2 to 3: \n        From 2 to 3: 1 step. Then time=6, at house 3.\n\n So total time 6.\n\n But note: the problem says we must complete tasks in order, meaning that the second task requires being at house 2, and we must have completed the first task (so we were at house 3) before moving to house 2.\n\n However, there's a catch: we can also consider that sometimes it might be beneficial to complete the current task and then the next task by not going back the long way if the next task is the same house? Actually, the example has two consecutive tasks: the third task is again 3.\n\n But note: the second task is 2, and the third task is 3. So after completing the second task (at house 2), we need to go to house 3 for the third task.\n\n How about if we had tasks: [3, 3]? Then we would stay at 3 for both, so no additional travel.\n\n However, the problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", meaning that for the i-th task, we must have done the first i-1 tasks. But the i-th task itself requires being at house a_i.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can simulate the journey from the start (house 1) to the first task, then from the first task to the second, etc.\n\n But note: the constraints (n, m up to 10^5) so we cannot do an O(n) per task.\n\n We need to compute the total distance traveled. The total time is the sum of the distances from the current house to the next task's house.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require to output the path, only the total time.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let current = 1 (starting house)\n\n   Then for each task house a_i (in the list of m tasks):\n\n        Compute the clockwise distance from current to a_i.\n\n        Then update current to a_i.\n\n   The total time is the sum of these distances.\n\n But wait, how to compute the clockwise distance from x to y?\n\n   If we are at x and need to go to y (both between 1 and n):\n\n        If y >= x: distance = y - x\n        Else: distance = n - x + y   [because we go from x to n (n - x steps), then from n to 1 is 1 step? Actually, from n to 1 is 1 step, then from 1 to y is y steps? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n            total houses in the circle: n\n            The clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) % n, but if negative, we add n and then take modulo? Actually, we don't want modulo, we want the positive distance.\n\n        Actually, the clockwise distance from x to y is: \n            d = (y - x) % n\n            But if d is negative, then we adjust: d = (y - x + n) % n? But wait, we don't want modulo, because if y < x, then (y-x+n) is positive and we get the distance.\n\n        However, note: when we do (y-x+n) % n, we get a value between 0 and n-1, but if y==x, then 0. That is correct.\n\n        But wait: the example from 3 to 2: (2-3+4) % 4 = (-1+4)%4 = 3%4=3. That matches.\n\n        However, note: we don't want to use modulo because the distance is exactly (y-x+n) % n, but wait, what if y>=x? Then (y-x+n)%n = (y-x)%n, but if y>=x, then y-x is between 0 and n-1, so (y-x)%n = y-x. \n\n        But note: if we use (y-x+n) % n, then for y>=x, we are effectively adding n and then taking modulo, which is the same as y-x (because y-x < n). So we can write:\n\n            distance = (y - x + n) % n\n\n        However, wait: what if y==x? Then (x-x+n)%n = n%n=0, which is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says that we start at house 1 and the first task might be house 1. Then distance=0, which is correct.\n\n        However, the above formula gives the distance from x to y in the clockwise direction. But note: the problem does not require to return to the start necessarily, but the distance is defined as the minimal clockwise steps? Actually, the ringroad is one-way clockwise, so we have to go the clockwise way. There is no counter-clockwise.\n\n        Therefore, we must use the clockwise distance.\n\n        But note: the above formula (y-x+n) % n gives the clockwise distance. However, wait: if we are at house 3 and want to go to house 2, then (2-3+4)%4 = 3, which is the number of steps. Similarly, from 1 to 3: (3-1+4)%4 = 6%4=2, which is correct.\n\n        However, wait: (3-1)=2, and 2 mod 4 is 2, but without modulo we have 2. So we can write:\n\n            distance = (y - x) % n\n            but if the result is negative, then we add n and then take modulo? Actually, we don't need modulo because we want the positive distance. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            distance = (y - x) if y>=x else (n - (x - y))\n\n        Or more simply:\n\n            distance = (y - x + n) % n   # This works because if y>=x, then (y-x+n) % n = (y-x) % n, and if y<x, then (y-x+n) is positive and less than n (because y-x+n < n + n, but actually y>=1, x<=n, so y-x+n is between 1-n+n = 1 and n-1+n = 2n-1, but modulo n gives the correct value). However, modulo n of a positive number less than 2n is the number itself if less than n, or subtracting n if between n and 2n-1.\n\n        Actually, let's check: \n            If y < x, then y-x is negative, say y-x = -k (k>0), then (y-x+n) = n-k, and n-k is positive and less than n (because k>=1, so n-k <= n-1). Then modulo n leaves it as n-k.\n\n        But wait, that is the same as n - (x-y). \n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that moving from house 1 to house 3 (when n=4) is 2 steps, and (3-1+4)%4 = 6%4=2, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: the example from 3 to 2: (2-3+4)%4=3, and 3 is the number of steps.\n\n        However, note: the example from 3 to 2 is 3 steps: 3->4 (step1), 4->1 (step2), 1->2 (step3). So yes, 3 steps.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance for each segment as (a_i - current + n) % n, but wait, what if (a_i - current) is negative? The modulus operation in Python for positive n and negative numbers: \n            (a_i - current + n) % n   -> this is always positive and equals to (a_i - current) mod n, but we want the clockwise distance, which is the smallest nonnegative residue modulo n, but in our case, the clockwise distance is the smallest nonnegative number of steps to go from current to a_i in the clockwise direction.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives a value between 0 and n-1. But if we are at house 1 and want to go to house 1, then 0 steps. But if we are at house 1 and want to go to house 1, we don't move. However, if we are at house 1 and want to go to house n, then (n-1+n)%n = (2n-1)%n = n-1, which is correct because from 1 to n: 1->2->...->n: n-1 steps.\n\n        But wait, from 1 to n: \n            (n-1+n)%n = (2n-1) % n = n-1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation in Python for (a-b) % n is defined as (a-b) % n = (a-b) mod n (nonnegative). But our formula (a_i - current + n) % n is designed to avoid negative by adding n.\n\n        But wait: what if a_i - current is negative and we add n, then take modulo n, and the result is the same as (a_i - current) mod n, which is the same as the clockwise distance.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation is defined such that (x % n) is in the range [0, n-1]. Our distance must be the minimal positive steps to go from current to a_i in the clockwise direction, which is exactly (a_i - current) mod n if we consider the circle? Actually, no: because if we are at current and we want to go to a_i, the clockwise distance is (a_i - current) mod n, but note that if a_i - current is negative, then (a_i - current) mod n is the same as (a_i - current + n) mod n, and that is the distance.\n\n        However, there is an alternative: the clockwise distance is (a_i - current) if a_i >= current, otherwise (a_i - current + n). So we can do:\n\n            if a_i >= current:\n                dist = a_i - current\n            else:\n                dist = a_i - current + n\n\n        This is equivalent to (a_i - current + n) % n only if we consider that (a_i - current + n) is positive and less than 2n, so modulo n is just (a_i - current + n) (if a_i - current + n < n, then modulo n is itself, but wait: if a_i < current, then a_i - current is negative, and a_i - current + n is between 0 and n-1 (inclusive) because a_i>=1, current<=n, so the smallest a_i is 1, the largest current is n, then 1-n+n=1, and the largest a_i is n-1, the smallest current is 2: then n-1-2+n = 2n-3, which for n>=2 is at least 1 and at most 2n-3, which for n>=3 is less than 2n, so modulo n is the same as the value. But wait, when n=2, then from current=2 to a_i=1: \n            (1-2+2) %2 = (1)%2=1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation is not necessary if we use the if condition.\n\n        But the problem: we have to do m up to 10^5, so we can do either way.\n\n        Let me choose the if condition for clarity.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            total_time = 0\n            current = 1\n\n            for each house h in the list of tasks (which is the second line, split into m integers):\n                if h >= current:\n                    steps = h - current\n                else:\n                    steps = h - current + n\n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = h\n\n        Then print(total_time)\n\n        Let me test with the example: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n            n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n\n            Step1: current=1, h=3 -> h>=current -> steps=3-1=2, total_time=2, current=3.\n            Step2: current=3, h=2 -> else: steps=2-3+4=3, total_time=5, current=2.\n            Step3: current=2, h=3 -> steps=3-2=1, total_time=6.\n\n            Output: 6 -> matches.\n\n        Another example: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n            Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n            Expected output: 2 (according to the example input provided: ['4 3\\n2 3 3'] -> output '2')\n\n            Let's compute:\n\n            Step1: current=1, h=2 -> h>=current -> steps=2-1=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n            Step2: current=2, h=3 -> steps=3-2=1, total_time=2, current=3.\n            Step3: current=3, h=3 -> steps=0, total_time=2.\n\n            Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n        But wait, the example input was given as two examples:\n\n            Input: \n                ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n            Output:\n                ['6', '2']\n\n        So our solution produces the expected outputs.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that initially Xenia is at house 1, and the tasks are given in order. We must complete the first task (which is the first element) and then the second, etc.\n\n        This approach is O(m) and handles up to 10^5 tasks, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        But wait: what if the task list is empty? Then m=0, so we don't enter the loop and output 0. That is correct.\n\n        Code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that the second line contains m integers. So we read the first line for n and m, then the second line for the list.\n\n        Example: if n=5, m=1, task=[3], then steps=3-1=2, total_time=2.\n\n        Example: n=5, m=2, tasks=[5,1]: \n            Step1: current=1, h=5 -> 5>=1 -> steps=4, current=5, total_time=4.\n            Step2: current=5, h=1 -> 1<5 -> steps=1-5+5=1, total_time=5.\n\n        Check: 1->2->3->4->5: 4 steps, then 5->1: 1 step. Total 5 steps.\n\n        But wait, from 5 to 1: is 1 step? Yes, because the ringroad is circular and adjacent houses are connected. So 5->1 is one step.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            Read n and m.\n            Read the next line and split into a list of integers.\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n\n            for each house in the list:\n                if house >= current:\n                    steps = house - current\n                else:\n                    steps = house - current + n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = house\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait: what if the task list has the same house consecutively? Then steps=0, which is correct.\n\n        Let me test with n=10, m=3, tasks=[5,5,5]:\n            Step1: current=1, h=5 -> steps=4, total_time=4, current=5.\n            Step2: current=5, h=5 -> steps=0, total_time=4, current=5.\n            Step3: current=5, h=5 -> steps=0, total_time=4.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that Xenia has multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So we are good.\n\n        But wait, there's an alternative: we could also consider that after completing a task, we are at the task's house, and then we move to the next. The above code does that.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3] -> 6\n            Example 2: n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3] -> 2\n\n        It matches.\n\n        However, wait: the example input format is given as a string in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n        We assume standard input.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            m = int(data[1])\n            tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for h in tasks:\n                if h >= current:\n                    steps = h - current\n                else:\n                    steps = h - current + n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = h\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        But wait, the problem constraints say that n and m can be up to 10^5, and we are doing a simple loop, so it is efficient.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation version is also acceptable, but we are using conditionals. Conditionals are cheap.\n\n        Let me test with a big example: n=10**5, m=10**5, with all tasks being 1 (the same). Then the total_time should be: \n            First task: 1-1=0, then all the rest 0. So total_time=0.\n\n        Another: n=10**5, m=10**5, tasks increasing from 1 to 10**5: \n            Then the first task: 1-1=0, then second task: 2-1=1, then 3-2=1, ... until 10**5- (10**5-1)=1. So total_time = 0 + 1 + 1 + ... (99999 times) -> 99999.\n\n        But wait, actually the first task is at house 1, then we go to house 2: 1 step, then house 3: 1 step, ... until house 10**5: 1 step. The total steps for the increasing part (from 1 to 10**5) is (10**5 - 1) * 1 = 99999.\n\n        However, note: we start at 1, then we do the first task (at 1) which is 0, then the next 99999 tasks (from 2 to 10**5) each adds 1, so total_time=99999.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        But wait, if the tasks are decreasing: [10**5, 10**5-1, ..., 1] (m=10**5)\n\n            Start at 1, then to 10**5: steps = 10**5-1 (because 10**5>=1) -> 99999 steps.\n            Then from 10**5 to 10**5-1: steps = (10**5-1 - 10**5) + 10**5 = -1 + 10**5 = 99999 steps? \n                Actually, no: because 10**5-1 < 10**5, so we use the else branch: steps = (10**5-1) - 10**5 + 10**5 = 10**5-1 - 10**5 + 10**5 = 10**5-1, which is 99999.\n\n            Then from 10**5-1 to 10**5-2: same, 99999 steps.\n\n            Then from 2 to 1: steps = 1-2+10**5 = 10**5-1 = 99999.\n\n            So total_time = 99999 * 10**5, which is 9999900000.\n\n        But wait, the entire journey: \n            Start at 1, then go to 10**5: 1->2->...->10**5: 99999 steps.\n            Then from 10**5 to 10**5-1: we go 10**5->1 (1 step) and then 1->2->...->(10**5-1): that would be 1 step (to 1) and then 10**5-2 steps to get to 10**5-1? Actually, wait: no, because we are only allowed to move clockwise. From 10**5, the next house is 1 (since it's a ring). Then from 1 to 10**5-1: we have to go 1->2->...->10**5-1: 10**5-2 steps. So total steps from 10**5 to 10**5-1: 1 (from 10**5 to 1) + (10**5-2) (from 1 to 10**5-1) = 10**5-1, which is 99999.\n\n        So the calculation is consistent.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            import sys\n\n            def main():\n                data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n                if not data:\n                    print(0)\n                    return\n                n = int(data[0])\n                m = int(data[1])\n                tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n                current = 1\n                total_time = 0\n                for h in tasks:\n                    if h >= current:\n                        steps = h - current\n                    else:\n                        steps = h - current + n\n                    total_time += steps\n                    current = h\n                print(total_time)\n\n            if __name__ == '__main__':\n                main()\n\n        However, note: the problem says the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 to n. Our calculations are based on that.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n\n        But wait, I see that the example input is given as a string in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n        We assume the input is given in the standard way.\n\n        One more edge: n=2, m=2, tasks=[2,1]\n            Step1: current=1, h=2 -> 2>=1 -> steps=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n            Step2: current=2, h=1 -> 1<2 -> steps=1-2+2=1, total_time=2.\n\n        Check: 1->2 (1 step), then 2->1 (1 step). Total 2 steps. Correct.\n\n        Another: n=2, m=2, tasks=[1,2] -> 0+1=1.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation version would be:\n\n            steps = (h - current + n) % n\n\n        But wait, that would give for the second task in [2,1] (n=2): \n            h=1, current=2: (1-2+2) %2 = (1)%2=1 -> correct.\n\n        But for the first task [1,2] (n=2): \n            h=2, current=1: (2-1+2)%2= (3)%2=1 -> correct.\n\n        However, what if the distance is 0? For example, n=3, current=2, h=2: (2-2+3)%3=3%3=0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: if the distance is n? \n            Example: from 1 to 1: (1-1+3)%3=3%3=0 -> correct.\n\n        However, from 1 to 1, we don't move. But what about from 1 to 1 in a circle: we can move n steps? But the problem says minimal steps. Actually, the minimal steps is 0, because we are already there.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation gives 0, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: from 1 to 3 (n=3): \n            (3-1+3)%3 = 5%3=2 -> which is correct: 1->2->3 (2 steps).\n\n        And from 3 to 1 (n=3): (1-3+3)%3=1%3=1 -> correct: 3->1 (1 step).\n\n        So the modulus method is also correct.\n\n        Which one to use? The modulus method is shorter, but we have to be cautious: the modulus operation in Python for positive numbers is straightforward, but note that (h - current + n) might be negative? \n\n        Actually, if h < current, then h-current is negative, so (h-current+n) is positive (because n is positive and larger than |h-current|? Not necessarily: if h-current is negative and we add n, we get a positive number. Then modulo n will give a value between 0 and n-1.\n\n        However, we know that the clockwise distance from current to h is (h - current) mod n (nonnegative) and is equal to (h - current + n) % n.\n\n        But wait: what if (h - current + n) is greater than or equal to n? Then modulo n will subtract n until it is in [0, n-1]. However, note that h is between 1 and n, and current is between 1 and n. \n\n        The maximum value of (h - current + n) is (n - 1 - 1 + n) = 2n-2, which is less than 2n, so modulo n is (2n-2) % n = (n-2) because 2n-2 = n + (n-2). \n\n        But wait, is that the correct clockwise distance? \n\n        Example: n=3, current=1, h=3: \n            Without modulus: (3-1+3)=5, 5%3=2 -> correct (1->2->3: 2 steps).\n        Example: n=3, current=2, h=1: \n            (1-2+3)=2, 2%3=2 -> but wait, the clockwise distance from 2 to 1 is 2 steps: 2->3->1.\n\n        But wait, 2->3 (1 step), 3->1 (1 step) -> total 2 steps. Correct.\n\n        However, what if we use modulus without the condition? Then the code becomes:\n\n            for h in tasks:\n                steps = (h - current + n) % n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = h\n\n        But wait: what if steps==0? Then we don't move, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation gives 0 only when h==current. But also, if we are at house 1 and n=3, then to go to house 1: (1-1+3)%3=3%3=0. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we are at house 3 and n=3, and we want to go to house 3: (3-3+3)%3=3%3=0. Correct.\n\n        But what if we are at house 3 and n=3, and we want to go to house 2: (2-3+3)%3=2%3=2. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: the modulus method gives the same result as the condition method?\n\n        Condition method for (current=3, h=2, n=3): \n            since 2<3, steps = 2-3+3 = 2.\n\n        Modulus method: (2-3+3)%3=2%3=2.\n\n        Condition method for (current=1, h=3, n=3): \n            since 3>=1, steps=3-1=2.\n\n        Modulus method: (3-1+3)%3=5%3=2.\n\n        Condition method for (current=2, h=1, n=3): \n            since 1<2, steps=1-2+3=2.\n\n        Modulus method: (1-2+3)%3=2%3=2.\n\n        So they are the same.\n\n        Why? Because the condition method breaks the calculation into two cases, and the modulus method is equivalent.\n\n        However, note: the modulus method does not account for the fact that if the distance is n, then we get 0? \n\n        Example: from 1 to 1, n=3: (1-1+3)%3=3%3=0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if we are at house 1 and want to go to house 4? But wait, n=3, so houses are 1,2,3. The problem says 1<=ai<=n, so h is in [1,3]. So no problem.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the modulus method as well.\n\n        But note: the modulus method might be slower because of the modulo operation? However, modulo is a relatively fast operation for integers.\n\n        But the condition method uses a branch. In high-level languages, branches can be predicted by the CPU, and modulo might be more expensive.\n\n        However, for n and m up to 10^5, the difference is negligible.\n\n        We can choose either.\n\n        I'll stick to the condition method because it is more explicit and avoids the modulo operation (though modulo is safe).\n\n        But note: the modulus method might be confusing because (h - current + n) % n is not the typical way to compute a distance (usually we don't take modulo for distance, we just want the positive value). However, mathematically it is correct.\n\n        Let me write the code with the modulus method for brevity.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\" and we are counting the steps.\n\n        Both methods are correct.\n\n        But note: the modulus method might be less intuitive for someone reading the code.\n\n        We'll use the condition method.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            m = int(data[1])\n            tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n\n            current = 1\n            total_time = 0\n            for h in tasks:\n                if h >= current:\n                    steps = h - current\n                else:\n                    steps = h - current + n\n                total_time += steps\n                current = h\n\n            print(total_time)\n\n        Let me run the provided examples again to be sure.\n\n        Example1: n=4, tasks=[3,2,3] -> 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n        Example2: n=4, tasks=[2,3,3] -> 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Submit.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad with `n` houses. The ringroad is one-way and clockwise, so Xenia can only move in the clockwise direction. The solution involves summing the distances between consecutive tasks, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start at house number 1 (the initial position) and initialize the total time to 0.\n2. **Iterate through each task**: For each task, determine the distance from the current house to the task's house:\n   - If the task's house number is greater than or equal to the current house, the distance is simply the difference between them.\n   - If the task's house number is less than the current house, the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ringroad and then continuing from the start to the task's house. This distance is computed as `(task's house number - current house + n)`.\n3. **Update current position and total time**: After calculating the distance for each task, update the current position to the task's house and add the distance to the total time.\n4. **Output the result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and ensures optimal performance even for large inputs (up to 100,000 houses and tasks).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for h in tasks:\n        if h >= current:\n            steps = h - current\n        else:\n            steps = h - current + n\n        total_time += steps\n        current = h\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. It then reads the list of task house numbers.\n- **Loop through tasks**: For each task, it checks if the task's house is ahead or behind the current position in the clockwise direction. If the task's house is ahead, the distance is straightforward. If it's behind, the distance accounts for wrapping around the end of the ringroad.\n- **Update and Sum**: The distance for each segment is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the task's house.\n- **Output**: Finally, the accumulated total time is printed, representing the minimal time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular movement and ensures optimal performance with a linear pass through the tasks, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
