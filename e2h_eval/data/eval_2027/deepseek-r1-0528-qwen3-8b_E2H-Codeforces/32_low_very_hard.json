    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element from the array will remove either the minimum or the maximum (or somewhere in between) and then the instability is the new max minus the new min.\n\n However, note: the instability is defined as max - min of the remaining array. We are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n Observation:\n  After removal, the array has n-1 elements.\n\n  The instability of the resulting array can be thought of as:\n    Option 1: Remove an occurrence of the current minimum (if there are multiple, we might have several choices)\n    Option 2: Remove an occurrence of the current maximum.\n\n  But note: sometimes removing an element that is not the global min or max might lead to a smaller instability? Actually, no.\n\n  Let's think:\n\n  Let the original array sorted: b[0] <= b[1] <= ... <= b[n-1]\n\n  If we remove an element at position i, then the new min and max are:\n      If i is the first occurrence (min), then the new min is the next smallest (which is b[1] if we remove b[0]) and the max remains b[n-1].\n      Similarly, if we remove the last occurrence (max), then the new max is b[n-2] and the min remains b[0].\n\n  However, we might also consider removing an element that is not the min or max? Actually, if we remove an element that is not the min or max, then the min and max remain the same. Therefore, the instability would be the same as the original (b[n-1]-b[0]). So we don't want that because we are trying to minimize.\n\n  Therefore, the candidate answers come from removing one of the extreme values (min or max).\n\n  But wait: what if there are duplicates? For example, [1, 1, 3, 7]. \n    Original: min=1, max=7, instability=6.\n    Removing a 1: then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability=6.\n    Removing a 7: then the array becomes [1,1,3] -> instability=2.\n\n  So we must consider that the min might appear multiple times. In fact, we can remove any occurrence. However, if we remove a non-min element that is not the max, then the min remains the same and the max remains the same? Then the instability doesn't change. Similarly for non-max.\n\n  Therefore, the only candidates that can reduce the instability are:\n      Candidate 1: Remove the first occurrence (so the new array has min = b[1] and max = b[n-1]) -> instability = b[n-1] - b[1]\n      Candidate 2: Remove the last occurrence -> instability = b[n-2] - b[0]\n\n  But wait, what if we remove an element that is the only min? Then the new min becomes the next smallest (which is b[1]), and the max remains. Similarly, if we remove the only max, the min remains and the new max becomes the previous largest (b[n-2]).\n\n  However, note: the array might have multiple mins. Then even if we remove one min, the min is still present (unless we remove the last occurrence of the min). Similarly for max.\n\n  So we should consider two possibilities:\n\n      Possibility 1: Remove one occurrence of the global min (if there are multiple, then we leave at least one min, so the min remains the same? Actually, no: if we remove one min, then the next smallest value becomes the min only if there was no other min? \n\n  Actually, let's define:\n      Let m = min(a), M = max(a)\n\n  But if we remove an element that is m, then the new min is:\n      If the frequency of m is more than one, then the min remains m (because there is still at least one m).\n      If the frequency of m is exactly one, then the new min is the next smallest number (which is the first element in the sorted array after m).\n\n  Similarly for M.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not require us to know the entire frequency, but we can use the sorted array.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Sort the array.\n  2. Consider the following two cases (and actually more if there are multiple minima or maxima):\n\n  But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. The key is that the resulting instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining array.\n\n  We can consider two strategies:\n\n      Strategy 1: Remove the smallest element (if it is unique, then the new min is the next smallest; if not, then the min remains the same). Then the instability is max(remaining) - min(remaining) = (if min changes: then the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in easily identifying the potential candidates for removal that could minimize the instability. The sorted array allows us to consider the smallest and largest elements efficiently.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: If the array has all elements the same (i.e., the first and last elements are equal), then removing any element will result in an instability of zero.\n3. **Evaluate Removal of Minimum or Maximum**: The key observation is that the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the smallest element or the largest element from the sorted array. \n   - Removing the smallest element: The new minimum becomes the second smallest element, and the maximum remains unchanged. The instability is then calculated as `last - first + 1` (since the smallest element is removed).\n   - Removing the largest element: The new maximum becomes the second largest element, and the minimum remains unchanged. The instability is then calculated as `last - first - 1` (since the largest element is removed).\n4. **Choose the Minimum Instability**: The solution involves comparing the results from removing the smallest or largest element and selecting the smaller of the two values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr.sort()\n    if arr[0] == arr[-1]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n    candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n    \n    result = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array is empty or all elements are the same, the instability is zero.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n4. **Candidate Calculation**: Two candidates for minimal instability are computed:\n   - **candidate1**: The instability when the smallest element is removed (`arr[-1] - arr[1]`).\n   - **candidate2**: The instability when the largest element is removed (`arr[-2] - arr[0]`).\n5. **Result Selection**: The smaller of the two candidates is chosen and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to considering only two potential scenarios, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to determine the minimal instability. The solution handles all edge cases and operates in optimal time complexity.",
