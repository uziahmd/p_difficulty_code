They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string s of length n.\n The tournament has 2^n teams, and the outcome of each phase is determined by the string s.\n Each character s[i] (0-indexed) corresponds to the i-th phase (which is the phase with 2^(n-i-1) games? Actually, note: \n   - The first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games, then next 2^(n-2), etc.\n\n We have two possibilities for each phase: \n   - If s_i is '0', then in that phase the lower-skilled team wins.\n   - If s_i is '1', then the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n We are to find all integers x (from 1 to 2^n) such that there exists a permutation p (which is just an assignment of distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n to the teams) so that the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Approach:\n We cannot try all permutations because 2^n can be up to 2^18 = 262144, which is acceptable for some algorithms but we need to check for each x whether there's a permutation that leads to x winning.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for all winning integers. There are 2^n integers (from 1 to 2^n) and n<=18, so 2^n is about 262144, which is too many to iterate over all permutations.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Let's think about the structure of the tournament. The tournament is a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves (teams). The games are fixed: the bracket is fixed (the initial pairing: 1vs2, 3vs4, etc., then the winners are paired as the next round, etc.). But the outcomes of the games are determined by the string s.\n\n We can model the tournament as a bracket. In each node (game) we know the rule: if the current phase (which corresponds to the depth from the root? Actually, the problem says: the first phase (with 2^(n-1) games) is the one that reduces from 2^n to 2^(n-1). Then the next phase is the second phase (if n>=2) with 2^(n-2) games, and so on.\n\n The phases are from the top (root) to the bottom? Actually, the first phase is the first set of games (the first round), and the last phase is the final.\n\n How does the bracket work?\n   - The initial bracket: the teams are numbered 1 to 2^n. The game between team i and team j is fixed by the bracket. The winner of a game advances to the next round.\n\n Conditions for a team to win the tournament:\n   - It must win all its games (n games, since there are n rounds).\n\n But also, the outcomes of the other games must be such that the path from the team to the champion is clear, and the opponents it faces are determined by the bracket and the outcomes of the previous games.\n\n However, the problem gives a string s that tells the outcome rule for each phase. The phase index i (from 0 to n-1) corresponds to the (n-i)-th round? Actually, the problem says:\n   \"in the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n So, the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-0) = 2^n games? That doesn't match because we start with 2^n teams and the first phase should have 2^(n-1) games. \n\n Correction: the problem says: \n   \"The tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games.\"\n   \"in the first phase: split into pairs: 2^(n-1) games\"\n\n And then: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n Wait: for i=0, 2^(n-0) = 2^n, but we only have 2^(n-1) games in the first phase. \n\n Let me re-read: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n But wait, the example input: \n      Input: \"3\\n101\"\n\n This means n=3, so total teams = 8. \n   First phase (i=0): 2^(3-0)=8 games? But we only have 7 games total. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the i-th phase (counting from the first phase as i=0) has 2^(n-i-1) games? Because:\n   Phase 0: 2^(n-1) = 4 (if n=2) but wait, for n=3: 2^(3-1)=4, but then the next phase would be 2^(3-2)=2, then 2^(3-3)=1.\n\n But the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\". For i=0: 2^(n) games, which is too many.\n\n Let me check the example output: \n   Example: Input \"2\\n01\" -> Output \"2 3\"\n\n Actually, the example input provided in the problem statement is: \n   ['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n And outputs: \n   ['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\n For the third example: n=2, string s=\"01\"\n\n Total teams: 4.\n\n Phases: \n   First phase (i=0): 2^(2-0)=4 games? But we have 4 teams, so 3 games? \n\n Alternatively, maybe the problem indexes the string s from the final to the first phase? Or the other way around?\n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n But note: the tournament has n phases? Actually, the number of phases is n (since we reduce from 2^n to 1 in n rounds). \n\n However, the total games is 2^n - 1, and the number of games in the i-th phase is 2^(n-i) ? \n\n For n=3: \n   i=0: 2^(3-0)=8 games -> but we start with 8 teams, so we can't have 8 games in the first round (because that would eliminate 8 teams, leaving 0). \n\n Another interpretation: the i-th phase (counting from the first as i=0) has 2^(n-i-1) games? Then for n=3:\n   i=0: 2^(3-1)=4 games (first round)\n   i=1: 2^(3-2)=2 games (second round)\n   i=2: 2^(3-3)=1 game (third round)\n\n Then the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\" -> wait, 2^(n-i) would be for i=0: 2^3=8, which is not matching.\n\n Alternatively, if we consider the phase index from the bottom (the final is phase 0) then:\n   i=0: final (1 game) -> 2^(n-0) = 2^n, which is 8 for n=3, not 1.\n\n I think there might be a confusion. Let me look at the example input \"2\\n01\": n=2, s=\"01\"\n   Total teams: 4.\n   Two phases: \n        Phase0 (i=0): 2^(2-0)=4 games? But we have 4 teams, so 3 games in total. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the i-th phase (starting from the first) has 2^(n-i) games? Then for n=2, i=0: 2^(2)=4 games, which is more than the 3 games we have.\n\n After reading the problem statement again: \n   \"in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, and so on (so, 2^(n-1) games are played in that phase).\"\n\n Then, \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\".\n\n Wait, the first phase (i=0) should have 2^(n-1) games. But 2^(n-i) for i=0 is 2^n, which is not 2^(n-1). \n\n There seems to be a discrepancy. \n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: \"3\\n101\" -> n=3, so 8 teams.\n\n   According to the problem, the first phase (i=0) has 2^(3-1)=4 games, then the second phase (i=1) has 2^(3-2)=2 games, then the third phase (i=2) has 2^(3-3)=1 game.\n\n But the string s is given of length n (so 3 characters). The problem says: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n So, for i=0: 2^(3-0)=8 -> but we have 4 games in the first phase.\n\n Therefore, I suspect the problem meant: the i-th phase (counting from 0) has 2^(n-i-1) games. \n\n However, the problem says \"2^(n-i)\", so that doesn't match.\n\n Alternatively, the problem indexes the phases from the final as the first? \n\n Let me reexamine: \n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n But note: the tournament has n rounds. The number of games in round k (from the final) is 2^k. \n   Round 0 (final): 1 game -> 2^0 = 1\n   Round 1: 2 games\n   Round 2: 4 games\n\n Then, if we let i be the round index from 0 to n-1 (where 0 is the final) then the i-th phase (from the final) has 2^i games.\n\n But the problem says: \"the first phase\" is the one with 2^(n-1) games, which is the semifinals (if n=3: the first phase is the semifinals, then the second phase is the quarterfinals, and the third phase is the final). \n\n Actually, the problem states the first phase as the one that happens first (so the first round, the one that eliminates half the teams). \n\n So, if we index the phases from the first (semifinals) to the last (final), then the number of games in the i-th phase (0-indexed) is 2^(n-i-1). \n\n But the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\". \n\n Now, if we index the phases from the final (last) to the first (first), then:\n   i=0: final (last) -> 2^(n-0) = 2^n -> but that is the total teams, not the number of games.\n\n Alternatively, if we index the phases from the first (most games) to the last (least games), then the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games. \n\n The problem says: \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\".\n\n There's a mismatch. \n\n Let me check the example: \n   Input: \"2\\n01\", n=2, s=\"01\"\n\n   The tournament has 4 teams.\n\n   First phase (i=0): according to the problem, should be 2^(n-0)=4 games? But we only have 3 games in total.\n\n Another possibility: the problem meant the i-th phase (counting from 0) has 2^(n-i) teams eliminated? Then the number of games is 2^(n-i). But wait, eliminating 2^(n-i) teams requires 2^(n-i) games. \n\n But the first phase (i=0) eliminates 2^(n-0)=2^n teams? That's all teams, which is not the case.\n\n After re‐reading the problem statement: \n   \"The tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games.\"\n\n   And the first phase has 2^(n-1) games (eliminating 2^(n-1) teams).\n\n   Then the second phase (if any) has 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n So, the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games (for i from 0 to n-1). \n\n But the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\".\n\n I think there is an error in the problem statement. \n\n However, note the example output: \n   Input \"3\\n101\" -> Output \"4 5 6 7\"\n\n   Input \"1\\n1\" -> Output \"2\"\n\n   Input \"2\\n01\" -> Output \"2 3\"\n\n Let me assume that the intended meaning is that the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games. Then the string s has n characters, and the i-th character (0-indexed) corresponds to the phase that reduces the number of teams from 2^(n-i) to 2^(n-i-1). \n\n But wait, the problem says: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n They say the phase has 2^(n-i) games. But if the phase is the i-th (0-indexed) then the number of games should be 2^(n-i-1). \n\n Unless the indexing of the string s is from the final to the first phase? \n\n Let me reinterpret: \n   The problem says: \n      \"The following is the playoff tournament description\"\n\n   And then: \n      \"These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows: ... \"\n\n   And the example: \n      Input \"2\\n01\": n=2, s=\"01\"\n\n   What does this mean?\n     The tournament has 4 teams. \n     There are two phases: \n        Phase0 (first phase) has 2^(2-0)=4 games? -> no, that's too many.\n\n   Alternatively, if we consider the string s from the final to the first phase, then:\n        s[0] (the first character) is for the final (last phase) and s[1] is for the first phase.\n\n   Then for the example \"2\\n01\":\n        The final (last phase) is '0' -> meaning in the final: the lower-skilled team wins.\n        The first phase (semifinal) is '1' -> meaning in the semifinal: the higher-skilled team wins.\n\n   Then the tournament goes as:\n        In the semifinal: two games (each between two teams). The winner of each semifinal is the higher-skilled team.\n        Then the final: the two winners (from the two semifinals) play. The winner is the lower-skilled one.\n\n   Now, how do we assign the teams? \n\n   The teams are initially in order: [1,2,3,4]\n\n   The bracket: \n        Semifinal 1: team1 vs team2 -> winner is max(1,2) because s[1] (the first phase) is '1' (higher wins) -> so winner is 2.\n        Semifinal 2: team3 vs team4 -> winner is max(3,4) -> 4.\n\n        Final: winner of semifinal1 (2) vs winner of semifinal2 (4). Since the final is the last phase (i=0) and s[0] is '0', the lower wins: so min(2,4)=2.\n\n   So the champion is 2.\n\n   But wait, the output for \"2\\n01\" is \"2 3\". Why is 3 also a winning integer?\n\n   We must consider that we can assign the permutation arbitrarily? Actually, the problem says: \n        \"You are given a string s which consists of n characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows\"\n\n   But note: the problem says \"a permutation p\" (which is an array containing each number from 1 to 2^n exactly once). \n\n   So we can assign the team numbers arbitrarily to the bracket positions.\n\n   Therefore, we are allowed to assign the numbers 1 to 4 arbitrarily to the four teams. \n\n   How does the bracket work? The bracket is fixed: the first match is always between the team assigned to position0 and position1, the second between position2 and position3, then the winners meet.\n\n   But we can assign the numbers arbitrarily. \n\n   Let me try to see if 3 can win:\n\n   We want 3 to win. We have two phases: the first phase (semifinal) is '1' (higher wins) and the final is '0' (lower wins).\n\n   The final must be between two teams: one of them is 3 (the champion). The other must be the winner of the other semifinal.\n\n   In the semifinal that 3 is in, since the rule is higher wins, 3 must be the highest in its semifinal. But wait, if 3 is the highest in its semifinal, then it wins that semifinal. Then in the final, it must lose to the other finalist (because the final rule is lower wins). Therefore, the other finalist must be lower than 3. But then 3 is higher than the other finalist? Then in the final, the rule says the lower wins, so 3 (being higher) loses. So that works.\n\n   However, we must arrange the bracket so that 3 is in the same semifinal as two teams that are lower than 3, and the other semifinal has two teams both lower than 3? Actually, no: the other semifinal must have two teams, and the winner must be lower than 3 (so that 3 beats it in the final? No, wait: in the final, the rule is lower wins, so 3 must be lower than the opponent to win? Actually, no: the rule says the lower wins, so if 3 is higher than the opponent, then the opponent wins. Therefore, for 3 to win the final, the opponent must be lower than 3. But then 3 is higher, so the opponent wins? Then 3 cannot win the final if the opponent is lower.\n\n   Alternatively, we have to assign the numbers arbitrarily. We can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the four positions.\n\n   Let me label the four positions: \n        Position0: team A, Position1: team B, Position2: team C, Position3: team D.\n\n   The semifinals: \n        Game1: A vs B -> winner is the higher (since s[1] (if we are considering the first phase as the semifinal) is '1') -> so winner = max(A,B)\n        Game2: C vs D -> winner = max(C,D)\n\n   Then the final: min(max(A,B), max(C,D)) (if the final rule is '0').\n\n   We want 3 to be the champion.\n\n   Possibility: \n        Let the champion be 4 (which is the highest) and then assign the others appropriately? \n\n   But wait, the problem asks for all x that can be the champion.\n\n   Let me try x=2 and x=3 for n=2, s=\"01\":\n\n   We have four numbers: 1,2,3,4.\n\n   For x=2 to be the champion:\n        We must assign 2 to one of the teams.\n\n        Consider the bracket: \n            Option1: 2 is in the first semifinal (A or B) and the other semifinal (C and D) must have the highest remaining number (so that the winner of the other semifinal is higher than 2, and then in the final the rule is lower wins, so 2 must be lower than that winner? But wait, the final rule is lower wins, so the champion is the lower of the two winners. \n\n        Actually, for 2 to win the tournament:\n            In the final, 2 must be the lower of the two winners. Therefore, the other winner must be higher than 2.\n\n            Now, for 2 to reach the final, in its semifinal (whichever it is) it must win. The rule for the semifinal is higher wins. So 2 must be the highest in its semifinal. Therefore, the other team in 2's semifinal must be lower than 2. \n\n            Then, the other semifinal must have two teams that are higher than 2? Actually, we have numbers: 1,3,4. \n            Since 2 is in a semifinal with 1, then the other semifinal has 3 and 4. The winner of the other semifinal is 4 (max(3,4)). Then the final: min(2,4) = 2 -> so 2 wins.\n\n        Now, for x=3 to be the champion:\n            In the final, 3 must be the lower of the two winners. Therefore, the other winner must be higher than 3. \n\n            For 3 to reach the final, in its semifinal it must win. The semifinal rule is higher wins, so 3 must be the highest in its semifinal. \n\n            Then, the other semifinal must have two teams that are higher than 3? But we have numbers: 1,2,4. \n            We assign 3 to one semifinal. Then the other semifinal must be assigned 4 and one other. The highest in the other semifinal must be higher than 3 (which is 4). \n\n            Then, the winner of the other semifinal is 4. Then the final: min(3,4)=3 -> so 3 wins.\n\n        But wait, how do we assign the numbers to the bracket for 3 to win?\n            Let the two semifinals be:\n                Semifinal1: [3, ?] -> to have 3 be the highest, the other must be <=3. We can use 1 and 2? Then the winner is 3 (since higher wins).\n                Semifinal2: [4, ?] -> we have two numbers left, say 1 and 2, so [4,1] -> winner is 4.\n\n            Then the final: 3 vs 4 -> rule is lower wins -> 3 wins.\n\n        But wait, we have four distinct numbers: 1,2,3,4. We used 1 and 2 in the first semifinal? Then the second semifinal must be 4 and the remaining number (which is 2? but 2 was already used). \n\n        Actually, we have to assign the numbers arbitrarily. We have four distinct numbers.\n\n        Let me assign:\n            Semifinal1: 3 and 2 -> then winner is 3 (because higher wins: 3>2).\n            Semifinal2: 4 and 1 -> then winner is 4.\n\n            Then the final: 3 vs 4 -> lower wins: 3<4 -> so 3 wins.\n\n        So 3 wins.\n\n        Similarly, for 2 to win:\n            We must have 2 in a semifinal with a number lower than 2 (only 1). Then the other semifinal must have the remaining two numbers: 3 and 4, and the winner is 4. Then the final: 2 vs 4 -> lower wins: 2<4 -> 2 wins.\n\n        What about 4?\n            To have 4 win:\n            In the final, 4 must be the lower of the two winners? But 4 is the highest number, so for it to be the lower, the other winner must be higher than 4? There is no number higher than 4. So 4 cannot be the lower in the final. Therefore, 4 cannot win.\n\n        What about 1?\n            To have 1 win:\n            In the semifinal, 1 must win. But the semifinal rule is higher wins. So 1 must be the highest in its semifinal. The other team must be lower than 1? There is no number lower than 1. So 1 cannot win.\n\n        Therefore, the winning integers are 2 and 3.\n\n   Now, the problem: we are to find all x (from 1 to 4) for which there exists a permutation p (assigning the numbers 1..4 to the four teams) such that the team with skill x wins.\n\n   We found that 2 and 3 can win.\n\n   The example output for \"2\\n01\" is \"2 3\", so that matches.\n\n   But note: the example input \"1\\n1\": n=1, s=\"1\"\n        Teams: 2 teams.\n        Only one phase (the final) which has 2^(1-0)=2^1=2? But wait, we have two teams, so one game.\n\n        The rule: s_0='1' -> higher wins.\n\n        We have two numbers: 1 and 2.\n\n        The champion must be the higher one: 2.\n\n        But the problem says: find all winning integers. \n\n        Let's check:\n            If we assign the two teams arbitrarily, the winner is the higher one. So the champion is always 2.\n\n        Therefore, the winning integer is only 2.\n\n        However, the output is \"2\", so that matches.\n\n   Example input \"3\\n101\": n=3, s=\"101\"\n\n        Teams: 8 teams, labeled 1 to 8.\n\n        The string s has three characters: \n          s0='1', s1='0', s2='1'\n\n        The phases: \n          Phase0 (first phase): 2^(3-1)=4 games? But wait, the problem says the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games) -> if we stick to the problem's stated formula, then:\n            i=0: 2^(3)=8 games -> but we only have 7 games.\n\n        But note: the example output is \"4 5 6 7\", meaning the winning integers are 4,5,6,7.\n\n        How do we explain that?\n\n        Let me assume the intended meaning is: the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games. Then the rules for the three phases are:\n          Phase0 (first phase): rule '1' (higher wins) -> 4 games\n          Phase1 (second phase): rule '0' (lower wins) -> 2 games\n          Phase2 (final): rule '1' (higher wins) -> 1 game\n\n        Then, we need to check which numbers from 1 to 8 can be the champion.\n\n        The tournament has 8 teams. The bracket is fixed: the first round (phase0) has 4 games, then phase1 has 2 games, then phase2 has 1 game.\n\n        We can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the 8 teams.\n\n        How to check for a particular x? \n\n        We can use a recursive (or iterative) simulation of the tournament, but note that n<=18, so the total teams is 2^18 which is 262144, which is too many to simulate for each candidate x (which is from 1 to 2^n).\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n        The tournament is a complete binary tree. The path from the champion to the root must satisfy the conditions of the rules in each phase.\n\n        However, note that the rules apply to entire phase (all games in that phase). But the outcome of the games not involving the champion also matter.\n\n        We can think of the tournament as having 2^n leaves (the teams) and the champion must be at the root.\n\n        The condition for a team to be champion is that for every opponent it faces (and the ones it eliminates) the outcomes must follow the rules.\n\n        However, note that the rules are global for the entire phase (same rule for all games in that phase). \n\n        This means that the outcome of a game in a phase depends on the two teams playing and the rule for that phase.\n\n        But we can choose the permutation arbitrarily. \n\n        Another idea: \n\n        We can use a greedy method: \n\n        Let's consider the bracket as a binary tree. The champion must be the one that wins all its games and the opponents in the same subtree must be arranged so that the champion wins.\n\n        However, we can also use the following observation:\n\n        In each phase, the rule is either \"higher\" or \"lower\". The entire tournament is fixed in structure.\n\n        We can simulate the tournament for a fixed x (as the champion) by assigning the other teams optimally. \n\n        Steps for checking a particular x (from 1 to 2^n):\n\n        We have 2^n teams. We assign the number x to one of the teams. But note: we can assign arbitrarily, so we can fix the champion to be at a fixed position? Actually, the bracket structure is fixed: the initial pairing is fixed (team1 vs team2, team3 vs team4, etc.), but we can assign the numbers arbitrarily to the leaves.\n\n        So we can assign the numbers arbitrarily. Therefore, we can assign the smallest numbers to the teams that are not desired to be in the path of the champion.\n\n        How to check for x?\n\n        We can use a DFS/BFS that traverses the bracket from the leaves to the root, and in each node (game) we know the rule (from the string s, and the phase level). But the challenge is that the rule for a phase applies to all games in that phase (same rule for all).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a known method for similar problems (like \"Fantasy Tournament\" type problems) where the bracket is fixed and the outcomes are predetermined by a rule.\n\n        Let me define the tournament bracket: \n\n          Let the teams be leaves of a complete binary tree of height n. The root is the champion.\n\n          The games are played from the leaves up to the root.\n\n          The rule for a phase (which corresponds to a level in the tree) is given by s[i] for the i-th phase (where i=0 is the first phase, which is the lowest level of the tree, i.e., the first round).\n\n          But note: the problem says the first phase (i=0) has 2^(n-1) games (which are the first round, the one that uses the leaves). Then the next phase (i=1) has 2^(n-2) games (the next round), and so on.\n\n          The rule for the phase at depth d (from the root) is s[n-1-d]? Or from the bottom?\n\n        Actually, the problem says the string s of length n: \n          s_0 corresponds to the first phase (the one with the most games, the first round) and s_{n-1} corresponds to the final (the last phase).\n\n        So the rule for the first phase (round 1) is s[0], and the rule for the final (round n) is s[n-1].\n\n        Now, we can simulate the tournament by building a segment tree or a heap-like structure for the bracket.\n\n        However, there is a simpler way: \n\n        We can use a bit mask or a recursive function that, given a segment (a set of consecutive teams in the bracket) and the current phase (or the rule for the current phase) and the required outcome (whether the champion must win or lose in that segment), but this seems complex.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n        We can consider that the tournament is deterministic once the permutation is fixed. We want to know if there exists a permutation such that x wins.\n\n        We can try to assign the numbers in increasing order (or decreasing order) to the leaves in a way that the champion x wins.\n\n        However, note: the bracket is fixed (the first match is between leaf0 and leaf1, then the next is leaf2 and leaf3, etc.). \n\n        We can use dynamic programming or greedy assignment.\n\n        Insight: \n\n        In each round (phase), the rule decides which of two teams wins. The entire tournament is fixed: the path of the champion must go through n rounds.\n\n        For the champion x to win a particular round (at a particular level) with rule 'r' (either '0' or '1'), we must have:\n\n          In the round (phase) that corresponds to the j-th level (from the root, the root is the final, then the next is the semifinal, etc.), the rule is given by s[n-1-j] (if we index s from 0 to n-1, and the first phase is the first round, which is the largest level in the tree? Actually, the root is the final, which is the last phase).\n\n        Let me define the rounds from the root (final) to the leaves (first round):\n\n          Round0: the final (last phase) -> rule s[n-1]\n          Round1: the next to final (second last phase) -> rule s[n-2]\n          ...\n          Round n-1: the first round (semifinals for n=3) -> rule s[0]\n\n        But wait, the problem says the first phase is the first round (which is the one with 2^(n-1) games) and that phase uses the rule s_0.\n\n        So the first round (closest to the leaves) uses rule s[0], the next round uses s[1], and the final uses s[n-1].\n\n        Now, to determine if x can be the champion, we must ensure that:\n\n          In the first round, x must be placed in a position such that it wins its first round game, and then the subsequent rounds must be favorable.\n\n        However, the outcome of the games that do not involve x also affect the path. \n\n        We can use a divide and conquer strategy: \n\n          Let the entire set of teams be {1, 2, ..., 2^n}. We fix x as the champion.\n\n          Then, we consider the bracket. The champion x must appear in the final. The two teams that reach the final are the winners of two halves. \n\n          We can break the bracket into two halves (each of size 2^(n-1)). Then, the champion x must be in one half. \n\n          In that half, x must win all its games (from the final of that half to the root). The rule for the games in that half is known (from the string s, from the first phase to the final of that half).\n\n          Moreover, the other half must produce a champion that, when compared to x in the final, the rule of the final (the last phase) must allow x to win.\n\n        We can recursively determine the set of numbers that can be the champion in a subtree.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let f(l, r, rules) be the set of numbers that can be the champion in the subtree defined by the leaves from l to r (inclusive) and the rules from the first round (closest to the leaves) to the final of this subtree (the root of the subtree) are given by the list `rules` (which has length equal to the depth of the subtree, which is log2(r-l+1)).\n\n          But note: the entire tournament has 2^n teams and n rounds, so the depth is n.\n\n        However, we don't know the rules for the entire tournament: the rules are given by the string s of length n, and the rule for the i-th phase (counting from the first round) is s[i]. \n\n        But the bracket is fixed: the first round is the first set of games (at depth n-1 from the root), then the next round (depth n-2), etc.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Let the entire set of teams be T = {1, 2, ..., 2^n}. We remove x (the candidate champion) and then we have to assign the other teams to the bracket.\n\n          But note: we can assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the best arrangement.\n\n        Alternate Insight from known similar problems (CodeForces, etc.): \n\n        We can use the following:\n\n          In a tournament with fixed bracket and fixed rules for each round, we can determine the necessary conditions for a team to be champion.\n\n        However, note: the rules are not fixed per match but per entire phase (round). \n\n        We can simulate the tournament by keeping track of the set of teams that can win a subtree.\n\n        Algorithm for a fixed x:\n\n          We have a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves. We fix x to be the champion.\n\n          We will consider the entire bracket. The champion must be x, so in the final, x must be present.\n\n          The two teams that reach the final are the winners of the two subtrees of size 2^(n-1). \n\n          Condition for the final: \n            Let the rule for the final be r_final = s[n-1] (if the problem indexes s[0] as the first phase). But wait, our earlier analysis: the first phase is the first round (the one with the most games) and the final is the last phase (smallest number of games). \n\n          However, the problem says: \n            \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n          And the i-th phase (0-indexed) is the phase that occurs at the i-th step (starting from the first). \n\n          We now know that the first phase is the first round, so the rule for the final (the last phase) is s[n-1].\n\n          But wait, the example \"2\\n01",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\) that can win a tournament given the outcome rules for each phase. The tournament involves \\( 2^n \\) teams, and each phase's outcome is determined by a character in the input string \\( s \\). The characters '0' and '1' dictate whether the lower or higher skilled team wins each game in the respective phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured as a single-elimination bracket with \\( n \\) phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The outcome of each game in a phase depends on the corresponding character in \\( s \\). The goal is to find all possible champions \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of team skills (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) allowing \\( x \\) to win the tournament.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a team \\( x \\) to win the tournament, it must win all its games in every phase. Additionally, the outcomes of other games must be arranged such that \\( x \\)'s opponents are favorable based on the phase rules. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a recursive approach to simulate the tournament. For each candidate \\( x \\), we check if it can win all its games by considering the phase rules and the relative strengths of the opposing teams. The solution involves:\n   - **Base Case**: If only one team remains, it is the champion.\n   - **Recursive Case**: For each phase, determine if \\( x \\) can win its games by leveraging the phase rule (higher or lower skilled team wins) and the available team numbers.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each candidate \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\). For each \\( x \\), it processes the tournament bracket in \\( O(n) \\) time per phase, leading to an overall complexity of \\( O(2^n \\times n) \\).
