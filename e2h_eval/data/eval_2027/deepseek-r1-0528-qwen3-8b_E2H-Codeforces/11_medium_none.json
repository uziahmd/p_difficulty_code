A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total milliliters of drink: total_drink = k * l\n    Each toast requires nl milliliters. So, the number of toasts from drink = total_drink // nl\n\n 2. Calculate the total lime slices: total_lime_slices = c * d\n    Each toast requires 1 slice. So, the number of toasts from lime = total_lime_slices\n\n 3. Calculate the salt requirement: Each toast requires np grams. The available salt is p grams.\n    So, the number of toasts from salt = p // np\n\n 4. The limiting factor is the minimum of these three values.\n\n 5. However, note that each friend must have the same amount and they are making toasts together.\n    But the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for each toast they make.\n\n    Actually, the entire group is making toasts. They are going to distribute the toasts equally? \n    But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for each toast.\n\n    So, if we let T be the total number of toasts, then:\n        T * nl <= total_drink   => T <= total_drink // nl\n        T * 1 <= total_lime_slices => T <= total_lime_slices\n        T * np <= p              => T <= p // np\n\n    Then, the maximum T is the minimum of these three.\n\n 6. However, note that the problem asks: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\n    But wait: the entire group is making T toasts. Since there are n friends, and each toast is shared by the entire group?\n    Let me clarify: the problem says \"each friend needs ... for each toast\". \n\n    Actually, the problem states: \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n    This is ambiguous. But looking at the example:\n\n        Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n        Explanation: \n          Total drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> 20/3 (nl) = 6.66... -> 6 toasts (floor division)\n          Lime: 10*8 = 80 slices -> 80 toasts\n          Salt: 100/1 = 100 toasts\n\n        Then they say: min(6, 80, 100) = 6, then divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2.\n\n    So, what does that mean? It means that each friend can make 2 toasts. But wait, if each friend makes 2 toasts, then the total toasts is 3*2 = 6.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of toasts T is the same as the number we get from the minimum of the three resources, but then we must also account for the fact that each toast involves all friends? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... for each toast\". So, for one toast, each friend gets one portion? Then for T toasts, the total drink required is T * n * nl? \n\n    Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    That implies: for one toast, each friend requires nl ml, so for n friends and T toasts, the total drink needed is T * n * nl.\n\n    But wait, in the example: \n        n=3, T=2 toasts per friend -> total toasts = 3*2 = 6? But then the drink requirement would be 6 * 3 * 3? (nl=3) -> 54 ml, but we only have 20 ml.\n\n    Alternatively, the problem might mean: one toast is made by the entire group? Then each toast requires for the entire group: n * nl ml, n * 1 lime slice, n * np grams of salt.\n\n    But the example calculation does not do that. In the example, they did:\n        drink: 20 / 3 (nl) -> 6 toasts (so one toast requires 3 ml, regardless of the number of friends)\n\n    And then they divided the limiting resource (which is the drink) by the number of friends (3) to get the per-friend toasts.\n\n    Another interpretation: the entire group is making toasts together. Each toast is one event for the entire group. Then the requirements per toast are:\n        drink: nl * n   (since each friend needs nl, and there are n friends)\n        lime: n * 1     (each friend gets one slice per toast, so n slices per toast)\n        salt: np * n\n\n    Then the example:\n        drink: 20 ml, per toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml -> 20/9 = 2.22 -> 2 toasts\n        lime: 80 slices, per toast requires 3 slices -> 80/3 = 26.66 -> 26 toasts\n        salt: 100 grams, per toast requires 1*3 = 3 grams -> 100/3 = 33.33 -> 33 toasts\n        Then the answer would be 2.\n\n    But wait, the example output is 2. And the example calculation was:\n\n        Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n    Here, they are treating the toast as requiring 3 ml (nl) per friend? But then why did they divide by 3 (the number of friends) at the end?\n\n    Actually, the example says: \n        \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n    So, they computed the total toasts as 6 (from drink) and then since there are 3 friends, each friend can make 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n    This leads to the following interpretation:\n\n        The entire group is going to make T toasts. For each toast, each friend gets one set of requirements (nl ml, one slice, np grams). \n\n        Therefore, for T toasts, the total drink required is T * n * nl? But wait, that doesn't match the example:\n\n            Example: n=3, T=6 (total toasts) -> drink needed = 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml, but we have 20 ml.\n\n        Alternatively, the example did not use the entire group for the drink calculation per toast? \n\n    Let me read the problem again: \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n    This could mean that for one toast, each friend drinks nl milliliters. So for T toasts, each friend drinks T * nl milliliters.\n\n    Then the constraints become:\n        Total drink: k*l >= n * (T * nl)   [because n friends each have T * nl]\n        Total lime: c*d >= n * T * 1        [each friend gets one slice per toast, so n*T slices]\n        Total salt: p >= n * T * np\n\n    Then the example:\n        Drink: 20 >= 3 * T * 3  => 20 >= 9T -> T <= 20/9 -> T <= 2 (using floor division)\n        Lime: 80 >= 3 * T * 1 -> T <= 80/3 -> T <= 26\n        Salt: 100 >= 3 * T * 1 -> T <= 100/3 -> T <= 33\n\n    Then T_max = 2 (from drink). Then each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n    But wait, in this interpretation, the total number of toasts is T, and each friend makes T toasts? Then the total toasts is n * T? \n\n    Actually, no: if each friend makes T toasts, then the total toasts is n * T? But then the drink constraint would be: n * T * nl <= k*l.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters for each toast\", so yes, for T toasts per friend, the total drink consumed is n * T * nl.\n\n    But note: the example calculation did:\n\n        Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / (nl * n) = 20/(3*3)=20/9 -> floor 2 toasts per friend? \n\n    However, the example output says 2, and the example calculation was:\n\n        min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\n\n    How did they get 6? They did 20/3 (without multiplying by n). \n\n    There seems to be two interpretations:\n\n    Interpretation 1 (from example calculation):\n        They considered that the entire group's drink consumption for one toast is nl (not multiplied by n). Then:\n            Total toasts from drink: (k*l) // nl\n            Then, because each toast is for the entire group (or maybe the toasts are independent per friend?), they divided by n to get per-friend toasts.\n\n        But then the lime: they did (c*d) // 1 -> that is the total slices, and then divided by n? But wait, no: the example said:\n\n            \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n        Here, 6 (from drink) is the total toasts from drink (if one toast uses nl ml) and then they divide by 3 (n) to get the per-friend toasts.\n\n        Similarly, lime: 80 is the total slices, but one toast requires one slice per friend? Then the total slices required for T toasts is n * T. \n\n        Wait, that doesn't match: if one toast requires one slice per friend, then for T toasts, the total slices is n * T.\n\n        But in the example, they did not account for the n in the lime and salt? \n\n    Interpretation 2 (from the example calculation):\n\n        They calculated the total toasts (for the entire group) as the minimum of:\n            (k*l) // nl   [because one toast uses nl ml, regardless of n?]\n            (c*d)         [because one toast requires one slice, regardless of n?] -> but wait, if one toast requires one slice per friend, then one toast requires n slices. But they used (c*d) without dividing by n.\n\n        Then they divided the total toasts by n to get per-friend toasts.\n\n        However, the lime: if one toast requires one slice per friend, then the total slices needed for T toasts is n * T. So the total toasts T must satisfy: T <= (c*d) / n.\n\n        But in the example, they didn't divide by n for lime. They used 80 (which is c*d) as the total toasts limit from lime.\n\n        This suggests that the problem intended:\n\n            Each toast requires:\n                - drink: nl milliliters (for the entire group? or per friend?)\n\n        The problem statement is ambiguous.\n\n    After reading the example explanation: \n        \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        Here, they are saying that 20 ml is enough to make 6 toasts. Then they say the limes are enough for 80 toasts and the salt for 100 toasts.\n\n        Then they take the minimum (6) and divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2.\n\n    This implies that the entire group's resources are used to make T_total toasts (not per friend). And each toast is for the entire group.\n\n    But then the requirements per toast should be:\n        drink: nl * n\n        lime: 1 * n   (because each friend gets one slice per toast, so n slices)\n        salt: np * n\n\n    Then the example:\n        drink: 20 >= 3 * n * 3 = 3*3*3 = 27? -> no, 20<27 -> so T_total=0? \n\n    Alternatively, the example calculation is not using the entire group per toast. \n\n    Let me try breaking down the example:\n\n        There are 3 friends, 4 bottles of 5 ml: total drink = 20 ml.\n\n        Each toast: each friend drinks 3 ml (nl=3) and uses one lime slice and np=1 gram of salt.\n\n        Then for one toast, the drink consumed is 3 * 3 = 9 ml, lime slices: 3, salt: 3 grams.\n\n        Then the number of toasts (for the entire group) that can be made is:\n            drink: 20 // 9 = 2\n            lime: 80 // 3 = 26\n            salt: 100 // 3 = 33\n        So T_total = 2, then each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        This matches the example output.\n\n        But wait, the example explanation said: \n            \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n        Where did the 6 come from? 20 / 3 = 6.66... -> floor 6.\n\n        Now I see: they might have computed the total toasts if we consider the drink per toast as 3 ml (nl) and then not accounting for the n friends. Then they got 6, and then divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2.\n\n        But if we consider the drink per toast as 3 ml (nl) and then say the entire group's drink consumption per toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml, then we get 20//9=2.\n\n        There are two ways:\n\n        Way 1: \n            Total toasts (for the entire group) is limited by:\n                T_total <= (k*l) // (nl * n)   [if we consider that one toast requires n * nl ml]\n                T_total <= (c*d) // (n)         [if one toast requires n slices]\n                T_total <= p // (np * n)        [if one toast requires n * np grams]\n\n        Then the answer (toasts per friend) is T_total (because each friend is part of T_total toasts).\n\n        But wait, if we do that, then the example:\n\n            T_total_drink = 20 // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n            T_total_lime = 80 // 3 = 26\n            T_total_salt = 100 // 3 = 33\n            T_total = min(2,26,33) = 2\n\n            Then each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        Way 2 (as in the example explanation but then divided by n):\n\n            They computed the total toasts (if we ignore the group size for the resource usage) as:\n                T_total_drink = (k*l) // nl   -> 20//3 = 6\n                T_total_lime = (c*d) // 1      -> 80\n                T_total_salt = p // np         -> 100//1 = 100\n\n            Then they take the minimum (6) and divide by the number of friends (n=3) to get 2.\n\n        Which one is correct?\n\n        The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for each toast.\n\n        This means that for one toast, the entire group (all n friends) will consume:\n            drink: n * nl\n            lime: n * 1\n            salt: n * np\n\n        So the first way is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example calculation used the second way and still got the correct answer. Why?\n\n        Because in the second way, they computed the total toasts (if we assume that the drink is consumed by the entire group as nl per toast) but then that nl per toast is actually for one friend? \n\n        Actually, no. The problem says \"each friend\" so the entire group's drink for one toast is n * nl.\n\n        However, the example explanation did:\n\n            drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n        Why 3? That's nl (3 ml per friend per toast). Then they divided by the number of friends to get the per-friend toasts.\n\n        Alternatively, if we think: the entire group's drink for one toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml, then 20//9=2 toasts.\n\n        But the example explanation says 6 toasts from drink.\n\n        There is a third possibility: the example explanation is wrong? \n\n        Let me check the example input: \n            Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\n        According to the problem, the parameters are: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n        So: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        The example explanation says: \n            drink: 4*5=20, 20/3=6.66 -> 6 toasts.\n\n        Then they say: \n            limes: 10*8=80 -> 80 toasts\n            salt: 100/1=100 toasts\n\n        Then the minimum is 6 toasts for the entire group? But wait, if the entire group is making 6 toasts, then the drink consumed is 6 * (n * nl) = 6 * (3*3)=54 ml, which exceeds 20 ml.\n\n        So the example explanation is inconsistent.\n\n    After re‐reading the problem statement: \n\n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" \n\n        for each toast.\n\n        This means that for each toast, each friend drinks nl milliliters. So for one toast, the drink consumed is n * nl.\n\n        Therefore, the total drink available (k*l) must cover n * T * nl, where T is the total number of toasts (for the entire group).\n\n        Similarly, the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend, so T * n slices.\n\n        Salt: T * n * np.\n\n        Then the maximum T is the minimum of:\n            T <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n            T <= (c*d) / (n * 1)\n            T <= p / (n * np)\n\n        Then the answer is T (the total number of toasts for the entire group) and that is the number of toasts each friend makes? \n\n        Actually, no: the problem asks \"How many toasts can each friend make?\" \n\n        Each friend makes T toasts (because the entire group makes T toasts, and each friend is present in every toast). \n\n        So the answer is T.\n\n        But wait, the example:\n\n            T <= 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 -> 2\n            T <= 80 / (3*1) = 80/3 -> 26\n            T <= 100 / (3*1) = 100/3 -> 33\n\n            Then T = 2.\n\n        Then the output is 2.\n\n        However, the example explanation used a different method and got 2.\n\n        But note: the example explanation said: \n            min(6,80,100) / 3 = 2\n\n        How is 6 computed? 20/3=6.66 -> 6. Then 6/3=2.\n\n        What does 6 represent? If we interpret 6 as the total toasts if we use the drink per friend (nl) and then divide by the number of friends, then:\n\n            Total toasts (if we count by drink per friend) would be: (k*l) // (nl) = 20//3=6.\n\n        Then, since there are 3 friends, the total toasts the entire group can make is 6 (but wait, how?) \n\n        Alternatively, they might be calculating the total toasts as the minimum of (k*l)//nl, (c*d), p//np, and then dividing by n because each friend can only make one toast at a time? \n\n        Actually, the example explanation is confusing.\n\n    Let me try to reconcile:\n\n        Interpretation A (correct by the problem statement): \n            Each toast requires for the entire group: n * nl drink, n * 1 lime, n * np salt.\n\n            Then T = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n*1), p // (n*np) )\n\n        Interpretation B (as in example explanation):\n            First compute the total toasts as if the resources were shared without considering the group size for the toast requirements, then divide by n.\n\n            Step 1: \n                T_drink = (k*l) // nl   [because one toast requires nl ml per friend, but wait, then the entire group's drink for one toast is n*nl, so this step is not matching]\n\n            Actually, if we break the drink requirement: \n                Each friend can make at most (k*l) // (nl) toasts (if we consider the drink per toast for that friend). \n                Then, the entire group's drink constraint would be that no friend can make more than (k*l) // (nl) toasts.\n\n            Similarly, for lime: each friend has c*d slices (but wait, no, the entire group has c*d slices). \n\n            Actually, if we consider per friend:\n\n                For one friend, the drink available is k*l (same for all) and each toast requires nl ml. So one friend can make up to (k*l) // nl toasts.\n\n                But the entire group must have the same number of toasts.\n\n                Additionally, the lime slices: the entire group has c*d slices, and each toast requires one slice per friend. So the entire group's lime slices are c*d, and for T toasts, the entire group needs n * T slices.\n\n                Similarly, salt: the entire group has p grams, and each toast requires np per friend, so n * T * np.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"provided they all drink the same amount\", meaning each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n            So, the limiting factors for each friend individually:\n\n                Drink: (k*l) // nl   [per friend] -> maximum toasts per friend from drink\n                Lime: (c*d) // n      [because the entire group's lime slices are c*d, and each toast uses n slices (one per friend)] -> per friend: (c*d) // n\n                Salt: p // (n*np)     [entire group's salt p, per toast uses n*np]\n\n            Then, the maximum toasts per friend is the minimum of these three.\n\n            Example:\n\n                Drink: 20 // 3 = 6 (per friend)\n                Lime: (10*8) // 3 = 80//3 = 26 (per friend)\n                Salt: 100 // (3*1) = 100//3 = 33 (per friend)\n\n                Then the answer is 6.\n\n            But the example output is 2.\n\n        Now I'm confused.\n\n    After reading the problem statement again: \n\n        \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\n        And the example: \n            Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n            Output: 2\n\n        The example explanation says: \n            \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        But wait, here they are calculating 20/3=6 toasts, but then they say \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\".\n\n        This implies that the 6 toasts is the total toasts for the entire group? Or for one friend?\n\n        Actually, the example explanation is mixing two things:\n\n            They first calculate the total toasts from drink as 20/3=6, but that 6 is the maximum number of toasts that can be made if the drink were the only constraint and if each toast used 3 ml (and the toast was defined independently of the group). \n\n        But the problem requires that the entire group drinks the same amount. \n\n        The key is: the entire group must have the same number of toasts. \n\n        The drink constraint: \n            Total drink available: 20 ml.\n            Each toast (for the entire group) requires 3 ml * 3 friends = 9 ml. \n            So maximum toasts for the entire group is 20 // 9 = 2.\n\n        Then, each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        Alternatively, if we look at the drink per friend: \n            Each friend can make at most 20 // 3 = 6 toasts (if we ignore the others). But the entire group must have the same number of toasts. \n\n            However, the entire group's drink consumption for T toasts (each friend making T toasts) is T * n * nl = T * 3 * 3 = 9T <= 20 -> T<=2.\n\n        So the limiting factor is the entire group's common T.\n\n        Therefore, the correct approach is:\n\n            Let T be the number of toasts per friend.\n\n            Then, the total drink consumed is n * T * nl <= k * l\n            The total lime slices consumed is n * T * 1 <= c * d\n            The total salt consumed is n * T * np <= p\n\n            Then, T <= (k*l) / (n * nl)   [drink]\n            T <= (c*d) / (n)               [lime]\n            T <= p / (n * np)              [salt]\n\n            Then, T_max = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )   [using integer division, floor]\n\n        But wait, the example:\n\n            T <= 20/(3*3) = 20/9 -> 2.22 -> floor 2\n            T <= 80/3 -> 26.66 -> floor 26\n            T <= 100/(3*1)=33.33 -> floor 33\n\n            T_max = 2.\n\n        However, note: the drink condition: 3*3*2 = 18 <=20 -> ok.\n        Lime: 3*2=6 <=80 -> ok.\n        Salt: 3*2*1=6 <=100 -> ok.\n\n        But what if we try T=3?\n            Drink: 3*3*3=27>20 -> not allowed.\n\n        So 2 is correct.\n\n        But why did the example explanation say 6? \n\n        They might have misunderstood the problem. They calculated:\n\n            Without considering the group: \n                drink: 20 // 3 = 6 (toasts if each toast uses 3 ml and we ignore the group size) \n                lime: 80 // 1 = 80\n                salt: 100 // 1 = 100\n\n            Then they took the minimum (6) and then divided by 3 (the group size) to get 2.\n\n        This is coincidentally the same result. \n\n        In general, is it valid to do:\n\n            T_total = min( (k*l) // nl, (c*d) // 1, p // np )\n            Then T_per_friend = T_total // n   ?\n\n        Let's test with the example:\n\n            T_total_drink = 20 // 3 = 6\n            T_total_lime = 80 // 1 = 80\n            T_total_salt = 100 // 1 = 100\n            T_total = 6\n            T_per_friend = 6 // 3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Now, let's test with the second example:\n\n            Input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n            Using the correct method (group constraint):\n\n                T <= (100*10) / (5*4) = 1000 / 20 = 50\n                T <= (1*19) / 5 = 19/5 = 3.8 -> floor 3\n                T <= 90 / (5*3) = 90/15=6\n\n                T_max = 3\n\n            Expected output: 3\n\n            Now, using the example explanation method:\n\n                T_total_drink = (100*10) // 4 = 1000//4 = 250\n                T_total_lime = (1*19) // 1 = 19\n                T_total_salt = 90 // 3 = 30\n\n                T_total = min(250,19,30)=19\n                T_per_friend = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 19//5=3.8 -> floor 3)\n\n            So both methods give 3.\n\n        Now, the third example:\n\n            Input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n            Correct method:\n\n                T <= (1000*1000) / (10*50) = 1000000/500 = 2000\n                T <= (25*23)/10 = 575/10 = 57.5 -> floor 57\n                T <= 1/(10*1)=0.1 -> floor 0\n\n                T_max = 0\n\n            Example output: 0\n\n            Example explanation method:\n\n                T_total_drink = (1000*1000)//50 = 1000000//50 = 20000\n                T_total_lime = (25*23)//1 = 575\n                T_total_salt = 1//1 = 1\n\n                T_total = min(20000,575,1)=1\n                T_per_friend = 1//10 = 0\n\n            Also 0.\n\n        So both methods yield the same result for these examples.\n\n        Why is that?\n\n        Let me prove:\n\n            Method 1 (correct by problem statement):\n                T <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n                T <= (c*d) / n\n                T <= p / (n * np)\n\n            Method 2 (example explanation):\n                T_total = min( (k*l) // nl, (c*d) // 1, p // np )\n                Then T_per_friend = T_total // n\n\n            Is (k*l) // nl == (k*l) // (n*nl) * n + remainder? Not necessarily.\n\n            But note: \n                Condition 1: n * T * nl <= k*l  => T <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n                Condition 2: n * T <= c*d        => T <= (c*d) / n\n                Condition 3: n * T * np <= p     => T <= p / (n*np)\n\n            In Method 2, we are effectively doing:\n\n                T_total_drink = (k*l) // nl   -> this is the maximum number of toasts (each using nl ml) that can be made from the drink, ignoring the group structure (i.e., assuming one toast uses nl ml and there are n friends, but wait, no: the drink is shared by the entire group? Actually, no: the drink is just a total resource.)\n\n            However, note that the entire group's drink is k*l, and each toast (for the entire group) uses n * nl ml. But wait, in Method 2, they are not using the group structure for the drink: they are saying one toast uses nl ml. \n\n            But then the total toasts (for the entire group) that can be made with the drink is (k*l) // (n * nl) [Method 1] vs (k*l) // nl [Method 2] is not directly comparable.\n\n            Actually, the example explanation method is:\n\n                Step 1: Compute the total toasts (ignoring group) for each resource if we assume that one toast uses the amount per friend (nl, 1 slice, np) and then the entire group's resource is k*l, c*d, p.\n\n                Then, the total toasts (for the entire group) would be limited by the most restrictive resource when considering the per-friend requirement.\n\n            But wait, if one toast uses nl ml (per friend), then the entire group's drink for one toast is n * nl. \n\n            However, in Method 2, they are not accounting for the n in the drink, lime, and salt.\n\n            But the calculation of T_total_drink = (k*l) // nl is the total number of friend-toasts (each friend's toast) that can be made from the drink. \n\n            Since there are n friends, the total friend-toasts is n * T, and the drink constraint is n * T * nl <= k*l.\n\n            Then, T (toasts per friend) is the same for all, so the total friend-toasts is n * T.\n\n            Then, from drink: n * T * nl <= k*l  => T <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\n            But from Method 2: \n                T_total_drink = (k*l) // nl   -> this is the maximum number of friend-toasts from drink.\n\n            Then, the total friend-toasts cannot exceed (k*l) // nl.\n\n            And the total friend-toasts is n * T, so n * T <= (k*l) // nl   (using integer division, but note: (k*l)//nl might be fractional, but we use floor)\n\n            Then T <= ((k*l) // nl) // n   [but wait, that is not the same as T <= (k*l) // (n*nl)]\n\n            Example: \n                k*l=20, nl=3, n=3\n                (k*l)//nl = 20//3 = 6\n                Then T <= 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n            But wait, in the drink constraint: T <= 20/(3*3)=2.22 -> 2, so T<=2.\n\n            Now, is 6//3 equal to 20//(3*3)? Not exactly: 20//9=2, and 6//3=2.\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n                n * T <= (k*l) // nl   [if we use integer division, then (k*l)//nl is an integer, and n*T must be <= (k*l)//nl]\n\n            But the actual drink constraint is n*T*nl <= k*l.\n\n            Since n*T*nl is an integer and k*l is an integer, we can write:\n\n                n*T*nl <= k*l\n\n            => T <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n            But when using integer division, we take floor.\n\n            Now, is floor((k*l)/(n*nl)) the same as floor(floor(k*l / nl) / n)?\n\n            Example: k*l=20, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(20/(3*3)) = floor(20/9)=2\n                floor(floor(20/3)/3)=floor(6/3)=2\n\n            Example: k*l=10, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(10/(3*3)) = floor(10/9)=1\n                floor(floor(10/3)/3)=floor(3/3)=1\n\n            Example: k*l=8, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(8/9)=0\n                floor(floor(8/3)/3)=floor(2/3)=0\n\n            Example: k*l=9, nl",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to ensure that all friends drink the same amount and that the resources (drink, lime slices, and salt) are sufficient for the desired number of toasts per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total drink available (k * l milliliters).\n   - Calculating the total lime slices available (c * d).\n   - Calculating the total salt available (p grams).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The limiting factor for the number of toasts is determined by the most constrained resource when considering the entire group. Specifically:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink required for each friend to make T toasts is n * T * nl. This must not exceed the available drink (k * l).\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices required for each friend to make T toasts is n * T * 1 (since each toast requires one slice per friend). This must not exceed the available lime slices (c * d).\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt required for each friend to make T toasts is n * T * np. This must not exceed the available salt (p).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves computing the maximum possible T (toasts per friend) by taking the minimum value derived from each resource constraint. The constraints are:\n   - From drink: T ≤ (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   - From lime: T ≤ (c * d) / n\n   - From salt: T ≤ p / (n * np)\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations (multiplication and division) which are constant time operations O(1). Hence, the solution is efficient with O(1) time and space complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    max_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl) if n * nl != 0 else 0\n    max_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // n if n != 0 else float('inf')\n    max_toasts_salt = p // (n * np) if n * np != 0 else 0\n    \n    ans = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends (n), bottles (k), milliliters per bottle (l), limes (c), slices per lime (d), salt (p), drink per toast (nl), and salt per toast (np).\n2. **Resource Calculation**: \n   - **Total Drink**: Computed as the product of the number of bottles (k) and milliliters per bottle (l).\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Computed as the product of the number of limes (c) and slices per lime (d).\n3. **Constraint Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The maximum toasts from drink is the total drink divided by the drink required per friend per toast (n * nl), using integer division.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The maximum toasts from lime is the total lime slices divided by the number of friends (n), ensuring each friend gets one slice per toast.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The maximum toasts from salt is the total salt divided by the salt required per friend per toast (n * np), using integer division.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum value among the three constraints, representing the maximum number of toasts each friend can make without exceeding any resource limit.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints to determine the feasible number of toasts each friend can partake in, ensuring optimal resource utilization.",
