Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of old candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour and then becomes one burned candle.\n   - After using the initial candles, we can collect all the burned ones to make new candles.\n\n However, note that we can also use the newly made candles and when they burn out, we can combine their leftovers.\n\n Steps:\n Let's denote:\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   leftover = 0   # This will be the number of burned candles we have (which can be converted to new candles)\n\n But note: we can use the burned candles from both the original and the newly lit ones.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n   While we have enough candles (either new or leftover) to light up:\n     total_hours += current_candles   # because we can light as many as we have in this round\n     Then, the burned candles from this round = current_candles (since each burns and becomes one burned)\n\n     Then, we can form new candles from the burned ones: \n        new_candles = burned // b\n        leftover = burned % b\n\n     And then we set current_candles to the new_candles plus any leftover from previous? Actually, we should accumulate the leftover.\n\n However, note: we don't necessarily have to separate the leftovers because after burning the new candles, we get more burned ones.\n\n Another way:\n\n   total = a\n   hours = a\n   while total >= b:\n        new_candles = total // b\n        remainder = total % b\n        hours += new_candles\n        total = new_candles + remainder\n\n   Then output hours.\n\n But let me test with the example: \n   Input: \"4 2\"\n     a=4, b=2\n     Start: total = 4, hours=4\n        First iteration: 4//2=2, remainder=0 -> hours=6, total=2+0=2\n        Second iteration: 2//2=1, remainder=0 -> hours=7, total=1+0=1 -> stop (1<2)\n        Output 7 -> correct.\n\n   Another example: \"6 3\"\n        Start: total=6, hours=6\n        Iteration1: 6//3=2, remainder=0 -> hours=8, total=2\n        Iteration2: 2//3=0, remainder=2 -> stop. Output 8 -> correct.\n\n But wait, what if there is a remainder? \n   Example: \"5 2\" (a=5, b=2)\n        Start: total=5, hours=5\n        Iteration1: 5//2=2, remainder=1 -> hours=7, total=2+1=3\n        Iteration2: 3//2=1, remainder=1 -> hours=8, total=1+1=2\n        Iteration3: 2//2=1, remainder=0 -> hours=9, total=1\n        Then stop.\n\n   Let's verify: \n        Initially 5 candles: 5 hours, then we have 5 burned -> 2 new candles (with 1 leftover)\n        Now we have 2 new candles: 2 hours, and then 2 burned (plus the leftover 1) -> 3 burned in total -> 1 new candle (with 0 leftover from this batch, but we have 3%2=1? Actually, we did 3//2=1 and remainder=1.\n        Then we use the 1 new candle: 1 hour, and now we have 1 burned (from the last candle) and the leftover from the previous step was 1? Actually, no: the previous step had 3 burned, which made 1 new candle and left 1. Then we use that 1 new candle, so we have 1 burned from that one. Then total burned at the end of this step is 1 (from the last candle) plus the leftover 1 from the previous? \n\n   Actually, in our simulation, we are accumulating the remainder. The process is:\n\n        Step0: We start with 5 candles (new). We burn them all: 5 hours. Then we have 5 burned.\n        Step1: From 5 burned, we make 5//2 = 2 new candles, and leftover 1. So we add 2 hours (from the 2 new candles). Then we have 2 new candles and 1 leftover burned.\n        Step2: We burn the 2 new candles: 2 hours. Then we have 2 burned from these, plus the leftover 1 -> total 3 burned.\n                Then we make 3//2 = 1 new candle, and leftover 1. So we add 1 hour. Then we have 1 new candle and 1 leftover burned.\n        Step3: We burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour. Then we have 1 burned from that, plus the leftover 1 -> total 2 burned.\n                Then we make 2//2 = 1 new candle, and leftover 0. So we add 1 hour. Then we have 1 new candle and 0 leftover.\n        Step4: Burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour. Then we have 1 burned, which is less than 2 -> stop.\n\n        Total hours: 5 (step0) + 2 (step1) + 1 (step2) + 1 (step3) + 1 (step4) = 10.\n\n   But according to our code:\n\n        total = 5, hours=5\n        Iteration1: new_candles=5//2=2, remainder=1 -> hours=7, total=2+1=3\n        Iteration2: new_candles=3//2=1, remainder=1 -> hours=8, total=1+1=2\n        Iteration3: new_candles=2//2=1, remainder=0 -> hours=9, total=1+0=1 -> stop.\n\n        Output 9, but expected is 10.\n\n   What went wrong? In the code, we are only counting the new candles in the current iteration as the ones we burn, but note that the leftover from the previous burned candles is also being considered in the next iteration. However, the mistake is that in the first iteration we use the 5 candles (burned) to make 2 new and leave 1. Then we have 2 new candles to burn, which gives 2 more hours. Then we combine the 2 burned from the new candles and the leftover 1 to get 3, which makes 1 new and leaves 1. Then we burn the 1 new candle (so 1 hour) and then we have 1 burned from that and the leftover 1, so 2 burned. Then we make 1 new. Then we burn the 1 new (1 hour) and then we have 1 burned (and no leftover from the previous because we just used the 2 to make the last one). \n\n   The code does not account for the fact that we are burning the new candles in the same cycle and then the leftover is carried over. But actually, the code does:\n\n        hours = a (the initial burning of a candles)\n        Then in the loop, we are burning all the current candles (which are the new ones we made and the leftover from previous) and then we count the new candles from the total burned (which includes the leftover).\n\n   However, the problem is that the initial burning is done separately. In reality, the process is continuous. We need to consider that we burn all the candles we have, and then we get as many new candles as the total burned divided by b, and the leftover is the remainder.\n\n   But note: the initial a candles are burned, and then we get a burned candles. Then we use those to make a//b new candles and have a % b leftover. Then we burn the new candles (a//b) and get that many burned, and then we combine with the leftover.\n\n   The code above does exactly that. Why did it give 9 for \"5 2\" and not 10?\n\n   Let me break down the code for \"5 2\":\n\n        Step0: hours = 5, total = 5\n        Step1: \n            new_candles = 5 // 2 = 2, remainder = 1\n            hours = 5 + 2 = 7\n            total = 2 + 1 = 3\n        Step2:\n            new_candles = 3 // 2 = 1, remainder = 1\n            hours = 7 + 1 = 8\n            total = 1 + 1 = 2\n        Step3:\n            new_candles = 2 // 2 = 1, remainder = 0\n            hours = 8 + 1 = 9\n            total = 1 + 0 = 1 -> loop ends.\n\n   But wait, in reality, after step3 we have 1 candle (from the last conversion) and we burn that, so we should get one more hour. But in the code, we are not burning the candle we just created in the same iteration? \n\n   Actually, the code counts the burning in the next iteration. But note: the condition is \"while total >= b\". In the third iteration, we set total=1, which is <2, so we break. But the hour from burning that last candle is not counted.\n\n   However, in the third iteration we burned the 2 candles (from the second iteration) and got 2 burned, which is then converted to 1 new candle. Then we set total=1. But we haven't burned that 1 candle yet. \n\n   The code structure:\n\n        hours = a   [we burned the initial a candles]\n        total = a   [then we process the burned ones]\n\n        Then in the loop, we are effectively burning the 'total' candles (which are the new ones we made from the burned ones, and the leftover) and then we get new_candles from that total.\n\n        But note: the burning of the 'total' candles is accounted for in the next iteration? Actually, the way we count is:\n\n          We start by burning the initial a, so we have a hours and then we have a burned.\n\n          Then we use the a burned to make new_candles = a//b, and we have remainder. Then we add new_candles (which is the hour from burning those new_candles) and then we set total to the new_candles plus the remainder (which is the burned from the new_candles and the leftover).\n\n        However, the burning of the new_candles is happening in the same time frame as the next hour? Actually, we are simulating:\n\n          Hour 0: we have a candles, we burn them -> a hours, then we have a burned.\n          Then we use the a burned to make floor(a/b) new candles, and we have a % b burned left (which we cannot use until we have more).\n\n          Now, we have floor(a/b) new candles. We can burn these in the next floor(a/b) hours. So we add floor(a/b) to the total hours.\n\n          Then we have burned from these new candles: floor(a/b) burned, and we also have the leftover a % b. So the total burned we have now is floor(a/b) + a % b.\n\n          Then we repeat.\n\n        So the code is correctly adding the new_candles (which is the floor(total/b)) as the hours from burning the candles we made from the previous burned ones.\n\n        But in the example \"5 2\", the breakdown:\n\n          Initial: 5 candles -> 5 hours. Then we have 5 burned.\n          Then we make 2 new candles (from 5//2) and 1 leftover. Then we burn the 2 new candles: 2 hours. So total hours=7.\n          Then we have 2 burned from the new candles plus the leftover 1 -> 3 burned.\n          Then we make 3//2 = 1 new candle and 1 leftover. Then we burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour. So total hours=8.\n          Then we have 1 burned from the last candle plus the leftover 1 -> 2 burned.\n          Then we make 2//2=1 new candle and 0 leftover. Then we burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour. So total hours=9.\n          Then we have 1 burned, which isn't enough.\n\n        So the code gives 9, but the manual calculation above gave 10? \n\n        Wait, let me recount manually:\n\n          Step0: 5 candles -> burn 5 hours, then 5 burned.\n          Step1: Use 5 burned -> 2 new candles (since 5//2=2) and 1 leftover. Then burn the 2 new candles: 2 hours -> total 7. Now we have 2 burned from these 2, so total burned available = 2 + 1 (leftover) = 3.\n          Step2: Use 3 burned -> 1 new candle (3//2=1) and 1 leftover. Then burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour -> total 8. Now we have 1 burned from that one, so total burned available = 1 + 1 (leftover) = 2.\n          Step3: Use 2 burned -> 1 new candle (2//2=1) and 0 leftover. Then burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour -> total 9. Now we have 1 burned, which is insufficient.\n\n        So the code is correct, and the manual calculation I did earlier was wrong because I thought we burned the last candle and then tried to use it again, but we don't. We stop when we have less than b burned to make a new one.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: Vasily lights up a new candle, which burns for an hour and then goes out. He can use the burned ones to make new ones. The process is continuous until he doesn't have enough burned ones to make a new candle.\n\n   But wait, in the last step we burn the candle and then we have one burned. We don't use it to make a new one because we need b burned to make one. So we stop.\n\n   So the answer for \"5 2\" is 9.\n\n   Let me check with the sample provided in the problem: \n        Input: ['4 2', '6 3'] -> Output: ['7','8']\n\n   Our code produces 7 and 8, which matches.\n\n   Another example: a=1, b=2 -> we can only burn 1 candle, then we have 1 burned which is less than 2 -> so 1 hour.\n\n   Code: \n        hours = 1, total=1 -> since 1<2, we break -> output 1.\n\n   Another example: a=2, b=2 -> \n        Start: hours=2, total=2\n        Then 2//2=1, remainder=0 -> hours=3, total=1 -> break. Output 3.\n\n   Let's verify: \n        Burn 2 candles: 2 hours. Then 2 burned -> make 1 new. Then burn that 1: 1 hour. Then we have 1 burned, which isn't enough. Total 3.\n\n   It seems correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle\". So if we have b burned, we can make one new. The process is that we burn all the candles we have (both the initial and the ones we made) and then we use the total burned to make new ones.\n\n   The code above is:\n\n        total = a\n        hours = a\n        while total >= b:\n            new_candles = total // b\n            remainder = total % b\n            hours += new_candles\n            total = new_candles + remainder\n\n   But note: the variable 'total' is the number of candles we have at the beginning of the next cycle (which are the new ones we made and the leftover from the previous cycle). However, in the burning process, we are burning all the candles we have (the 'total' in the current cycle) and then we get 'total' burned, which is then used to make new ones.\n\n   This is correct because:\n\n        At the beginning of a cycle, we have 'total' candles (which were either originally provided or made from previous burned ones).\n        We burn them all: that gives us 'total' hours (but wait, we are not adding 'total' hours here, we are adding the new_candles we make from the burned ones, which is total//b, and that comes from burning the 'total' candles).\n\n        Actually, the burning of the 'total' candles happens in the current cycle, and we are going to count that in the next iteration? \n\n   Let me reframe:\n\n        We start with a candles. We burn them: that's a hours. Then we have a burned.\n\n        Then we use the a burned to make new_candles = a//b, and we have remainder = a % b.\n\n        Then we have new_candles candles (and we still have the remainder, which is burned but not enough to make a new candle). \n\n        Now, we can burn these new_candles candles: that gives new_candles hours.\n\n        Then we have burned from these new_candles: new_candles, so total burned now is new_candles + remainder.\n\n        Then we use that total burned to make more candles.\n\n        So the code adds new_candles (the hours from burning the new_candles) and then uses the total burned (which is the sum of the burned from the new_candles and the remainder) to make more candles.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correctly accounting for the hours from burning the candles we made.\n\n   However, note that the initial burning is done separately. But the subsequent burnings are done by the loop.\n\n   We can also write it without separating the initial:\n\n        total = a\n        hours = 0\n        while total > 0:\n            # Burn as many as we have\n            hours += total   # because we can burn all the candles we have\n            # Now, we have total burned candles (from the ones we just burned)\n            # Then, we convert them to new candles: total // b new candles, and total % b leftover\n            new_candles = total // b\n            remainder = total % b\n            total = new_candles + remainder   # for the next cycle\n\n        But wait, in this version, we would count the initial a candles as burning and then the new ones and so on. However, we must note that after burning the initial a, we get a burned candles, but then we use the burned ones to make new ones. In this version, we are burning the current total (which is the candles we have) and then we set the next total to the new candles we made (from the burned) plus the remainder. \n\n        Let's test with \"4 2\":\n\n            Start: total=4, hours=0\n            Iteration1: \n                hours = 0+4 = 4\n                new_candles = 4//2=2, remainder=0 -> total=2\n            Iteration2:\n                hours = 4+2 = 6\n                new_candles = 2//2=1, remainder=0 -> total=1\n            Iteration3:\n                hours = 6+1 = 7\n                new_candles = 1//2=0, remainder=1 -> total=0+1=1? Wait, but we break the loop when total becomes 0? Actually, the condition is while total>0, so we do iteration3 and then set total=1, then iteration4:\n                hours = 7+1 = 8\n                new_candles=1//2=0, remainder=1 -> total=1\n            This would run forever.\n\n        So that version is incorrect because we are burning the new candles (which we just made) and then we have to account for the burned from the entire set.\n\n        Actually, the problem is that in the initial version, we did the initial burning separately and then started the loop with the burned ones. But in the alternative version, we are burning the current total (which is the candles we have) and then we are using the burned from that burning to make new ones. However, the burned from the current total is exactly the total (because each candle burns and becomes one burned). But then we are making new_candles = total//b and leaving remainder = total % b.\n\n        Then the next total should be the new_candles (because we have new_candles candles to burn) and we also have the remainder (which is burned but not used). But note: the remainder is burned and not used, so we don't burn them again until we have enough. However, in the next cycle, we are going to have the new_candles (which are the candles we can burn) and the remainder (which is just leftover). But the process requires that we combine all burned candles to make new ones. \n\n        The key is that the burned candles are collected and then we make new ones. In the alternative version, we are not accounting for the fact that the burned candles from the current cycle (which is the entire total) are then used to make new ones, and then we have the new ones and the leftover. However, the alternative version does:\n\n            total = a   (the candles we have to burn)\n            hours = 0\n\n            while total > 0:\n                hours += total   # we burn all the candles we have\n                # Then, we use the burned (which is total) to make new ones\n                new_candles = total // b\n                remainder = total % b\n                total = new_candles + remainder   # for the next cycle: we have new_candles (which we will burn in the next cycle) and the remainder (which we keep)\n\n        But wait, after burning the current total, we have total burned, and then we make new_candles and leave remainder. Then we set total to the new_candles (for the next cycle) plus the remainder (which is the unused burned). However, the remainder is not burned in the next cycle until we have enough? Actually, we are allowed to mix them. \n\n        But note: the problem says we can use the burned ones to make new ones. We don't have to burn the new ones immediately. However, the process is: we burn as many as we have (so we burn the new_candles we just made and the leftover from previous cycles) in the next cycle. But the alternative version is burning the entire total (including the new_candles and the leftover) in the same cycle? \n\n        Actually, the alternative version is burning the entire set of candles we have (which are the new ones and the leftover from previous cycles) and then we use the total burned (which is the entire total) to make new ones.\n\n        However, the problem is that we are allowed to use the burned ones from the previous cycles (the leftover) to help make new ones. But the alternative version does that.\n\n        But the issue is that in the alternative version, we are burning the candles we have and then we use the burned ones (from the entire set) to make new ones. That is the correct process.\n\n        Now, let's test \"4 2\" with the alternative version:\n\n            Start: total=4, hours=0\n            Iteration1: \n                hours = 4\n                new_candles = 4//2=2, remainder=0\n                total = 2+0 = 2\n            Iteration2:\n                hours = 4+2 = 6\n                new_candles = 2//2=1, remainder=0\n                total = 1+0 = 1\n            Iteration3:\n                hours = 6+1 = 7\n                new_candles = 1//2=0, remainder=1\n                total = 0+1 = 1\n            Iteration4:\n                hours = 7+1 = 8\n                new_candles = 1//2=0, remainder=1\n                total = 1\n\n        This goes on forever. Why? Because in iteration3, we set total=1, and then in iteration4 we burn 1 candle (so add 1 hour) and then we have 1 burned, which is not enough to make a new one, so we set total = 0+1 = 1, and then we do the same again.\n\n        The problem is that the burned candles from the last candle (the one we just burned) are 1, and we add that to the remainder from the previous cycle (which was 0) so we have 1. But we don't use that to make a new candle because 1 < b (which is 2). However, the alternative version does not account for the fact that we are accumulating the burned from every cycle. \n\n        Actually, in the alternative version, the total after burning is the number of candles we have (which are the ones we will burn in the next cycle) and the burned from the current cycle is the entire total (so we are effectively recycling the burned). But the mistake is that we are not using the burned from the current cycle to make new ones until the next cycle. \n\n        However, the alternative version is correct in the process: \n            We burn the entire set of candles we have (which is the new ones and the leftover) and then we use the total burned (which is the same as the total we just burned) to make new ones. \n\n        But note: the total burned is the entire set of candles we had at the beginning of the cycle. So if we have 1 candle, we burn it and get 1 burned. Then we use that 1 burned to make 0 new and leave 1. Then we have 1 candle again (from the leftover) to burn. \n\n        This is correct: we can keep burning one candle at a time if we have one burned, but we never get a full set to make a new one. However, the problem does not require that we use the burned candles from the same cycle to make new ones during the same cycle. We use the burned candles from a cycle to make new ones that will be burned in the next cycle.\n\n        But the alternative version is burning the entire set and then making new ones from the entire burned set (which is the entire set). Then the next set is the new ones plus the remainder. \n\n        The issue is that the alternative version counts the burning of the last candle (the one that leaves a remainder) again and again. \n\n        How to fix the alternative version? \n\n        Actually, the alternative version is correct if we break the loop when we don't have enough to make a new candle, but note: we are allowed to burn the candles we have even if we cannot make a new one from the burned. The process stops when we don't have enough burned to make a new candle. \n\n        However, the alternative version does not break when the total burned (which is the entire set) is less than b? Actually, we break when total==0. But we set total = new_candles + remainder, and new_candles might be 0 and remainder might be positive. Then we continue.\n\n        We should break when we don't have enough to make a new candle, meaning that after making new_candles, we don't have enough to start the next cycle? \n\n        Actually, the condition to continue is that we have at least b burned to make one new candle. But note: we are burning the candles and then we are using the burned ones. The condition for continuing is that the total burned (from the current cycle) is at least b. However, the alternative version uses the entire set (which is the candles we have) to burn and then we use the entire set as burned. But the entire set is the candles we have, and we can only make new ones if the entire set (the burned) is at least b.\n\n        But the alternative version does not check that; it continues as long as total>0.\n\n        How about changing the condition to break when total < b? \n\n        In the alternative version, we break when total < b? But wait, we can still burn the candles if we have any, even if we cannot make a new one. The problem is that we want to count the burning of the candles we have, even if we cannot make a new one. \n\n        Actually, the burning process continues until we have no candles. But we can only burn if we have candles. The condition to break is when we have 0 candles. \n\n        However, the alternative version sets total to new_candles + remainder, and if we have less than b, then new_candles is 0 and total becomes remainder (which is the burned from the current cycle). Then we burn that remainder (if positive) and then we set total to 0 + (remainder from the next cycle) and so on.\n\n        This leads to an infinite loop if the remainder is positive and less than b, because we keep burning one candle and getting one burned, which is not enough to make a new one, but we still have a candle to burn (the remainder from the previous cycle) and then we get one more burned, etc.\n\n        Actually, the alternative version does not model the process correctly because the burned from the current cycle is the entire set (which is the candles we had) and then we use that entire set to make new ones. Then the next set is the new ones plus the remainder. \n\n        But note: the burned candles are the entire set, so if we have 1 candle, we burn it and get 1 burned. Then we try to make new ones: 1//b = 0, so we leave 1. Then we set total=1. Then we burn that 1 and get 1 burned again. \n\n        This is correct: we can burn the candle and then we have the burned candle (which is 1) and we cannot make a new one, but we don't need to because we already burned the candle. The next cycle we have 1 candle (from the leftover) and we burn it again. \n\n        However, the problem is that the burned candle from the current cycle is the entire set (the candles we had) and then we use that entire set to make new ones. But we are allowed to use the burned candles from multiple cycles. \n\n        The process is:\n\n            Cycle0: We have a candles. We burn them -> a hours, then we have a burned.\n            Then we make a//b new candles and leave a % b.\n\n            Cycle1: We have a//b + a % b candles. We burn them -> (a//b + a % b) hours, then we have (a//b + a % b) burned.\n            Then we make (a//b+a % b)//b new candles and leave (a//b+a % b)%b.\n\n        But the alternative version is doing:\n\n            total = a\n            hours = 0\n            while total > 0:\n                hours += total\n                new_candles = total // b\n                remainder = total % b\n                total = new_candles + remainder\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n\n            Cycle0: total = a, hours = a, then total = a//b + a % b\n            Cycle1: total = a//b + a % b, hours = a + (a//b + a % b), then total = (a//b + a % b)//b + (a//b + a % b)%b\n\n        But note: the burned from cycle0 is a, and we use that to make new ones. The burned from cycle1 is the entire set we had at the beginning of cycle1 (which is a//b + a % b). \n\n        However, the problem states that we can use all the burned candles (from cycle0 and cycle1) together to make new ones. But in the alternative version, we are using the burned from cycle0 to make the candles for cycle1, and then the burned from cycle1 to make the candles for cycle2. \n\n        The two versions are actually the same. The first version (the one we initially wrote) is:\n\n            total = a\n            hours = a\n            while total >= b:\n                new_candles = total // b\n                remainder = total % b\n                hours += new_candles\n                total = new_candles + remainder\n\n        The alternative version is:\n\n            total = a\n            hours = 0\n            while total > 0:\n                hours += total\n                new_candles = total // b\n                remainder = total % b\n                total = new_candles + remainder\n\n        These two versions are different. In the first version, we do not burn the new_candles and the remainder in the same cycle? Actually, the first version separates the initial burning and then the subsequent burnings are the new_candles we made. But the alternative version burns everything (the new_candles and the remainder) in the same cycle.\n\n        Which one is correct?\n\n        Consider: \n            In the first version, we burn the initial a candles (so we get a hours) and then we use the a burned to make new_candles. Then we burn the new_candles (so we get new_candles hours) and then we use the burned from the new_candles plus the remainder to make the next set.\n\n        In the alternative version, we burn the initial a candles and then we use the a burned to make new_candles, and then we also burn the new_candles and the remainder? No, wait: the alternative version does:\n\n            Cycle0: \n                total = a, burn a candles -> a hours, then we have a burned, then we make new_candles = a//b and remainder = a % b, then set total = new_candles + remainder.\n\n            Cycle1:\n                Now, we burn the total (which is new_candles + remainder) candles -> (new_candles+remainder) hours, then we have (new_candles+remainder) burned, then we make new_candles2 = (new_candles+remainder)//b and remainder2 = (new_candles+remainder)%b, then set total = new_candles2 + remainder2.\n\n        But note: the burned from cycle0 is a, and we use that to make new_candles. Then in cycle1, we burn the new_candles and the remainder from cycle0. Then the burned from cycle1 is new_candles+remainder (which is the total candles we had in cycle1). Then we use that to make new ones.\n\n        However, the first version does:\n\n            Cycle0: burn a -> a hours, then use a burned to make new_candles = a//b and remainder = a % b, then set total = new_candles+remainder.\n            Cycle1: burn new_candles (which is a//b) -> a//b hours, then we have a//b burned from cycle1 plus the remainder from cycle0 (a % b) -> total burned = a//b + a % b = a (same as cycle0). Then we make new_candles2 = (a//b+a % b)//b = a//b//? Actually, no: we are not using the total burned from cycle1 and cycle0 together? \n\n        Actually, the first version does not combine the burned from cycle0 and cycle1. It only uses the burned from the current cycle to make the next candles.\n\n        But the problem allows combining all the burned candles (from all cycles) together. \n\n        Example: a=3, b=2.\n\n        First version:\n\n            Start: total=3, hours=3\n            Iteration1: \n                new_candles = 3//2 = 1, remainder=1\n                hours=4, total=1+1=2\n            Iteration2: \n                new_candles=2//2=1, remainder=0\n                hours=5, total=1\n\n            Then stop.\n\n        Alternative version:\n\n            Start: total=3, hours=0\n            Iteration1: \n                hours=3, new_candles=3//2=1, remainder=1, total=2\n            Iteration2:\n                hours=3+2=5, new_candles=2//2=1, remainder=0, total=1\n            Iteration3:\n                hours=5+1=6, new_candles=1//2=0, remainder=1, total=1\n            ... infinite.\n\n        But wait, the correct process for a=3, b=2:\n\n            We start with 3 candles: burn for 3 hours, then we have 3 burned.\n            We make 3//2=1 new candle and have 1 leftover.\n            Then we burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour, so total 4 hours. Then we have 1 burned from that and 1 leftover -> 2 burned.\n            Then we make 2//2=1 new candle: 1 hour, so total 5 hours. Then we have 1 burned from that, which is not enough.\n\n            So the correct answer is 5.\n\n        The first version gives 5, the alternative version (if we break when total>=b) would also give 5, but the alternative version without the condition breaks and then continues to burn the leftover one candle again and again.\n\n        Actually, the alternative version does not break when total>=b, but we can modify it to break when we cannot make any new candles and there are no leftover? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the first version because it is more straightforward and matches the intended process.\n\n        Conclusion: use the first version.\n\n        However, the first version does not account for the fact that we can combine the burned from multiple cycles. But note: the first version does combine them because the 'total' is the new candles plus the leftover from the previous cycle, and then we burn that total and then we use the entire burned (which is the total) to make new ones. \n\n        In the first version, the 'total' is the number of candles we have (which are the new ones we made and the leftover).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. Vasily can then combine `b` burned candles to create a new candle. The process continues until there are not enough burned candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` candles, which will be burned immediately, contributing `a` hours.\n2. **Recycling Burned Candles**: After burning the initial candles, collect all burned candles (which is `a`). Use these burned candles to create as many new candles as possible (`a // b`), leaving some leftover burned candles (`a % b`).\n3. **Subsequent Burning**: Burn the newly created candles, adding their count to the total hours. The burned candles from this new set, combined with any leftovers, are used to create more candles in the next iteration.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are enough burned candles (at least `b`) to create a new candle. Once fewer than `b` burned candles remain, the process stops, and the accumulated hours are the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning candles and recycling the burned ones into new candles until no more new candles can be made.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = a\n    hours = a\n    while total >= b:\n        new_candles = total // b\n        remainder = total % b\n        hours += new_candles\n        total = new_candles + remainder\n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The variables `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed for a new candle) are read from input.\n2. **Initial Burning**: The initial `a` candles are burned, contributing `a` hours to the total.\n3. **Recycling Loop**: While there are at least `b` burned candles (stored in `total`), the loop continues:\n   - **New Candles Calculation**: The number of new candles that can be made is `total // b`, and the remainder is `total % b`.\n   - **Update Hours**: The new candles' burning hours (`new_candles`) are added to the total hours.\n   - **Update Total Burned Candles**: The new `total` becomes the sum of new candles and the remainder from the previous step.\n4. **Output**: Once the loop exits (when `total < b`), the accumulated `hours` is printed, representing the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by iteratively recycling burned candles into new ones, ensuring optimal use of available resources until no further candles can be created.",
