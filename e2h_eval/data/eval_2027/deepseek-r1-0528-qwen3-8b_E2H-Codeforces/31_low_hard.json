Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, and then a list of n integers (the found cards) in the second line.\n\n The problem: We have infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x. We found n cards (with numbers that are in the range [-x, x]). We want to choose the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum of all the cards (found ones plus the chosen ones) is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to make the total sum zero by adding some cards (each card can be any integer between -x and x). We are allowed to use as many as we want of each.\n\n Observation:\n   We are allowed to use any card value from -x to x. So, the goal is to cover the deficit (if S is positive, we need negative cards; if S is negative, we need positive cards) with the fewest number of cards.\n\n However, note: We might also consider that we can use both positive and negative cards to adjust the sum.\n\n But note: We are only concerned with the minimum number of cards to add.\n\n Let deficit = -S (if S is positive, deficit is negative? Actually, let's define: we need the total sum to be 0, so the additional cards must sum to -S.\n\n However, we can break down:\n\n   If S == 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n   Otherwise, we need to achieve a total of 0, so we need to add a set of cards that sum to -S.\n\n   The constraint on each card: |card| <= x.\n\n   We want to minimize the number of cards.\n\n How?\n\n   We can use the following idea:\n\n   Since we can choose any integers in [-x, x], we can use the largest absolute value to reduce the deficit as much as possible.\n\n   Consider: \n     If we need to add a positive amount, we can use as many positive x as needed (but we might also use negative ones if that leads to fewer cards? Actually, no: because if we need to cover a positive deficit (i.e., we need to add a positive sum), then using negative cards would only make it worse. Similarly, for negative deficit.)\n\n   However, wait: what if we need to cover a deficit of 5 and x=3?\n      Option 1: Use two cards: 3 and 2 -> but 2 is allowed (since |2|<=3). So two cards: 3+2=5.\n      Option 2: Or one card: 5? But 5 is not allowed because x=3. So we cannot use 5.\n\n   Actually, we can use the maximum absolute value: x. But note, we can also use negative and positive arbitrarily.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. So we can use:\n\n        Let d = -S (the target sum we need to achieve by adding cards)\n\n        We want to represent d as a linear combination of integers in the range [-x, x] with the minimum number of terms.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use any integer, so we can use the same card multiple times.\n\n   This becomes: what is the minimum number k such that there exists integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (each in [-x, x]) so that a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_k = d?\n\n   This is similar to the coin change problem but with coins being every integer from -x to x (which is a lot) and we want the minimum number of coins to get the target d.\n\n   However, note that we are allowed to use any integer in [-x,x]. This set includes both positive and negative. But observe:\n\n   We can also think of it as: we want to cover d with steps of at most x (in absolute value) but we can go both ways.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note:\n\n     The maximum absolute value we can cover with k cards is k*x (by taking k cards of x or -x). But we can also mix signs.\n\n   Actually, we can use the following greedy approach:\n\n     We are allowed to use any integer. So the best way is to use the largest step (in absolute value) we can.\n\n     However, note: we can use negative and positive arbitrarily. The key is that we can use two types of moves: positive and negative, but we are free to choose.\n\n     Let's reframe: We need to achieve d with the minimum number of cards.\n\n     Since we can use any integer from -x to x, the maximum absolute value we can achieve with k cards is k*x. But actually, we can also use negative steps.\n\n     However, note: we can also",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the current sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Determine Additional Cards Needed**: If the sum is not zero, we need to find the smallest number of cards such that their sum equals the negative of the current sum. The key insight here is that each additional card can contribute at most ±x to the sum. Therefore, the minimum number of cards required is determined by how much the deficit (the absolute value of the current sum) can be covered by using the maximum possible step size (x) per card.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    \n    if total_sum == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    deficit = abs(total_sum)\n    \n    if deficit <= x:\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        k = deficit // x\n        remainder = deficit % x\n        \n        if remainder == 0:\n            print(k)\n        else:\n            print(k + 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers (n and x) followed by a list of n integers representing the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is calculated. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Deficit Handling**: The absolute value of the sum (deficit) is computed. If the deficit can be covered by a single card (i.e., deficit ≤ x), then the answer is 1.\n4. **Multiple Cards Calculation**: For larger deficits, the number of cards required is determined by dividing the deficit by x. If there is a remainder after division, an additional card is needed to cover the remaining amount. The result is the quotient plus one if there's a remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimum number of cards needed by leveraging the maximum step size (x) per card, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
