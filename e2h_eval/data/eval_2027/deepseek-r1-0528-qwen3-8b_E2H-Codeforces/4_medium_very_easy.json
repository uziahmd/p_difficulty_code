The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: \n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   string A (Nikephoros' sequence) and string B (Polycarpus' sequence)\n\n Since the sequences are cyclic, we can think of the i-th round (0-indexed) as:\n   a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b = B[i % len(B)]\n\n But note: n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the n rounds into complete cycles of the two sequences. However, note that the two sequences have different lengths.\n\n Let L1 = len(A), L2 = len(B). The combined cycle would be LCM(L1, L2) but since L1, L2 <= 1000, the LCM might be too large to consider as a cycle (but actually we can use the concept of overlapping cycles).\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the outcome for one full cycle of both sequences (i.e., the least common multiple of m and k) and then multiply by the number of complete cycles, and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\n However, note: the round i uses index i % m for A and i % k for B. The state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds? Actually, the pair (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the outcomes for all pairs (a, b) where a in A and b in B. But note: we have two sequences that are played in order. However, we are only concerned with the outcome of a single round.\n\n 2. We can define a function that, given a and b, returns:\n      -1 if Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses, meaning one red spot for Polycarpus)\n       1 if Polycarpus wins (so one red spot for Nikephoros)\n       0 for draw.\n\n    According to the rules:\n        Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n        Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n        Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n    So:\n        If a == b: 0\n        Else:\n            (a, b) = (R, S) -> R beats S -> Nikephoros wins (return 1) -> then Polycarpus gets a red spot? \n            But wait: the problem says: the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser and gets a red spot.\n\n            Similarly, if Polycarpus wins, then Nikephororos gets a red spot.\n\n    Therefore, let's map:\n        outcome(a, b):\n            if a == b: 0\n            elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                return 1   # meaning Polycarpus loses (so Nikephoros wins) -> add one to Polycarpus's red spots?\n            else:\n                return -1   # meaning Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus wins) -> add one to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n    But wait: the problem asks for the number of red spots on both players.\n\n    In each round:\n        If outcome is 1 (Nikephoros wins): then Polycarpus gets one red spot.\n        If outcome is -1 (Polycarpus wins): then Nikephoros gets one red spot.\n\n    Alternatively, we can say:\n        Let f(i) = 1 if Polycarpus wins round i (then we count one for Nikephoros)\n        Let f(i) = -1 if Nikephoros wins round i (then we count one for Polycarpus)\n\n    Then:\n        Total red spots for Nikephoros = number of rounds where f(i) = -1\n        Total red spots for Polycarpus = number of rounds where f(i) = 1\n\n 3. How to count without iterating n rounds?\n\n    We can consider the two sequences as two independent cycles. The outcome for round i depends on (A[i % m], B[i % k]).\n\n    The entire game is determined by the indices (i mod m, i mod k). The total distinct states is m * k, but note that the same state (same pair (a, b)) may appear at different i, and we can precompute the outcome for each distinct pair.\n\n    However, we cannot iterate over n rounds (which is up to 2e9). Instead, we can use the following:\n\n    Let T = LCM(m, k). Then the pattern of outcomes will repeat every T rounds. But note: T might be very large (up to 1e6 because m,k<=1000, then LCM(m,k) <= 10^6? Actually, worst-case LCM(997, 1000) is about 10^6). \n\n    However, 2e9 / T might still be large, but we can do:\n\n        total_red_Nike = 0\n        total_red_Poly = 0\n\n        Let base = T (the length of the cycle)\n        cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n        Then we can precompute the outcome for each round from 0 to T-1, and then:\n            total_red_Nike += cycles * (number of rounds in the cycle where outcome=-1)\n            total_red_Poly += cycles * (number of rounds in the cycle where outcome=1)\n\n        Then, we simulate the remaining 'remainder' rounds.\n\n    But wait: T = LCM(m, k) might be too big to simulate all T rounds? Because T can be as large as 1000*1000 (if m=1000, k=1000, then LCM(1000,1000)=1000, but worst-case for two numbers around 1000: the LCM can be up to 1000*1000/1 (if they are coprime) which is 1e6, which is acceptable because we can iterate 1e6 rounds (since 1e6 is 1 million). \n\n    However, note that n can be up to 2e9, but we are only simulating T (which is at most 1e6) and then the remainder (which is less than T, so at most 1e6). So the maximum we simulate is 2e6 rounds, which is acceptable.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, then A, then B.\n        Step 2: m = len(A), k = len(B)\n        Step 3: Compute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // GCD(m, k)\n\n        Step 4: Precompute an array `outcomes` for i in range(T):\n                j = i % m   # index for A\n                l = i % k   # index for B\n                a_char = A[j]\n                b_char = B[l]\n                Then determine the outcome as described.\n\n        But note: we are effectively going through T rounds, and T can be up to 1000*1000 (worst-case 1e6) which is acceptable.\n\n        Step 5: Count in the cycle:\n                Let cycle_Nike = count of outcomes that are -1 (i.e., when outcome=-1, meaning Nikephoros loses, so Polycarpus wins, so one red spot for Nikephoros? Wait, no: \n                Actually, we defined:\n                    outcome=1: Polycarpus loses (so one red spot for Nikephoros)\n                    outcome=-1: Nikephoros loses (so one red spot for Polycarpus)\n\n                So we want:\n                    In the cycle, count the number of rounds where outcome=-1 (these are the rounds where Nikephoros loses, so we add to Polycarpus's red spots) and outcome=1 (rounds where Polycarpus loses, so we add to Nikephoros's red spots).\n\n                Alternatively, we can store two counts per cycle:\n                    count_Nike_cycle = number of times outcome=-1 (each time Nikephoros loses, so adds to Polycarpus)\n                    count_Poly_cycle = number of times outcome=1 (each time Polycarpus loses, so adds to Nikephoros)\n\n                But wait, let me clarify:\n\n                We are counting the red spots for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\n                In a round:\n                    If outcome=-1: then Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros gets a red spot. So we should count this as one for Nikephoros.\n                    If outcome=1: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a red spot. So we should count this as one for Polycarpus.\n\n                However, wait our definition:\n\n                    We defined outcome(a, b) as:\n                        1 if Polycarpus wins (so we count one for Nikephoros) -> no, wait: \n                    Actually, we defined:\n                        outcome=1: Polycarpus loses -> that means Polycarpus loses, so Nikephoros wins -> then Nikephoros gets a red spot? \n                    But the problem: the loser gets the red spot.\n\n                    So:\n                        If outcome=1 (Polycarpus wins) then Nikephoros is the loser -> red spot for Nikephoros.\n                        If outcome=-1 (Nikephoros wins) then Polycarpus is the loser -> red spot for Polycarpus.\n\n                    Therefore, we must reverse the interpretation:\n\n                    Let me redefine the outcome function to return:\n                        1: if Polycarpus wins (then Nikephoros is the loser -> red spot for Nikephoros)\n                        -1: if Nikephoros wins (then Polycarpus is the loser -> red spot for Polycarpus)\n                        0: draw.\n\n                    Then:\n                        In one round, if outcome is 1, then Nikephoros gets one red spot.\n                        If outcome is -1, then Polycarpus gets one red spot.\n\n                Alternatively, we can define:\n\n                    outcome(a, b) returns:\n                        1 if a wins against b (then the loser is the opponent, so we assign the red spot to the opponent)\n                        -1 if b wins against a (then the loser is a, so we assign the red spot to a)\n\n                But wait, let's map the rules:\n\n                    a wins against b if:\n                        (a, b) = (R, S) -> a wins -> then red spot goes to b (Polycarpus)\n                        (a, b) = (S, P) -> a wins -> then red spot goes to b (Polycarpus)\n                        (a, b) = (P, R) -> a wins -> then red spot goes to b (Polycarpus)\n\n                    And if b wins against a?\n                        (b, a) = (R, S) -> then b wins -> red spot goes to a (Nikephoros)\n                        (b, a) = (S, P) -> then b wins -> red spot goes to a (Nikephoros)\n                        (b, a) = (P, R) -> then b wins -> red spot goes to a (Nikephoros)\n\n                But note: the round is between a (from A) and b (from B). \n\n                So we can define:\n\n                    outcome(a, b) = \n                        if a == b: 0\n                        elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: \n                            then a wins -> so red spot goes to b (Polycarpus) -> return 1 (meaning we assign red spot to the one who didn't play a? No, wait: we are tracking two players.\n\n                Alternatively, we can define:\n\n                    Let's say we want to count for Nikephoros (player A) and Polycarpus (player B).\n\n                    In a round:\n                        If a wins: then Polycarpus (B) loses -> red spot for Polycarpus (so we add 1 to Polycarpus's count) -> but wait, no: the problem says the loser gets the red spot. So if a wins, then B is the loser -> red spot for B.\n\n                    Therefore, we can define:\n\n                        outcome(a, b) = \n                            1 if a wins (then B loses, so we add one to B's red spots) OR\n                            -1 if b wins (then A loses, so we add one to A's red spots)\n\n                But then, how do we use it?\n\n                    For each round, if outcome is 1: then Polycarpus (B) gets a red spot.\n                    if outcome is -1: then Nikephoros (A) gets a red spot.\n\n                Now, let's check the example:\n\n                    Example input: \n                        7\n                        RPS\n                        RSPP\n\n                    Round 0: a0='R', b0='R' -> draw -> no red spot.\n                    Round 1: a1='P', b1='S' -> P vs S -> P does not beat S? Actually, according to rules: \n                        R beats S, S beats P, P beats R.\n\n                    So for (P, S): \n                        P vs S: P does not beat S (because P beats R, not S). Actually, S beats P. So in this round, S (from B) wins. Therefore, outcome should be -1 (meaning A loses, so we add one to A's red spots).\n\n                    Round 2: a2='S', b2='P' -> S vs P: S beats P -> so A wins, outcome=1 -> then B gets a red spot.\n\n                    Round 3: a3='R', b3='P' -> R vs P: R does not beat P (because R beats S, not P). P beats R -> so B wins, outcome=-1 -> A gets a red spot.\n\n                    Round 4: a4='P', b4='R' -> P vs R: P beats R -> A wins, outcome=1 -> B gets a red spot.\n\n                    Round 5: a5='S', b5='P' -> same as round 2: outcome=1 -> B gets a red spot.\n\n                    Round 6: a6='R', b6='S' -> R vs S: R beats S -> A wins, outcome=1 -> B gets a red spot.\n\n                    Then we have:\n                        A (Nikephoros) got red spots in rounds 1 and 3 -> 2 red spots.\n                        B (Polycarpus) got red spots in rounds 2,4,5,6 -> 4 red spots.\n\n                    But the sample output is \"3 2\", meaning Nikephoros has 3 and Polycarpus has 2.\n\n                Wait, the example output is \"3 2\". \n\n                Let me recount the example:\n\n                    Input: \n                        7\n                        RPS\n                        RSPP\n\n                    Round-by-round:\n\n                    Round 0: R vs R -> draw.\n                    Round 1: P vs S -> P loses? No, because S beats P. So P loses -> so Polycarpus (B) loses? No: wait, in round 1, A (Nikephoros) shows 'P' and B (Polycarpus) shows 'S'. \n                        According to the rules: \n                            S beats P -> so the winner is the one who showed S (Polycarpus) and the loser is the one who showed P (Nikephoros). \n                        Therefore, Nikephoros (A) loses -> red spot for Nikephoros.\n\n                    Round 2: S vs P -> S beats P -> so Polycarpus (B) loses -> red spot for Polycarpus.\n\n                    Round 3: R vs P -> P beats R -> so Nikephoros (A) loses -> red spot for Nikephoros.\n\n                    Round 4: P vs R -> P beats R -> so Polycarpus (B) loses -> red spot for Polycarpus.\n\n                    Round 5: S vs P -> S beats P -> so Polycarpus (B) loses -> red spot for Polycarpus.\n\n                    Round 6: R vs S -> R beats S -> so Polycarpus (B) loses -> red spot for Polycarpus.\n\n                    Then:\n                        Nikephoros: rounds 1, 3 -> 2 red spots.\n                        Polycarpus: rounds 2,4,5,6 -> 4 red spots.\n\n                But the example output is \"3 2\".\n\n                There seems to be a discrepancy. Let me check the example explanation:\n\n                    \"Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\"\n\n                The example explanation says:\n\n                    R - R. Draw.\n                    P - S. Nikephoros loses.  --> This is round 1: so one loss for Nikephoros.\n                    S - P. Polycarpus loses.   --> This is round 2: one loss for Polycarpus.\n                    R - P.

So then b wins.\n\n                    So we can write:\n\n                        def outcome(a, b):\n                            if a == b:\n                                return 0\n                            elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                                return 1   # meaning a wins -> then B (the other player) loses -> so we assign one to B's count?\n                            else:\n                                return -1   # meaning b wins -> then A loses -> assign one to A's count.\n\n                But then we use:\n\n                    If outcome returns 1: then we add one to Polycarpus (B)'s red spots.\n                    If outcome returns -1: then we add one to Nikephoros (A)'s red spots.\n\n                However, wait: \n                    In round1: outcome('P','S') returns -1 (because (P,S) is not in the list) -> then we add one to A (Nikephoros). Correct.\n\n                    In round2: outcome('S','P') returns 1 (because ('S','P') is in the list) -> then we add one to B (Polycarpus). Correct.\n\n                    In round3: outcome('R','P') returns -1 (because (R,P) is not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]) -> then we add one to A (Nikephoros). Correct.\n\n                    In round4: outcome('P','R') returns 1 (because ('P','R') is in the list) -> then we add one to B (Polycarpus). Correct.\n\n                    In round5: outcome('S','S') returns 0 -> nothing.\n\n                    In round6: outcome('R','P') returns -1 -> then we add one to A (Nikephoros). Correct.\n\n                So the total for A: 3, for B: 2.\n\n                Therefore, we must:\n\n                    For each round i (from 0 to n-1):\n                        a = A[i % m]\n                        b = B[i % k]\n                        res = outcome(a, b)\n\n                        if res == 1:\n                            count_B += 1\n                        elif res == -1:\n                            count_A += 1\n\n        Step 6: Now, we can compute T = LCM(m, k). Then:\n\n            total_rounds = n\n            cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n            We precomputed an array `cycle_counts` for the first T rounds (from i=0 to T-1):\n\n                count_A_cycle = 0\n                count_B_cycle = 0\n                for i in range(T):\n                    a = A[i % m]\n                    b = B[i % k]\n                    res = outcome(a, b)\n                    if res == 1:\n                        count_B_cycle += 1\n                    elif res == -1:\n                        count_A_cycle += 1\n\n            Then, total_A = cycles * count_A_cycle + (additional from the remaining rem rounds)\n            total_B = cycles * count_B_cycle + (additional from the remaining rem rounds)\n\n            For the remaining rounds (rem rounds), we can simulate from i = T to T+rem-1 (but note: we already precomputed the cycle of length T, so we can just simulate the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle? Actually, we can simulate from i=0 to rem-1, but note: the cycle is periodic with period T, so the next T rounds (from T to 2T-1) are the same as the first T rounds. But we don't need to simulate the entire cycle again, we can use the same function.\n\n            Alternatively, we can precompute an array `arr` of outcomes for one cycle (of length T) and then:\n\n                arr = [0]*T   # but we don't need the whole array, we only need the counts.\n\n            But wait, we already computed the cycle counts. Now, for the remainder, we can simulate from i=0 to rem-1 (which we have already in our outcome function) and then add the counts.\n\n            However, note: the remainder part is the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle. But the cycle starts at round0. \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                count_A_rem = 0\n                count_B_rem = 0\n                for i in range(rem):\n                    a = A[i % m]\n                    b = B[i % k]\n                    res = outcome(a, b)\n                    if res == 1:\n                        count_B_rem += 1\n                    elif res == -1:\n                        count_A_rem += 1\n\n            Then:\n                total_A = cycles * count_A_cycle + count_A_rem\n                total_B = cycles * count_B_cycle + count_B_rem\n\n        But wait: what is T? T is LCM(m, k). The rounds from 0 to T-1 form a complete cycle. The next T rounds (from T to 2T-1) are the same as the first T rounds. So yes, the remainder part is the first 'rem' rounds.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operations for the indices: \n            For round i, we use A[i % m] and B[i % k]. \n            When i >= T, then i % m and i % k will repeat the pattern of the cycle. So the entire sequence is periodic with period T.\n\n        Therefore, the above method is valid.\n\n        However, note: T might be 0? No, because m and k are at least 1.\n\n        But also, we must compute T = LCM(m, k). We can compute GCD first.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            import math\n\n            m = len(A)\n            k = len(B)\n            g = math.gcd(m, k)\n            T = (m * k) // g\n\n        Then, we do:\n\n            cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n        Then, we simulate the first T rounds (from i=0 to T-1) to get the counts for one cycle.\n\n        Then, we simulate the first 'rem' rounds (from i=0 to rem-1) to get the counts for the remainder.\n\n        Then, total_A = cycles * (count_A_cycle) + (count_A_rem)\n        total_B = cycles * (count_B_cycle) + (count_B_rem)\n\n        Print(total_A, total_B)\n\n 4. Example test with n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4 -> T = LCM(3,4)=12\n\n        Then we simulate 12 rounds to get the cycle counts.\n\n        Then, we do 7 // 12 = 0 cycles, and remainder=7, so we simulate 7 rounds.\n\n        The simulation for 7 rounds gives: \n            count_A_cycle for 12 rounds? Actually, we are not storing the entire cycle for 12 rounds, but we can compute the cycle counts for 12 rounds.\n\n        But note: the example only requires 7 rounds. We don't need the full cycle if n < T.\n\n        However, we are breaking the n rounds into cycles of length T. Since T=12 and n=7, then cycles=0, and we only simulate 7 rounds.\n\n        So we don't even need to compute the full cycle if n < T.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the cycle computation if n < T.\n\n        But the problem states that n can be up to 2e9, and T can be up to 1e6, so if n < T, then we can simulate n rounds (which is at most 2e9, which is too many). \n\n        However, wait: if n < T, then we don't need to compute the entire cycle (which is T rounds) because we only need the first n rounds. But n can be up to 2e9, which is larger than T (which is at most 1e6). \n\n        Actually, we are using T = LCM(m, k) and m,k <= 1000, so T <= 1000*1000 (if coprime) which is 1e6. And n can be up to 2e9, so we do:\n\n            cycles = n // T   -> which is 2e9 // 1e6 = 2000 cycles, and then remainder = n % T (which is less than T, so at most 1e6).\n\n        So we must compute the cycle counts for T rounds (which is 1e6) and then the remainder (which is at most 1e6). Then we can handle the 2000 cycles by multiplying the cycle counts.\n\n        But if n < T, then we only need to simulate n rounds (which is up to 2e9) but wait, n is the total rounds and if n < T, then T is at least 1, so n is at most 2e9, but T is the LCM(m,k) which is at least max(m,k) and at most 1e6. So if n < T, then n is less than 1e6? \n\n        Actually, n can be up to 2e9, but T is at most 1e6, so n//T is at least 2e9//1e6 = 2000, so n is always greater than T? \n\n        Not necessarily: if T is 1e6 and n=1000, then n < T, and we don't use the cycle part. \n\n        So we need to handle two cases: \n\n            Case 1: n >= T -> then we break into cycles and remainder.\n            Case 2: n < T -> then we only simulate n rounds.\n\n        But note: we are computing T = LCM(m, k). We can simulate n rounds without knowing T if we use modulus indexing? \n\n        However, we can always break the n rounds into:\n\n            total_A = 0\n            total_B = 0\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                a = A[i % m]\n                b = B[i % k]\n                res = outcome(a, b)\n                if res == 1:\n                    total_B += 1\n                elif res == -1:\n                    total_A += 1\n\n        But n can be up to 2e9, and we cannot iterate 2e9 times.\n\n        Therefore, we must use the cycle method.\n\n        But if n < T, then T is the LCM(m,k) which is at most 1e6, and n < T, so n is less than 1e6. Then we can simulate n rounds (because 1e6 is acceptable, but wait: if n is 2e9 and T is 1e6, then we are okay because we break into 2000 cycles and 0 remainder. But if n < T, then n is at most 1e6-1, so we can simulate n rounds.\n\n        However, we don't know T until we compute it. So we can do:\n\n            Option 1: Compute T = LCM(m,k). Then if n >= T, use cycle method. Else, simulate n rounds.\n\n        But note: T is at most 1e6, so if n < T, then n < 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: what if m=1, k=1, then T=1, and n=0 or n=1? Then we can use the cycle method.\n\n        Alternatively, we can always use the cycle method because:\n\n            We compute T = LCM(m,k) (at most 1e6) and then we break n into cycles and remainder. Then we only need to simulate T rounds (which is at most 1e6) and then the remainder (at most 1e6). \n\n        However, if n < T, then we are simulating n rounds (which is less than T, so less than 1e6) and we don't need the cycle part.\n\n        But note: we are going to simulate the entire cycle (T rounds) to get the cycle counts. Then for the remainder, we simulate up to T rounds. \n\n        But if n < T, then we can simply simulate the first n rounds and ignore the cycle. However, we are going to compute the cycle anyway and then use:\n\n            cycles = n // T   (which is 0)\n            remainder = n % T  (which is n)\n\n            Then we simulate the remainder (n) rounds.\n\n        But wait, we are going to simulate the entire cycle (T rounds) to get the cycle counts, but if n < T, then we don't need the cycle counts. \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if n == 0:\n                print(\"0 0\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            T = LCM(m, k)\n\n            if n >= T:\n                # We need to compute the cycle counts for T rounds and the remainder counts for n % T rounds.\n                # Then total_A = (n // T) * count_A_cycle + count_A_rem\n                # Then total_B = (n // T) * count_B_cycle + count_B_rem\n            else:\n                # Simulate n rounds directly.\n\n        However, we can combine:\n\n            We can compute T = LCM(m,k) (which is at most 1e6). Then:\n\n                cycles = n // T\n                rem = n % T\n\n            Then, if we simulate the entire cycle (T rounds) to get the cycle counts, and then simulate the first 'rem' rounds to get the remainder counts, then:\n\n                total_A = cycles * (count_A_cycle) + (count_A_rem)\n                total_B = cycles * (count_B_cycle) + (count_B_rem)\n\n            But note: if n < T, then cycles=0 and rem = n, so we are effectively simulating n rounds (by doing the first n rounds of the cycle). \n\n            However, we are simulating T rounds (which is 1e6) even if n < T. That's acceptable because T is at most 1e6, and 1e6 is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            T = LCM(m, k)   [which is at most 1000*1000 = 1e6]\n\n            Then, we simulate T rounds to get the cycle counts (for i from 0 to T-1). Then, we simulate the first 'rem' rounds (which is n % T) to get the remainder counts.\n\n            Then, total_A = (n // T) * count_A_cycle + count_A_rem\n            total_B = (n // T) * count_B_cycle + count_B_rem\n\n        But note: the cycle counts (count_A_cycle, count_B_cycle) are the counts for the entire cycle of T rounds.\n\n        This works for any n, because if n >= T, then we break into cycles and remainder. If n < T, then cycles=0 and we just use the first n rounds (which is the same as the first n rounds of the cycle).\n\n        However, note: the cycle of T rounds is the entire set of distinct (i mod m, i mod k) pairs? Actually, the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds, so the outcomes for rounds i and i+T are the same.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Step 1: Read n, A, B.\n\n            Step 2: m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n            Step 3: Compute T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)   [using math.gcd]\n\n            Step 4: Initialize:\n                    count_A_cycle = 0   # for the entire cycle T rounds\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after they play a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the game can have up to 2 billion rounds. The challenge is to efficiently compute the result without simulating each round individually, leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players using cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move in each player's sequence. The goal is to count how many times each player loses (i.e., receives a red spot) over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one cycle of `T` rounds and then scaling up the results for multiple cycles.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute `T` as the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: Simulate all `T` rounds to count losses (red spots) for both players within one cycle.\n   - **Scaling and Remainder Handling**: For the remaining rounds (if any), simulate those rounds separately and combine the results from full cycles and the remainder.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently handles large `n` (up to 2 billion) by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, reducing the problem to simulating at most `T` rounds (where `T` is up to 1 million for sequences of length 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    def outcome(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return 0\n        elif (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return -1\n            \n    count_A_cycle = 0\n    count_B_cycle = 0\n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        if res == 1:\n            count_B_cycle += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            count_A_cycle += 1\n\n    cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n    \n    count_A_rem = 0\n    count_B_rem = 0\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        if res == 1:\n            count_B_rem += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            count_A_rem += 1\n            \n    total_A = cycles * count_A_cycle + count_A_rem\n    total_B = cycles * count_B_cycle + count_B_rem\n    \n    print(f\"{total_A} {total_B}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of `A` and `B` is computed to determine the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Outcome Function**: This function determines the winner of a round based on the standard rock-paper-scissors rules. It returns `1` if the first player wins (second player loses), `-1` if the second player wins (first player loses), and `0` for a draw.\n4. **Cycle Simulation**: The algorithm simulates all `T` rounds to count how many times each player loses within one cycle.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total losses for each player are calculated by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of full cycles (`n // T`) and adding the losses from the remaining rounds (`n % T`).\n6. **Output**: The results for both players are printed, showing the total number of red spots each received.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
