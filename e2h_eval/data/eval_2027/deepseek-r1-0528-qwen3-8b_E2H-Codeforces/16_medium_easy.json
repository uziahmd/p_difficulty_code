Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation: \n Moving from one block to another is allowed if they share a common border of nonzero length. This is essentially crossing a road.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n But note: the entire plane is divided by the n infinite lines. We start at home and want to get to the university.\n\n Actually, we can think of it as: each road is a line that divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and the university lie in some blocks (regions). \n\n The movement condition is: if two blocks share a common border (which is a segment of one of the roads), then we can cross that road in one step.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require crossing the road only once. But observe: the minimal steps correspond to the number of roads we have to cross? Not exactly, because we might cross multiple roads at once? Actually, no: when moving from one block to another, we cross exactly one road (if the common border is one road). But wait: what if two roads meet at an intersection? Then the adjacent blocks may be separated by two different roads, but we can only cross one road at a time.\n\n However, note the definition: the common border must be a nonzero-length segment. Therefore, we cannot cross two roads at the same time (unless the two roads coincide, which they don't). So each step crosses one road.\n\n But note: the problem does not say we can cross arbitrarily. We are allowed to cross any road arbitrarily many times? Actually, the problem is about minimum steps. We need to determine the minimum number of steps (road crossings) required to go from home to university.\n\n However, consider: the entire plane is divided by the n lines. The home and university are in two distinct regions. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of road crossings required to go from home to university.\n\n But note: the movement is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent one (sharing a common border). This is similar to a graph where each block is a node and edges exist between two nodes if they share a common border (i.e., they are separated by exactly one road). Then the problem reduces to: what is the minimal number of road crossings (edges) to go from the home block to the university block?\n\n However, note that the graph is planar and the roads are straight lines. There is a well known fact: the minimal number of roads to cross is the same as the minimal number of lines that separate the two points? Actually, we can use duality: the regions are defined by the arrangement of lines. The two points are in two regions. We can consider the sign of the equation for each line.\n\n For a given line a*i*x + b*i*y + c*i = 0, we can define the value f_i(x,y) = a*i*x + b*i*y + c*i. Then the plane is divided by the line into two half-planes. The home point (x1,y1) will have a sign s_i = sign(f_i(x1,y1)) and the university (x2,y2) will have a sign t_i = sign(f_i(x2,y2)).\n\n Now, if for a particular line i, s_i and t_i are the same, then the home and university are on the same side of the line, so we do not need to cross that line. Otherwise, we must cross that line an odd number of times (at least once).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to cross the same road multiple times. But the minimal path would cross each separating line exactly once.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of lines that separate the two points (i.e., the lines for which the sign of the function at home and at university are different).\n\n But wait: is that true? Consider that we might cross a road more than once to avoid crossing other roads? However, in an arrangement of lines, the minimal number of crossings to go from one region to another is indeed the number of lines that strictly separate the two regions. And because the arrangement is such that the regions are convex (half-planes) and the entire arrangement is linear, we can cross each separating line exactly once.\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      2\n      0 1 0\n      1 0 0\n\n   These two lines are the x-axis and y-axis.\n\n   Home: (1,1) -> above both axes.\n   University: (-1,-1) -> below both axes.\n\n   How many roads separate them?\n     Line 1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0. \n        f1(1,1)=1 >0, f1(-1,-1)=-1<0 -> separating.\n     Line 2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0.\n        f2(1,1)=1>0, f2(-1,-1)=-1<0 -> separating.\n\n   So according to this, we need to cross 2 roads.\n\n   The example output is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      3\n      1 0 0\n      0 1 0\n      1 1 -3\n\n   The third line: 1*x + 1*y -3 = 0 -> x+y=3.\n\n   Check separation for (1,1) and (-1,-1):\n     Line 1: x=0 -> separating.\n     Line 2: y=0 -> separating.\n     Line 3: x+y=3 -> (1+1=2 <3) and (-1+-1=-2<3) -> same side (both negative? Actually, the equation is x+y-3=0. So for (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0, for (-1,-1): -1-1-3=-5<0 -> same side.\n\n   So only two lines separate them. The example output is 2.\n\n Therefore, the answer is simply the number of lines i for which the signs of (a*i*x1+b*i*y1+c*i) and (a*i*x2+b*i*y2+c*i) are different.\n\n However, wait: what if two roads are parallel? Then they don't intersect, but the separation by one road is independent of the other.\n\n But note: the minimal path must cross each separating road at least once. And we can cross each road independently. So the total minimal steps is the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But note: the problem says that the movement is from one block to another if they share a common border. This corresponds to crossing one road. Then the minimal number of steps is the number of roads we must cross.\n\n However, consider that the problem does not require crossing the roads in any particular order, and we are allowed to cross the same road multiple times. But the minimal path would never cross the same road twice unnecessarily.\n\n Therefore, we can simply count the number of lines for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read home (x1, y1)\n 2. Read university (x2, y2)\n 3. Read n\n 4. For each of the n lines (each has a, b, c):\n        value1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        value2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        If value1 * value2 < 0, then this road separates the two points.\n\n 5. Count the number of such roads.\n\n However, note: due to floating point precision, but the numbers are integers and the inputs are integers. But the values can be very large (up to 10^6) and we are multiplying two large numbers. However, the product might be very big, but we are only checking the sign. Alternatively, we can check without multiplication:\n\n        if (value1 < 0 and value2 > 0) or (value1 > 0 and value2 < 0):\n\n But note: what if one is zero? According to the problem, neither home nor university lies on the road. So value1 and value2 cannot be zero. So we can safely use the product.\n\n However, to avoid overflow, we can use:\n\n        if (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) * (a*x2 + b*y2 + c) < 0:\n\n But the numbers can be as large as 10^6, so the maximum absolute value of a term is |a|x1 + |b|y1 + |c|. Each term can be up to 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e12, and then multiplied by another 1e12? That would be 1e24, which is too big for integers in some languages, but in Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we are only comparing sign. However, the product might be very slow? Or we can do:\n\n        sign1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        sign2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if sign1 * sign2 < 0:\n\n But again, the product of two numbers each up to 1e12 (in absolute value) is 1e24, which is acceptable in Python for integers (since Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the operation is still O(1) in terms of digit operations? Actually, the numbers are fixed size so it's acceptable).\n\n However, we must be cautious: sometimes the product might be too slow? But n is at most 300, so we do 300 multiplications of two ~1e12 numbers, which is 300 multiplications of numbers with about 24 digits, which is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the product by comparing the signs:\n\n        if sign1 < 0 and sign2 > 0:\n            count += 1\n        elif sign1 > 0 and sign2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n But we must note that the signs are determined by the sign of the expression.\n\n However, note: the expression a*x+b*y+c can be positive or negative, and we know they are nonzero.\n\n But there is one more issue: what if the expression overflows? In Python, integers don't overflow, but the numbers are within the range of integers. The maximum absolute value for a term is:\n\n        |a*x1+b*y1+c| <= |a|*|x1| + |b|*|y1| + |c|\n\n Each of a, b, c, x1, y1 can be up to 10^6 in absolute value. So the maximum absolute value is:\n\n        |a|*|x1| <= 10^6 * 10^6 = 1e12\n\n Similarly for b and y1, and c. Then the sum is at most 3e12, which is within the range of Python integers.\n\n However, we can also consider using the fact that we only care about the sign. We can compare without computing the full product if we are concerned about performance, but 300 * 2 multiplications is acceptable.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   For the first road: [0,1,0] -> equation: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0.\n        At (1,1): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 -> positive.\n        At (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> negative.\n        Product: 1 * (-1) = -1 -> negative -> count increases.\n\n   Second road: [1,0,0] -> equation: x=0.\n        At (1,1): 1*1+0+0 = 1 -> positive.\n        At (-1,-1): 1*(-1)+0+0 = -1 -> negative.\n        Product: 1*(-1) = -1 -> negative -> count increases.\n\n   Total count = 2.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Another example: \n        Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n        Third road: [1,1,-3] -> equation: x+y-3=0.\n          (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 -> negative.\n          (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 -> negative.\n          Product: (-1)*(-5)=5 -> positive -> not separating.\n\n        Count = 2.\n\n So the program:\n\n        Read x1, y1\n        Read x2, y2\n        Read n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            Read a, b, c\n            s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n            if s1 * s2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n\n        Print count\n\n But wait: what if the two points are in the same block? Then we don't need to cross any road, so the answer is 0.\n\n This matches: if no road separates them, then count remains 0.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the home and university are in some blocks (and the roads divide the plane). The minimal steps to stay in the same block is 0.\n\n Let's test with two points in the same block.\n\n Example: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (2,2)\n        Roads: \n            0 1 0   # y=0\n            1 0 0   # x=0\n\n        For (1,1) and (2,2):\n            Road1 (y=0): \n                (1,1): 1 >0; (2,2): 2>0 -> same side -> not separating.\n            Road2 (x=0):\n                (1,1): 1>0; (2,2): 2>0 -> same side -> not separating.\n\n        Count = 0.\n\n So the answer is 0.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says \"the roads divide the plane into connected regions\" and \"an intersection is the point where at least two different roads intersect\". But the above reasoning holds because we are only concerned with the side of each road.\n\n But wait: what if two roads are coincident? The problem says \"no two roads are the same\", so no.\n\n Also, note: the problem says \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\n However, note: the equations are given as aix + biy + ci = 0. The standard form.\n\n But what if the equation is given with negative signs? For example, the line 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 is the same as 0*x -1*y + 0 = 0? Actually, no: the equation 0*x -1*y + 0 = 0 is equivalent to y=0, same as the first. But the sign of the expression changes. However, the product of the two signs (for the two points) will still be negative if they are on opposite sides. Because if the equation is multiplied by -1, then both signs flip, and the product remains the same (negative becomes negative, positive becomes positive). \n\n However, let me check: \n        Original: a*x+b*y+c = 0.\n        Multiply by -1: -a*x -b*y -c = 0.\n\n        Then for (x1,y1): original value = s1, new value = -s1.\n        For (x2,y2): original value = s2, new value = -s2.\n\n        Then the product for the original: s1*s2 < 0  <=> (-s1)*(-s2) = s1*s2 < 0.\n\n        So the condition is invariant under scaling the entire equation by a nonzero constant (including -1). Therefore, we are safe.\n\n Code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n\n        count = 0\n        for _ in range(n):\n            data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a, b, c = data\n            s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            # Since the points are not on the road, neither s1 nor s2 is zero.\n            if s1 * s2 < 0:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n But wait: what if the product is very large and we are concerned about the sign? The condition s1*s2 < 0 is equivalent to having opposite signs. However, if the product is too large, we might face overflow? But in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so we don't have overflow. However, the problem constraints say the numbers can be as large as 10^6, so the maximum absolute value of s1 and s2 is about 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6 ~ 2e12, and then the product is 4e24, which is a huge integer but still manageable in Python (though we are only comparing sign, and the product is positive/negative, so we don't need the full magnitude). \n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the product by:\n\n            if (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0) or (s1 > 0 and s2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n This avoids the large product and is just two comparisons.\n\n But note: the product might be positive even if the numbers are huge, but we are only interested in the sign. The comparison (s1 < 0 and s2 > 0) is safe.\n\n However, the product method is also safe and simple.\n\n But let's consider performance: the product of two integers of magnitude 1e12 is 1e24, which is about 80 bits, so it's a single machine word? Actually, no, because 2^64 is about 1e19, so 1e24 is 80 bits, and Python handles that, but doing 300 of these is acceptable.\n\n However, to be safe from potential overflow in other languages (but we are in Python), we can use the sign comparisons.\n\n Let's use:\n\n            if (s1 < 0) != (s2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n This is equivalent: because if s1 is negative and s2 positive, then (s1<0) is True and (s2<0) is False -> True != False -> True. Similarly for the other way.\n\n But note: if s1 is negative and s2 positive, then (s1<0) is True and (s2<0) is False, so they are not equal -> condition true.\n\n Also, if both are positive: (s1<0) is False, (s2<0) is False -> condition false.\n        both negative: (s1<0) is True, (s2<0) is True -> condition false.\n\n So yes, this is correct.\n\n However, what if s1 is negative and s2 is positive, but the product is negative? This condition is the same as the product being negative.\n\n But note: we must ensure that we are not dividing by zero, but we know s1 and s2 are not zero.\n\n So the code becomes:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n\n        count = 0\n        for _ in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            if (s1 < 0) != (s2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n Let me test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n        (1,1) and (-1,-1) with road [0,1,0]: \n            s1 = 1, s2 = -1 -> (1<0) is False, (-1<0) is True -> False != True -> True -> count++.\n\n Example 2: \n        (1,1) and (-1,-1) with road [1,0,0]:\n            s1 = 1, s2 = -1 -> same.\n\n Example 3: \n        (1,1) and (2,2) with road [0,1,0]:\n            s1 = 1, s2 = 2 -> both positive -> condition false.\n\n This is correct.\n\n However, note: the sign comparison is equivalent to the product being negative, but without the large product.\n\n Let's run the provided examples.\n\n Example Input 1: \n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'] -> expected output '2'\n\n Example Input 2:\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'] -> expected output '2'\n\n But wait, the second example input is given as:\n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n        Our code: \n            Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n            Roads: \n                [1,0,0]: x=0 -> s1 = 1, s2=-1 -> separating.\n                [0,1,0]: y=0 -> s1=1, s2=-1 -> separating.\n                [1,1,-3]: x+y-3=0 -> s1=1+1-3=-1, s2=-1-1-3=-5 -> both negative -> not separating.\n\n            Count = 2.\n\n So output is 2.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, wait: the example input representation in the problem is given as a list of strings. But we are reading from stdin.\n\n The problem says: \n        The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road (an infinite line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key observation here is that each road that separates the home and university points must be crossed at least once, and the minimal path requires crossing each such road exactly once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves navigating through regions (blocks) divided by infinite lines (roads). The home and university are located in two distinct blocks. The movement between blocks is allowed only if they share a common border (i.e., crossing a single road). The minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate the home and university points.\n2. **Insight**: For each road, check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This is done by evaluating the sign of the linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both points. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points and must be crossed at least once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves reading the coordinates of the home and university, then processing each road to determine if it separates the two points. The count of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (s1 < 0) != (s2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, the code calculates the value of the linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university points. If the signs of these values differ, the road separates the two points, and the count is incremented.\n3. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to reach the university from home by crossing each separating road exactly once.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road's contribution to separating the two points, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution.",
