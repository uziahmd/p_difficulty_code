Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We need to assign each digit in A (from left to right) to either Homer (H) or Marge (M) for exactly n moves each.\n The catch: the total prize is the sum of two numbers, S1 (for Homer) and S2 (for Marge). \n But note: the number A is taken from left to right, and when a player takes the leftmost digit, they append it to their own number.\n\n However, note that the assignment matters because the digits are appended in order. For example, if we assign the first digit to Homer, then his number becomes that digit, but if we assign the second digit to Homer, then his number will be the first digit followed by the second? Actually, no: the process is:\n\n Initially: A = \"1234\", S1 = \"\", S2 = \"\"\n Step 1: \n   If Homer goes first: \n        take the leftmost digit '1', so S1 becomes \"1\", and A becomes \"234\".\n   Then Marge goes: \n        take the next leftmost digit '2', so S2 becomes \"2\", and A becomes \"34\".\n\n Alternatively, if the sequence is HHMM:\n   First move (Homer): S1=\"1\", A=\"234\"\n   Second move (Homer): S1=\"12\", A=\"34\"\n   Third move (Marge): S2=\"3\", A=\"4\"\n   Fourth move (Marge): S2=\"34\", A=\"\"\n\n But wait, the problem says: on the i-th turn, the player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number.\n\n So the entire sequence of moves is predetermined by the string A. The players don't choose which digits to take arbitrarily; they take the leftmost available one.\n\n However, the assignment (who takes which digit) is what we control. We have to assign the 2n digits to two players, each getting n digits, and the order of digits for a player is the order in which they were taken (i.e., the relative order in A).\n\n The value of S1 is the number formed by the digits assigned to Homer in the order they appear (from left to right in A), and similarly for S2.\n\n But note: the total prize is S1 + S2 (as numbers). We want to maximize this.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Since n is at most 18, the total number of digits is up to 36. We cannot iterate over all partitions (which would be C(36,18) ~ 9e9) without dynamic programming.\n\n However, note that the digits are taken in order. We can use DP with state (i, j) meaning we have processed the first i+j digits, and Homer has taken j digits, and Marge has taken i digits (so j from 0 to n, i from 0 to n). But wait, we have 2n digits, so we need to process 2n digits.\n\n But the catch: the value of S1 and S2 are built from the digits in the order they are taken. However, if we just know how many digits each has taken, we don't know the actual numbers.\n\n But note: the numbers are built from the digits in the order of appearance. So if Homer has taken some digits, the number S1 is the concatenation of the digits he took in the order of the original A (because the digits are taken from left to right and when assigned to Homer, they are appended in the order they were taken).\n\n However, we cannot store the entire number because n can be up to 18, so the numbers can have up to 18 digits (which is a very big number, but we can use DP with state (i, j) and store the two numbers as integers? But 18-digit numbers are too big to store as integers in terms of state space? Actually, 18-digit numbers have about 10^18 possibilities, which is too many.\n\n Alternate idea: we are only interested in the total prize (S1+S2) and the assignment must be such that the digits are assigned in order.\n\n However, note: the assignment is fixed by the order. We have to assign the first k digits (for some k) to either H or M, but the catch is that the digits are appended in the order of A.\n\n Another observation: the entire assignment is a sequence of length 2n of H and M, with exactly n H's and n M's.\n\n Let the string of moves be s[0]s[1]...s[2n-1] (each character either 'H' or 'M').\n\n Then, the number S1 is built from the digits at the positions where s[i]=='H'.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from a given number A. The players each make exactly n moves, and the prize is the sum of the numbers formed by each player from their respective picks. The challenge is to determine the optimal sequence of moves (a string of 'H' and 'M' of length 2n with exactly n of each) that maximizes the sum.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning the digits of A into two subsequences (one for each player) such that each player picks exactly n digits. The order of digits in each subsequence must follow their appearance in A. The goal is to maximize the sum of the two numbers formed by these subsequences.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sum S1 + S2 can be maximized by ensuring that the largest digits are assigned to the most significant positions in the numbers. However, since the digits are picked in order, the assignment must respect the sequence of digits in A.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum possible sum achievable after processing the first `i+j` digits, with Homer having taken `j` digits. Here, `i` is the count of digits processed so far minus `j`.\n\n4. **State Transition**: For each digit, we decide whether to assign it to Homer or Marge. If assigned to Homer, the digit's value is added to Homer's number (shifted by the appropriate power of 10 based on the position). Similarly for Marge. The DP state transitions consider both possibilities.\n\n5. **Backtracking for Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[2n][n]` to construct the move sequence. During backtracking, we check which choice (Homer or Marge) led to the current state, ensuring we pick the path that maximizes the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n\n    dp = [[-1] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n\n    for i in range(total_digits + 1):\n        for j in range(n + 1):\n            k = i - j\n            if k < 0 or k > n or j < 0 or j > n:\n                continue\n            if dp[k][j] == -1:\n                continue\n            digit_char = A[i - 1]\n            d_val = int(digit_char)\n            if k - 1 >= 0:\n                new_val = dp[k][j] + d_val * (10 ** (k - 1))\n                if dp[k - 1][j] == -1:\n                    dp[k - 1][j] = new_val\n                else:\n                    if new_val > dp[k - 1][j]:\n                        dp[k - 1][j] = new_val\n            if j - 1 >= 0:\n                new_val = dp[k][j] + d_val * (10 ** (j - 1))\n                if dp[k][j - 1] == -1:\n                    dp[k][j - 1] = new_val\n                else:\n                    if new_val > dp[k][j - 1]:\n                        dp[k][j - 1] = new_val\n\n    result = ''\n    k = n\n    j = n\n    index = 2 * n - 1\n    while index >= 0:\n        if k > 0 and dp[k - 1][j] == dp[k][j] - (int(A[index]) * (10 ** (k - 1))):\n            result = 'H' + result\n            k -= 1\n        elif j > 0 and dp[k][j - 1] == dp[k][j] - (int(A[index]) * (10 ** (j - 1))):\n            result += 'M'\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            digit_char = A[index]\n            d_val = int(digit_char)\n            power = None\n            if k > 0:\n                power = 10 ** (k - 1)\n            else:\n                power = 10 ** (j - 1) if j > 0 else None\n            if k > 0 and j > 0:\n                if dp[k - 1][j] == dp[k][j] - d_val * power:\n                    result = 'H' + result\n                    k -= 1\n                else:\n                    result += 'M'\n                    j -= 1\n            elif k > 0:\n                result = 'H' + result\n                k -= 1\n            elif j > 0:\n                result += 'M'\n                j -= 1\n        index -= 1\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of 2n digits. The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the maximum sum achievable for each state `(i, j)`.\n\n2. **DP Table Filling**: For each digit in `A`, the DP table is updated by considering whether the digit should be assigned to Homer or Marge. The value for each state is computed based on the previous state and the digit's value, shifted appropriately to its position.\n\n3. **Backtracking**: Starting from the state `(n, n)`, the solution backtracks through the DP table to construct the move sequence. For each step, it checks which player's assignment led to the current state and appends 'H' or 'M' accordingly.\n\n4. **Output**: The constructed sequence of moves is printed, ensuring that both players have made exactly `n` moves and the total prize is maximized.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible move sequences using dynamic programming and backtracking, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 18`.",
