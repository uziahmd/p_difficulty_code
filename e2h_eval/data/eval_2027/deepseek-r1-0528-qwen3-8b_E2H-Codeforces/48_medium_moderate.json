He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (Roman numeral system) or both integers.\n The next line is a string representing a non-negative integer c in base a (with possible leading zeros, but the length is at most 1000). However, note that the number might be given in a base up to 25, and the representation may contain digits beyond '9', so we use letters for digits above 9 (like 'A' for 10, etc.).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Convert the given string from base `a` to an integer (in base 10).\n    - We note that the input string can have digits from '0' to ... (if base is up to 25, then digits go from '0' to 'Z', but the problem says in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.)\n    - We'll map each character to a digit value. For example, if the base is 16, then the string might have 'A' which is 10.\n\n 2. Then, convert that base-10 integer to base `b`.\n    - If `b` is an integer (and not 'R'), then we convert the base-10 number to base `b`. But note: the base `b` is between 2 and 25, so we can represent digits as characters from '0' to ... (if base is 25, then digits go from 0 to 24, so we need to map 10 to 'A', 11 to 'B', ... up to 24 as 'Y'? Actually, wait: the problem says \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10\", so for base 11, we use 0-9 and then A (which is 10). Similarly, base 12 would use 0-9 and then A, B? But note: the example input is \"12 13\\nA\", meaning base12 and then the digit A (which is 10) is given.\n\n 3. Special case: if `b` is 'R', then we convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n However, note the input format: \n   First line: two tokens. One of them might be 'R'. So we read two tokens. Then the second line is the string.\n\n Important: The problem states that the integer c (in base a) may be non-negative and its length doesn't exceed 1000. But if it's Roman, then the number is guaranteed to be <= 300010 and not zero.\n\n Steps in detail:\n\n Step 1: Parse the first line.\n   tokens = input().split()\n   a_str = tokens[0]\n   b_str = tokens[1]\n\n   If b_str is 'R', then we want to output the Roman numeral for the number.\n\n   Otherwise, both a and b are integers (from 2 to 25).\n\n Step 2: Read the next line, which is the string representation of the number in base a.\n\n Step 3: Convert the string from base a to an integer (base 10).\n\n   How to do that?\n   Let s = the input string.\n\n   We need to map each character in s to a digit. The mapping for digits in base a (which is at most 25) is:\n     For a digit char, if it's between '0' and '9', then the value is int(char).\n     If it's an uppercase letter, then the value is 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A')).\n\n   However, note: the problem says the number is given in base a, so the digits allowed are from 0 to a-1. And the representation might have leading zeros.\n\n   Example: base 16, the string \"10\" is 1*16^1 + 0*16^0 = 16.\n\n   But wait: what if the base is 11? Then the digits can be from 0 to 10. The digit 'A' represents 10.\n\n   However, there's a catch: the input string might contain digits that are beyond the base? The problem says \"a non-negative integer c in base a\", so the digits must be in [0, a-1]. But the problem also says \"it may contain leading zeros\", so we don't have to worry about invalid digits? Actually, we are guaranteed that the digits are valid because it's given in base a.\n\n   Steps for converting the string to base10:\n\n     num = 0\n     for each char in the string (from left to right):\n         d = char_to_digit(char, base_a)\n         num = num * base_a + d\n\n   But note: the string might be very long (up to 1000 digits). However, the base a is at least 2 and at most 25. The maximum number we can get from a string of 1000 digits in base 25 is 25^1000, which is astronomically large. But note the condition: \n\n      \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\"\n\n   Actually, wait: the problem says:\n\n      \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\"\n\n   But wait, that seems too high? Actually, the example input has numbers that are small. However, the note says: \n\n      In any other case (i.e., when we are not dealing with Roman numerals) the number (in base 10) is at most 10^1510.\n\n   But wait, 10^1510 is a number with 1511 digits, which is huge. However, our base conversion from base a (at most 25) to base 10 would require handling very big integers. But Python supports big integers, so we can do that.\n\n   However, there's a catch: the problem says the number in base a (with base a) is given as a string of up to 1000 digits. The maximum value in base 25 with 1000 digits is 25^1000, which is much larger than 10^1510? Actually, 25^1000 = (5^2)^1000 = 5^2000, and 10^1510 is 10^1510. We know that 5^2000 is about (10^log10(5))^2000 = (10^0.69897)^2000 ~ 10^(1397.94) which is less than 10^1510. So actually, the constraint for non-Roman cases is that the base10 number is <= 10^1510, so even though the base a string can be up to 1000 digits, the actual base10 value is bounded by 10^1510. This might mean that the input string in base a might have leading zeros and the actual number is small.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000\". So the string can be up to 1000 digits. However, the base10 value is bounded (for non-Roman: <= 10^1510, and for Roman: the number is <= 300010 and not zero).\n\n   So we have two cases: \n        Case 1: b is integer -> convert base10 number to base b (integer base, 2<=b<=25)\n        Case 2: b is 'R' -> convert base10 number to Roman numeral.\n\n   However, note: the input base a is given, and the number is in base a. But the base10 integer might be very big (if the string is long and base a is big) but the problem guarantees that in non-Roman cases the base10 integer is <= 10^1510. So we can safely convert the string to base10 using Python's built-in conversion? But wait, we cannot use Python's int(s, a) because the base a is variable and the digits might include letters beyond '9'. Also, note that the standard int(s, base) function only handles bases up to 36 and uses lowercase letters, but our base can be up to 25, and the string might have uppercase letters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write our own conversion.\n\n   Steps for converting string s from base a to base10:\n\n        Let digits = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n        But note: the base a might be as low as 2, so we don't have all these digits. We need to take only the first `a` characters from the digits string? Actually, no: the input string uses digits that are valid in base a, so the digits used are from '0' to the digit representing a-1.\n\n        However, the problem says the representation may contain leading zeros and the digits are from 0 to a-1. So we can map each character to a digit value by:\n\n            if char in '0123456789':\n                d = int(char)\n            else:\n                d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n\n        But wait: what if the base a is 11? Then the digits are 0-9 and 'A' (which is 10). This mapping is correct.\n\n        However, if the base is 15, then the digits are 0-9 and 'A','B','C','D'. But the input string might use only digits that are less than the base. So we can map each character to a digit value without worrying about the base, as long as the digit is in the set of allowed digits (but the problem guarantees that the string is in base a, so the digits are valid).\n\n        But note: the mapping above does not check the base. It just maps the character. However, the base a is given, so we must ensure that the digit value is less than a. But the problem says the input is in base a, so we assume the digits are valid.\n\n        Algorithm for base a to base10:\n\n            num = 0\n            for char in s:\n                # Map char to digit value d\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n                num = num * a + d\n\n        But wait: what if the base a is 11, and the string contains a digit 'A'? Then d=10, which is <11 -> valid.\n\n        However, what if the base is 10 and the string contains 'A'? Then d=10, which is not <10 -> invalid. But the problem says the input is in base a, so we assume the digits are valid.\n\n        Since the problem states that the input is a non-negative integer in base a, we assume the digits are in the range [0, a-1].\n\n   But wait: the input string might have a digit that is represented by a letter, but the base is low and the letter corresponds to a digit >= base? That would be an invalid input, but the problem guarantees that the input is valid.\n\n Step 4: Now, if b is an integer (not 'R'):\n        Convert the base10 integer to base b.\n\n        How?\n        If the base10 integer is 0, then output \"0\".\n\n        Otherwise, repeatedly divide the number by b and record the remainders.\n\n        But note: the base b is from 2 to 25. The remainders will be from 0 to b-1.\n\n        We need to map the remainder to a digit character.\n\n        We can define a mapping for digits: \n            For remainder d (0 <= d < b):\n                if d < 10: use str(d)\n                else: use chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n        However, note: the base b might be 11, then we use 0-9 and then 'A' for 10. But wait: if b is 11, then the digits go from 0 to 10, so we use 0-9 and then 'A' (for 10). Similarly, if b is 12, then we use 0-9 and then 'A','B'.\n\n        But note: the problem says the base b is at least 2 and at most 25.\n\n        Steps for converting base10 integer n to base b:\n\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                if r < 10:\n                    digits.append(str(r))\n                else:\n                    digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n\n            Then reverse the digits.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base2: the input string is \"1111001\", which is base2? Actually, wait: the first token is the base for the input. The input is given in base a (which is 2), so the string \"1111001\" is in base2. Then we convert that to base2? \n\n        But wait: the problem says the door lock: first part is base a, second part is base b, and the third is integer c in base a. Then we write it in base b.\n\n        So we read the entire string (which is in base a) and convert to base10, then from base10 to base b.\n\n        Example: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> the input string is \"1111001\" in base2. That base2 number is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 64+32+16+8+1 = 121 in base10. Then we convert 121 to base2: \n\n          121 // 2 = 60 remainder 1\n          60 // 2 = 30 remainder 0\n          30 // 2 = 15 remainder 0\n          15 // 2 = 7 remainder 1\n          7 // 2 = 3 remainder 1\n          3 // 2 = 1 remainder 1\n          1 // 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n        So the base2 representation is \"1111001\", which is the same as the input. So the output is \"1111001\".\n\n        Therefore, the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" outputs \"1111001\".\n\n Step 5: If b is 'R':\n\n        Convert the base10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n        Conditions: the base10 integer is at most 300010 (and not zero) and at least 1.\n\n        We need to handle the subtractive notation and the fact that the base is 10 (standard Roman numerals).\n\n        Standard Roman numerals: I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500, M=1000.\n\n        Rules for subtractive: \n            Usually, we use I, X, C for subtraction (only from the next two higher denominations). \n            So: 4 is IV, 9 is IX, 40 is XL, 90 is XC, 400 is CD, 900 is CM.\n\n        However, note that the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we need to cover numbers up to 300010.\n\n        But standard Roman numerals typically don't go beyond 3999 (or sometimes 4999). However, the problem states that the number is <= 300010.\n\n        How to convert a base10 integer (n) to Roman numeral?\n\n        We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number is positive and <= 300010.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion (for numbers up to 300010):\n\n        We can use a list of tuples that map integer values to Roman numeral strings, including the subtractive forms.\n\n        But note: 300010 is three hundred thousand ten. We need to represent 300000 and 10.\n\n        However, standard Roman numerals do not have a standard symbol for 100000 or 500000. But the problem does not specify, and the example numbers are small (like 5, 4). \n\n        But wait, the example input \"16 R\\n5\" -> output 'V', and \"5 R\\n4\" -> output 'IV'. \n\n        Since the problem states that the number is at most 300010, we can assume that the representation must work for numbers up to 300010.\n\n        However, the typical Roman numeral system does not have symbols for numbers beyond 1000 (M) without bars (which are not considered here). So how do we represent 10000? \n\n        According to the problem statement, the subtractive principle is used, and the base is 10. But note: the problem says the number is written in base 10 (because the input was given in base a, then converted to base10, and then we write in Roman). \n\n        There are historical extensions, but the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can break it down:\n\n        Let's consider:\n\n        We can use:\n\n          M: 1000\n          (for 2000: MM, 3000: MMM)\n          But 4000 is not standard, but we can use MMMM (or sometimes IV for 4, but for thousands? Actually, the problem says the subtractive principle is used for the fourth and ninth iteration. So for thousands: \n            4000: would be MMMM? Or sometimes IV with a bar? But the problem does not specify bar. \n\n        Since the problem does not specify beyond the standard subtractive principle and the examples are small, and the maximum is 300010, we can break the number into:\n\n          thousands: 300010 // 1000 = 300, remainder 10\n          then 1000s: 300 times M (if we use M for 1000) but wait, 300000 is three hundred thousand, so we need to represent 300000.\n\n        However, standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 100000. But note that 100000 is one hundred thousand, which would be C (centum) but that is 100, not 100000. Actually, the problem says: \n\n          \"a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred\"\n\n        So the symbols are: \n          I, V, X, L, C, D, M.\n\n        The problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        This implies that the system is additive and subtractive, and the symbols are fixed.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify how to represent numbers beyond 3999. \n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can break it as:\n\n          300010 = 300 * 1000 + 10\n\n        But we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n        Actually, there are extended systems, but the problem does not specify. Let me check the constraints: the number is at most 300010. \n\n        We can use the following approach:\n\n        Break the number into:\n\n          thousands: n // 1000, remainder n % 1000\n          then the remainder is broken into hundreds, tens, ones.\n\n        But how to represent 300000? We can use 300 * 1000, but 1000 is represented by M. So 300000 is MMM followed by 0 hundreds, 0 tens, 10 ones.\n\n        However, writing 300000 as \"MMM\" for 3000 and then nothing for the rest? Actually, 300000 is 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        Alternative: use the standard way of writing large numbers: by repeating the symbols. But note: the problem says the base is 10 and the subtractive principle. \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the example numbers are small, we can assume that the intended representation is the standard one, and for numbers beyond 3999 we use the repetition of the base symbols (without subtractive for thousands?).\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" but that was for the base system, not for Roman.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again: the Roman numeral system described is the standard one (with subtractive) and the only special thing is that they use base a for the input and base b for the output, but the Roman numeral is independent of base (it's base10).\n\n        However, the example inputs for Roman are small (5 and 4). \n\n        Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, we have to represent numbers up to 300010.\n\n        We can use the following method:\n\n        We'll create a list of value-symbol pairs for the standard Roman numerals, and then also for the thousands we use 'M' and for multiples of 1000 we use multiple 'M's.\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion (standard way):\n\n        We break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n        But note: the standard way breaks the number by place values: \n          thousands: 1000, 2000, 3000, ... (but we don't have a symbol for 10000, so we use multiple M's: 1000=M, 2000=MM, 3000=MMM, 4000=MMMM? But wait, the problem says the subtractive principle is for the fourth and ninth iteration. In the context of Roman numerals, 4000 is not typically written as MMMM, but sometimes as IV with a bar (meaning 4000). However, the problem does not specify bars.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the maximum is 300010, we can simply use:\n\n          For thousands: use 'M' repeated (n // 1000) times.\n\n        But then 4000 would be written as 'MMMM', and 9000 as 'VIIIIM'? No, that's not standard.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the standard subtractive for the thousands? Actually, there is no standard subtractive for thousands. \n\n        However, the problem says the subtractive principle is used for the fourth and ninth iteration. In the standard system, we have:\n\n          I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, etc.\n\n        But for thousands, we don't use subtractive? Actually, the standard system does not use subtractive for thousands. \n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        This suggests that the subtractive principle is applied for the same set of symbols as the standard, but the problem does not explicitly say that the subtractive principle applies to the thousands. \n\n        However, the example numbers are small. And the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can stick to the standard way for the lower places and for the thousands we use multiple M's.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let n be the base10 integer.\n\n        We can break n as:\n\n          thousands = n // 1000\n          rest = n % 1000\n\n        Then, represent thousands as 'M' repeated thousands times.\n\n        Then, represent rest as a standard Roman numeral (using the subtractive rules for the hundreds, tens, and ones).\n\n        But wait, the standard Roman numeral representation for numbers above 3999 does not exist in the strict system, but the problem allows up to 300010. \n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can break 300010 as:\n\n          thousands = 300, rest = 10.\n\n        Then we represent 300000 as \"C\" repeated 3000 times? That would be too long. \n\n        Alternatively, we can break the number into:\n\n          Break by the largest possible symbols.\n\n        We can use a list of tuples from highest to lowest:\n\n        Standard Roman numeral conversion algorithm (for numbers up to 3999) is well known. But our number can be up to 300010.\n\n        We can extend the standard algorithm by adding the thousands part.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Define a list of value-symbol pairs, including the subtractive ones, and including the M for 1000.\n\n        However, we have to be careful: the subtractive principle is only for the same set: \n          I, X, C (and maybe for D and M? Actually, the standard subtractive uses I, X, C. For thousands, we don't use subtractive because there's no symbol above M? \n\n        We can define a list that includes:\n\n          roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n          ]\n\n        But wait, this is for the standard system (up to 3999). How to handle numbers above 3999?\n\n        Actually, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can break the number by first extracting the thousands part (each 1000 is represented by M) and then the rest (which is less than 1000) by the standard method.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          def to_roman(n):\n            # If n is 0, return empty string.\n            # Break n into two parts: thousands_part = n // 1000, remainder = n % 1000.\n\n            # Convert the thousands_part to a string of 'M' repeated that many times.\n            # Then convert the remainder to Roman numeral using the standard method (with subtractive) for numbers < 1000.\n\n          However, the standard method for numbers < 1000 uses the same list of numerals (without the 1000,900,...,500, etc.). \n\n        But wait, the standard method for numbers < 1000:\n\n          roman_numerals_under_1000 = [\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n          ]\n\n        Then, we can write a helper function for numbers less than 1000.\n\n        However, note: 300010 = 300000 + 10. \n          300000: 300 thousands -> 300 * 1000 -> so we use 300 'M's? That would be \"M\" repeated 300 times, which is 300 characters. Is that acceptable?\n\n        The problem does not specify the maximum length of the output. But the input string was up to 1000 digits, and the base10 integer is at most 300010, so the Roman numeral for 300000 is 300 'M's, which is 300 characters. This is acceptable because the problem does not restrict the length of the output.\n\n        But wait, the example inputs did not have such large numbers.\n\n        However, the problem says the number in base a is given (as a string of up to 1000 digits) and then we convert to base b (which is either integer or R). For the integer base, the output is base b (which is from 2 to 25) and the length of the output might be long (because the base10 integer is up to 10^1510, so the base b representation might be very long). But for Roman, the base10 integer is at most 300010, so the Roman numeral representation is at most 300 'M's and then the rest (which is up to 300) for the last part, so total 300 + 3 = 303 characters.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          if n == 0:\n              return \"\"\n          else:\n              # Break n into thousands and the rest\n              thousands = n // 1000\n              rest = n % 1000\n\n              roman_thousands = 'M' * thousands\n              roman_rest = to_roman_under_1000(rest)\n\n              return roman_thousands + roman_rest\n\n        But wait, what if rest is 0? Then we don't want to append anything.\n\n        However, the standard way: 1000 is \"M\", 2000 is \"MM\", etc., and then 10000 is \"MMMMM\", but we are breaking by 1000. \n\n        But note: the standard Roman numeral system does not have a symbol for 10000, so we use multiple M's.\n\n        However, there is a problem: the standard subtractive rule for 4000 is not defined by a single symbol, but we are using MMMM. \n\n        The problem says: \"The fourth and ninth iteration\", meaning that when you have four of the same symbol, you use subtractive? Actually, no, the subtractive rule is defined for specific transitions (like 4 is IV, 9 is IX, etc.), but for the thousands, the standard subtractive rule does not apply because there is no next higher symbol (unless we use a bar over M for 5000, but that's not in the problem).\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the examples are small, we'll use the simple method: for thousands, we use 'M' repeated, and for the rest (less than 1000) we use the standard subtractive rules.\n\n        However, let's test with a few numbers:\n\n          Example 1: 5 -> \"V\"\n          Example 2: 4 -> \"IV\"\n          Example 3: 9 -> \"IX\"\n          Example 4: 40 -> \"XL\"\n          Example 5: 90 -> \"XC\"\n          Example 6: 400 -> \"CD\"\n          Example 7: 900 -> \"CM\"\n          Example 8: 1000 -> \"M\"\n          Example 9: 1989 -> \"MCMLXXXIX\"\n\n        But wait, 1989: \n          1000: M\n          900: CM\n          80: LXXX (which is 50+30) -> but wait, 80 is usually LXXX? Actually, 80 is represented as LXXX (50+10+10+10) or sometimes as I for 1, but standard is LXXX.\n\n          Actually, 1989: \n            1000: M\n            900: CM\n            80: LXXX\n            9: IX -> so MCM is 1900, then LXXX is 80, then IX is 9 -> MCM + LXXX + IX = MCM + LXXX + IX.\n\n          But wait, the standard representation for 1989 is MCM LXXX IX, so together: MCM becomes 1900, then LXXX is 80, then IX is 9 -> 1989.\n\n          However, the standard representation is actually: MCM is 1900, then LXXX is 80, then IX is 9 -> so MCM LXXX IX.\n\n          Now, 300010: \n            thousands: 300 -> \"M\"*300\n            rest: 10 -> \"X\"\n\n          So the whole string is 300 times 'M' and then an 'X'. \n\n        But wait, 300010 is three hundred thousand ten. In standard Roman numerals, we break the number by thousands, hundreds, etc. So we should break the thousands part (which is 300) and then the hundreds (0), then tens (0), then ones (10). \n\n        However, our method breaks the number as:\n\n            n = 300010\n            thousands = 300010 // 1000 = 300\n            rest = 10\n\n        Then we output \"M\"*300 + \"X\"\n\n        But is that correct? \n\n        Actually, the standard way is to break the number by the largest place value. 300010 = 300 thousands + 10.\n\n        But note: 300 thousands is 300 * 1000, so we use 300 M's. Then 10 is X. \n\n        However, the standard representation for 3000 is \"MMM\", so 300000 is \"MM...M\" (300 times). \n\n        But wait, the standard system doesn't have a symbol for 10000, so we use multiple M's.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we are safe.\n\n        Steps for the helper function for numbers under 1000:\n\n          def to_roman_under_1000(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"\"\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n            res = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res += symbol\n                    n -= value\n            return res\n\n        Then the main function:\n\n          def to_roman(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"\"\n            # Break n into thousands and the rest\n            thousands = n // 1000\n            rest = n % 1000\n            return 'M' * thousands + to_roman_under_1000(rest)\n\n        But wait, what if the rest is 0?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of converting to Roman numerals. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input string from the given base to a base-10 integer, converting this integer to the desired base (either an integer base or Roman numerals), and handling edge cases such as zero or invalid inputs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion from Input Base to Base-10**: The input string is read and converted to a base-10 integer. Each character in the string is mapped to its corresponding digit value based on the specified base. For example, if the base is 16, 'A' maps to 10.\n2. **Conversion to Target Base**: The base-10 integer is then converted to the target base. If the target base is an integer (between 2 and 25), each digit is determined by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. For Roman numerals, the base-10 number is broken down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, using standard Roman numeral symbols with subtractive notation where applicable.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: Special cases include when the input number is zero (output \"0\") or when the target base is Roman numerals (ensuring the number is within the valid range).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    base_a_str = first_line[0]\n    base_b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        a = int(base_a_str)\n        b_str = base_b_str\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Error in input\", e)\n        return\n\n    digits_map = {}\n    for i in range(36):\n        if i < 10:\n            digits_map[str(i)] = i\n        else:\n            digits_map[chr(ord('A') + i - 10)] = i\n\n    def str_to_base10(s, base):\n        n = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            if d >= base:\n                continue\n            n = n * base + d\n        return n\n\n    base10_num = str_to_base10(num_str, a)\n\n    if base_b_str == 'R':\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n            return\n        if base10_num > 300010:\n            print(\"\")\n            return\n\n        def to_roman_under_1000(n):\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n            res = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res += symbol\n                    n -= value\n            return res\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"\"\n            thousands = n // 1000\n            rest = n % 1000\n            roman_rest = to_roman_under_1000(rest)\n            return 'M' * thousands + roman_rest\n\n        roman_rep = to_roman(base10_num)\n        print(roman_rep)\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(base_b_str)\n        except:\n            print(\"Invalid base b\")\n            return\n\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n\n        digits = []\n        num_val = base10_num\n        while num_val:\n            num_val, r = divmod(num_val, b)\n            if r < 10:\n                digits.append(str(r))\n            else:\n                digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n\n        if not digits:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits.reverse()\n            print(''.join(digits))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line specifies the source and target bases, and the second line provides the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The number string is converted from the source base to a base-10 integer by processing each character, mapping it to its digit value, and accumulating the result.\n3. **Target Base Conversion**:\n   - **Integer Base**: The base-10 number is divided by the target base repeatedly, with remainders collected to form the digits of the result in the target base. Digits greater than 9 are represented by letters (A-Z).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: The base-10 number is split into thousands and the remainder. The thousands part is represented by 'M's, and the remainder is converted using standard Roman numeral rules with subtractive notation for values like 4 (IV) and 9 (IX).\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handles zero values and ensures Roman numeral conversions are within the specified range (1 to 300010).
