For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (tone index) in a 12-note circle.\n    Let's assign:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   [Note: In some systems, H is B, but here we see two different names? Actually, the problem says: \"after H goes C\", and the list has 12 notes. Also note that the example input includes \"A B H\", so we must map H to 11.\n\n 2. However, note that the problem states the notes are cyclic. So we can do modulo 12.\n\n 3. Given three notes, we have three numbers: n1, n2, n3.\n\n 4. We need to check all permutations of these three notes to see if we can form a major or minor triad.\n\n 5. Conditions for major: \n        There exists an ordering (a, b, c) such that:\n            (b - a) % 12 = 4   (i.e., 4 semitones)\n            (c - b) % 12 = 3   (i.e., 3 semitones)\n\n        Then the total from a to c would be 7 semitones.\n\n 6. Conditions for minor:\n        There exists an ordering (a, b, c) such that:\n            (b - a) % 12 = 3\n            (c - b) % 12 = 4\n\n 7. But note: the circle is modulo 12. We have to consider the circular arrangement.\n\n 8. However, note: the problem says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" (when going upward). But in our mapping, if we have E (4) and C (0), then if we go from E to C in the circle, we can go two ways. The problem says \"from the lowest to the uppest\", but in the definition of the chord, we are allowed to order arbitrarily? Actually, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\".\n\n 9. How to handle the circle? We can consider that the circle is from 0 to 11. The distance between two notes a and b (in semitones) is defined as the smallest positive angle, but note: the problem says the distance from C to E is 4 and from E to C is 8. So they are not using the shortest distance. They are going in one direction (from low to high).\n\n 10. However, in the example: \"C# B F\" is minor. Let's map:\n        C#: 1, B: 10, F:5.\n\n     We are told to order as \"B C# F\". So we have to arrange the notes in increasing order (by their tone value) but wrapping around?\n\n     Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n     This means we are to arrange the three notes in ascending order (with wrap-around) but then how do we define the distance? \n\n     Alternatively, we can think: we have three points on a circle (with 12 points). We want to check if there is a contiguous segment of three points (in the circular sense) that forms a major/minor triad.\n\n 11. But note: the example \"C E G\": \n        C=0, E=4, G=7.\n        Order by increasing tone: [0,4,7]. Then:\n          4-0 = 4 -> major step\n          7-4 = 3 -> minor step? Actually, wait: major triad requires the first two to be 4 and the next 3, so yes: 4 and then 3.\n\n 12. Example \"C# B F\": \n        Notes: C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n        We need to order them: 1,5,10. Then the distances are:\n          5-1 = 4 -> but wait, the example says we order as \"B C# F\", which in numbers is [10,1,5]. Now, we must consider the circular ordering.\n\n     How to compare in a circle? We can unroll the circle. Since the chord is defined by the intervals, we can also consider the differences modulo 12.\n\n 13. Alternate approach: \n        Since the chord is unordered, we can generate all 6 permutations and check the condition. But note: the condition is defined by two consecutive intervals (4 and 3 for major, 3 and 4 for minor) and then the third interval is fixed (it will be 5 because 4+3=7, and 12-7=5, but wait, actually the entire circle is 12, so the third interval is (12 - (4+3)) = 5, but that is the remaining part). However, the problem does not require the third interval to be 5, but the condition is only on two consecutive intervals.\n\n 14. But note: the definition says \"an unordered set\" and then we can order the notes arbitrarily. However, the ordering must be such that the distances are as specified. But the distances are defined from the lowest to the highest. \n\n 15. Important: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. So we must consider the entire set of three notes and assign an order that goes from the lowest to the highest, but the circle might wrap around.\n\n 16. Actually, the example \"C# B F\": \n        The notes are C#, B, F. We can map to numbers: [1, 10, 5].\n        We need to arrange them in ascending order without wrap-around? But note: 10 (B) is greater than 5 (F) and 1 (C#) in the linear representation? \n\n     However, the problem states: the notes are repeated cyclically. So we can also consider the circle. But the distance from B to C# is 2 semitones (if we go from B to C#: 10->0->1, that's 2 steps: 10->11 (C natural?) wait no, our mapping: \n        Our mapping: \n          0: C\n          1: C#\n          2: D\n          3: D#\n          4: E\n          5: F\n          6: F#\n          7: G\n          8: G#\n          9: A\n          10: B\n          11: H? \n\n     Wait, the problem says: the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And then cyclic: after H comes C.\n\n     But in our mapping, we assigned:\n        C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n     However, the example input includes \"A B H\", so we must map H to 11. And B to 10.\n\n     Now, the example \"C# B F\": \n        C#:1, B:10, F:5.\n\n     To form the chord, we must order the notes so that we start at the lowest and go to the highest. But in a circle, we can break the circle at any point.\n\n     How to order three distinct points on a circle? We can break the circle at the point with the smallest value, but wait: what if the smallest value is not the actual lowest in the musical scale? Actually, the problem doesn't specify a starting note, but the distance is defined from the lowest to the highest.\n\n     Another idea: We can consider the three intervals between the three points (in semitones) and then check if they are {3,4,5} (because 3+4=7, and then the rest is 5). Then, for major: the two smaller intervals must be 3 and 4, but arranged as 4 then 3? Actually, the condition is:\n\n        Major: two intervals of 4 and 3 in sequence (so the entire chord spans 7 semitones, and the two intervals are 4 and 3). But note: the entire chord is 7 semitones, so the third interval (closing the chord) is 5 (because 12-7=5). Similarly, minor: 3 and 4, then the third is 5.\n\n     However, the problem doesn't require the entire chord to be 7 semitones, but the condition is defined by two consecutive intervals. But note: the definition says: \n        Major: there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that:\n            dist(X,Y)=4, dist(Y,Z)=3.\n\n        Then the chord is three notes: X, Y, Z. The entire set is {X,Y,Z}. The distance from X to Z is 7, and then the remaining part (from Z to X) is 5 (because 12-7=5). But wait, is that necessarily the case? \n\n     Actually, the circle is 12 semitones, so the entire circle is 12. The three notes split the circle into three arcs. The sum of the three arcs is 12. The two arcs (from X to Y and Y to Z) are 4 and 3, so the third arc (from Z back to X) is 12 - (4+3) = 5. \n\n     Similarly, for minor: the two arcs are 3 and 4, so the third arc is 5.\n\n     Therefore, both major and minor triads have the same set of intervals: {3,4,5}. The difference is the order of the two given intervals.\n\n     So we can check: \n        For the three notes, compute the three intervals (the gaps between consecutive notes when arranged in order, but considering the circularity). \n\n     Steps for checking:\n\n        Step 1: Map the three notes to numbers (0 to 11).\n        Step 2: Sort the three numbers. Then, we have three numbers: a, b, c (with a<=b<=c). Then, we can break the circle at a, so the distances are:\n                d1 = b - a\n                d2 = c - b\n                d3 = (a + 12) - c   [this is the wrap-around]\n\n        But wait, we have three distinct points. The three intervals (going in the circle) are:\n                interval1 = b - a\n                interval2 = c - b\n                interval3 = (a + 12) - c   [but this is the same as (12 - (c - a)) because (a+12)-c = 12 - (c-a)]\n\n        However, note: the entire circle is 12, so the three intervals must add to 12.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider the three intervals in the circle without breaking at a: the intervals are the differences between consecutive notes (including the wrap-around). We can do:\n\n                intervals = [ (b - a) % 12, (c - b) % 12, (a - c) % 12 ]   -> but negative modulo? We want the positive ones.\n\n        Actually, we can compute the three gaps as:\n\n                gap1 = (b - a) % 12\n                gap2 = (c - b) % 12\n                gap3 = (a - c) % 12   -> but wait, (a-c) is negative, so we do (a - c + 12) % 12, but then we get 12 - (c-a). Alternatively, we can compute the gaps without modulo by:\n\n                Let the sorted list be [x0, x1, x2]. Then the gaps are:\n                    g1 = x1 - x0\n                    g2 = x2 - x1\n                    g3 = (x0 + 12) - x2\n\n        Then the set of gaps is {g1, g2, g3}. But note: the entire circle must be 12, so g1+g2+g3 = 12.\n\n        However, in the example \"C E G\": [0,4,7]\n            g1 = 4, g2=3, g3= (0+12-7)=5 -> set {3,4,5}\n\n        Example \"C# B F\": [1,5,10] (if we sort the numbers: 1,5,10)\n            g1=4, g2=5, g3= (1+12-10)=3 -> set {3,4,5}\n\n        So both are triads (since the set of gaps is {3,4,5}). Then we need to check the order.\n\n        For major: the condition is that there exists an ordering (a,b,c) such that the two consecutive intervals (from a to b and then b to c) are 4 and 3. But note: the ordering in the circle is fixed by the note names? No, we can choose the starting point.\n\n        Actually, the problem allows us to order arbitrarily. So we can choose the starting note arbitrarily.\n\n        Condition for major: \n            There exists a starting note such that the next two notes (in the circular order) are separated by 4 and then 3.\n\n        But note: the entire chord is defined by the set. We can start at any note.\n\n        However, the condition is defined by two consecutive intervals (without wrapping). But wait, the example \"C# B F\" was ordered as \"B C# F\", meaning they started at the highest note? \n\n        How did they get 3 and 4? \n            From B to C#: \n                B (10) to C# (1): \n                In the circle, from 10 to 1: \n                    Without wrap: 1-10 is negative, so we wrap: 1 + 12 - 10 = 3 -> 3 semitones.\n                Then from C# (1) to F (5): 5-1=4 -> 4 semitones.\n\n        So the condition is that the two consecutive intervals (in the circular order) must be 3 and then 4, and then the next is 5 (which is the remaining). \n\n        But note: the definition says \"the distance along the musical scale from the lowest to the uppest\", so they are ordering from low to high. However, the example \"C# B F\" was ordered as \"B C# F\", which is not from low to high (because B is 10, C# is 1, and then F is 5). \n\n        Let me clarify: the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n        This suggests that we should take the absolute smallest path? Or the entire set of three notes, we can arrange in ascending order (without wrap) and then check the intervals?\n\n        Actually, the example \"C# B F\" is given as minor by ordering the notes as \"B C# F\". That ordering is not in ascending numerical order (because 10,1,5 is not ascending). \n\n        But note: the problem does not say the ordering must be by the numerical value. It says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals ...\". \n\n        The key is: the distance is defined from the lowest tone to the uppest one. So in the ordering, the first note must be the lowest and the last the highest? \n\n        However, in the example \"C# B F\", the note B is actually lower than C# and F? \n\n        Let's map the notes to frequencies. The circle: \n            C (0) -> 261.63 Hz\n            C# (1) -> 277.18 Hz\n            ...\n            B (10) -> 220.00 Hz? Actually, standard tuning: A4 is 440 Hz.\n\n        Standard tuning (A4=440):\n            C4: 261.63\n            C#4: 277.18\n            D4: 293.66\n            D#4: 311.13\n            E4: 329.63\n            F4: 349.23\n            F#4: 369.99\n            G4: 392.00\n            G#4: 415.30\n            A4: 440.00\n            B4: 493.88\n            C5: 523.25\n\n        So B4 is 493.88 and C5 is 523.25, so B4 is lower than C5. But wait, our mapping: \n            We have 12 notes per octave. The problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. So we have:\n\n            C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n        But wait, the example input includes \"A B H\", and the note H is the last one. According to the standard, H is the B of the next octave? Or is it the B of the same octave? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" So the sequence is:\n\n            ... , H (which is the 11th note) then the next is C (which is 0 mod 12). \n\n        And the frequency of H (as the last note) is the same as the next C? Actually, the note after B (which is 10) is H (which is 11) and then C (0) is the same as H? No, wait the problem says: after H goes C again. So the notes are:\n\n            C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11)\n\n        Then the next note after H (11) is C (0). So the circle is 0 to 11 and then 0 again.\n\n        Now, the frequencies: \n            A4 (440) is note 9 (if we consider octave 4). Then B4 (note 10) is 493.88, and then H (note 11) is the next note, which would be A#5? But wait, the problem lists H as the last note and then cycles to C. \n\n        Actually, the problem says the set of notes is 12, and they are arranged in order. The note H is the 12th note (index 11) and then the next is C (index0). \n\n        Now, the frequency of H (index11) is the same as the next C (which is the same as the previous C)? No, because the octave increases. But the problem is about the same octave? Or we don't care about octaves? \n\n        The problem states: the distance is measured in semitones. And the circle is 12. So we are working modulo 12.\n\n        The important thing is the relative positions. \n\n        So how do we define the distance from B (10) to C (0)? \n            In the circle, we can go two ways: \n                One way: from 10 to 11 (H) and then to 0 (C) -> that's 2 semitones (because from 10 to 0 is 2 steps: 10->11->0, but wait: 10->11 is 1 semitone, 11->0 is 1 semitone, so 2 semitones? But the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones. \n\n        The problem says: the distance from E (4) to C (0) is 8 semitones. \n            Because if we go from E (4) to F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), A#(10), B(10) -> wait, no, we don't have A#. \n\n        Actually, the example: E to C. We have to go from 4 to 0. The direct way (without wrap) is 0-4 = -4, which is 8 semitones (because 12-4=8). \n\n        So the distance from a higher note to a lower note (without wrapping) is calculated as (a - b) mod 12, but if a < b, then (a - b) mod 12 = a-b+12, but then we get 0-4+12=8. \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the distance from note a to note b (with a and b represented as numbers from 0 to 11) as:\n            If b >= a: d = b - a\n            Else: d = 12 - (a - b)   [which is the same as (b - a + 12) % 12, but wait: (b - a) % 12 gives a negative?]\n\n        Actually, the distance from a to b (from low to high) is the smallest nonnegative number of semitones to go from a to b, but the problem says the distance from E to C is 8, meaning we are going the long way? \n\n        Let me read: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". So they are not taking the minimal path. They are taking the distance from E to C as if we go upward (even though C is lower). \n\n        So the rule: the distance from note a to note b is defined as (b - a) mod 12, but if negative, then add 12. Then the distance from E (4) to C (0): (0-4) mod 12 = -4 mod 12 = 8 (if we define modulo operation for negative as adding 12 until positive). \n\n        Therefore, the distance from a to b is (b - a) % 12, but if negative, we adjust by adding 12 until positive? Actually, we can do: \n            distance(a, b) = (b - a) % 12\n            But wait: (0-4) % 12 = -4 % 12. In Python, -4 % 12 gives 8, because -4 + 12 = 8.\n\n        So we can define: \n            def dist(a, b):\n                return (b - a) % 12   # but wait, (b-a) % 12 gives a number in [0,11]. However, note that the distance from a to b is defined as the upward distance (from a to b) in the circle. \n\n        But the problem says: the distance from E to C is 8. With this definition: (0-4)%12 = (-4)%12=8, which matches.\n\n        However, the example \"C# B F\": \n            We are told to order as \"B C# F\". \n            Then: \n                From B (10) to C# (1): (1-10)%12 = (-9)%12 = 3 -> correct (3 semitones)\n                From C# (1) to F (5): (5-1)%12=4 -> correct (4 semitones)\n\n        So the condition for minor is: \n            There exists an ordering (a, b, c) of the three notes such that:\n                (b - a) % 12 = 3\n                (c - b) % 12 = 4\n\n        But note: the entire chord must be three distinct notes, and the ordering is arbitrary.\n\n        However, we have three notes. We can try all 6 permutations and check if any permutation satisfies either:\n\n            Condition for major: \n                (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3\n\n            Condition for minor:\n                (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4\n\n        But note: the condition is defined by two consecutive intervals. The third interval (from c to a) is (a - c) % 12, but we don't care about that for the condition.\n\n        However, we must ensure that the three notes are distinct. The problem says a chord is an unordered set of three notes.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Map the input string to three numbers.\n\n        2. Check if the three numbers are distinct. (The problem says the chord is three notes, but what if duplicates? The problem says \"set\", so duplicates shouldn't occur.)\n\n        3. Generate all 6 permutations of the three numbers.\n\n        4. For each permutation (a,b,c):\n                Check if ( (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3 ) -> major\n                Check if ( (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4 ) -> minor\n\n        5. If we find one major, output \"major\".\n           If we find one minor, output \"minor\".\n           Otherwise, output \"strange\".\n\n        But note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so no chord is both major and minor.\n\n        Example: \"C E G\": \n            Numbers: [0,4,7]\n\n            Permutations:\n\n            (0,4,7): \n                (4-0)%12=4, (7-4)%12=3 -> major -> found.\n\n            (0,7,4): \n                (7-0)=7, (4-7)%12 = (4-7+12)%12=9 -> not major or minor.\n\n            (4,0,7): \n                (0-4)%12=8, (7-0)%12=7 -> no.\n\n            (4,7,0): \n                (7-4)=3, (0-7)%12=5 -> no.\n\n            (7,0,4): \n                (0-7)%12=5, (4-0)%12=4 -> no.\n\n            (7,4,0): \n                (4-7)%12=9, (0-4)%12=8 -> no.\n\n            So only one permutation works.\n\n        Example \"C# B F\": \n            Numbers: [1,5,10]\n\n            We need to find a permutation (a,b,c) such that (b-a)%12=3 and (c-b)%12=4.\n\n            Let's try (10,1,5): \n                (1-10)%12 = (1-10) = -9 -> 3 (because -9+12=3) -> condition1: 3, then (5-1)%12=4 -> condition2: 4 -> minor.\n\n            So it works.\n\n        However, note: the example input is given as \"C# B F\", so the input is provided as three strings.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Create a dictionary to map note names to numbers.\n\n        Note: The input may have '#' and without. Also, note that the note 'H' is present.\n\n        Let's create the mapping:\n\n            note_to_num = {\n                'C': 0,\n                'C#': 1, 'Db': 1,   # but the problem only uses the given notation: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n                'D': 2,\n                'D#': 3, 'Eb': 3,    # but the problem doesn't use Eb, so we don't need to support that? The problem says the input will be in the given notation.\n                'E': 4,\n                'F': 5,\n                'F#': 6, 'Gb': 6,\n                'G': 7,\n                'G#': 8, 'Ab': 8,\n                'A': 9,\n                'B': 10,\n                'H': 11\n            }\n\n        But the problem says the input is in the above-given notation. So we don't have to worry about 'Db' etc. Only the given: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'].\n\n        However, the example input: \"A B H\", so we have to map 'A','B','H'.\n\n        Step 2: Read the input line, split into three strings.\n\n        Step 3: Map each string to a number. If there's an invalid note, but the problem says the input is three space-separated notes in the given notation.\n\n        Step 4: Check if the three numbers are distinct. If not, then it's strange? But the problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes. So duplicates would not be allowed. But the problem does not say the input won't have duplicates? We'll assume no duplicates.\n\n        Step 5: Generate all permutations of the three numbers.\n\n        Step 6: Check for major and minor.\n\n        However, note: the condition in the problem is defined for an ordering (X,Y,Z).

In our permutation, we are using all three distinct numbers, so that's fine.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers: \n            (-9) % 12 = 3, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: the condition in the problem is defined for the entire set. However, the condition in the code is defined for the two consecutive intervals. \n\n        But note: the two consecutive intervals in the permutation (a,b,c) are from a to b and then b to c. The entire set is {a,b,c}. \n\n        However, the definition does not require that the three notes are arranged in increasing order (by the circle) or anything. It just requires that we can order the set arbitrarily.\n\n        The above method checks all 6 permutations, so we are good.\n\n        But let's test with a known minor chord: \"D F A\" (D minor). \n            D=2, F=5, A=9.\n\n            We need to check if there is a permutation (a,b,c) such that (b-a)%12=3 and (c-b)%12=4.\n\n            Let's try: \n                (2,5,9): \n                    (5-2)=3, (9-5)=4 -> minor.\n\n            So it works.\n\n        Another example: major chord \"D F# A\":\n            D=2, F#=6, A=9.\n\n            (2,6,9): \n                (6-2)=4, (9-6)=3 -> major.\n\n        But wait: (9-6)=3, but then (2-9)%12 = (2-9+12)%12=5, but we don't check that.\n\n        However, the condition is only on two consecutive intervals. The entire chord is three notes, and we are only checking two consecutive intervals. \n\n        But note: the condition is defined by two consecutive intervals, and then the third interval is fixed by the circle (it must be 5). \n\n        However, the definition does not require the third interval to be 5, it only requires the two given intervals. \n\n        But wait: the problem says the chord is an unordered set of three notes. The definition of major is: there exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3. \n\n        The above code checks exactly that.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the condition (b-a)%12=4 and (c-b)%12=3 does not necessarily imply that the three notes are distinct and form a set of three? But we already checked distinctness.\n\n        But note: the condition (b-a)%12=4 and (c-b)%12=3 implies that the three notes are distinct because 4 and 3 are nonzero, so a != b and b != c, and then a != c (because 4+3=7, and 7 %12 !=0, so a != c). \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        However, we must consider that the two intervals are defined modulo 12.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique number (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note musical scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H).\n2. **Distinct Notes Check**: Ensure the three input notes are distinct. If they are not, the chord is automatically classified as \"strange\".\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three note numbers. For each permutation, check if the intervals between consecutive notes (when ordered in the permutation) match the conditions for a major or minor chord:\n   - **Major Chord Condition**: The first interval should be 4 semitones, and the second interval should be 3 semitones.\n   - **Minor Chord Condition**: The first interval should be 3 semitones, and the second interval should be 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the major condition, output \"major\". If any permutation meets the minor condition, output \"minor\". If neither condition is met by any permutation, output \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    s = input().split()\n    nums = [mapping[note] for note in s]\n    \n    if len(set(nums)) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    perms = list(itertools.permutations(nums))\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for a, b, c in perms:\n        interval1 = (b - a) % 12\n        interval2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if interval1 == 4 and interval2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if interval1 == 3 and interval2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and found_minor:\n        print(\"strange\")\n    elif found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique number (0-11) based on its position in the 12-note scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into three note names, which are then converted to their corresponding numbers using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Distinct Notes Check**: The code checks if all three notes are distinct. If not, it immediately outputs \"strange\" since a chord requires three distinct notes.\n4. **Permutations Generation**: All permutations of the three note numbers are generated to explore every possible ordering of the notes.\n5. **Interval Check**: For each permutation, the code calculates the intervals between consecutive notes (modulo 12 to handle the circular nature of the musical scale). If any permutation has intervals of 4 and 3 semitones (for major) or 3 and 4 semitones (for minor), the respective flag is set.\n6. **Result Output**: Based on the flags set during the interval checks, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if no valid conditions are met. The problem guarantees that no chord is both major and minor, so the combined flag check ensures correct output.",
