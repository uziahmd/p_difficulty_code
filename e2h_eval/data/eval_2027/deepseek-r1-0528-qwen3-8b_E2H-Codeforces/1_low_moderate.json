The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n Conditions: \n   The plate is w x h.\n   We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost ring). The second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, etc.\n\n Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle size is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n However, note that the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n But note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (so the outermost rectangle is w x h).\n The second ring goes 2 cells away, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4).\n\n How many cells in a ring?\n   Consider a rectangle of size a x b (with a and b being the dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) from the original).\n   The ring is the border of that rectangle. So the number of cells in the border of an a x b rectangle is:\n        top and bottom: each has length b, and there are two rows -> 2 * b\n        left and right: but we must subtract the corners because they are counted twice? Actually, the standard way:\n\n        total = 2*(a + b)*1 - 4   ? Let's think.\n\n   Alternatively, the entire rectangle has a*b cells, but we can also compute the border as:\n        total = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because the corners are shared by two sides, but wait: actually the formula for the border of an a x b grid is 2*(a+b) - 4?]\n\n   Actually, no. The border of an a x b grid (with a>=2, b>=2) is:\n        top row: a cells\n        bottom row: a cells\n        middle rows: (b-2) columns, and there are (a-2) rows? That doesn't sound right.\n\n   Let me break it down:\n        The top row: all b cells? Actually, wait: the rectangle is a x b. Then the top row has b cells, the bottom row has b cells, and the sides (without the top and bottom) have (a-2) * 2 (for the two sides) but then the sides include the top and bottom? \n\n   Actually, the standard way to compute the border of an a x b grid is:\n        If a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n        Otherwise: 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because the four corners are counted twice if we do 2a+2b]\n\n   But let's test with a=3, b=3: \n        The grid has 8 border cells (like a 3x3: the outer ring). \n        Using the formula: 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n   However, note the example input: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n\n   But wait, the example also includes \"7 9 1\" -> 28 and \"7 9 2\" -> 40.\n\n   Let's check 7x9 for k=1:\n        The first ring is the entire border of the 7x9 rectangle.\n        Using the formula: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32, but expected is 28.\n\n   Wait, what's the issue?\n\n   Let me draw a 7x9 rectangle (7 rows, 9 columns):\n\n        The border: \n            Top row: 9 cells.\n            Bottom row: 9 cells.\n            The sides: There are 7-2 = 5 rows in between, and each side (left and right) has 5 cells (because we don't count the top and bottom again). \n            So total = 9 (top) + 9 (bottom) + 5 (left) + 5 (right) = 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n   Alternatively, using the formula: 2*(7+9) - 4 = 2*16 - 4 = 32-4 = 28.\n\n   So the formula is: border = 2*(a+b) - 4.\n\n   Now, for the second ring (k=2) in 7x9:\n        First ring: uses the entire 7x9, so the next ring is defined on a rectangle of size (7-4) x (9-4) = 3x5.\n        Then the second ring is the border",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate and moving inward. The key insight is to determine the dimensions of each rectangle formed by each ring and then compute the number of cells in its border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into `w x h` cells. The first ring is the outermost border of this rectangle. The second ring is the next border, 2 cells inside the first, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n2. **Insight**: For the i-th ring, the inner rectangle dimensions are `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. The number of cells in the border of a rectangle of size `a x b` is given by `2*(a + b) - 4`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 1 to k. For each ring, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle and then the number of cells in its border. Sum these values for all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(k), which is optimal given the constraints (k ≤ floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        a = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        b = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * (a + b) - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_cells` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the current rectangle (`a` and `b`) by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original width and height.\n   - If either dimension becomes non-positive, break the loop as further rings would not fit.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring's border using the formula `2*(a + b) - 4`.\n   - Add this value to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the desired result by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and their borders, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
