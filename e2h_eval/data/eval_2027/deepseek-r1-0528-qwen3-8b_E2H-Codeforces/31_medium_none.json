Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, and then a list of n integers (the found cards) in the second line.\n\n The problem: We have infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x. We found n cards (with numbers that are in the range [-x, x]). We want to choose the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum of all the cards (found plus chosen) is zero.\n\n Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n\n Then we need to achieve a total sum of 0, so the sum of the additional cards must be -S.\n\n Now, what is the minimum number of cards we need to pick from the set of integers in [-x, x] (excluding the ones we already have? Actually, note: the problem says \"he only found n of them\", meaning there are infinitely many left. So we can use any card from the entire set (from -x to x) arbitrarily many times.\n\n But note: the example input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" has n=2, x=3, and the found cards are [-2, -2]. The sum is -4. We need to add cards such that the total becomes 0. We need a sum of 4 from additional cards.\n\n However, the note says: He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in absolute value. So the maximum absolute value of a card is 3. Therefore, we cannot use a card with 4. But wait, 4 is greater than 3? Yes, so we cannot use 4. The next best is to use two cards of 2: because 2+2=4.\n\n However, note that we can also use negative cards? But we are trying to get a positive sum (4). So we don't use negative ones. Alternatively, we might use a mix? But we are minimizing the number of cards. \n\n Observation:\n We are allowed to pick any card from the range [-x, x]. We wish to represent the target T = -S (which in this example is 4) as the sum of the minimum number of integers, each between -x and x (inclusive).\n\n However, note that we are allowed to use zeros too. But zeros don't help.\n\n How to solve?\n\n We are looking for the minimum k (nonnegative integer) such that there exists k numbers (each in [-x, x]) that add up to T.\n\n But note: the problem does not require distinct cards. So we can use the same card multiple times.\n\n This is similar to a coin change problem but with coins being all integers in [-x, x] (so a very large set) and we wish to minimize the number of coins to make the sum T.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to use negative numbers. This makes it more complicated.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since we can use any integer in [-x, x], we can consider:\n\n 1. If T == 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, note that the maximum positive value we can get with k cards is k*x, and the minimum is -k*x.\n\n So we must have |T| <= k*x.\n\n Moreover, we are allowed to use both positive and negative numbers. But note: we can use a card with value v (any integer in [-x,x]) and we are free to choose.\n\n However, we are minimizing the number of cards.\n\n Consider: we can use one card if and only if T is in the range [-x, x]. Then the answer is 1 if |T| <= x and T != 0? Actually, if T is 0 then we don't need any, so for non-zero T we check if |T| <= x then one card.\n\n But wait, what if T is positive and we use a positive card? Similarly, if T is negative, we use a negative card.\n\n However, there is a catch: we are allowed to use multiple cards. So sometimes we might need more than one.\n\n Example: T=4, x=3 -> cannot use one card (because 4>3), so we try two cards: \n   The maximum two cards can give is 3+3=6, which is >=4, and minimum is -6, so we can represent 4? \n   We can use two cards: 3+1=4, but wait: 1 is in the range? Yes, so two cards.\n\n But note: the problem says the initial set has every integer from -x to x. So we have 1 available. Then why the example output is 2? \n\n Let me read the example again: \n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n   Output: \"2\"\n\n Why isn't 1 acceptable? Because the example says: \"He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\" \n\n Wait, note: the required number is 4, and 4 is beyond 3 (the absolute value limit). So we cannot use a card with 4. But we can use two cards of 2 (which is within [-3,3]) and 2 is available.\n\n So the key is: the value of a card must be an integer in the range [-x, x].\n\n Therefore, when representing T, we are constrained by the fact that each card is at most x (in absolute value). \n\n Steps:\n\n Let S = sum(found_cards)\n Let T = -S\n\n If T == 0: answer 0.\n\n Now, we wish to represent T as a sum of integers each in [-x, x] with minimum k.\n\n Note: k must be at least ceil(|T| / x) if we only use positive numbers? But we can use negative numbers too. However, using negative numbers would require even more positive numbers to compensate, so probably we want to use as many positive as needed.\n\n However, consider: T is positive. We can use positive numbers only (since negative would require even more positive to compensate). Similarly for negative T.\n\n So without loss of generality, assume T is positive (if T is negative, we can consider the absolute value and use negative cards, but actually the problem is symmetric: we can flip the sign by using negative cards, but the minimal k for T and -T should be the same? Not exactly: because we are constrained by absolute value, but the representation for -T would be with negative cards. However, the condition is the same: we need k cards such that the sum is T (for positive) or -T (for negative). But the minimal k for T and -T is the same.\n\n So let's assume T is positive (if T is negative, then set T_abs = |T| and consider positive representation).\n\n Now, what is the minimum k such that we can form T with k cards, each in [-x, x]?\n\n We can use up to k cards, each at most x. So the maximum positive sum we can get is k*x. We require k*x >= T.\n\n So k >= ceil(T / x). But is that sufficient? \n\n Consider: we are allowed to use any integers. So if we have k cards, we can assign any integers in [-x, x] to them.\n\n We wish to know if there exists an assignment such that the sum is T.\n\n We can think of it as: we have k cards, and we can choose values from -x to x. We want the sum to be T.\n\n We can also use the idea of \"greedy\": if we use as many x as possible, then adjust.\n\n But note: we can use negative numbers too. However, if we are forming a positive T, then we don't need negative numbers unless we have to use a negative to meet the constraints? Actually, no: because we can use positive numbers only to form T (if T is positive). But wait, what if we use a negative card? Then we have to compensate by having even more positive cards. That would require more cards. So for minimal k, we would prefer to use only positive cards if T is positive.\n\n However, sometimes we can use negative cards and still use k cards? For example, if T is negative, we use negative cards. But for positive T, we use positive cards.\n\n But wait, what if T is positive and we use a negative card? Then the rest must sum to T + (some negative value). This will require more positive cards to compensate, so k would be larger. Therefore, the minimal k must be achieved by using only positive cards (if T is positive) or only negative cards (if T is negative). \n\n Therefore, without loss of generality, consider T positive. We wish to form T with k cards, each card being at most x (and at least -x, but we are using positive so we don't care about negative). Actually, we can use any card, but to form a positive T, we can use only positive cards (because if we use a negative card, we have to make the rest even larger to compensate, which requires more cards). So the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= T and also we can form T with k positive cards (each positive card is at most x, and we can choose any integer in [0, x] but note: we can also use 0? However, 0 doesn't help. \n\n But note: the problem allows any integer from -x to x. However, for forming T (positive) we can use any positive integer (from 1 to x) and zeros? But zeros don't add. So we only use positive integers.\n\n Then the problem reduces to: represent T as the sum of k integers, each between 1 and x (or more generally, between -x and x, but we choose positive ones). However, we are allowed to use negative ones too, but they hurt so we avoid.\n\n But wait: maybe we can use negative cards and get a lower k? Consider: T=5, x=3, and k=2. With positive cards: maximum we can get is 3+3=6>=5. Can we form 5? 3+2=5, but 2 is in the set. So yes.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use negative cards. But why would we? In this case, we don't need to. \n\n But consider: T=5, x=3, and k=2: we can use 3 and 2 (both positive). \n\n Another example: T=5, x=3, and k=3: we could also do 3+3+(-1)=5, but that doesn't help because we are minimizing k.\n\n However, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= T and also k >= ceil(T/x) and we can form T by choosing k numbers from [1, x] (if T is positive). \n\n But note: we can also use numbers that are not necessarily positive, but the minimal k must satisfy two conditions:\n\n  1. k*x >= T   (since the maximum positive sum is k*x)\n  2. Also, the minimal positive sum with k cards is k (if we use the smallest positive number 1) but we don't require that because we can use zeros? Actually, zeros don't help. But wait, we can use negative numbers? Then the minimal positive sum is unbounded from below? \n\n However, we are forming a positive T. We can use negative numbers, but then we have to compensate with even larger positive numbers. The minimal k is determined by the condition that the maximum positive sum we can get (k*x) is at least T, and the minimal positive sum we can get is ... actually, we don't have a lower bound for the positive part. But note: we can use negative numbers arbitrarily as long as the total is T. \n\n Actually, the representation is flexible. The necessary and sufficient condition for T (positive) is that the maximum sum (k*x) is at least T, and the minimum sum (k*(-x)) is at most T. But wait, if T is positive, then the minimum sum being at most T is automatically satisfied (since k*(-x) is negative, and T is positive, so negative <= positive). \n\n So the only constraint is k*x >= T.\n\n However, is that sufficient? \n\n We can form T if k*x >= T and k >= ceil(T/x). But we must also be able to form T with k numbers, each in [-x, x]. \n\n Actually, there is a well-known fact: with coins of denominations from -x to x (except 0) we can form any integer provided we have enough coins? But we are constrained by the absolute value. \n\n But note: we have all integers from -x to x. So we have consecutive integers. Then we can form any integer T' (for sufficiently large |T'|) with a fixed set of denominations if the set includes consecutive integers? \n\n However, we are minimizing the number of coins. \n\n Actually, we can use the following:\n\n  Since we have consecutive integers, we can form any integer T' (positive or negative) provided we have enough coins. The minimal number of coins k must satisfy:\n\n      k >= ceil(|T| / x)\n\n  But is that sufficient?\n\n  Consider: we have all integers from -x to x. Then the greatest common divisor of the denominations is 1 (because we have consecutive integers). So by the coin problem, we can form any integer above a certain threshold with enough coins. However, we are allowed to use negative coins too, which effectively gives us the ability to form any integer with at least ceil(|T|/x) coins? \n\n  However, note: we can use negative coins arbitrarily. But wait, we are trying to form a positive T. We can use one positive card and then use negative cards to adjust? \n\n  Actually, the problem is simpler: we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. Then we can use the following greedy:\n\n      We need k cards. The maximum absolute value per card is x. The total sum we need is T.\n\n      We can use the following: the maximum positive sum is k*x, the minimum positive sum is k*(minimum positive we can use) but note we can use negative too.\n\n  But note: we are not restricted to positive cards. However, we are forming a positive T. We can use negative cards, but then we have to compensate. \n\n  However, there is a known result: the minimal number of cards needed to form T (assuming we have all integers from -x to x) is:\n\n      k_min = ceil(|T| / (2*x))? \n\n  Let me think: no, that doesn't fit the examples.\n\n  Example 1: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/(2*3)) = ceil(4/6)=1 -> but we cannot form 4 with one card (because 4>3). So that formula is not correct.\n\n  Alternatively, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that:\n\n      k*x >= T   (if we use only positive cards) OR \n\n      but wait, we can use negative cards to our advantage? Actually, no: because negative cards would require even more positive cards to compensate. \n\n  Actually, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that:\n\n      k*x >= T   (if T is positive)\n\n  Why? Because we can use k positive cards (each at most x) to get a sum of at most k*x, and we need at least T. And we can choose the cards arbitrarily from 1 to x (since 0 and negatives are not helpful for increasing the positive sum). \n\n  However, we must be able to form T exactly. \n\n  But note: we have all integers from 1 to x. Then with k cards, we can form any integer between k and k*x (by choosing the appropriate numbers). \n\n  Why? Because we can use the coins 1 to x. Then with k coins (each at least 1) we can form any integer from k to k*x. \n\n  But wait, we don't have to use 1. We have all integers from 1 to x. Then the minimal sum is k (if we use all 1's) and the maximal is k*x (if we use all x's). And because we have consecutive integers (from 1 to x) we can form every integer between k and k*x. \n\n  However, note: we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. But if we are forming a positive T, we don't need negatives. But if we use negatives, then we have to use more positives to compensate. \n\n  Actually, the problem does not require that we use only positive cards. But if we use a negative card, then the positive part must be even larger. \n\n  But here's the catch: the minimal k must satisfy k*x >= T, and also we must be able to form T with k cards. \n\n  However, note: if we allow negative cards, then we can form T even if k*x < T? No, because the maximum positive contribution is k*x (if we use the largest positive cards) and the negative cards reduce the total. So to get T, we require that the maximum positive sum is at least T. \n\n  Therefore, the condition is k*x >= T.\n\n  Then the minimal k is ceil(T / x) if we are allowed to use only positive cards? \n\n  But wait: we are allowed to use negative cards. However, using negative cards does not help in increasing the positive sum. In fact, to form T, we can use some positive and some negative. But then the total positive sum must be T + (the absolute value of the negative cards). \n\n  However, we are trying to minimize k. The condition is that the total positive part (if we break down the k cards into positive and negative) must be at least T (if we use negative cards, we have to compensate by having a larger positive part). But then the maximum positive part is k*x (if we use all positive cards). \n\n  Actually, the condition is still that the maximum positive sum we can get from k cards is k*x, and we need k*x >= T. \n\n  Why? Because if we use negative cards, then the total sum is (positive part) - (absolute value of negative part). To get T, we require positive part - negative_part = T, and positive part <= k*x (since each card is at most x). Then T = positive_part - negative_part <= k*x - negative_part. But negative_part is at least 0, so T <= k*x. \n\n  Similarly, we can also use negative cards to form a negative T.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n  Then k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n  Example 1: \n      Input: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1, 1, 2] -> S = (-1+1+2)=2 -> T=-2.\n      Then |T|=2, so k_min = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. Output 1 -> matches.\n\n  Example 2:\n      Input: n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> S=-4, T=4, |T|=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. Output 2 -> matches.\n\n  Example 3: T=0 -> k_min=0.\n\n  Example 4: T=1, x=1 -> ceil(1/1)=1 -> correct.\n\n  Example 5: T=2, x=1 -> ceil(2/1)=2 -> correct (we need two cards of 1).\n\n  Example 6: T=3, x=1 -> ceil(3/1)=3 -> correct.\n\n  Example 7: T=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> correct because 2 cards: 2+1=3, and 1 and 2 are in the set.\n\n  Example 8: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n  Example 9: T=5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> but wait, can we form 5 with two cards? \n        The two cards must be in [-3,3]. The maximum is 3+3=6, so we can. But 3+2=5, and 2 is in the set. So yes.\n\n  Example 10: T=6, x=3 -> ceil(6/3)=2 -> correct (two cards: 3+3=6).\n\n  Example 11: T=7, x=3 -> ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3 -> correct (three cards: 3+3+1=7).\n\n  However, wait: Example 9: T=5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2, and 5<=2*3=6, so yes.\n\n  But note: the condition is k*x >= T. For k=2, 2*3=6>=5 -> holds. And we can form 5 because 5 is between 2 (minimal positive sum: 1+1=2) and 6 (maximal). And because we have consecutive integers from 1 to 3, we can form every integer from 2 to 6.\n\n  Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n      Read n and x.\n      Read the list of n integers.\n      Compute S = sum(list)\n      T = -S\n\n      If T == 0:\n          print(0)\n      Else:\n          abs_T = abs(T)\n          # k_min = ceil(abs_T / x)\n          k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x   # This is integer ceiling division for positive numbers.\n\n          However, wait: what if T is negative? We take absolute value, so it's the same.\n\n          But note: is that always sufficient? We argued that k_min is the smallest integer such that k_min * x >= abs_T.\n\n          However, we must also check: is it possible to form T with k_min cards? \n\n          Condition: k_min * x >= abs_T.\n\n          But note: we can form T if and only if k_min * x >= abs_T? \n\n          Actually, we can form T if we have k_min cards because:\n\n            We can choose the cards arbitrarily from [-x, x]. \n\n            We need to form T (which is either positive or negative). Without loss of generality, assume T is positive (if negative, we can use negative cards and the same reasoning applies by symmetry).\n\n            Then we wish to form T with k_min cards. The maximum positive sum is k_min*x, and we have k_min*x >= T.\n\n            But also, we must be able to form T by selecting integers from [ -x, x ] (but we are free to choose). \n\n            However, we are allowed to use zeros. But zeros don't help. \n\n            Actually, we can use the following: \n\n              We can use up to k_min cards, and we can use the largest positive cards (x) until we get close to T.\n\n            But note: we don't require consecutive integers from 1 to x for the positive part? \n\n            However, we have all integers from 1 to x. Then with k_min cards, the minimal positive sum we can form is k_min (if we use ones) and the maximal is k_min*x. And because the set {1,2,...,x} is contiguous, we can form every integer from k_min to k_min*x.\n\n            But wait, we are allowed to use negative numbers too. Then we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k_min*x? \n\n            Actually, the set of numbers we can form with k_min cards (each in [-x,x]) is the set of all integers from -k_min*x to k_min*x, but with gaps? \n\n            However, note: we have consecutive integers from -x to x. Then with one card we can form [-x, x]. With two cards, we can form [-2*x, 2*x] (because the minimal is -x + (-x) = -2*x and maximal is x+x=2*x). But are all integers in between achievable?\n\n            Let me check for two cards and x=2: \n                The set of two-card sums: \n                    -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n                How? \n                    -2 + -2 = -4\n                    -2 + -1 = -3\n                    -2 + 0 = -2\n                    -2 + 1 = -1\n                    -2 + 2 = 0\n                    -1 + -1 = -2, but wait, we have two cards: we can choose independently. Actually, the set is the convolution of two intervals [-2,2] with itself. The result is [-4,4] and since we have consecutive integers, the entire interval is filled.\n\n            In general, with k cards and the set [-x,x] (which is symmetric and consecutive), the set of achievable sums is the set of all integers from -k*x to k*x, because:\n\n                Base: k=1: [-x, x] -> consecutive integers from -x to x.\n\n                Assume for k-1, we can form all integers from -(k-1)*x to (k-1)*x.\n\n                Then for k, we take a card with value v (from -x to x) and add it to a sum s from -(k-1)*x to (k-1)*x.\n\n                Then the new sum s' = s + v, and s ranges over [-(k-1)*x, (k-1)*x] and v from [-x,x]. Then s' ranges from -(k-1)*x - x = -k*x to (k-1)*x + x = k*x.\n\n                But is every integer in [-k*x, k*x] achieved? \n\n                Since the set for k-1 is consecutive and the step of v is 1 (because we have consecutive integers from -x to x), the entire interval [-k*x, k*x] is covered.\n\n            Therefore, with k cards, we can form every integer T such that |T| <= k*x.\n\n            Then the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n            And that is k_min = ceil(|T| / x).\n\n  Therefore, code:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      total = sum(cards)\n      T = -total\n\n      if T == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_T = abs(T)\n          # Calculate k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n          # Using integer arithmetic: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   for positive a, b.\n          k_min = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n          # But wait: is that correct? \n          # Example: abs_T=4, x=3 -> (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2 -> correct.\n          # Example: abs_T=3, x=3 -> (3+3-1)//3 = 5//3=1 -> correct? 1*3>=3 -> yes.\n          # Example: abs_T=2, x=3 -> (2+3-1)//3 = 4//3=1 -> correct.\n          # Example: abs_T=0 -> 0, but we handled T==0 separately.\n\n          # However, note: the condition k_min*x >= abs_T is satisfied by this formula.\n\n          print(k_min)\n\n  But wait, let's test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2'] -> T=-2, abs_T=2, k_min=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2=1 -> correct.\n\n      Example 2: ['2 3\\n-2 -2'] -> T=4, abs_T=4, k_min=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> correct.\n\n  However, note: what if T is negative? We took absolute value, so it's okay.\n\n  But wait: what if T is negative and we use negative cards? The same condition holds: |T| <= k_min*x.\n\n  Therefore, the solution is to compute k_min = ceil(|T| / x) = (|T| + x - 1) // x.\n\n  However, wait: is that the minimal k? \n\n      We require k*x >= |T|, and we take the smallest integer k satisfying that.\n\n  But note: the set of achievable sums is [-k*x, k*x] (all integers). So if k*x >= |T|, then we can form T.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is k_min.\n\n  But wait, consider the example: T=0 -> we handled separately. What if T is negative? We take absolute value so it's the same.\n\n  One more edge: T=1, x=1000 -> k_min = ceil(1/1000)=1.\n\n  T=1000, x=1 -> k_min = ceil(1000/1)=1000.\n\n  T=1000, x=2 -> ceil(1000/2)=500.\n\n  This seems correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if T is negative? The same logic applies because we take absolute value.\n\n  But note: the problem says the cards can be positive, negative, or zero. And we are allowed to use negative cards. However, the condition we derived is independent of the sign.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      t = -s\n      if t == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n          # We need the smallest integer k such that k*x >= abs_t.\n          # k = ceil(abs_t / x)\n          k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n  But wait, let's test with the provided examples and some more.\n\n  Example: n=1, x=5, card=[3] -> T=-3, abs_t=3, k=(3+5-1)//5 = 7//5 = 1 (since 7//5 is 1 in integer floor division). Then 1*5=5>=3 -> correct.\n\n  Example: n=1, x=5, card=[0] -> T=0 -> prints 0.\n\n  Example: n=1, x=5, card=[5] -> T=-5, abs_t=5, k=(5+5-1)//5 = 9//5=1 -> correct.\n\n  Example: n=2, x=5, cards=[5,5] -> T=-10, abs_t=10, k=(10+5-1)//5=14//5=2 -> correct.\n\n  Example: n=2, x=5, cards=[5,4] -> T=-9, abs_t=9, k=(9+5-1)//5=13//5=2 -> correct because 2*5=10>=9.\n\n  Example: n=2, x=5, cards=[5,3] -> T=-8, abs_t=8, k=(8+5-1)//5=12//5=2 -> correct.\n\n  Example: n=2, x=5, cards=[5,2] -> T=-7, abs_t=7, k=(7+5-1)//5=11//5=2 -> correct.\n\n  Example: n=2, x=5, cards=[5,1] -> T=-6, abs_t=6, k=(6+5-1)//5=10//5=2 -> correct.\n\n  Example: n=2, x=5, cards=[5,0] -> T=-5, abs_t=5, k= (5+5-1)//5=9//5=1 -> correct.\n\n  Example: n=2, x=5, cards=[5,-1] -> T=-4, abs_t=4, k=(4+5-1)//5=8//5=1 -> correct.\n\n  Example: n=2, x=5, cards=[5,-5] -> T=0 -> prints 0.\n\n  It seems consistent.\n\n  However, wait: what if T is negative and we use positive cards? The same condition holds.\n\n  Therefore, we have the solution.\n\n  But wait: the problem statement says \"minimum number of cards\". Our solution is based on the condition that we can form T if the absolute value of T is at most k*x. And we choose the smallest k for which k*x >= |T|. \n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the input format. The first line has two integers: n and x. The second line has n integers.\n\n  We read:\n\n      import sys\n\n      data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n      n = int(data[0])\n      x = int(data[1])\n      arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n  But the problem says: first line two integers, second line n integers.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n  But note: the example input: \n          \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n      After split, the second line is ['-1','1','2'] -> then arr = [-1,1,2]\n\n  That is correct.\n\n  Code:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      t = -s\n      if t == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n          k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n  But wait: there is a possibility that the set of cards we found might contain duplicates or zeros, but that doesn't matter because we are only using the sum.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value, so our calculation of T is safe.\n\n  However, what if T is very large? But n<=1000 and x<=1000, and the numbers on the cards are at most 1000 in absolute value. Then the maximum absolute value of T is at most 1000*1000 = 1000000. Then k = ceil(1000000/x) and x>=1, so k<=1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the example input only has n cards, and the absolute value of each card is at most x (which is at most 1000). So the maximum absolute value of T is at most 1000000 (if n=1000 and each card is 1000, then T=-1000000). Then k_min = ceil(1000000/x) and x>=1, so k_min <= 1000000.\n\n  However, we are doing integer arithmetic: (abs_t + x - 1) // x, which is efficient.\n\n  But wait: what if T is positive? We did abs(t) so it's the same.\n\n  Therefore, we are done.\n\n  However, wait: I just thought: the condition we derived is that with k cards we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k*x. But what if T is not divisible by the gcd? \n\n  But note: the set of denominations is consecutive integers, so the gcd is 1. Therefore, we can form any integer T (as long as |T| <= k*x). \n\n  However, wait: we proved by induction that with k cards we can form every integer from -k*x to k*x. So we don't need divisibility by any gcd because the set is consecutive.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  Let me run the provided examples:\n\n      Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2] -> s=2, t=-2, abs_t=2 -> k=(2+2-1)//2= (3)//2=1 -> output 1.\n\n      Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, t=4, abs_t=4 -> k=(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> output 2.\n\n  So it matches.\n\n  However, wait: the example input is given as a string in the example: \n          ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n  But we are reading from stdin.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      n, x = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      s = sum(arr)\n      t = -s\n      if t == 0:\n          print(0)\n      else:\n          abs_t = abs(t)\n          k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n  But wait: what if T is negative? We take absolute value, so it's the same.\n\n  However, note: the condition is symmetric for positive and negative T.\n\n  One more thing: the ceiling division for positive numbers is defined as (abs_t + x",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards (found and additional) equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the sum of the found cards, S, must be balanced by the sum of the additional cards, which should be -S. The challenge is to find the smallest number of cards (each with values between -x and x) that sum up to -S.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum (-S) divided by the maximum absolute value of a card (x). This is because each card can contribute at most x (or -x) towards the sum, so the minimal number of cards needed is the smallest integer k such that k*x ≥ |target sum|.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the target sum (T = -sum of found cards). If T is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimal k as ceil(|T| / x) using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    t = -total_sum\n    if t == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line reads the list of found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the total sum of the found cards. The target sum T is the negative of this total, which needs to be achieved by additional cards.\n3. **Special Case Handling**: If T is zero, output 0 since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: For non-zero T, calculate the minimal number of cards (k) using integer arithmetic to find the ceiling of |T| divided by x. This is done by `(abs_t + x - 1) // x`, ensuring we round up to the nearest integer.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the computed minimal number of cards (k).\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging mathematical insights and integer arithmetic to handle edge cases and large values optimally.",
