Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of old candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour.\n   - When we burn a candle, it becomes an old candle.\n   - After burning, if we have collected 'b' old candles, we can make one new candle.\n\n However, note that we can use the same strategy repeatedly: \n   - Start with 'a' candles. Burn all of them -> hours used = a, now we have a old candles.\n   - Then, we can make floor(a / b) new candles from the old ones, and the remainder (a % b) remains as leftover.\n\n But note: the problem is that when we burn the new candles, they also become old. So we can continue the process.\n\n Steps:\n   Let hours = 0\n   Let current_candles = a\n   Let leftovers = 0\n\n However, we can simulate:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   while current > 0:\n        # Burn the current candles\n        total_hours += current\n        # Now we have 'current' old candles (from the ones we just burned) plus any leftover from before?\n        # Actually, we should account for the leftovers from previous cycles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   Step 1: Burn 'a' candles -> hours = a, then we have 'a' old candles.\n   Step 2: From 'a' old candles, we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and we are left with a % b old candles.\n\n   Then we add the new candles to our current stock and continue.\n\n   But note: when we burn the new candles, we get more old ones. So the process continues until we don't have enough to make a new candle.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   candles = a\n   hours = 0\n   leftover = 0\n\n   while candles > 0:\n        # Burn all the current candles (including any leftover from previous cycles? Actually, we should accumulate leftovers)\n        # But note: in the problem, the process is:\n        #   - Initially, we have a candles. We burn them -> hours += a, then we have a old ones.\n        #   - Then, we form new candles: n_new = a // b, and the leftover_old = a % b.\n        #   - Then, the next set of candles is n_new, but also we have the leftover_old from the previous step? Actually, we must carry over the leftover.\n\n   Actually, let's reframe:\n\n   We start with:\n        current = a\n        total_hours = 0\n        leftover = 0\n\n   But wait, the process doesn't separate the initial a and the leftover. Instead, we can consider:\n\n   total_candles = a\n   total_used = 0\n   leftover_count = 0\n\n   However, a better way is:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   while candles >= 1:\n        total_hours += candles   # burn all current candles\n        # Now, we have 'candles' old candles (which are the ones we just burned) plus any leftover from before?\n        # But actually, we need to account for the fact that we might have leftover from previous cycles.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   We start by having a certain number of candles (initially a). Then, we burn them, so we add the number of candles burned to the hours, and then we get those burned candles as leftovers.\n\n   Then, we can form new candles from the total leftovers (which is the sum of all burned candles that haven't been turned into new ones yet).\n\n   However, we can model it without accumulating all leftovers at once:\n\n   Let:\n        hours = 0\n        current = a\n        leftover = 0\n\n   But then, we burn the current candles: so we add 'current' to hours, and then we get 'current' leftovers (but we also have the leftover from before).\n\n   Actually, we should combine the leftover from the previous cycle with the current burned candles.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   candles = a\n   hours = 0\n   while candles >= 1:\n        # Burn 'candles' candles: that gives us 'candles' hours\n        hours += candles\n        # Then, we can form new candles from the burned candles (which are now leftovers) and any leftover from before.\n        # But wait, in our simulation, we don't have leftover from before because we are using the entire current set.\n\n   However, we must account for the fact that we might have leftover from previous cycles. So we should keep track of the total leftover.\n\n   Revised:\n\n   Let:\n        total_leftover = 0\n        candles = a\n        hours = 0\n\n   But then, the process:\n\n        Step 1: We have 'candles' new candles. We burn them: hours += candles.\n        Then, these candles become 'candles' leftovers. So total_leftover += candles.\n\n        Then, from total_leftover, we can form new_candles = total_leftover // b\n        And update total_leftover = total_leftover % b\n\n        Then, set candles = new_candles   (because now we have new candles that we can burn again)\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require separating the initial and the recycled. Actually, we can use:\n\n        total_leftover = 0\n        current = a\n        hours = 0\n\n        while current > 0:\n            hours += current\n            # Burn the current candles, so they become leftovers. But note: we are going to use the leftovers to make more candles.\n            total_leftover += current\n            current = total_leftover // b\n            total_leftover = total_leftover % b\n\n   But wait, is this correct?\n\n   Example 1: Input \"4 2\"\n        Start: current=4, total_leftover=0, hours=0.\n        First iteration:\n            hours = 4\n            total_leftover = 4\n            current = 4 // 2 = 2\n            total_leftover %= 2 -> 0\n        Second iteration:\n            hours = 4+2 = 6\n            total_leftover = 0+2 = 2\n            current = 2//2 = 1\n            total_leftover %= 2 -> 0\n        Third iteration:\n            hours = 6+1 = 7\n            total_leftover = 0+1 = 1\n            current = 1//2 = 0\n            total_leftover %= 1 -> 1 % 2 = 1\n\n        Then we break because current becomes 0.\n\n        Output: 7 -> matches.\n\n   Example 2: Input \"6 3\"\n        Start: current=6, total_leftover=0, hours=0.\n        First iteration:\n            hours=6\n            total_leftover=6\n            current=6//3=2\n            total_leftover=0 (6%3=0)\n        Second iteration:\n            hours=6+2=8\n            total_leftover=2\n            current=2//3=0 -> stop.\n\n        Output: 8 -> matches.\n\n   However, wait: in the second example, after the first burn we have 6 old candles, which gives 2 new candles. Then we burn these 2, getting 2 more hours, and then we have 2 old candles. Since 2 < 3, we cannot make another candle. So total 8 hours.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read input: a and b\n\n   total_leftover = 0\n   current = a\n   hours = 0\n\n   while current > 0:\n        hours += current\n        total_leftover += current\n        current = total_leftover // b\n        total_leftover = total_leftover % b\n\n   Print(hours)\n\n   But note: the problem says that Vasily can act optimally. This simulation accounts for the recycling.\n\n   However, there's an alternative mathematical solution. But the above loop is efficient since a and b are at most 1000, and the number of iterations is logarithmic.\n\n   Let me test with edge cases.\n\n   Edge case 1: a=1, b=2\n        current=1, total_leftover=0, hours=0.\n        First iteration: hours=1, total_leftover=1, current=0 (since 1//2=0). Then break.\n        Output: 1 -> correct.\n\n   Edge case 2: a=2, b=3\n        current=2, total_leftover=0, hours=0.\n        First iteration: hours=2, total_leftover=2, current=0 (2//3=0). Then break.\n        Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n   Edge case 3: a=5, b=3\n        current=5, total_leftover=0, hours=0.\n        Iter1: hours=5, total_leftover=5, current=5//3=1, total_leftover=5%3=2.\n        Iter2: hours=5+1=6, total_leftover=2+1=3, current=3//3=1, total_leftover=0.\n        Iter3: hours=6+1=7, total_leftover=0+1=1, current=0 -> break.\n        Output: 7.\n\n   Check: \n        5 initial candles: burn for 5 hours, then we have 5 old -> make 1 new (using 3 of them, leaving 2).\n        Then burn the 1 new candle: 1 hour, now we have 1 old and 2 leftover -> total 3 old, so we make 1 new candle (3//3=1) and then burn that one: 1 hour, then we have 1 old which is not enough. Total hours=5+1+1=7.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above method uses integer arithmetic and accumulates the total_leftover. It is straightforward.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the input format is one line with two integers.\n\n   Code:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   if not data: \n        # but problem says there are two integers, so we assume there are.\n        pass\n   a = int(data[0])\n   b = int(data[1])\n\n   Then run the while loop.\n\n   But wait: what if b==1? The problem states that b>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say 1<=a<=1000, 2<=b<=1000.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Let's code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and can be recycled into a new candle after burning, provided there are enough burned-out candles to form a new one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of initial candles, `a`, and the recycling rate, `b`.\n2. **Simulate Burning Process**: \n   - **Burning Candles**: For each iteration, burn all available candles (both initial and those formed from recycled leftovers). Each burned candle contributes one hour to the total.\n   - **Recycling Leftovers**: After burning, the total number of burned candles (leftovers) is used to form new candles. The number of new candles is calculated by integer division of the total leftovers by `b`. The remaining leftovers after forming new candles are carried over to the next iteration.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until there are no more candles left to burn (i.e., the current number of candles drops to zero).\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and recycling process, ensuring optimal use of all available candles and their leftovers to maximize the total burning hours.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_leftover = 0\n    current = a\n    hours = 0\n    \n    while current > 0:\n        hours += current\n        total_leftover += current\n        current = total_leftover // b\n        total_leftover = total_leftover % b\n        \n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to form a new candle).\n2. **Initialization**: Variables `total_leftover`, `current`, and `hours` are initialized to zero. `total_leftover` keeps track of the cumulative burned candles, `current` represents the number of candles available for burning in each iteration, and `hours` accumulates the total burning time.\n3. **Loop Execution**: \n   - **Burning Phase**: In each iteration, the current candles are burned, adding their count to `hours`.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The burned candles are added to `total_leftover`. New candles are formed by dividing `total_leftover` by `b`, and the remainder is stored back in `total_leftover` for the next iteration.\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when `current` becomes zero, indicating no more candles are left to burn. The total accumulated hours are then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
