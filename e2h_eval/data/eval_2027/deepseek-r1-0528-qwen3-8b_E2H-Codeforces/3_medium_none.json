Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers for the lantern positions.\n The idea is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps between the lanterns and also the edges (from 0 to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to l).\n\n However, note that the problem can be broken down into:\n   - The leftmost part: from 0 to the first lantern. The required d must at least cover from 0 to the first lantern.\n        So, the left edge requires d >= (first_lantern - 0) / 2? Actually, we need to cover 0, so if the first lantern is at position a0,\n        then the light from the first lantern must extend from a0 to the left until 0. The distance from a0 to 0 is a0. Therefore, the light must reach 0 from a0: d >= a0/2? Not exactly.\n\n But note: the entire street must be lit. We have multiple lanterns. The problem is to find the minimum d such that every point in [0, l] is within d of at least one lantern.\n\n We can think of it as:\n\n  - The gap from 0 to the first lantern: the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the first lantern's position. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0. Therefore, the leftmost uncovered segment is [0, a0]. The lantern at a0 will cover up to a0-d? Actually, wait: the lantern lights all points within d. So the coverage from a0 is [a0-d, a0+d]. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0. But wait, actually the lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The maximum distance from a0 to 0 is a0, so d must be at least a0. However, note that if we set d = a0, then the lantern covers from 0 to a0+a0. But we don't necessarily need to set d to a0 because if there are other lanterns, they might help? Actually, no: the entire street must be covered. We are looking for the minimum d that works for the whole street.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n  Let the sorted lantern positions be: a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}\n\n  The entire street is covered if:\n    - The left end: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The coverage from the first lantern goes from (a0 - d) to (a0 + d). We require that (a0 - d) <= 0, so d >= a0.\n    - Similarly, the right end: the last lantern must cover up to l, so (a_{n-1} + d) >= l -> d >= l - a_{n-1}.\n    - Between two consecutive lanterns: the gap between a_i and a_{i+1} must be covered. The light from the left lantern extends to a_i + d, and from the right lantern extends to a_{i+1} - d. To cover the gap, we require that a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, i.e., 2*d >= a_{i+1} - a_i.\n\n However, note: the entire street must be covered, so the gaps between lanterns must be bridged. The condition for two consecutive lanterns is that the light from the left lantern must reach at least halfway, and the right lantern must reach the other halfway. The minimal d that bridges the gap between a_i and a_{i+1} is (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\n But note: we don't need to set d to the maximum of these because we want the minimal d that satisfies all conditions.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n  Condition 1: d >= a0   (to cover from 0 to a0)\n  Condition 2: d >= l - a_{n-1}  (to cover from a_{n-1} to l)\n\n  Condition 3: for each gap i (from 0 to n-2): d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2\n\n Then the answer is the maximum of these three values.\n\n Why Condition 3? Because the two lanterns at a_i and a_{i+1} must cover the entire gap between them. The left lantern covers up to a_i + d, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - d. The gap between a_i and a_{i+1} is a_{i+1} - a_i. For the two segments to meet or overlap, we need a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, which simplifies to 2*d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) -> d >= (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   candidate1 = a0  (if we set d = a0, then the left end is covered)\n   candidate2 = l - a[-1]\n   candidate3 = max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 for i in range(n-1) )\n\n Then answer = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n However, wait: let's test with the example \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n   n=2, l=5, lanterns = [2,5]\n\n   candidate1 = 2\n   candidate2 = 5 - 5 = 0\n   candidate3 = (5-2)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\n   Then we take max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> which matches.\n\n   Another example: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n   First, sort the lanterns: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\n   candidate1 = 0\n   candidate2 = 15 - 15 = 0\n   candidate3: \n        gaps: 3-0=3 -> 1.5\n               5-3=2 -> 1.0\n               7-5=2 -> 1.0\n               9-7=2 -> 1.0\n               14-9=5 -> 2.5\n               15-14=1 -> 0.5\n\n        so candidate3 = 2.5\n\n   Then answer = max(0,0,2.5) = 2.5 -> matches.\n\n But wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0? For example, if we have n=1, l=10, and the lantern is at 5.\n\n   Then we need to cover from 0 to 5 and from 5 to 10.\n\n   candidate1 = 5\n   candidate2 = 5\n   candidate3: no consecutive gaps (n=1, so no i from 0 to n-2) -> so candidate3 is negative infinity? Then we take max(5,5, -inf) = 5.\n\n   But actually, we need d>=5 to cover both ends. Correct.\n\n However, note that if we have multiple lanterns, the condition for the middle gaps is independent and we take the maximum over all gaps.\n\n But note: what if the street is already fully covered by the lanterns without needing the edges to cover the entire edge? For example, if we have two lanterns at 0 and l, then candidate1 = 0, candidate2 = 0, and candidate3 might be some positive number. Then the answer would be candidate3. However, the two lanterns at the edges will cover the entire street only if the gaps between them are bridged by the condition 3. But wait, if the lanterns are at 0 and l, then the gap is l. Then candidate3 for the single gap is l/2. But also, we must consider the edges: but the edges are already covered because the first lantern is at 0 (so it covers from -d to d, but we only care about [0, l]; and similarly the last at l covers [l-d, l+d], but we only care about [0,l]). However, the condition for the edges is automatically satisfied by the fact that the lantern is at 0 and l? \n\n Actually, the condition for the edges:\n\n   Left edge: the first lantern is at 0, so we require d >= 0 (which is always true). Similarly, the right edge: the last lantern is at l, so we require d >= 0.\n\n But the gap between 0 and l is l, so we require d >= l/2.\n\n Example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and 10.\n\n   candidate1 = 0\n   candidate2 = 0\n   candidate3 = (10-0)/2 = 5\n\n   So answer = 5. This is correct because with d=5, the first lantern covers [0-5, 0+5] = [-5,5] and the second [5,15] so together [0,10] is covered.\n\n However, note: the entire street is [0,10]. The first lantern covers [0,5] (since we start from 0, the negative part doesn't matter). The second lantern covers [5,10]. So the point 5 is covered by both. The minimal d is 5.\n\n But wait: is 5 the minimal? What if d=4? Then the first lantern covers [0,4] and the second [6,10]. The segment [4,6] is not covered. So indeed 5 is minimal.\n\n Therefore, the method is:\n\n   Sort the lantern positions.\n   candidate1 = the first lantern's position (distance from 0)\n   candidate2 = l - the last lantern's position (distance from the last lantern to l)\n   candidate3 = maximum of (gap/2) for consecutive lanterns, where gap = a[i+1]-a[i] for i in range(n-1)\n\n   Then answer = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n However, note: what if there are no lanterns? (n=0). But the problem states n>=1.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"The first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109)\".\n\n So we don't have to handle n=0.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the example input format. The input is given as a string, but the example shows two lines.\n\n Example input: \n   \"7 15\"\n   \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n We read n and l, then the next line is the list of n integers.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read the first line to get n and l.\n   Read the next line, split and convert to integers.\n\n   Then sort the list.\n\n   Then compute:\n        candidate1 = arr[0]\n        candidate2 = l - arr[-1]\n        candidate3 = 0\n        for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n            gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n            if gap > 2*candidate3: # we can update candidate3 to be the maximum gap/2\n                candidate3 = gap / 2.0\n\n        answer = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n   Then print the answer with formatting to have 10 decimal places.\n\n But wait: what if the street is already completely covered by the lanterns? Then the gaps between lanterns are small, but the edges might require a larger d? Our method still holds.\n\n However, note: if the lanterns are very dense, candidate3 might be very small, but candidate1 and candidate2 might be large.\n\n Example: n=3, l=10, lanterns at [0, 5, 10]\n\n   candidate1 = 0\n   candidate2 = 0\n   candidate3 = max( (5-0)/2, (10-5)/2 ) = max(2.5, 2.5) = 2.5\n\n   So answer = 2.5.\n\n But with d=2.5, the first lantern covers [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5,2.5] -> so [0,2.5] is covered, the second lantern covers [2.5,7.5], and the third [7.5,12.5] -> so [0,10] is covered.\n\n However, note: the entire street is [0,10]. The first lantern covers up to 2.5, then the second from 2.5 to 7.5, and the third from 7.5 to 10. The edges are covered because the first lantern is at 0 and the last at 10.\n\n But wait: the first lantern being at 0: the condition for the left edge is satisfied (candidate1=0). Similarly the right edge (candidate2=0). The gaps: between 0 and 5, we require d>= (5-0)/2 = 2.5; between 5 and 10, we require (10-5)/2=2.5. So d must be at least 2.5.\n\n However, what if we set d=2.4? Then the first lantern covers [0, 2.4*2?] Actually, wait: the lantern at 0 with d=2.4 covers from 0-2.4 to 0+2.4, i.e., [-2.4,2.4]. So the point 2.4 is covered. The second lantern at 5 covers [5-2.4, 5+2.4] = [2.6,7.4]. Now, the point 2.4 is covered by the first lantern, but the point 2.6 is covered by the second. However, the gap between 2.4 and 2.6 is 0.2, but note: the first lantern's coverage ends at 2.4 and the second starts at 2.6. The point 2.5 is not covered because 2.5 < 2.6 and 2.5 > 2.4. So d must be at least 2.5.\n\n Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   # If there's only one lantern, then we have to cover from 0 to l, so the lantern must be placed appropriately.\n   # But our method: candidate1 = a[0], candidate2 = l - a[0] (because there is only one), and candidate3 = 0 (no consecutive gaps).\n   # Then answer = max(a[0], l - a[0], 0) = max(a[0], l - a[0])\n\n   This makes sense: if the single lantern is at position x, then we need d to be at least x (to cover from 0 to x) and at least (l-x) (to cover from x to l). So the minimal d is the maximum of x and (l-x).\n\n Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 5: then d = max(5,5)=5.\n\n Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 3: then d = max(3,7)=7.\n\n Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 0: then d = max(0,10)=10.\n\n Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 10: then d = max(10,0)=10.\n\n Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 8: then d = max(8,2)=8.\n\n So the code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   candidate1 = a[0]  # distance from start (0) to the first lantern\n   candidate2 = l - a[-1]  # distance from the last lantern to the end (l)\n   candidate3 = 0.0\n\n   # If there is at least two lanterns, then we consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   if n > 1:\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            # The required d for this gap is gap / 2.0\n            if gap / 2.0 > candidate3:\n                candidate3 = gap / 2.0\n\n   ans = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n   # Format the answer to have 10 decimal places.\n   print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n However, note: the problem says the answer must have an absolute or relative error <= 1e-9. Using float and formatting to 10 decimal places should be acceptable.\n\n But wait: what if the maximum comes from candidate3 and candidate3 is a floating point number? It's computed as a division, so it's a float. But the problem constraints (l up to 10^9) and n up to 1000, so the gaps can be integers, but when divided by 2, they might not be integers. But that's okay.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n   sorted a = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n   candidate1 = 0\n   candidate2 = 15-15=0\n   candidate3: \n        gaps: 3-0=3 -> 1.5\n              5-3=2 -> 1.0\n              7-5=2 -> 1.0\n              9-7=2 -> 1.0\n              14-9=5 -> 2.5\n              15-14=1 -> 0.5\n        so candidate3 = 2.5\n   ans = max(0,0,2.5) = 2.5 -> prints \"2.5000000000\"\n\n Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n   sorted a = [2,5]\n   candidate1 = 2\n   candidate2 = 5-5=0\n   candidate3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n   ans = max(2,0,1.5)=2 -> prints \"2.0000000000\"\n\n But wait, the sample output for the second sample is \"2.0000000000\", which is 2.0, and we got 2.0.\n\n However, note: the second sample input is \"2 5\\n2 5\", and the expected output is \"2.0000000000\". Our code produces 2.0, which is correct.\n\n But wait: in the example above, I thought the sample output was 2.0, but the problem statement says:\n\n     Input: \n          ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n     Output:\n          ['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n However, note: the example input has two test cases. Our code reads one test case. The problem runs on one test case per run.\n\n But the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is given as a list of two strings. In actual competition, we read one test case.\n\n Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says \"The first line\" and \"The next line\", so we are reading two lines.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as a list of two strings. This might be a representation. In standard input, we would have:\n\n   First line: \"7 15\"\n   Second line: \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n   Or for the second sample:\n\n   First line: \"2 5\"\n   Second line: \"2 5\"\n\n So we are reading correctly.\n\n Let me run through a few more edge cases.\n\n Edge Case 1: n=1, l=10, a=[5] -> ans = max(5, 5, 0) = 5.0\n\n Edge Case 2: n=1, l=10, a=[0] -> ans = max(0,10,0)=10.0\n\n Edge Case 3: n=1, l=10, a=[10] -> ans = max(10,0,0)=10.0\n\n Edge Case 4: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10] -> ans = max(0,0,2.5)=2.5\n\n Edge Case 5: n=0? -> but n>=1, so skip.\n\n Edge Case 6: n=2, l=1, a=[0,1] -> candidate1=0, candidate2=0, candidate3=(1-0)/2=0.5 -> ans=0.5\n\n But wait: with d=0.5, the first lantern covers [0-0.5,0+0.5]=[-0.5,0.5] and the second [0.5,1.5]. The entire street [0,1] is covered because from 0 to 0.5 is covered by the first, and from 0.5 to 1 by the second. However, the point 0.5 is covered by both. So it is correct.\n\n But note: the entire street is [0,1]. The first lantern's coverage goes from -0.5 to 0.5, so [0,0.5] is covered. The second lantern from 0.5 to 1.5, so [0.5,1] is covered. The point 0.5 is included.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the street is from 0 to l (inclusive). The lantern at 0 with d=0.5 covers [0,0.5] (since we are only concerned with [0,1]), and the lantern at 1 with d=0.5 covers [0.5,1]. So yes.\n\n But note: the condition for the edges: the first lantern is at 0, so we require d>=0 (which is satisfied). The last lantern is at 1, so we require d>=0 (satisfied). The gap between 0 and 1 is 1, so we require d>=0.5. So the minimal d is 0.5.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the street is of length l, meaning from 0 to l. The lanterns are located at points ai (0<=ai<=l). \n\n One more edge: when the lanterns are not covering the entire street even if d is set to the maximum? Actually, the method ensures that:\n\n   - The left edge: 0 is covered by the first lantern if d>=a0, and if not, then the first lantern alone cannot cover the left edge. Similarly for the right.\n\n   And for the gaps, we require that the two adjacent lanterns together cover the gap.\n\n But note: the entire street is covered if:\n\n   [0, a0+d] is covered by the first lantern (but note the first lantern might not be at 0, but we set d>=a0 so that 0 is included: the first lantern at a0 covers from a0-d to a0+d. Since d>=a0, then a0-d <= 0, so 0 is included. Similarly, the last lantern at a_{n-1} must have d>=l-a_{n-1}, so a_{n-1}+d >= l.\n\n   And for the gaps, we require that the entire interval [a_i, a_{i+1}] is covered by the two lanterns: the left lantern extends to a_i+d and the right lantern extends to a_{i+1}-d, and we require a_i+d >= a_{i+1}-d, so the entire gap is covered.\n\n Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n Code:\n\n   Read n and l.\n   Read the list of n integers.\n\n   Sort the list.\n\n   candidate1 = a[0]  (if the first lantern is at a[0], then d must be at least a[0] to cover 0)\n   candidate2 = l - a[-1] (to cover the end l)\n   candidate3 = 0.0\n   For i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        candidate3 = max(candidate3, gap/2.0)\n\n   ans = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n   Print ans with 10 decimal places.\n\n However, note: what if the street is already fully covered by the lanterns? Then the gaps might be negative? No, because gaps are non-negative (the lanterns are sorted). Also, if there are duplicate lanterns, then the gap is 0, so candidate3 remains the same.\n\n Example: n=3, l=10, a=[2,2,8] -> \n   sorted: [2,2,8]\n   candidate1 = 2\n   candidate2 = 10-8 = 2\n   gaps: 2-2=0 -> 0, then 8-2=6 -> 3.0\n   candidate3 = 3.0\n   ans = max(2,2,3.0)=3.0\n\n But wait, with d=3, the first lantern at 2 covers [2-3, 2+3] = [-1,5]. The second lantern at 2 covers the same. The third at 8 covers [5,11]. So the entire street [0,10] is covered? \n   From 0 to 5: covered by the first two.\n   From 5 to 10: the third lantern covers from 5 to 11, so [5,10] is covered.\n\n However, note: the gap between the second lantern (at 2) and the third (at 8) is 6, and we require d>=3 to bridge that gap. So d=3 is minimal.\n\n But what if we set d=2? Then the first lantern covers [-1,5] (so [0,5] is covered). The second lantern same. The third lantern at 8: [6,10]. Now, the gap between 5 and 6 is not covered. So d=2 is insufficient.\n\n Therefore, the answer is 3.0.\n\n However, note: the condition for the left edge: the first lantern is at 2, so d must be at least 2 (which is satisfied by 3). The right edge: 10-8=2, so d>=2 (satisfied). The gap between 2 and 8 is 6, so d>=3. So the minimal d is 3.\n\n The code produces 3.0, which is correct.\n\n Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at specific points along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to ensure that every point on the street from 0 to `l` is covered by at least one lantern's light. The key observation is that the minimal `d` must satisfy three conditions:\n   - **Left Edge Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0). This requires `d` to be at least the distance from the first lantern to the start (i.e., `a[0]`).\n   - **Right Edge Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the end of the street (`l`). This requires `d` to be at least the distance from the last lantern to the end (i.e., `l - a[-1]`).\n   - **Gap Coverage**: Consecutive lanterns must cover the gaps between them. For any two consecutive lanterns at positions `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, the required `d` must be at least half the distance between them (i.e., `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`).\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to systematically check the left edge, right edge, and gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - **Max Calculation**: The minimal `d` is the maximum value derived from the three conditions mentioned above. This ensures all edges and gaps are adequately covered.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the list of lantern positions takes O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of lanterns. The subsequent linear scan to compute the maximum gap requirement is O(n). Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    candidate1 = a[0]\n    candidate2 = l - a[-1]\n    candidate3 = 0.0\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            mid_gap = gap / 2.0\n            if mid_gap > candidate3:\n                candidate3 = mid_gap\n                \n    ans = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate checking the left edge, right edge, and gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Edge Conditions**: \n   - `candidate1` is the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0).\n   - `candidate2` is the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n4. **Gap Conditions**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is calculated, and half of this gap is considered as a potential `d` value. The largest such value across all gaps is stored in `candidate3`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal `d` required to cover the entire street is the maximum value among `candidate1`, `candidate2`, and `candidate3`.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all parts of the street are covered by the lanterns' light with the minimal possible radius `d`.",
