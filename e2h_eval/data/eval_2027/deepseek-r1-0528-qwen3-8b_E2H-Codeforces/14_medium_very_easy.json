    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How do we count trailing zeros in n!?\n The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n Now, we are given m (from 1 to 100000) and we need to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the number of positive integers n with exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n Observation:\n Let f(n) = Z(n). Then note that f(n) is non-decreasing. Moreover, for a fixed m, the set of n satisfying f(n)=m might be consecutive numbers.\n\n But note: the example: m=1 -> n from 5 to 9.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (the lower bound) and then adjust to get the exact m.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"exactly m\".\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   Let L(m) be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, but actually we want the starting point for which f(n)=m.\n\n But note: it's possible that for some m, there is no n such that f(n)=m? Actually, no: because the function f(n) increases by steps (at multiples of 5, then 25, etc.). However, we know that the sequence of trailing zeros is increasing and the gaps are sometimes more than 1. For example, between 24! and 25! we jump from 4 to 6 trailing zeros. So, for m=5, we don't have any n such that Z(n)=5? Actually, wait:\n\n   n:  5 -> 1, 6->1, 7->1, 8->1, 9->1, 10->2, 11->2, 12->2, 13->2, 14->2, 15->3, ...\n\n So, for m=5, we don't have any n such that Z(n)=5.\n\n Therefore, we must output 0 and then nothing (or just 0).\n\n Approach:\n\n We can use binary search to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m, and then check if Z(n) is exactly m? But note: we want all n with Z(n)=m.\n\n Alternatively, we can find:\n\n   Let n_low be the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n   Let n_high be the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n Then, the n's that have exactly m zeros are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\n However, note: if we have two consecutive n: n1 and n2, and Z(n1) = Z(n2) = m, then they are consecutive in the solution set.\n\n But also note: the trailing zeros are non-decreasing. So, the set of n with Z(n)=m is an interval [L, R] (if exists) where:\n   L = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m and Z(L)=m.\n   R = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1, then the previous one (n=R-1) is the last with Z(n)=m.\n\n However, we must check that Z(L)=m and Z(R-1)=m. But by definition, R is the first n with at least m+1, so Z(R-1) < m+1, and since we know Z(n) is non-decreasing, we have Z(R-1)=m.\n\n But note: what if there is a jump? Then we might have Z(L)=m and then at some point we jump to m+k (k>=1) without having m+1. Then our method would still work because we define R as the smallest n with Z(n)>=m+1, so if no n has m+1, then R would be infinity? But note m is at most 100000, and we are guaranteed that there is a maximum n (we can set an upper bound).\n\n However, note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000. We must consider that for very large m, the corresponding n could be huge.\n\n But note: the function Z(n) is roughly n/4 (since we add floor(n/5)+floor(n/25)+... which is about n/4). So, for m=100000, n is around 4*m? Actually, the standard estimate is that Z(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + ... = n/((5-1)/5) = n/4 * (geometric series) but actually the series is n/5 + n/25 + ... <= n/5 * (1/(1-1/5)) = n/4. So n is about 4*m.\n\n But we don't need to compute n beyond the necessary. We can use binary search for n.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Define a function Z(n) that computes the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n 2. We want to find:\n     Lower bound: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n        Let L0 = smallest n with Z(n) >= m.\n\n     Upper bound: the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n        Let R0 = smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n 3. Then the numbers n for which Z(n)=m are the integers in [L0, R0-1].\n\n 4. But note: it is possible that there is no n with Z(n)=m? Actually, we found L0 and R0. Then the set [L0, R0-1] is the set of n with Z(n)=m.\n\n However, we must ensure that Z(L0)=m. But by definition, L0 is the smallest n with Z(n)>=m. It is possible that Z(L0) > m? Then the set would be empty.\n\n Example: m=5. \n     What is Z(20)? \n        Z(20) = 4 (because 20//5 + 20//25 = 4 + 0 = 4)\n        Z(21) = 4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6.\n\n     So, the smallest n such that Z(n)>=5 is 25, and Z(25)=6 which is greater than 5. Then the set [25, next_bound-1] would be for m=6? Actually, we are looking for m=5: our condition for R0 is for m+1=6, so R0=25. Then the set [L0, R0-1] = [25, 24] -> empty.\n\n 5. Therefore, we must check: the set of n with Z(n)=m is non-empty only if the smallest n with Z(n)>=m has Z(n)==m.\n\n    Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        Let L0 = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n        Let R0 = smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then the condition for existence is: Z(L0) == m.\n\n        But wait, if Z(L0) > m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m. \n\n    However, note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and jumps by at least 1 at some points, but sometimes by more. So if we have a jump from m-1 to m+k (k>=1), then for each integer i in [m, m+k-1] there is no n.\n\n    Therefore, we can say:\n\n        Let L0 = smallest n with Z(n) >= m.\n        Then if Z(L0) != m, then there is no n with Z(n)=m.\n\n        But note: the function Z(n) is non-decreasing and the values are integers. So if Z(L0) != m, then it must be Z(L0) >= m+1, and then the set [L0, R0-1] (with R0 being the smallest n with Z(n)>=m+1) would be for m+1, not for m.\n\n    Actually, the set for m is empty if and only if Z(L0) > m.\n\n 6. Algorithm:\n\n    Step 1: Read m.\n\n    Step 2: Use binary search to find L0 (smallest n with Z(n) >= m). We set bounds for n: since m>=1, we know that n must be at least 5 (for m=1). And n can be up to, say, 5*m (or 5*m+some) but note: Z(5*m) is about m (actually floor(5*m/5)+floor(5*m/25)+... which is at least m). But sometimes we might need a little more? Actually, we can set high to 5*m*5? But let's do:\n\n        low = 0, high = 5*m  (but wait, for m=1, we need at least n=5, so maybe set high=5*m is safe? Actually, the value of Z(n) is about n/4, so n ~ 4*m. So 5*m is safe.\n\n        However, sometimes we might have m=0? The problem says m>=1.\n\n    Step 3: Similarly, find R0 (smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1). But if we found that there is no n with Z(n)=m (i.e., Z(L0) > m), then we don't need to compute R0. But we can compute both.\n\n    Step 4: If Z(L0) != m, then output 0.\n\n    Step 5: Otherwise, the numbers are from L0 to R0-1. Then the count is (R0 - L0). Then output the count and the list of numbers from L0 to R0-1.\n\n 7. But note: the problem requires to output the k numbers (in increasing order). However, if the range is very large (like m=100000, then n might be around 400000, so the range [L0, R0-1] could have many numbers) then printing all numbers might be too slow and use too much memory.\n\n    Example: m=1, then L0=5, R0=10 (because Z(10)=2, so smallest n with Z(n)>=2 is 10). Then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n    But if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n    However, for large m, the gap between L0 and R0-1 might be small (because the trailing zeros increase by more than one at multiples of 25, etc.) but sometimes the gap is 5 (if we jump by 1, then the gap is 1, but if we jump by 5, then the gap is 4). Actually, the gap is (Z(R0) - Z(L0)) in terms of the jump? Not exactly.\n\n    Actually, the gap (number of n with Z(n)=m) is (R0 - L0). This gap can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,...? Actually, the maximum gap between two consecutive zeros counts (i.e., the step in n) is 4, because when you hit a multiple of 5, you get an extra zero. But note: the zeros count increases at multiples of 5, then 25, then 125, etc.\n\n    However, the set of n with a fixed m might be consecutive. For example, for m=1, we have 5 consecutive numbers (5 to 9). Why 5? Because the next jump is at 10, which gives 2 zeros. So the gap between the two different zero counts is 5.\n\n    But note: the zeros count doesn't change every 5 numbers, it changes at multiples of 5, then 25, etc. The zeros count remains constant for a while and then jumps. The length of the interval for a given m is the distance between two consecutive multiples of 5 that cause an increase in the zeros count.\n\n    However, we don't need to worry about the gap size for performance because the gap is at most 5? Actually, no: consider m=0. But m>=1. Also, the gap is the number of consecutive n that have the same zeros count. The zeros count increases by the number of times 5 divides the number (except that we are counting cumulative). \n\n    Actually, the zeros count increases by the exponent of 5 in n (when n is a multiple of 5). But the zeros count for n and n+1: \n        Z(n+1) = Z(n) + (number of times 5 divides (n+1))\n\n    However, the zeros count only increases at multiples of 5. So between two consecutive multiples of 5, the zeros count remains the same.\n\n    But wait: at n=25, we have an extra factor of 5 (so two factors) and then the zeros count increases by 2.\n\n    Therefore, the zeros count can jump by more than one. Then the set for m might be empty, or if m is hit, then the set is the numbers from L0 to the next multiple of 5 (excluding the next multiple of 5, because at the next multiple the zeros count becomes higher).\n\n    Actually, the zeros count for n! increases by the multiplicity of 5 in n. So if n is divisible by 5^k but not 5^(k+1), then when we go from n! to (n+1)! we add one factor of 5 (if n+1 is not divisible by 5) and so on until we hit the next multiple of 5.\n\n    However, the zeros count only changes at multiples of 5. So the zeros count is constant for n in [a, b] where a and b are consecutive multiples of 5? Not exactly: the zeros count for n! is the same for n and n+1 (unless n+1 is a multiple of 5, then it increases by the exponent of 5 in n+1).\n\n    Actually, the zeros count for n! is the same for n and n+1 if n+1 is not divisible by 5. But if n+1 is divisible by 5, then we add one or more zeros.\n\n    Example: \n        n=4: Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1.\n        n=5: Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2.\n\n    So the zeros count is constant for a block of 5 numbers (from 5 to 9) and then jumps at 10.\n\n    Therefore, the set of n with Z(n)=m is either empty or a contiguous set of numbers.\n\n    But note: the jump at 25 is by 2, so for m=6, we have Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7. So the set for m=6 is [25,29]. \n\n    However, wait: Z(25)= floor(25/5)+floor(25/25)=5+1=6.\n            Z(26)= floor(26/5)+floor(26/25)=5+1=6.\n            Z(27)=5+1=6.\n            Z(28)=5+1=6.\n            Z(29)=5+1=6.\n            Z(30)= floor(30/5)+floor(30/25)=6+1=7.\n\n    So the set for m=6 is [25,29] (5 numbers).\n\n    Now, the gap (the length of the set) is 5 (from 25 to 29) and the next jump is at 30 (which is a multiple of 5, and adds 1, so total jump from 6 to 7).\n\n    In general, the zeros count increases by the exponent of 5 in n (when n is a multiple of 5) and then remains constant for the next 4 numbers (because the next multiple of 5 is 5 more). So the set for a particular m (if it exists) will always have 5 numbers? \n\n    But wait: what if the jump is more than 1? For example, at 125: \n        Z(124)= floor(124/5)+floor(124/25)+floor(124/125)=24+4+0=28.\n        Z(125)= floor(125/5)+floor(125/25)+floor(125/125)=25+5+1=31.\n\n        So from 124 to 125, the zeros count jumps from 28 to 31 (by 3). Then what about m=29,30? There is no n such that Z(n)=29 or 30.\n\n    Therefore, the set for m is either empty or a contiguous set of numbers, and the length of the set is 5? Actually, no: the set for m=1 is 5 numbers (5 to 9). The set for m=2 is 5 numbers (10 to 14). The set for m=3 is 5 numbers (15 to 19). The set for m=4 is 5 numbers (20 to 24). The set for m=5 is empty. The set for m=6 is 5 numbers (25 to 29). The set for m=7 is 5 numbers (30 to 34). But wait, Z(30)=7, then 31,32,33,34: \n        Z(30)=7, Z(31)=7, Z(32)=7, Z(33)=7, Z(34)=7, Z(35)=8.\n\n    So the set for m=7 is [30,34] (5 numbers).\n\n    However, note that after a jump of more than one, the sets for the intermediate m values are empty.\n\n    Therefore, the set for m is non-empty if and only if m is in the image of Z(n). And the image of Z(n) is the set {0,1,2,...} but with gaps.\n\n    How to compute the set for m?\n\n    We can use the binary search for L0 and R0.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        low = 0, high = 5*m   [We know that Z(5*m) is at least m (actually more than m for m>=1) because Z(5*m) >= m]\n\n        We'll define:\n            def zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n\n        Then:\n\n        L0 = binary_search_lower_bound(m)   # smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m\n        Then check: if zeros(L0) != m, then output 0.\n\n        Otherwise, we need to find R0 = smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n        Then the numbers are from L0 to R0-1.\n\n        However, the problem says: first print k (the number of such n) and then the k integers.\n\n        Example: m=1 -> k=5, then print 5, then 5 6 7 8 9.\n\n        But note: the range [L0, R0-1] is contiguous and we can generate the numbers if k is small. But k can be up to 5 (as we saw, the sets are contiguous and of length 5, unless the jump is more than one, then the set for m is 5 numbers). \n\n        However, wait: what if m is very large and the next jump is at a very large n? Actually, the set for m is always 5 numbers, because the zeros count increases by 1 or more at multiples of 5, and then stays constant for 4 more numbers. So the set for m is either 5 numbers or empty.\n\n        But wait: the set for m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't care.\n\n        However, consider m=0: \n            Then we are looking for n such that Z(n)=0. \n            Z(n)=0 for n from 1 to 4, then at 5 it becomes 1. So the set is [1,4] (4 numbers). But again, m>=1.\n\n        But note: the example input m=1, and we output 5 numbers. \n\n        Actually, the set for a given m (if non-empty) is always of length 5? \n\n        Let me check with m=0 (even though not required): \n            zeros(0)=0, zeros(1)=0, zeros(2)=0, zeros(3)=0, zeros(4)=0 -> 5 numbers? Actually, 1,2,3,4: that's 4 numbers.\n\n        Why? Because the next multiple of 5 is 5, and then we have 5 numbers from 5 to 9 for m=1. \n\n        The pattern:\n\n            The zeros count is 0 for n from 1 to 4 (4 numbers).\n            Then 1 for n from 5 to 9 (5 numbers).\n            Then 2 for n from 10 to 14 (5 numbers).\n            Then 3 for n from 15 to 19 (5 numbers).\n            Then 4 for n from 20 to 24 (5 numbers).\n            Then 6 for n from 25 to 29 (5 numbers).\n\n        So the set for m=0 has 4 numbers, and the rest (for m>=1) have 5 numbers? \n\n        But wait, why is m=0 different? Because we start counting from 1, and the first multiple of 5 is 5. The zeros count for n=0 is 0, but n must be positive. So positive integers start at 1.\n\n        However, the problem states positive integers n.\n\n        So for m>=1, the set is 5 numbers if the zeros count reaches m at some n and then the next jump is by 1 (so we get a block of 5). But if the jump is more than 1 (like at 25, the jump is 2: from 5 (at n=24) to 6 (at n=25) and then continues until 29, so the set for m=5 is empty, and for m=6 we have 5 numbers.\n\n        Actually, the set for a given m is always 5 numbers (if it exists) for m>=1? \n\n        Let me test with m=100000. We are not going to compute by hand, but note:\n\n            The zeros count increases by the exponent of 5 in n. The next jump (at n+1) is 1 if n+1 is divisible by 5 but not by 25, then 2 if divisible by 25 but not 125, etc.\n\n        However, the set for m is defined as the consecutive n for which the zeros count is exactly m. The zeros count remains constant until the next multiple of 5. But the next multiple of 5 might add more than one zero (if that multiple is divisible by a higher power of 5). \n\n        Therefore, the set for m is the set of n from L0 to the next multiple of 5 minus 1 (unless the next multiple of 5 is the one that causes the jump). Actually, the zeros count remains constant until the next multiple of 5. But note: the zeros count is defined for the entire factorial. The zeros count does not change until the next multiple of 5 is reached.\n\n        However, the zeros count does change when we multiply by a multiple of 5. The amount of change is the exponent of 5 in that multiple.\n\n        Therefore, the set for m is the set of n from L0 to min(R0-1, the next multiple of 5 - 1) ??? \n\n        Actually, no: the zeros count remains constant for n from L0 until the next time we hit a multiple of 5 that causes an increase. But note: the zeros count is computed by the formula, and the next increase happens at the next multiple of 5 (and the amount of increase is the exponent of 5 in that multiple). \n\n        However, the zeros count is non-decreasing and the set for m is the set of n such that zeros(n)=m. \n\n        How do we know the length? \n\n        Actually, we don't need to know the length by hand. We can simply compute:\n\n            k = R0 - L0   (the count)\n\n        Then output k and then the numbers from L0 to R0-1.\n\n        But note: the numbers from L0 to R0-1 are consecutive. However, if k is large (like 5) then we can output them. But if k is 0, we output 0.\n\n        But wait: the example m=5: \n            L0 = smallest n such that zeros(n)>=5 -> we found 25, and zeros(25)=6, which is not 5 -> so we output 0.\n\n        How do we compute R0 for m=5? \n            We want the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=6 -> that is 25.\n\n        Then the set for m=5 is [25,24] -> empty.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n            Read m.\n\n            Define function zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros.\n\n            Use binary search to find L0 (smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m)\n\n            Then check if zeros(L0) == m.\n\n            If not, output 0.\n\n            Else, use binary search to find R0 (smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m+1)\n\n            Then the numbers are from L0 to R0-1, which is k = R0 - L0 numbers.\n\n            Then output k and then the k numbers (if k>0, else nothing).\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\n        But if k is large, we cannot output a list of k numbers (because k might be large, but note: the set is contiguous and the gap between L0 and R0-1 is at most 5? Actually, wait: the zeros count increases by the exponent of 5 in n. The zeros count remains constant for a block of numbers. The block length is determined by the next multiple of 5. \n\n        But note: the zeros count increases at multiples of 5, so the zeros count is constant for 5 consecutive numbers (unless the next multiple of 5 is more than 5 away? Actually, no: the zeros count changes only when we hit a multiple of 5. So the zeros count is constant for a block of 5 numbers? \n\n        Actually, no: the zeros count changes at every multiple of 5, so the zeros count is constant for the numbers from n to n+4 (if n is a multiple of 5, then n+1 to n+4 have the same zeros count as n? No, wait: n is a multiple of 5, then n! has more zeros than (n-1)!. But then (n+1)! = n! * (n+1), and if n+1 is not a multiple of 5, then the zeros count remains the same as n! (until the next multiple of 5). \n\n        Actually, the zeros count for n! is independent of n mod 5. It is computed by the entire product.\n\n        But note: the zeros count for n! is the sum_{k>=1} floor(n/5^k). \n\n        Therefore, the zeros count is constant for n in the range [a, a+4] (if a is the current multiple of 5) because floor(n/5^k) doesn't change for n in [a, a+4] (since a is divisible by 5, then a+4 is not). \n\n        However, wait: if a is divisible by 25, then floor(a/5)=a//5, floor(a/25)=a//25, and then at a+5, we get an additional 5 and then the floor division by 5 increases by 1 (if a+5 is divisible by 5, then floor((a+5)/5)=floor(a/5)+1). \n\n        But the zeros count increases at multiples of 5. So the zeros count is constant for n from a to a+4 (where a is a multiple of 5) and then at a+5 (which is the next multiple) the zeros count increases by the exponent of 5 in (a+5). \n\n        Therefore, the set for a given m (if non-empty) is always 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n        Example: \n            m=1: [5,9] -> 5 numbers.\n            m=2: [10,14] -> 5 numbers.\n            m=3: [15,19] -> 5 numbers.\n            m=4: [20,24] -> 5 numbers.\n            m=5: [] -> 0 numbers.\n            m=6: [25,29] -> 5 numbers.\n\n        Then why did the example input ['1'] output 5 numbers? That matches.\n\n        But wait: the example input ['5'] (m=5) outputs 0.\n\n        However, what if m=0? (not in the problem) then we have [1,4] -> 4 numbers. \n\n        Since the problem says m>=1, we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n        Therefore, for m>=1, if the set is non-empty, then the set has exactly 5 numbers.\n\n        But wait: what about m=0? We are not handling m=0, so we are good.\n\n        However, wait: is that always 5? \n\n        Consider a multiple of 25: \n            At n=25, zeros(25)=6. Then the set for m=6 is [25,29] (5 numbers). Then at n=30, zeros(30)=7. Then set for m=7 is [30,34] (5 numbers).\n\n        Now, consider a multiple of 125: \n            n=124: zeros(124)= floor(124/5)+floor(124/25)+floor(124/125)=24+4+0=28.\n            n=125: zeros(125)= floor(125/5)+floor(125/25)+floor(125/125)=25+5+1=31.\n\n            Then the set for m=29 and 30 is empty. But the set for m=28: \n                The smallest n such that zeros(n)>=28: \n                    n=124: 28, so L0=124, and zeros(124)=28 -> valid.\n                Then R0: smallest n such that zeros(n)>=29: \n                    We need to find the smallest n with zeros(n)>=29. \n                    n=125: zeros(125)=31 -> so R0=125.\n                Then the set for m=28 is [124,124] (only n=124). But wait, that's 1 number, not 5.\n\n        So my previous assumption is wrong. \n\n        Why? Because the zeros count jumps from 28 to 31 at n=125, so the set for m=28 is [124,124] (only one number). \n\n        Similarly, the set for m=29 and 30 is empty.\n\n        Then the set for m=31 is [125,129] (5 numbers).\n\n        Therefore, the set for a given m can have any number of consecutive integers, from 1 up to 5? Actually, the set for m is the set of n such that:\n\n            zeros(n) = m\n\n        and the zeros count is constant for a block of numbers. The block of numbers for which zeros(n) is constant is determined by the next multiple of 5. However, if the next multiple of 5 is a multiple of a higher power (like 25, 125) then the jump is larger and the block might be broken into multiple m values.\n\n        Actually, the zeros count function is constant between multiples of 5. But the value of zeros(n) is determined by the entire formula. The key is: the zeros count increases by the exponent of 5 in n (when n is a multiple of 5). \n\n        Therefore, the set for m is the set of n from L0 to R0-1, and the length is R0-L0.\n\n        We don't know the length in advance, but note that the zeros count only changes at multiples of 5, so the set for m is a contiguous set of numbers that does not cross a multiple of 5 (unless the multiple of 5 is the next one). \n\n        But wait, the set for m=28 was only [124,124] because the next multiple of 5 (125) causes a jump of 3 (from 28 to 31). So the set for m=28 is just [124,124] (one number). \n\n        Similarly, the set for m=29 and 30 is empty.\n\n        The set for m=31 is [125,129] (5 numbers).\n\n        Therefore, the length of the set for m can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? Actually, no: the zeros count increases by a fixed amount (the exponent) at multiples of 5. The zeros count is constant for n in [a, a+4] (if a is the current multiple of 5) but if the next multiple of 5 is a higher power, then the jump is larger and the set for the previous m values are broken.\n\n        Actually, the set for m is the set of n for which the zeros count equals m, and the zeros count is constant for a block of 5 numbers, unless we are at the boundary of a multiple of a higher power. \n\n        However, note: the zeros count for n is the same as for n-1 if n is not divisible by 5. So the zeros count is constant for n in [k, k+4] for any k that is a multiple of 5? \n\n        But wait: \n            Let k=25, then zeros(25)=6, zeros(26)=6, zeros(27)=6, zeros(28)=6, zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7.\n\n        So the block is 5 numbers. \n\n        Now, let k=125, then zeros(125)=31, zeros(126)=31, zeros(127)=31, zeros(128)=31, zeros(129)=31, zeros(130)=? \n\n            zeros(130)= floor(130/5)+floor(130/25)+floor(130/125)=26+5+1=32.\n\n        So the block for 125 is 5 numbers.\n\n        Then why did the set for m=28 have only one number? \n\n        Because 124 is not the end of a block. The block for zeros count 28 is from the point where zeros(n) becomes 28 until the next multiple of 5 (which is 125). But note: the zeros count increases at 125, and the value jumps from 28 (at 124) to 31 (at 125). \n\n        So the block for zeros count 28 is from the smallest n with zeros(n)=28 (which is 124) to the next multiple of 5 (which is 125) minus one, but note: the zeros count at 124 is 28, and at 125 is 31, so the zeros count is 28 only at n=124.\n\n        Therefore, the set for m is the set of n from L0 to the next multiple of 5 minus one (if the next multiple of 5 is the next jump) but note: the zeros count might jump by more than one.\n\n        Actually, the set for m is the set of n from L0 to the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently determining the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is primarily governed by the number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division yields zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we use binary search to find the smallest integer \\( L0 \\) such that \\( Z(L0) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest integer \\( R0 \\) such that \\( Z(R0) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between \\( L0 \\) and \\( R0-1 \\), inclusive, provided \\( Z(L0) \\) exactly equals \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., \\( Z(L0) > m \\)), the answer is simply 0. Otherwise, the valid \\( n \\) values form a contiguous block from \\( L0 \\) to \\( R0-1 \\), and we output these values in increasing order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeros_count(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n        \n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if zeros_count(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n            \n    L0 = low\n    if zeros_count(L0) != m:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n        \n    low2, high2 = L0, 5 * m * 5\n    while low2 < high2:\n        mid2 = (low2 + high2) // 2\n        if zeros_count(mid2) < m + 1:\n            low2 = mid2 + 1\n        else:\n            high2 = mid2\n            \n    R0 = low2\n    k = R0 - L0\n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n    else:\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = list(range(L0, R0))\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n            \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **zeros_count Function**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for L0**: The first binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (L0) such that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is at least \\( m \\). The search range is set from 0 to \\( 5 \\times m \\) to ensure it covers possible values of \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Validation Check**: After finding L0, we check if \\( Z(L0) \\) exactly equals \\( m \\). If not, there are no valid \\( n \\) values, and we output 0.\n\n4. **Binary Search for R0**: The second binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (R0) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The upper bound is set to \\( 5 \\times m \\times 5 \\) to handle larger values efficiently.\n\n5. **Output Result**: The valid \\( n \\) values are those from L0 to R0-1. If there are any, we print the count followed by the values themselves in increasing order. If no values exist, we print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible time complexity.",
