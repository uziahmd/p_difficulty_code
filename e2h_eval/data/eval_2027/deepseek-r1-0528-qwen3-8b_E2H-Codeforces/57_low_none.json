His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two numbers n and x in the first line.\n Then two lists: one for the first tour (list a) and one for the second tour (list b).\n\n We know that Vasya's total points (from both tours) is at least x. However, we don't know which participant is Vasya, but we know that there are two integers i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n The problem: we have to find the best and worst place Vasya could have got.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to consider all participants. Each participant has two scores: one from the first tour and one from the second tour. But note: the input gives two separate lists of n integers each.\n\n 2. We can form an array `c` of pairs (a_i, b_j) but wait, the problem says the results of the first and second tour are given in arbitrary order. However, note: the two lists are of the same length and each participant has one score in the first list and one in the second? Actually, the problem states: \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\". So we have two arrays of the same length, but they are not necessarily aligned. However, the problem does not specify that the two lists are paired by index. \n\n Important: The problem says: \"The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order.\" This means that the two lists are independent. Therefore, we cannot assume that the i-th element of the first list goes with the i-th element of the second.\n\n 3. But note: the problem says that the two lists are the results for the first and second tour. And there are n participants. So we can reassign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the first tour scores? Actually, the problem does not specify that the two lists are for the same set of participants in the same order. However, the problem says: \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and then \"the participants' points in the second tour\", and the participants are the same. So we can think: we have two multisets of scores, and we are allowed to assign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the participants (i.e., we can form any pairing). However, note: the condition is that there exists at least one pair (one participant i from the first list and one participant j from the second list) such that the sum is at least x. But actually, we are told that Vasya was present and he has two scores (one from the first list and one from the second list) that add up to at least x. However, we don't know which ones. But wait, the problem does not say that the two lists are given as pairs. It says the teacher has the results (two lists). So the entire set of participants is represented by the union of the two lists? Actually, no: there are n participants, so we have n scores for the first tour and n scores for the second tour, but they are independent. However, each participant must be assigned one score from the first tour and one from the second tour.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the participants' points in the first tour\" and \"the participants' points in the second tour\", meaning that the first list is the set of first tour scores (n scores) and the second list is the set of second tour scores (n scores). And we are free to assign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the participants (so we can form any pairing). However, the condition is that there is one particular participant (Vasya) who has a score a_i (from the first list) and a score b_j (from the second list) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n 4. The key: We are allowed to assign the second list arbitrarily to the first list? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the pairing. So we can form any pairing between the two lists? But note: each participant gets one score from the first tour and one from the second tour. Since the two lists are independent, we can assign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the participants (so we can form any pairing). Therefore, the entire set of participants is the multiset of first tour scores and second tour scores, and we can assign the second tour scores arbitrarily to the first.\n\n However, we are also told that there is at least one way to assign the second tour scores to the first such that one particular participant (Vasya) has a total of at least x. But note: the assignment must cover all participants, so we are going to form n pairs (each first score and each second score exactly once). However, the problem does not fix the assignment for the other participants.\n\n How to approach?\n\n We need to compute:\n\n - Best place: the smallest rank Vasya can achieve (if his total is high,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the participants' scores from both tours and efficiently calculating the possible rankings without explicitly considering all permutations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to find the best and worst ranks Vasya can achieve given that his total points from both tours is at least `x`. The key insight is that we can independently sort the scores from both tours and use them to determine the minimum and maximum ranks Vasya could have.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Best Rank (Minimum Rank)**: To minimize Vasya's rank, we maximize his total points by pairing his highest possible score from the first tour with the highest available score from the second tour that sums to at least `x`. This involves sorting both lists of scores and using binary search to find the necessary pairings.\n\n   - **Worst Rank (Maximum Rank)**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we minimize his total points by pairing his lowest possible score from the first tour with the highest score from the second tour that still allows his total to be at least `x`. This involves counting how many participants can score higher than Vasya's minimum total points.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting and Binary Search**: Both the first and second tour scores are sorted to facilitate efficient searching and counting.\n   - **Two Pointers Technique**: Used to count the number of participants who can outperform Vasya in both scenarios (best and worst ranks).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves sorting two lists of size `n`, which takes O(n log n) time. The subsequent steps involve linear scans and binary searches, each operating in O(n) or O(log n) time, leading to an overall complexity of O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    best_place = 1\n    \n    total_vasya = None\n    \n    def find_min_total():\n        left = 0\n        right = n-1\n        min_val = float('inf')\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if a_sorted[mid] + b_sorted[n-1-mid] >= x:\n                min_val = min(min_val, a_sorted[mid] + b_sorted[n-1-mid])\n                right = mid - 1\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1\n        return min_val\n    \n    def find_max_total():\n        left = 0\n        right = n-1\n        max_val = -1\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if a_sorted[mid] + b_sorted[mid] >= x:\n                max_val = max(max_val, a_sorted[mid] + b_sorted[mid])\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        return max_val\n    \n    min_total = find_min_total()\n    max_total = find_max_total()\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        best_place = 1\n    else:\n        best_place = 1\n        \n    def count_better(score):\n        count = 0\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        while i < n and j >= 0:\n            if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] > score:\n                count += j + 1\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                j -= 1\n        return count\n    \n    def count_worse(score):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[i] >= score:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n    \n    worse_place = count_better(x) + 1\n    \n    if max_total >= x:\n        best_place_candidate = count_better(max_total) + 1\n        best_place = min(best_place, best_place_candidate)\n    \n    print(str(best_place) + \" \" + str(worse_place))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total points `x`, and the scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both sets of scores (first and second tours) are sorted to facilitate efficient searching and counting.\n3. **Finding Minimum Total Points**: Using binary search, we find the smallest total points Vasya can have that meets or exceeds `x`.\n4. **Finding Maximum Total Points**: Similarly, we find the largest total points Vasya can have that meets or exceeds `x`.\n5. **Calculating Best Rank**: The best rank is determined by counting how many participants can score higher than Vasya's maximum total points.\n6. **Calculating Worst Rank**: The worst rank is determined by counting how many participants can score higher than Vasya's minimum total points.\n7. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed as two space-separated integers.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible ranks by leveraging sorted lists and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
