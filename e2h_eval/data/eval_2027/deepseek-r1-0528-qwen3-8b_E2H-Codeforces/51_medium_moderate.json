Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is to check two things:\n 1. The combined letters of the first two names (guest and host) should have the same multiset as the letters in the third pile (with no extra letters).\n 2. The total count of each letter in the guest and host must exactly match the count in the pile.\n\n However, note: the problem says that we are to verify that there are no extra letters and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Combine the first two strings (guest and host) into one string.\n - Count the frequency of each letter in the combined string and in the pile string.\n - If the counts for every letter in the combined string are the same as in the pile, then output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n But note: the example input has multiple test cases? Actually, looking at the example input, it's provided as a list of strings, but the problem says the input consists of three lines.\n\n However, the example input format is given as:\n ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n But in the problem statement, it's three lines. So we can read three lines.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Output: YES\n\n How?\n   Guest = \"SANTACLAUS\"\n   Host = \"DEDMOROZ\"\n   Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, let me check: \n     Combined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ -> length is 10 + 8 = 18\n     Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> length is 15? Let me count: \n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 16? \n\n   Actually, the example input is given as a string with newlines, so we split by newline.\n\n   Let me re-read the example: \n        Input: \n          SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Actually, the example input is one string with three lines? Or three separate lines?\n\n   The problem says: \n        The input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So we read three lines.\n\n   The example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But note: the example input is actually three separate lines.\n\n   The example input is:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Then the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n   Now, we can compare the sorted version of the combined string and the sorted version of the pile? But wait, the example says \"YES\".\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a frequency dictionary.\n\n   Let's count the letters for the combined string and the pile.\n\n   Combined: \n        SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n        Count: \n            S: 4, A: 3, N: 1, T: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1, D: 2, E: 2, M: 1, O: 2, R: 1, Z: 1\n\n   Pile: \n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n        Let me break it down: \n            S: 2, A: 2, N: 1, T: 1, M: 1, O: 2, R: 1, Z: 1, D: 2, E: 1, C: 1, L: 1, U: 1\n\n   Wait, that doesn't match.\n\n   Let me recount the example:\n\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z -> \n        D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Combined: \n        S:2+0=2, A:3+0=3, N:1+0=1, T:1+0=1, C:1+0=1, L:1+0=1, U:1+0=1, D:0+2=2, E:0+1=1, M:0+1=1, O:0+2=2, R:0+1=1, Z:0+1=1\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Now, comparing:\n        Combined: S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n        Pile:     S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   They don't match because Combined has A:3 and Pile has A:2.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n   There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   And the example says: \n        In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\n\n   So the pile should contain exactly the letters from the two names.\n\n   Let me check the example pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   How many letters? \n        S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S -> Wait, wait, I think I miscounted.\n\n   Actually, the example input in the problem is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But that is just a representation. The actual input is three lines.\n\n   The example pile is: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let me write it out:\n\n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n   That is 18 letters.\n\n   Now, the combined guest and host: \n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 10 letters\n        Host: DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters\n        Total: 18 letters.\n\n   So the pile must have 18 letters.\n\n   Now, let's count the pile:\n\n        S: appears at the beginning and the end -> 2\n        A: appears at positions 2,5,17 -> 3 times? Wait, the pile string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Breakdown:\n          S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n        A: indices 1,4,15 -> 3 times? But wait, index 15 is the 16th letter? Let's index from 0:\n\n        0: S\n        1: A\n        2: N\n        3: T\n        4: A\n        5: M\n        6: O\n        7: R\n        8: O\n        9: Z\n        10: D\n        11: E\n        12: D\n        13: C\n        14: L\n        15: A\n        16: U\n        17: S\n\n        So A: positions 1,4,15 -> 3 times.\n\n   Then why did I get 2 earlier? Because I thought the pile was \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" and I broke it as:\n\n        S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S -> indeed 3 A's.\n\n   So the pile has:\n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Now the combined has:\n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   This matches.\n\n   So the mistake was in the initial breakdown of the pile.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read the three lines.\n   Step 2: Combine the first two lines (without spaces or newlines) into one string.\n   Step 3: Compare the sorted list of the combined string with the sorted list of the third string.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use collections.Counter.\n\n   Example code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, what if the third string has extra letters? Then the Counter comparison will show that there's an extra letter (because the keys or counts won't match).\n\n   This method works.\n\n   However, note the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile.\"\n\n   We are reading three lines.\n\n   But what if the names have spaces? The problem says: \"all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" So no spaces.\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        We are to output \"NO\"\n\n        Let's compute:\n\n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\"\n        s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count the letters in the combined and s3.\n\n        Combined: \n            P:2, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n        s3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n            J:1, O:2, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:1, E:1, K:2\n\n        They don't match.\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input:\n                BABBONATALE\n                FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Output: \"NO\"\n\n        Combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        s3: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Count combined:\n\n            B:2, A:4, O:1, N:1, T:2, E:2, L:1, F:1, H:1, C:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, M:1, U:1\n\n        s3: \n            B:2, A:3, B:2, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A:3, N:1, O:1, L:2, E:2, F:1, A:3, T:2, H:1, E:2, R:1\n\n        Actually, let me count s3: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        But wait, let's do it by code.\n\n        Alternatively, we can rely on the Counter.\n\n   Since the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, using Counter is efficient.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        def main():\n            s1 = input().strip()\n            s2 = input().strip()\n            s3 = input().strip()\n            if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: what if the pile has extra letters? Then the Counter for s3 would have a key that is not in s1+s2, or the count would be different.\n\n   This method is correct.\n\n   But note: the example input format may include newlines, but we are stripping. The problem says the lines are non-empty and only uppercase letters.\n\n   Let's run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1:\n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", s3 = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Combined: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n        Counter for combined: \n            {'S':2, 'A':3, 'N':1, 'T':1, 'C':1, 'L':1, 'U':1, 'D':2, 'E':1, 'M':1, 'O':2, 'R':1, 'Z':1}\n\n        Counter for s3: \n            {'S':2, 'A':3, 'N':1, 'T':1, 'M':1, 'O':2, 'R':1, 'Z':1, 'D':2, 'E':1, 'C':1, 'L':1, 'U':1}\n\n        They are equal.\n\n   Example 2:\n        s1 = \"PAPAINOEL\", s2 = \"JOULUPUKKI\", s3 = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Counter(s1+s2) = Counter('PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI') \n            P:2, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n        Counter(s3) = Counter('JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI')\n            J:1, O:2, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:1, E:1, L:2 (but wait, we already counted L:2? Actually, the string is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n            Let me count manually for s3: \n                J:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:1, I:1, E:1, K:2\n\n            Actually, the string \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\": \n                J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n            So: \n                J:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n            But wait, the combined string has P:2, A:2, I:2, ... and s3 has P:2, A:2, I:2? But wait, in the combined string we have two P's from \"PAPA\", and in s3 we have two P's? \n\n            However, the combined string has two P's and the pile has two P's? Then why is the example output \"NO\"?\n\n            Let me recount the combined string: \n                s1: \"PAPAINOEL\" -> P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1\n                s2: \"JOULUPUKKI\" -> J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, U:1, K:2, I:1\n\n                Combined: \n                    P:2+1=3, A:2, I:1+1=2, N:1, O:1+1=2, E:1, L:1+1=2, J:1, U:2+1=3, K:2\n\n            Now, the pile: \n                s3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> \n                    J:1, O:2, U:3, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n            Now the combined has P:3, but the pile has P:2 -> so they don't match.\n\n            Therefore, the example 2 is correctly \"NO\".\n\n   Example 3:\n        s1 = \"BABBONATALE\", s2 = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", s3 = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Combined: \n            BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\n        Count the letters in the combined:\n\n            B:2 (from BABBONATALE) and then in FATHERCHRISTMAS there's no B? Actually, \"BABBONATALE\" has two B's, and the rest of the string doesn't have B? \n            Let me break it:\n\n            BABBONATALE -> B:2, A:2, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:1, L:1\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS -> F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A:1, S:1\n\n            So combined:\n                B:2, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:2, E:2, L:1, F:1, H:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1\n\n        Now, the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            B:2 (from BAB), then ... \n            Actually, let me break it down:\n\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            B:2 (from the beginning and then the next B) -> actually, let me count:\n\n            B: appears at least twice (the first two letters are \"BA\", then another B in \"BAB\"? Actually, the string starts with \"BAB\", so that's two B's.\n\n            Then the entire string: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            We can use Counter, but let me do it by hand:\n\n            B: count in the entire string: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER -> \n                B: appears at index0, index1 (if the string is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", then the first three letters are \"BAB\", so two B's at the start, then later we see \"BONATALLE\" -> one more B? \n\n            Actually, the string is: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            Let's list the letters:\n\n            B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R\n\n            So B: at positions 0,2,12 -> 3 times.\n\n            Therefore, the combined has B:2, but the pile has B:3 -> mismatch.\n\n            So the example 3 is \"NO\".\n\n   Therefore, the code using Counter is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the combined string is at most 200, and the third string at most 100? Actually, the problem says each line does not exceed 100, so the third line (pile) is at most 100, but the combined is the sum of two lines (each up to 100) so at most 200.\n\n   But wait, the pile must have the same total number of letters as the combined two names. If the pile has more than 200, then we know it's invalid. However, the problem says the third line has length at most 100, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\n   But wait, the example 1: \n        Guest: 10, Host:8 -> 18, and pile:18 (which is <=100)\n\n   Example 2: \n        Guest:9, Host:10 -> 19, pile:19 (<=100)\n\n   Example 3:\n        Guest:11, Host:14 -> 25, pile:25 (<=100)\n\n   So the pile length must be the same as the combined two names? \n\n   Actually, if the pile has a different length than the combined string, then we can immediately say \"NO\", because the multiset cannot match.\n\n   We can add a quick check:\n\n        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n\n   But the Counter method already checks the counts. However, if the lengths are different, the Counter comparison will fail. But the problem says the third line length is at most 100, and the first two at most 100, so the combined is at most 200. \n\n   However, the pile might be shorter or longer. \n\n   Example: if the pile is shorter, then the Counter for s3 will have less of some letters. Similarly, if longer, then there's an extra letter.\n\n   The Counter method does this.\n\n   But to make it faster, we can check the length first.\n\n   Since the length check is O(n) and the Counter is O(n) too, and n is small (max 200), we can do either.\n\n   However, if the length is not the same, we can avoid building the Counters.\n\n   But note: building the Counter for s1+s2 and s3 is O(n). \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if Counter(s1+s2) == Counter(s3):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But the Counter construction also requires traversing the string. The length check is a simple integer comparison.\n\n   Since the problem constraints are small, we can also just use the Counter without the length check.\n\n   However, the problem says the third line is at most 100, and the first two at most 100, so the combined is at most 200. The Counter construction for two strings of total 200 and one string of 100 is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the example input might have the pile with length not equal to the combined, and that's common.\n\n   We'll go with the Counter method.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the input might have trailing or leading spaces? The problem says: \"all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" and we use strip() to remove any potential newline or spaces.\n\n   But the problem says the input is three lines, so we assume the input is given as three lines.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n   And then the rest.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: There is a possibility that the input has spaces? The problem says \"contain only uppercase Latin letters\", so no spaces. So we can skip strip if we want, but it's safe to use strip to remove any extraneous whitespace (like newline at the end).\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        s1 = input().replace('\\n','')\n        s2 = input().replace('\\n','')\n        s3 = input().replace('\\n','')\n\n   But the problem says the lines are given, so each line is one string.\n\n   I'll use strip.\n\n   Code:\n\n        from collections import Counter\n\n        s1 = input().strip()\n        s2 = input().strip()\n        s3 = input().strip()\n\n        if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   This should work.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: YES\n   Example 2: NO\n   Example 3: NO\n\n   But wait, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   However, in the example, the input is given as a list of strings, but we are reading three lines. So the example input is three separate lines.\n\n   Our code reads three lines, so it will work.\n\n   However, note: the example input is provided as a list of three elements, but the problem says three lines.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Let me run the code with the example inputs.\n\n   Example 1:\n\n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   Example 3:\n\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   All correct.\n\n   But note: the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is just a representation. When we read from stdin, we are reading three lines.\n\n   We assume the input is provided via standard input.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the third line is the pile. So we are comparing the pile to the combined of the first two.\n\n   This is as per the problem.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   But wait, what if the input has lowercase? The problem says uppercase. So we are safe.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name without any extra or missing letters. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking if the multiset (count of each letter) of the combined letters from the guest's and host's names matches exactly with the multiset of letters in the pile. This ensures that all letters are used exactly as needed without any surplus or deficit.\n2. **Intuition**: By comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names (guest + host) with the frequency of each letter in the pile, we can determine if the pile contains exactly the required letters. If the counts match for all letters, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves using a frequency counter (or dictionary) to count occurrences of each letter in the combined names and the pile. The comparison of these counters will reveal if the pile can be rearranged to form the names.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the input strings once to build the frequency counters. Given that each string can be up to 100 characters, the total operations are linear with respect to the sum of the lengths of the input strings, making the solution efficient with O(n) time complexity, where n is the total number of characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    if Counter(s1 + s2) == Counter(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Frequency Comparison**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined string of the guest's and host's names. This count is then compared with the count of letters in the pile.\n3. **Decision Making**: If the counts match exactly, the output is \"YES\", indicating the pile can be rearranged to form the names. Otherwise, the output is \"NO\", meaning there are either extra letters or missing letters in the pile.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of reconstructing the original names from the given pile of letters by leveraging simple frequency counting and comparison.",
