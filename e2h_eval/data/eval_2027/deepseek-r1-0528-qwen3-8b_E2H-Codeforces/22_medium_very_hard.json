After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has n and m, then n lines with m characters (each row is a string of m digits)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines (each line is a string of m digits) and store them as a list of strings.\n\n Approach:\n For each subject (column), we want to know the maximum mark (which is the best mark for that subject). Then, for each student (row), we check if there is at least one subject where his mark is equal to the maximum mark for that subject (and note: there might be multiple students with the same maximum, so all of them are best in that subject).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"successful\" if the student is the best in at least one subject.\n\n Alternative approach:\n For each student, we can check for each subject: is the student's mark in that subject the maximum for that subject? But note: if two students have the same maximum mark, then they are both best in that subject. So we don't necessarily need to assign per subject the set of best students.\n\n We can do:\n\n Let grades be a list of strings, each string is a student's marks.\n\n Step 1: Precompute the maximum mark for each subject (each column).\n\n Step 2: For each student (each row), check for each subject j: \n         if grades[i][j] == max_marks[j], then this student is best in subject j.\n\n But note: what if there are multiple maximums? Then we mark the student as successful if at least one subject j satisfies the condition.\n\n However, note: if a student has the maximum mark in a subject, then he is best (even if another student also has the same maximum). So we don't care about uniqueness.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Let's break down the columns (subjects):\n\n        Subject0: [2, 2, 1] -> max = 2\n        Subject1: [2, 3, 1] -> max = 3\n        Subject2: [3, 2, 2] -> max = 3\n\n   Now check each student:\n\n        Student0: \"223\"\n          subject0: 2 == 2 -> True (so successful)\n          subject1: 2 != 3 -> False\n          subject2: 3 == 3 -> True (so successful) -> but wait, actually we only need one True to be successful.\n\n        However, note: the example output is 2, meaning two successful students.\n\n        Student1: \"232\"\n          subject0: 2 == 2 -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student2: \"112\"\n          subject0: 1 != 2 -> False\n          subject1: 1 != 3 -> False\n          subject2: 2 != 3 -> False -> not successful.\n\n   So we count Student0 and Student1? But wait, the example says: \n        \"the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3\", \n        \"student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2\"\n\n   In the example, the students are numbered from 1 to 3, but our list is 0-indexed.\n\n   In the example, student0 (first row) is student1 (if we consider 1-indexed) and student1 is student2 (if we consider 1-indexed) and student2 is student3.\n\n   Actually, the example says:\n        Student1 (our index0) is best at subjects 1 and 3 -> wait, but in our breakdown:\n            Our subject0 is the first subject, so subject1 in example is our subject0? \n            And subject3 in example is our subject2? \n\n   The example input: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112']\n\n   The example says: \n        student1: best at subjects 1 and 3 -> which corresponds to our subjects0 and subjects2.\n\n   But note: the example input does not specify the subject names, just numbers.\n\n   Our breakdown by columns is correct: \n        Column0: [2,2,1] -> best for subject0 (which is the first subject) are the two students with 2.\n        Column1: [2,3,1] -> best for subject1 is the one with 3.\n        Column2: [3,2,2] -> best for subject2 is the one with 3.\n\n   Now, student0 (first row): \n        subject0: 2 -> best (because 2 is the max for subject0)\n        subject1: 2 -> not best (max is 3)\n        subject2: 3 -> best (max is 3)\n\n   So student0 is best in two subjects. Similarly, student1 (second row):\n        subject0: 2 -> best\n        subject1: 3 -> best\n        subject2: 2 -> not best\n\n   So student1 is best in two subjects. But wait, the example says \"student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3\" (which are our subjects0 and 2) and \"student number 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2\" (which are our subjects0 and 1). \n\n   This matches: \n        Student0 (number 1) is best in subject0 and subject2 (which are the first and third subjects).\n        Student1 (number 2) is best in subject0 and subject1 (which are the first and second subjects).\n\n   However, note: the example input has 3 students, and the output is 2. That means there are two successful students.\n\n   But wait: student0 and student1 are successful because each has at least one subject they are best at? Actually, they are best in two, but that doesn't matter. \n\n   However, wait: the example says student0 is successful because he is best at at least one subject (in fact two). Similarly, student1 is successful. But student2 is not.\n\n   But then why the output is 2? Because there are two successful students.\n\n   However, note: the example says \"student number 1\" and \"student number 2\" are successful, meaning two students.\n\n   So our method: for each student, check if there exists at least one subject j such that grade[i][j] == max_j (where max_j is the maximum in column j).\n\n   We can do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            students.append(s)\n\n        # Precompute the maximum for each subject (each column)\n        max_per_subject = [0] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_vals = [students[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_val = max(col_vals)\n            max_per_subject[j] = int(max_val)   # or we can keep as char? but since comparing, we can use int or char? they are digits so same.\n\n        # But note: the marks are from '1' to '9', so we can compare as characters? Actually, the character '9' is greater than '8'? Yes, because they are in lex order and they are digits.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can convert to integers.\n\n        # Let's do: \n        #   max_per_subject[j] = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))   but we can use the list comprehension above.\n\n        # Then, for each student i, check for any subject j: students[i][j] == max_per_subject[j] (if we use same type)\n\n        # But note: the input is given as characters. We can compare characters because '1'<'2'<...<'9'\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use integers.\n\n        # Let me use integers for clarity.\n\n        # Revised:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Build a list for the maximum mark (as integer) for each subject\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [int(students[i][j]) for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n        # Now, for each student i, we check for any j such that int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j]\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   However, let's test with the first sample:\n\n        Input: \n            n=3, m=3\n            students = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n        max_marks for subject0: max([2,2,1]) -> 2\n        subject1: max([2,3,1]) -> 3\n        subject2: max([3,2,2]) -> 3\n\n        Student0: \"223\" -> \n            subject0: 2==2 -> True -> successful\n        Student1: \"232\" ->\n            subject0: 2==2 -> True -> successful\n        Student2: \"112\" ->\n            subject0: 1!=2, subject1: 1!=3, subject2: 2!=3 -> not successful.\n\n        Count = 2 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a string with the first line being \"3 3\" and then three lines of three digits.\n\n   However, the problem states: \n        The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\n\n   So we are reading correctly.\n\n   Let's test the second sample:\n\n        Input: \n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        We need to compute max_marks for each of the 5 subjects.\n\n        Subject0: [9,1,1] -> 9\n        Subject1: [1,1,1] -> 1\n        Subject2: [7,8,1] -> 8\n        Subject3: [2,2,1] -> 2\n        Subject4: [8,8,1] -> 8\n\n        Now, check each student:\n\n        Student0: \"91728\"\n            subject0: 9==9 -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student1: \"11828\"\n            subject0: 1 !=9 -> skip\n            subject1: 1==1 -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student2: \"11111\"\n            subject0: 1 !=9 -> skip\n            subject1: 1==1 -> True -> successful.\n\n        So we count 3, which matches the sample.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as:\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as two separate examples. The problem says:\n\n        Input:\n            ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n        Output:\n            ['2', '3']\n\n   This is just two separate test cases. However, the problem says:\n\n        The first input line contains two integers n and m...\n\n   So we are reading one test case at a time? Actually, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. Typically, we read until EOF.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as two separate strings. In competitive programming, we usually read until EOF. However, the problem says the input is from standard input.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case per run. But the example input is given as two separate examples. \n\n   However, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two examples. But in a typical competition, we read one test case.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as two separate strings. This is confusing. Actually, the example input is two separate inputs.\n\n   Since the problem says: \"Print the single number\", meaning for one test case.\n\n   How should we handle multiple test cases? The problem does not say. But the constraints say n, m from 1 to 100, and no mention of multiple test cases.\n\n   However, looking at the example input representation: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n   This is just a representation of two test cases. But in the real input, we would get one test case at a time.\n\n   But the problem says: \"The first input line contains two integers n and m\", and then the next n lines. So we assume one test case.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Note that the marks in a rows are not separated by spaces.\" and so on.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we will read one test case.\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as two separate strings. This is just for illustration. In practice, we read from stdin until we have the entire test case.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n   However, let me check the problem statement again: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. It does not say anything about multiple test cases.\n\n   So we write code for one test case.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Print the single number\", so one test case.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n   However, there is an alternative without converting to integers: we can compare the characters.\n\n        max_per_subject[j] = max(students[i][j] for i in range(n))   # but this returns a string, and we can compare the characters.\n\n        Then for student i, for each subject j: if students[i][j] == max_per_subject_chars[j] then successful.\n\n   But note: the marks are digits, so the character comparison is equivalent to integer comparison.\n\n   Example: '1' < '2' < ... < '9'\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        max_marks_chars = []   # list of the maximum character in each column\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [students[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks_chars.append(max(col))\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if students[i][j] == max_marks_chars[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break   # break inner loop, but then we break to move to next student\n\n        print(count)\n\n   However, wait: this counts the same student multiple times if we break inside the inner loop? Actually, we break the inner loop and then move to the next student. But note: we are counting the student as soon as we find one subject where they are best. So we break the inner loop and then count the student.\n\n   But in the above code, we are using a for-loop for j and then breaking the inner loop. Then we increment the count for the student and then move to the next student.\n\n   But wait: the above code uses a nested loop and breaks the inner loop. However, we don't have a flag variable. We can do:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if students[i][j] == max_marks_chars[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Or even:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if any(students[i][j] == max_marks_chars[j] for j in range(m)):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But the problem size is small (n, m <= 100), so any method is acceptable.\n\n   Let's choose the integer version because we are dealing with digits and integer comparison might be clearer.\n\n   However, the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, so they are single-digit integers.\n\n   I'll write the integer version.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            students.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Build max_marks as a list of integers for each subject (column)\n        max_marks = [0] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_vals = [int(students[i][j]) for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks[j] = max(col_vals)\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break   # break the inner loop once we found one best subject for this student\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But wait, we are counting the same student multiple times if we break? Actually, no: we break the inner loop and then move to the next student.\n\n   However, note: we break the inner loop for the current student, and then we go to the next student. So we are counting each student at most once.\n\n   But wait: the above code counts the student if at least one subject is best, and then we break. That's correct.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if any(int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   This is more concise.\n\n   Let me choose the any() version for clarity.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Compute the maximum for each subject (column)\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [int(students[i][j]) for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            if any(int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j] for j in range(m)):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But note: the input might be large? n, m up to 100, so 100*100 = 10000 comparisons, which is acceptable.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        max_marks = [2, 3, 3]\n\n        Student0: [2,2,3] -> [2==2, 2==3 (False), 3==3] -> True (because any is True)\n        Student1: [2,3,2] -> [2==2, 3==3, 2==3] -> True\n        Student2: [1,1,2] -> [1==2, 1==3, 2==3] -> False\n\n        Count = 2.\n\n   Example2:\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        max_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\n        Student0: [9,1,7,2,8] -> \n            9==9 -> True -> so successful.\n        Student1: [1,1,8,2,8] -> \n            1==9? no, 1==1 -> True -> successful.\n        Student2: [1,1,1,1,1] -> \n            1==9? no, 1==1 -> True -> successful.\n\n        Count = 3.\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the example input is provided as a string that includes the newline. We are using input().strip() so that's safe.\n\n   But what if there are spaces? The problem says: \"Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9 (inclusive). Note that the marks in a rows are not separated by spaces.\"\n\n   So we don't have spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n   But wait: what if the input has extra spaces? The problem says the marks are not separated by spaces. So each row is exactly m characters.\n\n   We use .strip() to remove any accidental trailing spaces (like newline) but the input is given as a string of m characters.\n\n   Since the problem says the marks are from 1 to 9, and the input format is clear, we can rely on that.\n\n   However, let me consider an edge case: n=1, m=1.\n\n        Input: \n            1 1\n            5\n\n        max_marks[0] = 5\n        Student0: [5] -> 5==5 -> True -> count=1.\n\n   Another edge: n=1, m=0 -> but m>=1 per constraints.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Let me submit the code.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the input might be given as a string with the first line being \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\" etc. in the example. But we are reading from stdin.\n\n   The code reads from stdin, so we must ensure that the input is provided as described.\n\n   We'll assume the input is as described.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                col.append(int(students[i][j]))\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use list comprehensions for the columns.\n\n   But the above is clear.\n\n   However, we can optimize the column extraction by using:\n\n        col = [int(x) for x in zip(*students)]\n\n   Then, we can do:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Using zip to transpose the matrix\n        # But note: the students are stored as list of strings, and we want to take the j-th character from each string.\n\n        # Actually, we can do: \n        #   transposed = zip(*students)\n        #   max_marks = [max(map(int, col)) for col in transposed]\n\n        Then, we can use the same logic.\n\n   This might be more efficient and concise.\n\n   Let's try:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Transpose the matrix: each element is a tuple of characters for that column.\n        # Then convert each tuple to a list of integers and take max.\n\n        max_marks = [max(map(int, col)) for col in zip(*students)]\n\n        # But wait, the zip(*students) will give us tuples of length n (the number of students) for each column, and there will be m columns.\n\n        # Then, for each student i, we can check: for j in range(m): if int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j] ...\n\n        # Alternatively, we can avoid the inner conversion for each student's mark by storing the integer version of the whole matrix?\n\n        # However, we can do:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Convert the i-th student's string to list of integers? Or we can compare as integers using the j-th column's max.\n            # We can do: for j in range(m): if int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j] ...\n            # But note: we have already computed max_marks for each j.\n\n            # But wait: the above method with zip does not change the fact that we are comparing the student's j-th mark (a char) to max_marks[j] (an integer).\n\n        However, we can also precompute the entire matrix as integers:\n\n        mat = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            row = [int(x) for x in students[i]]\n            mat.append(row)\n\n        Then, max_marks for column j is max(row[j] for row in mat)\n\n        But then we don't need to use zip. But the problem size is small.\n\n   Considering clarity, the zip method is concise.\n\n   Let me rewrite with zip:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If there are leading/trailing spaces, we stripped, but now we want to split by columns.\n\n        # Transpose the list of strings: \n        #   transposed = list(zip(*students))\n        #   Then for each column (tuple of characters), convert to list of integers and take the max.\n\n        max_marks = []\n        for col in zip(*students):\n            col_ints = [int(c) for c in col]\n            max_marks.append(max(col_ints))\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        max_marks = [max(int(c) for c in col) for col in zip(*students)]\n\n   Then:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        max_marks = [max(int(c) for c in col) for col in zip(*students)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if int(students[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   This is more concise.\n\n   But note: we are converting each character to integer twice: once in the list comprehension for max_marks, and then again in the inner loop. \n\n   However, the total number of conversions is:\n\n        For max_marks: m * n (for each column, we iterate over n characters, and each character is converted to int)\n        Then, for the student checks: n * m (each character is converted to int)\n\n        Total: n*m + n*m = 2*n*m, which is acceptable for n, m <= 100 (max 20000 conversions, which is acceptable).\n\n   Alternatively, we could precompute the entire matrix as integers and then compute the max per column and then check:\n\n        mat = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            row = [int(x) for x in students[i]]\n            mat.append(row)\n\n        max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*mat)]\n\n        Then we don't need to convert again.\n\n        Then:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if mat[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   This avoids converting the same character twice.\n\n   Steps for this version:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Convert each student's string into a list of integers\n        mat = []\n        for s in students:\n            row = [int(char) for char in s]\n            mat.append(row)\n\n        # Transpose the matrix to get columns\n        # Then take the max of each column\n        max_marks = []\n        for col_index in range(m):\n            col = [mat[i][col_index] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n        # Or use zip for mat? But note: mat is list of lists, and we can do:\n        #   max_marks = [max(row[col_index] for row in mat) for col_index in range(m)]\n\n        # But then we can do:\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use:\n        #   max_marks = [max(col) for col in zip(*mat)]\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if mat[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   This version converts the entire matrix to integers (n*m conversions) and then does the rest.\n\n   Which one to choose? The first version (with two conversions) is simpler, but the second version (with one conversion) is more efficient in terms of total conversions.\n\n   But the problem size is small, so either is acceptable.\n\n   I'll choose the second version for efficiency and clarity.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Convert each row to a list of integers\n        mat = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            row = []\n            for char in students[i]:\n                row.append(int(char))\n            mat.append(row)\n\n        # Transpose the matrix to get columns and compute max for each column\n        # Alternatively, we can use:\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [mat[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks.append(max(col))\n\n        # Or using zip(*mat) for the columns?\n        # But note: mat is a list of lists, and zip(*mat) will give tuples of the j-th element of each row.\n\n        # Actually, we did the same above.\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if mat[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   But we can also use:\n\n        max_marks = [max(mat[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n   But that is the same.\n\n   Let me stick to the above.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input may be up to 100x100, so building the entire matrix is acceptable.\n\n   We'll go with this.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"Write a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\n   We have met the requirement.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        students = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Create a 2D list of integers\n        mat = [[int(char) for char in s] for s in students]\n\n        # Get the maximum for each column (subject)\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_max = max(mat[i][j] for i in range(n))\n            max_marks.append(col_max)\n\n        # Now, for each student (row) check if there's at least one subject (column) where the student's mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if mat[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   This is clear.\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        n=3, m=3, students = ['223','232','112']\n        mat = [\n            [2,2,3],\n            [2,3,2],\n            [1,1,2]\n        ]\n\n        max_marks = [max([2,2,1]), max([2,3,1]), max([3,2,2])] = [2,3,3]\n\n        Then for i=0: \n            j0: 2==2 -> True -> count becomes 1, break inner loop.\n        i=1:\n            j0: 2==2 -> True -> count becomes 2, break.\n        i=2:\n            j0: 1==2 -> False, j1:1==3->False, j2:2==3->False -> no break.\n\n        Print 2.\n\n   Example2: \n        n=3, m=5, students = ['91728','11828','11111']\n        mat = [\n            [9,1,7,2,8],\n            [1,1,8,2,8],\n            [1,1,1,1,1]\n        ]\n        max_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\n        i0: j0:9==9 -> True -> count=1\n        i1: j0:1!=9 -> j1:1==1 -> True -> count=2\n        i2: j0:1!=9 -> j1:1==1 -> True -> count=3\n\n        Print 3.\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the example input might have different formatting.

We have tested with the provided examples.\n\n   I think this is correct.\n\n   But wait: there's a more efficient way to compute the max_marks? We did:\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_max = max(mat[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n   This is O(m*n) and then we do an O(n*m) for the checking. The total is O(n*m) which is acceptable.\n\n   Let me submit.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Marks\", and the example input was given as a string that we split. We assume the input is correct.\n\n   We'll output the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of each student in all subjects.\n2. **Matrix Conversion**: Convert the input strings into a 2D integer matrix where each row represents a student's marks and each column represents a subject's marks across all students.\n3. **Column-wise Maximum Calculation**: For each subject (column), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student in that subject.\n4. **Success Check**: For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum mark for that subject. If they do, count them as successful.\n5. **Output the Result**: Print the total count of successful students.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    students = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        if s:\n            students.append(s)\n            \n    mat = []\n    for s in students:\n        row = [int(char) for char in s]\n        mat.append(row)\n        \n    max_marks = []\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_max = max(mat[i][j] for i in range(n))\n        max_marks.append(col_max)\n        \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        found = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if mat[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the dimensions (n, m), and subsequent lines contain the students' marks.\n2. **Matrix Construction**: Each student's marks string is converted into a list of integers, forming a 2D matrix where each row corresponds to a student and each column to a subject.\n3. **Maximum Marks Calculation**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by examining all entries in that column across all students.\n4. **Success Determination**: Each student is checked against the maximum marks of each subject. If a student's mark in any subject matches the subject's maximum, they are marked as successful.\n5. **Result Output**: The total number of successful students is printed, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input data, leverages simple loops for matrix operations, and ensures correctness by thoroughly checking each student's performance across all subjects. The complexity is O(n*m), which is optimal given the constraints.",
