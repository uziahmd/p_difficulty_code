There are $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$ distinct$$$^\\dagger$$$ edge-weighted trees with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that each edge is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. Your task is to find the sum of $$$d(1,n)^\\ddagger$$$ of all such trees that are good. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ Two trees are considered to be distinct if either:   there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in one of the trees, and not in the other.  there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in both trees but the weight of the edge between them in one tree is different from the one in the other tree. Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$).

The value of $$$d(1,4)$$$ is:   $$$-2$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees;  $$$-1$$$ for $$$8$$$ trees;  $$$0$$$ for $$$4$$$ trees;  $$$1$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 500000) and we need to compute the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees.\n\n Conditions for a good tree:\n   - Each edge weight is either 1 or -1.\n   - For each vertex i, the product of the edge weights on the edges incident to i (i.e., the edges having i as one endpoint) is -1.\n\n However, note that the condition for each vertex i is stated in terms of the product of the edge weights incident to i being -1.\n\n But note: the problem says \"for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges having i as one endpoint\" is -1.\n\n Observation:\n   In a tree, each edge is incident to two vertices. The condition must hold for every vertex.\n\n Let T be the set of edges. For each vertex i, let S_i be the set of edges incident to i. Then the condition is:\n      ∏_{e ∈ S_i} w_e = -1.\n\n How do we count the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees?\n\n Note: d(1, n) is the sum of weights along the unique path from 1 to n.\n\n Since the total number of distinct trees (without the vertex conditions) is n^(n-2) * 2^(n-1), and we have additional constraints, we must consider the constraints.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can think about the constraints on the edges. The conditions for each vertex i impose a relation on the edges incident to i.\n\n However, note that the entire graph is a tree. There are n-1 edges.\n\n Also, the condition for each vertex i is multiplicative: the product of the edges incident to i is -1.\n\n But note: the entire set of conditions must be consistent. Moreover, if we fix the edges, then the conditions for each vertex must hold.\n\n Let x_e be the weight of edge e (either 1 or -1). Then for each vertex i, we have:\n\n      ∏_{e incident to i} x_e = -1.\n\n We have n equations, but note: the product of the conditions for two adjacent vertices might relate.\n\n Actually, consider the entire product over all vertices:\n\n      ∏_{i=1}^{n} (∏_{e incident to i} x_e) = (-1)^n\n\n But each edge appears exactly twice (once for each endpoint). So:\n\n      ∏_{e} (x_e)^2 = (-1)^n\n\n Now, note that x_e^2 = 1 for any edge (since x_e is either 1 or -1). Therefore, the left side is 1.\n\n So we require 1 = (-1)^n, which implies that n must be even. But wait, the problem states that there are good trees for any n? \n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 2 -> Output: 998244352 (which is -1 mod 998244353)\n\n For n=1: \n   There is one vertex, no edges. Then the condition for the single vertex: product of edges (none) is 1, but we require -1. So no good tree? \n   But the example input includes n=2, and the example output for n=2 is non-zero.\n\n The problem says: \n   \"In the first test case, there is only 1 distinct good tree.\"\n\n So for n=1, the condition fails. Therefore, we must assume n>=2? But the input constraint says n>=1.\n\n According to the example, when n=2, there is one good tree. The tree has one edge (between 1 and 2). Condition for vertex 1: product of edges incident to 1 is w_12 = -1. Similarly for vertex 2: same edge, so condition requires w_12 = -1. So the edge must be -1.\n\n Then d(1,2) = -1.\n\n For n=1: \n   Condition: product of edges incident to 1 must be -1. There are no edges, so the product is 1, not -1. So no good tree.\n\n However, the problem says: \"There are n^(n-2)*2^(n-1) distinct edge-weighted trees\", but note that for n=1: 1^(-1) is undefined? Actually, Cayley's formula says there is 1 tree (the empty graph) for n=1, and then 2^(0)=1, so total 1. But then the condition fails, so the answer for n=1 should be 0.\n\n The sample input does not include 1, but the problem says n>=1.\n\n Therefore, we must handle n=1 separately.\n\n Let's break down the problem:\n\n Step 1: Understand the constraints.\n\n The conditions for each vertex i: the product of the incident edges is -1.\n\n This is a system of n equations. However, note that the product of the equations for all vertices is:\n\n      ∏_{i=1}^{n} (∏_{e incident to i} x_e) = ∏_{e} (x_e)^{degree(e)} \n\n But wait, actually each edge e appears exactly twice (at its two endpoints). So the exponent for x_e in the entire product is 2. Then:\n\n      ∏_{e} (x_e)^2 = (-1)^n.\n\n And since (x_e)^2 = 1 for every edge, we have 1 = (-1)^n.\n\n Therefore, the system has a solution only if (-1)^n = 1, i.e., n is even.\n\n But wait, in the example n=2 (even) works, but what about n=3? \n\n For n=3: \n   We have 3 vertices and 2 edges. Conditions for each vertex:\n\n   Let edges: e1 between 1-2, e2 between 1-3, and say we don't have edge 2-3 (but wait, in a tree with 3 vertices, we must have two edges, so it's a chain: 1-2-3 or 1-3-2).\n\n   Consider a star: 1 connected to 2 and 3. Then:\n     Vertex 1: e1 * e2 = -1.\n     Vertex 2: e1 = -1.\n     Vertex 3: e2 = -1.\n\n   Then from vertex 2 and 3, we get e1=-1, e2=-1. Then for vertex 1: (-1)*(-1)=1, which is not -1. So no solution.\n\n   Alternatively, chain: 1-2-3. Then:\n     Vertex 1: e1 = -1.\n     Vertex 2: e1 * e2 = -1 -> (-1)*e2 = -1 -> e2=1.\n     Vertex 3: e2 = 1, but we require -1. Contradiction.\n\n   So no good tree for n=3.\n\n   Therefore, the system is solvable only when n is even? \n\n   But wait, the problem statement says: \"You are given a positive integer n.\" and then says there are n^(n-2)*2^(n-1) distinct trees without the condition. But then the condition might not be satisfied for odd n.\n\n   However, the example input includes n=4 and n=10 (both even) and also n=1,2,4,10,43434.\n\n   The sample outputs for n=1,2,4,10,43434 are provided.\n\n   For n=1: output is 0 (because no good tree).\n   For n=2: output is 998244352 (which is -1 mod 998244353).\n   For n=4: output is 948359297.\n\n   So the existence of good trees depends on n being even? Actually, the condition we derived is necessary: the system has a solution only if n is even. But is it sufficient?\n\n   Let's check n=4 (even):\n\n   We have 4 vertices and 3 edges.\n\n   Conditions for each vertex: product of incident edges = -1.\n\n   We can use the fact that the product of all vertex conditions is 1 (because each edge squared) and we require (-1)^4=1, so the condition holds.\n\n   However, we must check consistency. \n\n   Another way: the conditions are linear modulo 2 if we take logarithms (but the exponents are multiplicative). Alternatively, we can use linear algebra over GF(2) by taking signs.\n\n   But note: the condition for a vertex is multiplicative. We can assign to each edge e a variable in {1,-1}. Then the condition for vertex i is:\n\n        ∏_{e incident to i} x_e = -1.\n\n   This is equivalent to:\n\n        ∏_{e incident to i} x_e / (-1) = 1\n\n   Or, if we map x_e to a variable in GF(2) by considering the sign, we can take:\n\n        Let y_e = (1 + x_e) / 2 ? Not directly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        For each vertex i, the product of the edges incident to i must be -1.\n\n   This is a system of n equations in n-1 variables (each edge appears in two equations). The system is consistent if the product of the equations (considering the multiplicity) is 1 and the graph is connected (tree). \n\n   However, we already saw that the product of all equations is 1 (because each edge squared) and the right-hand side product is (-1)^n. Therefore, the system is consistent if and only if (-1)^n = 1, i.e., n is even.\n\n   So: if n is odd, there are no good trees. Then the answer is 0.\n\n   If n is even, then there are good trees.\n\n   How many good trees? \n\n   Without the condition, we have n^(n-2) * 2^(n-1) trees.\n\n   With the condition, we have additional constraints. But note: the condition is a multiplicative constraint. The system of equations has n equations and n-1 variables (edges). The system is underdetermined? \n\n   Actually, the system has rank n-1 (if the graph is connected) because the product of the equations gives a dependency (the product of all equations is 1, and the right-hand side is 1). So the solution space is 1-dimensional? \n\n   However, we have n equations and n-1 variables. The system is homogeneous if we rewrite the conditions as:\n\n        ∏_{e incident to i} x_e * (-1) = 1   =>   ∏_{e incident to i} x_e = -1.\n\n   But note: the system is not homogeneous. However, we can take the ratio of equations.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n        Let z_i = ∏_{e incident to i} x_e.\n\n        Then the condition is z_i = -1 for all i.\n\n        Also, note that the product of all z_i is (∏_{e} x_e^2) = 1, and the product of the right-hand sides is (-1)^n = 1 (since n even). \n\n   How to count the solutions?\n\n   Consider: the condition for each vertex is independent in the sense that we can assign arbitrary x_e's as long as they satisfy the multiplicative conditions. \n\n   We can fix the edges arbitrarily and then adjust the last edge to satisfy the conditions? But note: the conditions are not independent. \n\n   Actually, the system is defined on a graph (the tree) and the equations are for the edges. We have n equations and n-1 variables, and the equations are consistent (as we saw) and the solution space is an affine space of dimension 1? \n\n   However, note: the multiplicative group is {1,-1}. The system is:\n\n        x_{e1} * x_{e2} * ... * x_{ek} = -1   for each vertex.\n\n   We can choose the weights arbitrarily for all edges except one, and then the last edge is determined by the conditions. But we must check consistency.\n\n   Example for n=2: one edge. Two conditions: \n        Condition at vertex 1: x1 = -1.\n        Condition at vertex 2: x1 = -1.\n\n   So the system is consistent and we have one solution.\n\n   Example for n=4: three edges. Conditions for four vertices.\n\n   We have three edges (say e1, e2, e3). Conditions:\n\n        v1: e1 * e2 = -1   [if the tree is a star: center v1, edges e1, e2, e3]\n        v2: e1 = -1\n        v3: e2 = -1\n        v4: e3 = -1\n\n   Then from v2: e1=-1; from v3: e2=-1; from v4: e3=-1. Then v1: (-1)*(-1)=1, but we need -1 -> contradiction.\n\n   So the tree structure matters.\n\n   Actually, the conditions depend on the structure. We must consider the entire tree.\n\n   Alternate Insight:\n\n   The condition for a vertex i is: the product of the edges incident to i is -1.\n\n   This condition is equivalent to: the product of the edges along the path from i to the root (if we root the tree) is -1? Not exactly.\n\n   However, note: the condition is local to the vertex.\n\n   We can re-root the tree arbitrarily. But note: the product of the edges incident to a vertex is fixed.\n\n   Another idea: let the entire product of the edge weights (if we traverse the entire tree) doesn't matter. But note the conditions are local.\n\n   Let's define for each edge e, a variable x_e. Then the condition for vertex i is:\n\n        ∏_{e incident to i} x_e = -1.\n\n   We can think of this as a system in the multiplicative group. \n\n   We can fix one edge arbitrarily and then solve for the others. But note: the system is consistent only if n is even.\n\n   How many solutions? \n\n   The system has n equations and n-1 variables. The solution space is a coset of a subgroup of index 2^(n-1) but wait, we are in {1,-1}^{n-1}. The conditions are multiplicative.\n\n   Actually, we can fix the weights of all edges except one, and then the last edge is determined by the conditions. However, the conditions must be consistent.\n\n   Consider: we have n equations and n-1 variables. The system is consistent (as we saw) and the solution space is a coset of a subgroup of size 2 (since the product of all equations is 1 and the right-hand side is 1, so we have one free variable?).\n\n   But wait, in the n=2 case, we had one equation and one variable. Actually, the system is:\n\n        Equation for vertex 1: x1 = -1.\n        Equation for vertex 2: x1 = -1.\n\n   So we have two equations for one variable. But they are the same equation. So the solution space is one solution.\n\n   In general, the system has n equations and n-1 variables, and the equations are dependent. The rank is n-1? \n\n   Actually, the equations are not independent. The product of the equations (over all vertices) is 1 (left side) and 1 (right side, since (-1)^n=1 for even n). \n\n   Moreover, we can show that the system has exactly 2^(n-1) solutions? Actually, no, because the system is multiplicative and the variables are in {1,-1}. \n\n   But note: the system is defined by the tree structure. The system of equations is:\n\n        For each vertex i, the product of the edges incident to i is -1.\n\n   This is equivalent to: the product of the edges incident to i is 1 in the multiplicative group modulo 2 (if we take logarithm base 2) but then we have additive equations modulo 2. However, we are in {1,-1} and the operation is multiplication.\n\n   Alternatively, define a new variable for each edge: let y_e = (1 - x_e)/2, then x_e = 1 - 2*y_e (but then we are in integers). However, we can map to GF(2): let z_e = (1 - x_e)/2 mod something? Not straightforward.\n\n   Instead, take logarithms (base 2) of the absolute value? But we care about the sign.\n\n   Let's map the equation to an additive equation modulo 2:\n\n        Let w_e = 0 if x_e = 1, and w_e = 1 if x_e = -1.\n\n        Then the condition for vertex i: the sum (mod 2) of the w_e for edges e incident to i is 1 (because (-1) corresponds to 1 mod 2, and the product becomes a sum mod 2).\n\n        Why? Because the product of the x_e = (-1)^(number of edges incident to i that are -1) = -1 if the count is odd, and 1 if even. So we want odd.\n\n        So: ∑_{e incident to i} w_e ≡ 1 (mod 2) for each vertex i.\n\n   Now, we have a linear system over GF(2) with n equations and n-1 variables (the edges). \n\n   The system is:\n\n        A * w = b   (mod 2)\n\n        where A is the incidence matrix (each row has ones at the positions of the edges incident to the vertex) and b is the vector of ones (mod 2).\n\n   The question is: how many solutions does this system have?\n\n   Note: the incidence matrix of a connected graph (tree) has rank n-1 (over reals, but here we are over GF(2)). \n\n   However, the system is consistent if the vector b is in the column space of A.\n\n   The condition for consistency is that the sum of the equations (over all vertices) is 0 (mod 2). \n\n        Sum_{i=1}^{n} (A * w)_i = A^T * w (with A^T having two ones per column) but wait, the sum of the rows of A is a vector with degree(i) ones for each row i. Then the sum of the equations is:\n\n        ∑_{i} (∑_{e incident to i} w_e) = ∑_{e} (w_e * (degree of edge e?)) \n\n        But each edge has two endpoints, so each w_e appears twice. Then the sum is 0 (mod 2). And the sum of the right-hand side (which is n ones) is n mod 2. \n\n   Since we require the system to be consistent, we must have n mod 2 = 0 (because the left side is 0). But we already know n is even (from the necessary condition). \n\n   So the system is consistent.\n\n   The solution space then has dimension (number of variables) - rank = (n-1) - (n-1) = 0? \n\n   Wait, the rank of the incidence matrix of a connected graph with n vertices is n-1. So the solution space has dimension (n-1) - (n-1) = 0. \n\n   But wait, then there is exactly one solution? \n\n   However, note: our system is defined for a tree (connected graph). \n\n   But wait, the system has n equations and n-1 variables, and the rank is n-1, so the solution space has dimension (n-1) - (n-1) = 0. \n\n   Therefore, there is exactly one solution for the w_e (and hence for the x_e) in the multiplicative group? \n\n   However, note: the mapping from w_e to x_e is bijective (w_e=0 -> x_e=1, w_e=1 -> x_e=-1). So there is exactly one assignment of the edge weights that satisfies the conditions.\n\n   But wait, that would imply that for a fixed tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights to satisfy the conditions.\n\n   However, note: the system is defined on the edges. The edges are labeled by the pairs of vertices. \n\n   Therefore, for a fixed tree (fixed set of edges), there is exactly one assignment of weights (each edge 1 or -1) such that the condition holds (if n is even).\n\n   But wait, the problem does not fix the tree structure. We are counting over all trees (all possible labeled trees) and then for each tree, we assign weights according to the system (if n is even) and then sum d(1, n) over these trees.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Case 1: n is odd -> 0.\n\n   Case 2: n is even -> \n\n        We have to consider all labeled trees (there are n^(n-2) trees) and for each tree, there is exactly one weight assignment that makes it good.\n\n        Then the problem reduces to: for each labeled tree T (with n even) that is good (i.e., the weight assignment is fixed by the system), compute d(1, n) and then sum them.\n\n        But note: the system of equations for the weights is independent of the tree structure? Actually, no: the system depends on the tree structure (the incidence matrix). \n\n        However, we just argued that for a fixed tree, there is exactly one weight assignment. \n\n        Therefore, the total sum is the sum over all labeled trees T (with n even) of [the unique d(1, n) for T].\n\n        Now, we have to compute:\n\n            Sum_{T} d(1, n)\n\n        where T runs over all labeled trees on n vertices (labeled from 1 to n) and for each T, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the system.\n\n        But note: the system of equations is linear in GF(2) and the solution is unique. However, the value d(1, n) is the product of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n? Actually, no: d(1, n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path.\n\n        But wait, the weights are in {1,-1}. The sum is the algebraic sum (with signs).\n\n        How to compute the sum over all trees?\n\n        We cannot iterate over n^(n-2) trees because n can be up to 500000.\n\n        We need to find a combinatorial way.\n\n        Let F(n) = sum_{T} d(1, n) for all labeled trees T (with n even) with the unique weight assignment.\n\n        But note: the weight assignment is fixed by the system. How does the weight assignment affect d(1, n)?\n\n        In the system, the weight assignment is determined by the requirement that for each vertex i, the product of the incident edges is -1.\n\n        We can express d(1, n) in terms of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\n        However, note: the entire system is linear (in GF(2)) and the solution is unique. But the system is defined by the entire tree. \n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n        We can use linearity in the weight assignments. But note: the weight assignment is fixed for a given tree.\n\n        However, we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n          Part 1: Count the contribution of each edge to the total sum.\n\n        But note: d(1, n) is the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n. So if we can compute for each edge e, the number of trees T such that e is on the path from 1 to n, and then multiply by the weight of e (which is determined by the system) and then sum, then we can get the answer.\n\n        However, the weight of edge e is not independent of the tree. In fact, the weight of edge e is determined by the system of equations, which depends on the entire tree.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot separate the edges independently.\n\n        Another idea:\n\n        We can use generating functions or known results on labeled trees and their properties.\n\n        Known: Kirchhoff's Matrix Tree Theorem, but that counts spanning trees with weights. Here we have fixed weights (determined by the system) and we want the sum of d(1, n) over all trees.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the Prüfer code. \n\n        The set of labeled trees can be represented by a Prüfer sequence of length n-2. \n\n        But note: the condition on the weights is multiplicative and the system is linear. The weight of an edge is determined by the entire tree.\n\n        However, note: the system of equations is linear (in GF(2)), and the solution is unique. We can express the weight of an edge as a linear combination (over GF(2)) of the \"free\" variables? But wait, we fixed all edges. \n\n        Actually, the system has a unique solution, so we can write for each edge e, the weight x_e is determined by the system.\n\n        How? We can set up the system:\n\n            For each vertex i, the product of the edges incident to i is -1.\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n\n            ∏_{e incident to i} x_e = -1.\n\n        We can fix an arbitrary assignment for the edges and then adjust? But the system is consistent and the solution is unique.\n\n        However, we need to compute the sum of d(1, n) for all trees. \n\n        Another insight: the problem is symmetric in the vertices? \n\n        Note: the condition must hold for every vertex. \n\n        But the function d(1, n) is not symmetric. \n\n        However, we can consider that the system of equations is linear in GF(2) and the solution for the entire tree is unique. Then the weight of an edge e is a function f(e, T) that depends on the tree T.\n\n        Then the total sum is:\n\n            Sum_{T} [ d(1, n) for T ]\n\n            = Sum_{T} [ Sum_{e in path(1,n) in T} f(e, T) ]\n\n        This is hard.\n\n        Let me try a different approach: \n\n        Since the system has a unique solution, the weight of an edge e in a tree T is determined by T. \n\n        Now, consider the entire set of labeled trees. We wish to compute:\n\n            Sum_{T} [ d(1, n) ]\n\n        = Sum_{T} [ Sum_{e on the path from 1 to n in T} (weight of e in T) ]\n\n        = Sum_{e} [ Sum_{T such that e is on the path from 1 to n} (weight of e in T) ]\n\n        Now, we can break the sum by edges. But the weight of e in T is not constant; it depends on T.\n\n        However, note: the system of equations for T (which fixes the weights) is defined by the entire tree T. \n\n        How to compute the weight of edge e for a given tree T? \n\n        The system is:\n\n            For each vertex i: the product of edges incident to i is -1.\n\n        This is a global condition.\n\n        But note: the system is linear in GF(2). Specifically, if we define for each edge e, a variable w_e in {0,1} (0 for 1, 1 for -1) then the condition for vertex i is:\n\n            ∑_{e incident to i} w_e ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\n        This is a linear system over GF(2). The solution is unique. \n\n        How to express the weight of edge e? It is determined by the system. \n\n        But note: the system is defined by the entire tree. The condition for each vertex i is an equation that involves the edges incident to i.\n\n        We can solve the system by assigning w_e arbitrarily for n-2 edges and then the remaining two edges (or one edge) are determined? \n\n        Actually, the system has n equations and n-1 variables (edges). The solution is unique. \n\n        However, we cannot easily separate the edge e.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n        Since the system is linear, the weight w_e for edge e is a linear combination (over GF(2)) of the other edges? But note: we have a unique solution, so we can write:\n\n            w_e = g_e(T)   (a function of the tree T)\n\n        Then the total sum is:\n\n            Sum_{T} [ Sum_{e on path(1,n)} g_e(T) ]\n\n        But note: the system is defined by the entire tree, and the weight of an edge e is determined by the entire tree.\n\n        However, we can use the linearity of the system to express the weight of edge e in terms of the other edges, but it is complicated.\n\n        Let me consider a smaller example: n=2.\n\n          Only one tree: two vertices and one edge. The system: \n            Vertex1: w1 = 1\n            Vertex2: w1 = 1\n\n          Solution: w1=1. Then d(1,2) = -1 (since x1=-1).\n\n          Now, n=4.\n\n          We have 4 vertices and 3 edges. Conditions:\n\n            Let the tree be a star: center 1, edges: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n            Then:\n                v1: w1+w2+w3 = 1 (mod2)\n                v2: w1 = 1\n                v3: w2 = 1\n                v4: w3 = 1\n\n            Then v1: 1+1+1 = 3 mod2 = 1, which satisfies.\n\n            So the solution: w1=1, w2=1, w3=1 -> all edges are -1.\n\n            Then d(1,4) = -1 + (-1) + (-1) = -3.\n\n          But wait, there are other trees for n=4. \n\n          Example: chain 1-2-3-4.\n\n            Edges: e1:1-2, e2:2-3, e3:3-4.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n                v1: w1 = 1\n                v2: w1 * w2 = -1 -> w1+w2=1 (mod2)\n                v3: w2 * w3 = -1 -> w2+w3=1 (mod2)\n                v4: w3 = 1\n\n            From v1: w1=1.\n            From v4: w3=1.\n            From v2: 1+w2=1 -> w2=0.\n            From v3: 0+1=1 -> holds.\n\n            So solution: w1=1, w2=0, w3=1 -> edges: e1=-1, e2=1, e3=-1.\n\n            Then d(1,4) = -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1.\n\n          Now, how many trees are there for n=4? 4^(2) = 16 trees? Actually, by Cayley, there are 4^2=16 labeled trees? \n\n          But wait, Cayley's formula says the number of labeled trees on n vertices is n^(n-2), so for n=4, 4^2=16.\n\n          However, we have 16 trees, and for each tree, the system gives a unique weight assignment (if n even). Then the total sum is the sum of d(1,4) for all 16 trees.\n\n          We cannot enumerate all 16 trees.\n\n        We need a better way.\n\n        Insight: \n\n        The weight of an edge e in a tree T is determined by the system. The system is a linear system over GF(2). We can view the entire system as:\n\n            M * w = b   (mod2)\n\n            where M is the incidence matrix (each row for a vertex, each column for an edge, with 1 if the edge is incident to the vertex) and b is the all-one vector.\n\n        The solution w is unique.\n\n        Now, we wish to compute:\n\n            Sum_{T} [ d(1, n) ] = Sum_{T} [ Sum_{e in path(1,n) in T} (-1)^{w_e} ]\n\n        But wait, d(1, n) = sum_{e in path(1,n)} x_e = sum_{e in path(1,n)} (-1)^{w_e}.\n\n        This is difficult.\n\n        Another idea: use the linearity of the system to express the weight of an edge in terms of the other edges. But note the system is defined by the entire tree.\n\n        However, note: the system is a linear system, and the weight of an edge e is a linear combination (over GF(2)) of the other edges? \n\n        Actually, the solution is unique, so we can write:\n\n            w_e = c_e + Sum_{f != e} a_{e,f} * w_f   (mod2)\n\n        But the coefficients a_{e,f} depend on the tree structure. And we are summing over all trees.\n\n        This seems intractable.\n\n        Let's try to use the Prüfer code. \n\n        The number of labeled trees is n^(n-2). The Prüfer code assigns a sequence of n-2 labels to the tree.\n\n        But the condition on the system is global.\n\n        Another known result: \n\n        In a tree, the edge weights are determined by the system. The system is:\n\n            For each vertex i, the product of the incident edges is -1.\n\n        This means that the product of the edge weights around any vertex is -1.\n\n        Now, consider the entire tree. We can root the tree arbitrarily. Then the weight of an edge can be expressed in terms of the parent-child relationship.\n\n        But the conditions are local.\n\n        Let me consider the following: \n\n        Let P be the path from 1 to n. The weight of each edge on P is determined by the system. However, the system involves edges not on P as well.\n\n        But note: the system is defined on the entire tree.\n\n        We can use the following: \n\n        The system of equations is:\n\n            For each vertex i, the product of the edges incident to i is -1.\n\n        This is equivalent to: \n\n            For each vertex i, the product of the edge weights incident to i is -1.\n\n        Now, consider the following: \n\n            Let the entire tree have a designated root (say vertex 1). Then we can define the weight of an edge as follows:\n\n            For an edge incident to vertex 1, we can set one particular edge (say the one connecting 1 to its child) to be -1? But the system requires the product of the incident edges at 1 to be -1.\n\n            However, the system is multiplicative and the tree is not rooted.\n\n        After careful thought, note that the system is defined by the entire tree. The weight of an edge is determined by the parity of the number of vertices (or the structure) that impose a condition.\n\n        However, we can use the following: \n\n        The weight of an edge e is determined by the system. The system has a unique solution, so we can write the weight of edge e as a function of the tree.\n\n        But note: the system is linear, so the weight of edge e is a linear combination (over GF(2)) of the other edges. But wait, the system is:\n\n            M * w = b   (mod2)\n\n        We can solve for w_e by considering the inverse of M (if it exists). But M is the incidence matrix of a tree, which is a connected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges. The incidence matrix over GF(2) has rank n-1 (because the graph is connected) and the system is consistent (n even). \n\n        The solution is unique. \n\n        How to compute the weight of edge e without solving the entire system? \n\n        In linear algebra, we can use Cramer's rule. But the matrix M is the incidence matrix of a tree. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that the system is defined on a tree and the conditions are local. \n\n        We can root the tree at vertex 1 and then express the weight of each edge in terms of the conditions.\n\n        However, I recall that in a tree, the edge weights can be assigned consistently if we fix a root. \n\n        Let me try to assign weights bottom-up. \n\n        We start from the leaves. \n\n        Consider a leaf i. Then the condition for i is: the product of the edges incident to i is -1. But there is only one edge incident to i. So the weight of that edge must be -1.\n\n        Then, for a vertex i that is not a leaf, the condition is: the product of its incident edges is -1.\n\n        But the incident edges include the edge to its parent and the edges to its children.\n\n        However, we have already assigned the weights to the edges from the children (if we process from leaves upward). \n\n        Then the weight of the parent edge can be determined by the condition at this vertex.\n\n        Specifically, let the vertex i has children c1, c2, ..., ck and a parent edge p. Then:\n\n            (p) * (edge_c1) * (edge_c2) * ... * (edge_ck) = -1.\n\n        But the edges to the children are already assigned (if we process children first). Then the weight of the parent edge p is determined as:\n\n            p = ( -1 ) / (edge_c1 * edge_c2 * ... * edge_ck)\n\n        In multiplicative terms, p = -1 * (edge_c1 * edge_c2 * ... * edge_ck)^{-1}\n\n        But since the edge weights",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances from vertex 1 to vertex n over all \"good\" trees.
