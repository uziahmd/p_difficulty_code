She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The cursor starts at `pos` and we need to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r`.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (if there are unclosed tabs in that direction) one tab per second.\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (one operation per second). After closing, the segment [a, b] is updated (the remaining tabs).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to simulate every move but to compute the minimum seconds.\n\n Observation:\n Since we can close entire segments (all tabs to the left or right) in one move, the goal is to leave the tabs [l, r].\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the entire set of tabs is already the desired segment [l, r], then we don't need to do anything -> 0 seconds.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we have to close the tabs that are outside [l, r]. There might be two parts to close: left part (tabs < l) and right part (tabs > r).\n\n However, note that the closing operations can be done from the current cursor position. But we can also move the cursor.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Case 1: The desired segment [l, r] covers the entire initial set? Then 0.\n\n But note: we start with n tabs and we want to leave [l, r]. So if l == 1 and r == n, then no operation is needed.\n\n Case 2: Only one side needs to be closed.\n\n  - If l == 1, then we don't need to close the left side. Similarly, if r == n, then we don't need to close the right side.\n\n Case 3: Both sides need to be closed.\n\n But note: we can choose the order of closing and moving.\n\n However, note the operations:\n\n  Operation types:\n    - Move left: from i to max(i-1, a)   [where a is the current minimum index of unclosed tabs]\n    - Move right: from i to min(i+1, b)   [where b is the current maximum index of unclosed tabs]\n    - Close left: closes all tabs from a to i-1 (then update a to i)\n    - Close right: closes all tabs from i+1 to b (then update b to i)\n\n We need to minimize the time.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since n is at most 100, we can think about breaking the problem into parts:\n\n  We have to close the left part (if any) and the right part (if any). The operations for closing require being at a certain position.\n\n Conditions for closing:\n  - To close the left part, we must be at a position >= l (so that after closing the left part, the new left boundary becomes our current position).\n    Actually, to close the left part (from a to l-1), we must be at least at l (because the closure operation will close from the current a to i-1, and we want to remove everything up to l-1). Therefore, we must be at a tab that is >= l. Similarly, to close the right part (from r+1 to b), we must be at a tab <= r.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we close the left part first. We can interleave moves and closings.\n\n But note: when we close a part, it updates the boundaries. This affects the movement.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\"\n\n Let's consider:\n\n  Let left_side = the tabs with index < l (to be closed)\n  Let right_side = the tabs with index > r (to be closed)\n\n Steps:\n\n  Option 1: Close the left side first, then the right side.\n\n    Steps for left side:\n      - We must move the cursor to the left until we reach l (or beyond, but we cannot go below l because then we would close too much? Actually, note: the closure operation closes from the current a to i-1. We want to close up to l-1. So we must be at a tab i such that i >= l (so that i-1>=l-1, so we cover all tabs from a to l-1). However, we can also close from a tab that is exactly l? Then we close from a to l-1.\n\n      How many moves to get to the left side? We start at `pos`. We must move left until we are at l (at least). But wait: if we are at a tab < l, then we cannot close the left part because the closure operation would close from the current a (which is the smallest unclosed tab) to i-1, and if i < l, then we might not cover the entire left_side (since we haven't closed the left part yet, the current a is 1, so we would close from 1 to i-1, which might not include everything from 1 to l-1 if i-1 < l-1).\n\n    Actually, we must be at a tab >= l to close the left side. Similarly, to close the right side, we must be at a tab <= r.\n\n  So:\n\n    Condition for closing left: we must be at a tab i >= l.\n    Condition for closing right: we must be at a tab i <= r.\n\n  Therefore, we have to get to a position from which we can close the left part (if there is left part) and similarly for the right.\n\n  We can consider:\n\n    If there is no left part (i.e., l == 1) then we don't need to close the left. Similarly, if there is no right part (r == n) then we don't need to close the right.\n\n  Now, what if both exist?\n\n    We have two options:\n\n      Option A: Close left first, then right.\n\n        Steps for Option A:\n          1. Move from `pos` to the left until we are at l (or beyond, but beyond is not necessary because we only need to be at l to close the left). Actually, to close the left, we must be at a tab i >= l. The minimal movement for the left is |pos - l| (if we are going to use the minimal path) but note: we can also overshoot? However, we must end at a tab that is at least l. The minimal steps to get to the left part is |pos - l| (if we move directly to l). Then we close the left (1 second). Then we need to move to the right part to close the right. But after closing the left, the remaining tabs are from l to n (until we close the right). Then we need to move from l to r (if we are at l, then we need |l - r| moves to get to r) and then close the right (1 second). However, note: after closing the left, the boundaries become [l, n]. Then to close the right, we must be at a tab <= r. So we can also close the right from r (then we close from r+1 to n). But we might have moved from l to r. Alternatively, we could have closed the left from a position greater than l (say we moved to l + k) and then we don't have to go all the way to l again? Actually, we can close the left from any position i>=l. The minimal movement to close the left is to get to the left boundary (l) because if we stop earlier (at a tab between pos and l) then we can close the left from there, but then we still have to move to the right part (which is at r). \n\n        Total time for Option A:\n          = |pos - l|  [moving to l] \n            + 1         [closing left]\n            + (l to r? Actually, we are at l, and we need to go to r to close the right. But note: we can close the right from a position anywhere from l to r. The minimal movement from l to a position <= r is |l - r|? Actually, we can close the right from any position in [l, r]. The minimal movement from l to a position where we can close the right is 0 if we are at r (if we are at r, then we can close the right). But if we are at l, then we have to move to r (which is |r-l|). Then close the right (1 second). So total = |pos-l| + 1 + |r-l| + 1.\n\n        However, wait: maybe we don't need to go to l to close the left. We can go to any tab i>=l. So if we are already at a tab >=l, then we don't need to move to l. The minimal movement to get to a tab >=l is the distance from `pos` to the segment [l, n]. Similarly, for the right.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          Let d_left = the distance from `pos` to the interval [l, r] (if we need to get to the left part) but actually we have two separate closures.\n\n        Another option: we can also consider doing some moves in the middle. But note that the closure operations are independent and the boundaries change.\n\n  Actually, let me reframe:\n\n  We have two independent tasks: close the left (if any) and close the right (if any). But they can be interleaved arbitrarily, and the movement can be optimized.\n\n  However, note that once we close the left, we cannot open any tabs again (so the boundaries are fixed). Similarly for the right.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Let left_needed = (l > 1)   [meaning we have to close the left part: tabs 1 to l-1]\n    Let right_needed = (r < n)   [meaning we have to close the right part: tabs r+1 to n]\n\n    If not left_needed and not right_needed: answer = 0.\n\n    Otherwise, we consider:\n\n      Option 1: Close left first, then right.\n\n        Steps:\n          Step 1: Move from `pos` to a tab i (>= l) [minimum moves: the distance from `pos` to the interval [l, n]]\n          Step 2: Close left (1 second)\n          Step 3: Move from i to a tab j (<= r) [the minimal moves from i to j is |i - r|? Actually, we can move as long as there are tabs, but after closing the left the boundaries are [l, n] (for the right part, the entire [r+1, n] is still there). So we need to move from i to a position <= r. The minimal moves is |i - r|? Actually, we can move left or right. Since we are at i (>=l) and we want to get to a position <= r, we can move left until we hit l, but note: we don't necessarily have to go to l. We just need to get to a position <= r. The minimal moves is the distance from i to the interval [1, r] (but note: the current boundaries are [l, n] so we can only move from i to l (if we move left) or from i to r (if we move right). Actually, we are constrained by the boundaries, but since we are at i (>=l) and we want to get to a position <= r, we can move left until we hit l (if we are above r, then we have to move left until we hit r? Actually, if i > r, then we must move left until we are at r (or less). But note: we can close the right from any position <= r. So we must get to a position <= r. The minimal moves from i to a position <= r is (i - r) if i>r, and if i<=r, then 0.\n\n        Then Step 4: Close right (1 second)\n\n        Total for Option 1: \n          moves1 = abs(pos - l)   [if we move to l] OR maybe we don't have to go to l? Actually, we can choose any i>=l. So the minimal moves to get to a tab >=l is: \n            if pos < l: then we need to move l - pos steps to the right.\n            if pos >= l: then we don't need to move (0) to get to a tab >=l (we are already there).\n\n        Then after closing left, we are at i (which we chose, say we went to l). Then we need to move from l to a position <= r. The minimal moves from l to a position <= r is 0 if l<=r (which it is) but if we are at l and l<=r, then we can stay. But wait: if we are at l and l<=r, then we are already at a position <= r (unless l>r, but l<=r). So we don't need to move? Then we close the right from l.\n\n        However, note: the condition for closing the right is that we are at a position <= r. We are at l, and l<=r, so yes.\n\n        But wait: what if we are at a position i (>=l) that is greater than r? Then we must move left until we are at a position <= r. The minimal moves from i to a position <= r is (i - r) if i>r.\n\n        So we can choose the best i (>=l) to minimize the total moves.\n\n        Actually, we are free to choose any i>=l. So we can choose i = max(l, min(n, ...)) but note: we are constrained by the boundaries. However, the minimal total time for Option 1 would be:\n\n          Let i1 = max(l, min(n, pos)) ? Not necessarily.\n\n          Actually, we can break the movement into two parts:\n\n          Part 1: Move from `pos` to a position i (>=l). The cost is |pos - i|, but we can choose i. We want to minimize the overall time.\n\n          Then, from i, we must move to a position j (<=r). The cost is |i - j|. Then we do two closure operations.\n\n          But note: we don't need to necessarily use the same i for both. Actually, we can break the journey: we can move from `pos` to i (>=l) then from i to j (<=r). The total movement is |pos - i| + |i - j|, and we can choose i and j (with i>=l and j<=r). However, we must close the left first, so we must be at i>=l at the time of the first closure, then we move to j (which is <=r) for the second closure.\n\n          But note: after closing the left, the boundaries change (left is closed, so the new a = i (if we closed from i, then the new left boundary is i). Then when we move from i to j, we are constrained by the new boundaries? Actually, the boundaries update after each closure. However, for the purpose of movement, the boundaries are the remaining tabs. After closing the left, the remaining tabs are from i to n (if we closed from i, then the left part is removed and the new left boundary is i). Then the right part remains [i, n]. Then we want to close the right, so we must be at a position <= r (and the right part is from i to n, so we can only move within [i, n]). Then we have to get from i to a position j in [i, r] (if i<=r, then j can be any position from i to r; if i>r, then we cannot get to a position <=r because the boundaries start at i and i>r, so we must have moved to a position <=r before closing the left? Actually, no: we close the left from i (which is >=l) and then the boundaries become [i, n]. Then to close the right, we must be at a position j<=r, but if i>r, then the boundaries [i, n] do not include any tab <=r (because i>r). Then we cannot close the right from that state. Therefore, we must be at a position <=r at the time of closing the right, and also we must have closed the left from a position >=l.\n\n        So the constraint is that the two closures must be done in an order that the intermediate positions are valid.\n\n        Actually, we must close the left from a position i>=l and then the right from a position j<=r, but note that after closing the left, the available tabs are from i to n, so j must be in [i, n] and also j<=r. Therefore, we require i<=r (otherwise, we cannot get to a position j<=r because the left boundary becomes i and i>r, so the entire segment [i, n] is above r). Therefore, if we close the left first, then we must choose i (>=l) such that i<=r. Then the closure of the right can be done from i (if i<=r) without moving.\n\n        Similarly, if we close the right first, then we must choose a j (<=r) such that j>=l (so that after closing the right, the boundaries become [l, j] and then we can close the left from a position >=l, and note that j>=l must hold to be able to close the left? Actually, no: to close the left, we must be at a position >=l. After closing the right, the boundaries become [l, j] (if we closed the right from j, then the new right boundary is j). Then to close the left, we must be at a position >=l, which we are (since j>=l? Actually, j is chosen from [1, r] and we require j>=l? No, we require to close the left from a position >=l, and the boundaries after closing the right are [l, j] (so the left boundary is still l). Then we can move from j to a position >=l (which we are, because j is in [l, r] so j>=l). Then we close the left from j (if j>=l, then we can close the left from j because j is the current position and we close from j to the left, but wait: the closure operation for the left removes from a to j-1. But the current a is l, so we remove from l to j-1. But j>=l, so that's okay.\n\n        Therefore, we have two independent strategies:\n\n          Strategy 1: Close left first (then right)\n            Conditions: We must have l <= r (given) and we must have a position i such that l<=i<=r (so that after closing the left, we can still close the right from i without moving).\n\n            Steps:\n              Move from `pos` to a position i (in [l, r]): the minimal movement is the distance from `pos` to the interval [l, r] (if we are outside [l, r] then we have to move to the nearest endpoint, but if we are inside then 0). Actually, the minimal movement is the minimal distance from `pos` to [l, r]. Then we do two closures (each 1 second).\n\n            Total time: \n              moves_to_i = 0\n              if pos < l: then we need to move (l - pos) to the right.\n              if pos > r: then we need to move (pos - r) to the left.\n              if l <= pos <= r: then 0.\n\n              Then add 2 seconds for the two closures.\n\n          Strategy 2: Close right first (then left)\n            Similarly, we need a position j in [l, r] (because after closing the right, the boundaries become [l, j] and then we must close the left from a position >=l, which we are because j>=l (since j is in [l, r])). Then:\n\n            Steps:\n              Move from `pos` to a position j (in [l, r]): same as above, minimal movement = \n                if pos < l: then (l - pos) to the right.\n                if pos > r: then (pos - r) to the left.\n                else 0.\n\n              Then two closures (each 1 second).\n\n          Strategy 3: Maybe we can do one closure and then the other without moving to the entire [l, r]? \n\n          But note: the above strategies require moving to [l, r] to do both closures. However, is that always necessary?\n\n          Consider: \n            To close the left, we must be at a position >=l. But we don't necessarily have to be in [l, r] to close the left. We can be at a position >=l and <=n (even beyond r) as long as we are at least l. But then, after closing the left, we are at i (>=l) and then we have to close the right. To close the right, we must be at a position <=r. But if i>r, then we cannot get to a position <=r because the left closure has updated the boundaries to [i, n] and i>r, so the available tabs are from i to n, which are all >r. Then we cannot close the right because we are not at a position <=r. Therefore, we must have i<=r.\n\n          Similarly, for closing the right first: we must be at a position <=r, and then to close the left we must be at a position >=l, but if we are at j (<=r) and j<l, then we cannot close the left because the closure operation for the left requires being at a position >=l, and we are at j<l. Therefore, we must have j>=l.\n\n          So the common requirement is that the first closure must be from a position that is in [l, r] (if we are doing two closures). \n\n        However, wait: what if we don't have to do both closures? For example, if only one side exists, then we only do one closure.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n          Case 1: No left and no right: 0.\n          Case 2: Only left (l==1, but r<n): then we just need to close the right. But wait: if l==1, then we don't need to close the left. Then we only need to close the right. How?\n                  We must be at a position <=r (to close the right). So we move from `pos` to a position <=r (minimal movement: if pos>r, then (pos - r) to the left; if pos<r, then we might not need to move? Actually, we can close the right from any position <=r. But note: if we are already at a position <=r, then we can close the right. But what if we are at a position >r? Then we must move left until we are at r (or less). Also, note: if we are at a position <l (but l==1, so we are at 1 or above, but wait: if l==1, then we don't close the left, so we start with the entire set. Then the right part is from r+1 to n. Then we must be at a position <=r. So if `pos`>r, then we move left (pos-r) steps. Then close the right (1 second). Total: (pos - r) + 1.\n\n          But wait: we might have the possibility to close the right from a position that is not necessarily r? Actually, we can close the right from any position <=r. So the minimal movement is the distance from `pos` to the interval [1, r] (but note: we don't need to close the left, so we are free to move anywhere). However, we are constrained by the boundaries. Initially, the boundaries are [1, n]. We can move from `pos` to any tab. The minimal movement to get to a tab <=r is 0 if `pos`<=r, and `pos`-r if `pos`>r.\n\n          Similarly, if only right (r==n) then we need to close the left. Then we must be at a position>=l. Minimal movement: if `pos`<l, then l-pos; else 0. Then 1 second.\n\n        Now, combining:\n\n          Let left_needed = (l > 1)\n          Let right_needed = (r < n)\n\n          If not left_needed and not right_needed: 0.\n\n          Else if left_needed and not right_needed: \n             if pos < l: \n                 move = l - pos\n             else:\n                 move = 0\n             total_seconds = move + 1\n\n          Else if not left_needed and right_needed:\n             if pos > r:\n                 move = pos - r\n             else:\n                 move = 0\n             total_seconds = move + 1\n\n          Else: both needed\n             Option 1: Do two closures, and we must move to [l, r] (at least one point in between). The minimal movement is the minimal distance from `pos` to [l, r]. That is:\n                 if pos < l: then we need to move to l -> distance = l - pos.\n                 if pos > r: then we need to move to r -> distance = pos - r.\n                 if l <= pos <= r: then 0.\n\n             Then we do 2 seconds for the two closures.\n\n             So total_seconds = (minimal_movement) + 2.\n\n          But wait: is that correct for the case when both are needed?\n\n          Example from the problem: \n            Input: \"6 3 2 4\" -> n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n            Here, left_needed: 2>1 -> True; right_needed: 4<6 -> True.\n\n            Our method: \n              pos=3 is between l=2 and r=4 -> minimal_movement=0, then total_seconds=0+2=2.\n\n            But the example output is 5.\n\n          Why?\n\n          The example solution: \n            shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2 (1 second), close all the tabs to the left (1 second), shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3 (0 seconds? because we are at 2, then move to 3: 1 second), then to tab 4 (another 1 second), and then close all the tabs to the right (1 second). Total: 1+1+1+1+1 = 5.\n\n          What's wrong?\n\n          In our analysis for the two closures, we assumed that we can do the two closures from a single point in [l, r] (without moving). But note: the example did two separate movements: first moved to 2 (to close left) then moved to 4 (to close right). And 2 and 4 are both in [l, r]=[2,4].\n\n          However, our calculation for the two closures was: we move to a point in [l, r] (any point) and then do two closures. But note: we don't necessarily have to do both closures from the same point. We can do the first closure from one point and the second closure from another point (within [l, r]).\n\n          But wait: the example moved from 3 to 2 (left) then from 2 to 3 (right) then from 3 to 4 (right) and then closed the right. Why did they move from 2 to 3 to 4? Because after closing the left, the boundaries become [2,6] (initially, then after closing the left from 2, the left part is gone and the new left boundary is 2). Then to close the right, they had to be at a position <=4. They were at 2, then moved to 3 then to 4 (so they moved from 2 to 4, which is 2 steps). Then closed the right.\n\n          So the minimal movement for the two closures is not simply the minimal distance from `pos` to [l, r] (which is 0 in this case because 3 is in [2,4]), because we have to do two distinct closures and we might need to traverse the entire segment.\n\n          Actually, we have two possibilities for two closures:\n\n            Possibility 1: We move to one point in [l, r] (say x) and then do both closures (if x is in [l, r] we can do both). But note: the closure operations do not require that we are at the edge of the segment [l, r]. They only require that we are at a position >=l for the left closure and <=r for the right closure.\n\n            However, the example did not do both closures from the same point. They did the left closure from 2 and the right closure from 4.\n\n          So the minimal time for two closures is:\n\n            We must be at a point >=l at the time of the left closure and at a point <=r at the time of the right closure.\n\n            We can break the journey:\n\n              Option A: Go to the left part first, then the right part.\n\n                Steps:\n                  Move from `pos` to l (if we are going to close the left from l) -> |pos-l|\n                  Close left (1)\n                  Then move from l to r (if we are going to close the right from r) -> |l - r|\n                  Close right (1)\n\n                Total: |pos-l| + |l-r| + 2\n\n              Option B: Go to the right part first, then the left part.\n\n                Steps:\n                  Move from `pos` to r (|pos-r|)\n                  Close right (1)\n                  Then move from r to l (|r-l|)\n                  Close left (1)\n\n                Total: |pos-r| + |r-l| + 2\n\n              Option C: Maybe we can do one closure from one side and then the other without traversing the entire [l, r]? \n\n            But note: the minimal way to cover both conditions (being >=l and <=r) is to be somewhere in [l, r]. However, if we do the two closures from two different points, we have to account for the movement.\n\n          Actually, the example did:\n\n            Option A: \n              Move from 3 to 2: |3-2|=1\n              Close left: 1\n              Then move from 2 to 4: |2-4|=2\n              Close right: 1\n              Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n            Option B:\n              Move from 3 to 4: |3-4|=1\n              Close right: 1\n              Then move from 4 to 2: |4-2|=2\n              Close left: 1\n              Total: 1+1+2+1 = 5.\n\n          So both ways give 5.\n\n          Now, what if we do one closure from an intermediate point?\n\n          Example: \n            Start at 3, we can move to 3 (already in [2,4]), then we can close the left from 3? \n              Condition for left: we are at 3 (>=2) -> yes.\n              Then close left: now the boundaries are [3,6]. Then we must close the right from a position <=4. We are at 3, which is <=4, so we can close the right from 3.\n\n            Steps:\n              No movement (0) then close left (1) then close right (1) -> total 2.\n\n          Why didn't the example use this? \n\n          Because the example did not consider that we can close the left from 3 (without moving) and then close the right from 3 (without moving). \n\n          But wait: the example input was \"6 3 2 4\". After closing the left from 3, the left part (tab 1 and 2) is closed? Actually, no: the closure operation for the left from 3 closes the tabs from a (current minimum) to 2. But initially, the minimum tab is 1. So we close from 1 to 2. Then the remaining tabs are 3,4,5,6. Then we close the right from 3: we close from 4 to 6. So we are left with 3 and 4, which is [3,4] but we wanted [2,4]. \n\n          So we cannot close the left from 3 because that would close the tab 2 (which is part of [2,4])! \n\n          Therefore, we must be careful: the closure operation for the left closes from the current a to i-1. The current a is the smallest unclosed tab. Initially, a=1. When we close the left from 3, we close [1,2]. Then the remaining tabs are 3 to 6. Then we close the right from 3: we close [4,6]. Then we are left with 3 and 4. But we wanted [2,4]. So we accidentally closed tab 2 (which is required) and also we did not keep tab 2. \n\n          Correction: The problem says: \"close all the tabs that don't belong to the segment [l, r]\". So we must not close any tab in [l, r]. Therefore, we must not close tab 2 (which is l). \n\n          Therefore, to close the left part (tabs 1 to 1, because l=2) we must be at a tab i such that i-1>=l-1? Actually, the closure operation for the left removes [a, i-1]. We want to remove only the tabs < l. So we must have i-1 = l-1, meaning i = l. \n\n          Similarly, for the right: we must close [r+1, b] so we must be at a tab i such that i = r+1? Actually, no: the closure operation for the right removes [i+1, b]. We want to remove [r+1, n]. So we must have i+1 = r+1 => i = r.\n\n          Therefore, to close the left part (if any) we must be at l (exactly). Similarly, to close the right part (if any) we must be at r (exactly).\n\n          So the operations are:\n\n            Left closure: must be at l (then we close [a, l-1]; and note that initially a=1, but after some moves the a might change? Actually, the closure operation sets the new left boundary to i (the current tab) so the next a is i. But to remove exactly [a, l-1] we must have a<=l-1 and we must set the new a to l (so we close from the current a to l-1). However, if we are at l, then we close [a, l-1] and then the new a becomes l.\n\n            Similarly, for the right: we must be at r to close [r+1, b].\n\n          Then the problem becomes:\n\n            We must be at l to close the left, and at r to close the right.\n\n          Now, the process:\n\n            We start at `pos`. We can move freely (as long as the boundaries allow, but initially the boundaries are [1, n]).\n\n            Steps for two closures (both needed):\n\n              We have two mandatory points: l and r.\n\n              We can choose the order:\n\n                Option 1: Go to l first, then to r.\n                  Time = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2\n\n                Option 2: Go to r first, then to l.\n                  Time = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2\n\n              Then take the minimum of these two.\n\n          Example \"6 3 2 4\": \n            Option1: |3-2| + |2-4| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n            Option2: |3-4| + |4-2| + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n          Example \"6 3 1 3\": \n            Input: n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3.\n            Here, left_needed = (1>1) -> False, right_needed = (3<6) -> True.\n\n            Then we only need to close the right. But to close the right, we must be at r=3. We are already at 3, so no movement. Then 1 second. Output 1.\n\n          Example \"5 2 1 5\": \n            Input: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5.\n            Then no closure needed (since l==1 and r==5) -> 0.\n\n          Now, let's test the example from the problem: \n            Input: \"6 3 2 4\" -> 5 (correct)\n            Input: \"6 3 1 3\" -> 1 (correct)\n            Input: \"5 2 1 5\" -> 0 (correct)\n\n          But wait, what if we have to do one closure and the starting position is not at the required point?\n\n          Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8.\n\n          Left closure: must be at 3 -> move from 5 to 3: 2 seconds, then close left (1), then move from 3 to 8: 5 seconds, then close right (1) -> total 2+1+5+1 = 9.\n\n          Alternatively, Option2: move from 5 to 8: 3 seconds, close right (1), then move from 8 to 3: 5 seconds, close left (1) -> total 3+1+5+1 = 10.\n\n          So the minimal is 9.\n\n          Now, what if we have",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to leave only the tabs within the segment [l, r] open in her browser. The solution involves analyzing the initial positions and the required segment to decide the optimal sequence of operations (moving the cursor or closing tabs) that minimizes the time taken.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Luba starts with `n` tabs, and the cursor is at position `pos`.\n   - She needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n   - Operations include moving the cursor left or right (one tab per second) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (one second per operation).\n   - The key observation is that to close the left part (tabs < l), the cursor must be exactly at `l`. Similarly, to close the right part (tabs > r), the cursor must be exactly at `r`.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - If the entire segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), no operations are needed.\n   - If only one side needs closing (either left or right), move the cursor to the required position (l for left closure, r for right closure) and perform the closure.\n   - If both sides need closing, consider two scenarios: moving to `l` first and then to `r`, or moving to `r` first and then to `l`. The minimal time is the lesser of the two options plus two seconds for the two closure operations.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Check if no closures are needed (l == 1 and r == n), return 0.\n   - For single-side closures, calculate the movement from `pos` to the required position (l or r) and add one second for the closure.\n   - For double-side closures, calculate the time for both possible paths (l → r or r → l) and choose the minimal one, adding two seconds for the closures.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, making it O(1) in time and space complexity, which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l > 1)\n    right_needed = (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_needed and not right_needed:\n        if pos < l:\n            moves = l - pos\n        else:\n            moves = 0\n        print(moves + 1)\n        return\n        \n    if not left_needed and right_needed:\n        if pos > r:\n            moves = pos - r\n        else:\n            moves = 0\n        print(moves + 1)\n        return\n        \n    option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(l - r) + 2\n    option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the desired segment [l, r] covers all tabs (l == 1 and r == n), output 0 as no operations are needed.\n- **Single-Side Closure**: \n  - For closing only the left side (l > 1), move the cursor from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` is left of `l`) and perform the closure. The time is the movement distance plus one second.\n  - Similarly for closing only the right side (r < n), move the cursor from `pos` to `r` (if `pos` is right of `r`) and perform the closure.\n- **Double-Side Closure**: Calculate the time for two paths (moving to `l` first then `r`, or vice versa). The minimal time between these paths plus two seconds for the closures is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases by leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional logic to minimize the operations required.",
