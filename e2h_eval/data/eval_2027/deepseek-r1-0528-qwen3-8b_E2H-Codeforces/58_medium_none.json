You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to find the minimum number of edges t to add to form an odd cycle, and the number of ways w (without adding loops or parallel edges).\n\n Observing:\n - An odd cycle must have at least 3 edges (triangle) but note: the problem says \"simple cycle of an odd length\" (more than one vertex, so at least 3). However, we can also form odd cycles by having cycles of length 5,7,... but we are interested in the minimal number of edges to add.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the graph already contains an odd-length cycle, then t=0 and w=1? Actually, wait: if there's already an odd cycle, then we don't need to add any edge. But note: the problem is asking for the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length. If the graph already has one, then t=0 and w=1.\n\n However, note: the example input \"3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1\" is a triangle (odd cycle) so output is \"0 1\".\n\n But what if the graph doesn't have an odd cycle?\n\n We consider:\n\n Case 1: The graph is empty (n vertices, m=0). Then we need to form an odd cycle. The smallest odd cycle is a triangle (3 edges). So we would need to add 3 edges. How many ways? We choose 3 vertices from n. The cycle is determined by the set of three vertices (since the cycle is undirected and fixed). But note: we are not allowed to add parallel edges or loops. Also, we are counting sets of edges.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"minimum number of edges that must be added\", so we are looking for the smallest t (which could be 0, 1, 2, ...) such that after adding t edges we have an odd cycle.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n t = 0: if there's already an odd cycle.\n\n t = 1: adding one edge might create an odd cycle? \n   Example: Consider two triangles sharing an edge? Or more simply: \n   Suppose we have a path of even length (so that with one edge we get an odd cycle). \n   Example: A square (even cycle) and then adding a diagonal? Actually, the diagonal would form two triangles (each of odd length). But wait: the square has 4 vertices. Adding an edge between two opposite vertices (a diagonal) gives two triangles. However, we require the entire cycle to be of odd length. The diagonal creates two cycles: one of length 3 (if the square is 1-2-3-4-1 and we add 1-3, then we have cycle 1-2-3-1 which is odd) and also 1-3-4-1 (which is also odd). So with one edge we can create an odd cycle.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the entire graph to have an odd cycle, just that after adding the edges, the graph contains a simple cycle of odd length.\n\n   However, we must consider the minimal t. So we check:\n\n   - t=0: already exists an odd cycle.\n   - t=1: can we create an odd cycle by adding one edge?\n        Conditions for t=1: There must exist two non-adjacent vertices u and v such that the current graph has a path from u to v of even length (so that together with the edge (u,v) we form an odd cycle). Alternatively, the condition is that the two vertices u and v must lie in the same connected component and the distance between them is even (then adding the edge will complete an odd cycle). But note: if we have a bipartite graph, then we can use the property: if we add an edge within one part, then we break the bipartiteness and create an odd cycle.\n\n        Actually, in a bipartite graph, any cycle is even. So if the graph is bipartite, then we can create an odd cycle by adding one edge that connects two vertices in the same part. However, we must check that the two vertices are in the same bipartite set and are not adjacent (because if they are adjacent, then we cannot add the edge again). \n\n        But wait: the graph might not be connected. Then each connected component is bipartite. Then, if there are two vertices in the same bipartite set (from the same connected component) that are not adjacent, then we can add an edge between them to form an odd cycle.\n\n        However, if the graph is disconnected, then we can also consider edges between different components? But note: if we connect two different bipartite components, then we can form an odd cycle? Let me think:\n\n        Suppose we have two bipartite graphs (components). Let the first component have bipartition (A, B) and the second (C, D). Now, if we add an edge between a vertex in A and a vertex in C, then we are connecting two bipartitions. But note: the entire graph becomes a new bipartite graph? Actually, no: the entire graph remains bipartite because we can assign colors appropriately. But wait, we are breaking the bipartiteness by creating an odd cycle only if we connect two vertices of the same color? \n\n        Actually, the key is: the graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycle. So if we connect two vertices from the same connected component (and same bipartite set) then we break the bipartiteness. But if we connect two vertices from different connected components, then we are just merging two bipartite graphs, and the entire graph remains bipartite (unless we connect two vertices that are both in the same set of their own component). \n\n        Actually, when connecting two bipartite components, we can assign the colors arbitrarily. So we can avoid creating an odd cycle by assigning the colors appropriately. Therefore, we cannot create an odd cycle by adding an edge between two different connected components? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n          - In a bipartite graph, we can assign two colors (say 0 and 1) to the vertices such that adjacent vertices have different colors.\n          - When we have two connected bipartite components, we can assign the colors independently. So if we have a vertex u in component1 (color0) and a vertex v in component2, we can assign v to be color0 or color1 arbitrarily. Therefore, we can avoid having an odd cycle by choosing the assignment so that u and v have different colors.\n\n        However, wait: the problem does not require the entire graph to be bipartite. We are only concerned with the existence of an odd cycle. But if we add an edge between two different components, then the graph remains bipartite (with proper coloring) and hence no odd cycle. So we cannot create an odd cycle by adding an edge between two different connected components.\n\n        Therefore, the only way to create an odd cycle by adding one edge is if we connect two vertices in the same connected component that are in the same bipartite set (and not already connected). \n\n        But note: if the graph is not connected, then each connected component is bipartite. Then, we can look for two vertices in the same connected component that are in the same bipartite set and not adjacent.\n\n   - t=2: if we cannot do it with one edge, maybe two edges? \n        Example: Consider two triangles that are not connected. Then we need to add two edges to connect them and form an odd cycle? Actually, no: we can form an odd cycle by connecting two existing even cycles? \n\n        Actually, the minimal odd cycle is 3. So if we have two disjoint edges (i.e., two edges that don't share a vertex) and we add two edges to form a triangle? That doesn't fit.\n\n        Alternatively, consider a graph that is a chain of 3 vertices (a path of two edges). Then we need to add two edges to form a triangle? Actually, we can form a triangle by adding two edges: connect the two ends? Then we have a triangle. But wait, the two edges we add would be from one end to the middle and the other end to the middle? Actually, we can also consider: \n\n        Another idea: if we have two even cycles (each of length >=4) and we connect them with two edges? Actually, let me think:\n\n        We can also consider a graph that is two even cycles (say two squares) and then we add two edges to form a cycle of length 5? \n\n        Actually, the minimal t is the smallest number of edges we can add to form an odd cycle.\n\n        Known fact: the minimal odd cycle is of length 3. So the minimal t is 3 minus the number of edges we are missing from a triangle? But note, we are not constrained to a single triangle.\n\n        Actually, we can break down:\n\n        Option 1: The graph already has an odd cycle -> t=0.\n\n        Option 2: The graph is bipartite. Then we can try to break the bipartiteness by adding one edge (if there exists two non-adjacent vertices in the same bipartite set) -> t=1.\n\n        Option 3: If the graph is not bipartite (so there is an odd cycle) then t=0.\n\n        But wait, if the graph is not bipartite, then there's an odd cycle, so t=0.\n\n        So the answer is:\n\n          t=0: if the graph is not bipartite (has an odd cycle).\n          Otherwise (the graph is bipartite):\n\n            Check for t=1: \n                For each connected component, consider the two parts (let the component have bipartite sets X and Y). Then, the number of missing edges within X and within Y (that are not present) is the candidate for t=1.\n\n                However, note: if we add an edge in the same set, then we break the bipartiteness and create an odd cycle.\n\n                But note: we are allowed to add only one edge. Then we only need one such edge to be added to form an odd cycle.\n\n                However, we must check: if there exists at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices in the same bipartite set (in the same component) then t=1 and the number of ways w is the total number of such pairs (non-edges in the same set) over all components.\n\n            If no such edge exists (i.e., in every connected component, all the possible edges within a set are already present) then we cannot break the bipartiteness with one edge. Then we must consider t=2.\n\n            But wait: if we cannot break with one edge, then we must form a triangle (or a larger odd cycle) by adding two edges? \n\n            Example: Consider two disjoint edges (two edges that are not connected). Then the graph is bipartite (each edge is a connected component with two vertices, and the bipartite sets are {v1} and {v2} for each edge). Now, if we add two edges: one edge connecting two vertices from the same set (but from different components) and then another edge? Actually, we cannot form an odd cycle by adding two edges in this way.\n\n            Alternatively, consider a graph that is a path of 3 vertices (which is bipartite). Then we have 3 vertices and 2 edges. The bipartite sets: {v1, v3} and {v2}. Then the missing edges: we can add an edge between v1 and v3 (same set) to form a triangle (t=1). But if we didn't have that possibility? \n\n            Now, consider a graph that is two disjoint edges (so two connected components, each an edge). Then the bipartite sets for each are (say) {a1, b1} and {a2, b2}. Then the same set for the first component is {a1} and {b1}? Actually, no: in a two-node graph, the bipartite sets are two singletons. Then we can add edges within the same set? But the same set in the first component is {a1} (only one node) so no edge to add. Similarly for the second. So we cannot break with one edge. Then we must consider two edges.\n\n            How to break with two edges?\n\n            Idea: We can form a triangle by adding two edges? Actually, no: a triangle requires three edges. But note: we are allowed to form any odd cycle (any odd length). The next smallest odd cycle is 5, which requires 5 edges. But we are only adding two edges. \n\n            Alternatively, we can form an odd cycle by combining two even cycles? \n\n            Actually, note: the minimal odd cycle is 3. So if we have a graph that is bipartite, then we can form an odd cycle by creating a triangle (if we have three vertices that are not forming a triangle) but then we need to add three edges. \n\n            But wait: we can also form a cycle of length 5 by adding two edges? \n\n            Example: Consider a pentagon without one edge (so a path of 5 vertices). But wait, that graph is bipartite? Actually, a pentagon is an odd cycle, but without one edge it is a path (which is bipartite). \n\n            Let me take a different example: two triangles that are connected by two edges. Actually, we are in a bipartite graph, so no triangles.\n\n            Another example: a 4-cycle (bipartite) and we add two edges to form a 5-cycle? \n\n            Example graph: 4 vertices (a square) and we add two edges. How? \n                Square: 1-2-3-4-1. This is bipartite. Now, if we add edges 1-3 and 2-4, then we get two triangles and the square becomes two triangles. But wait, we are adding two edges and we get an odd cycle (the triangles). However, note: the problem is to form an odd cycle. We are allowed to form multiple cycles. \n\n            But actually, if we add two edges to a square (connecting two diagonals) then we get two triangles and the entire graph becomes non-bipartite. However, the minimal t might be 2.\n\n            However, note: we might form an odd cycle by adding two edges without necessarily having a square. \n\n            Actually, the minimal t is the minimal number of edges to add so that the graph becomes non-bipartite. \n\n            There's a known fact: the minimal number of edges to add to make a graph non-bipartite is either 0 (if already non-bipartite) or 1 (if the graph is bipartite but has a connected component that is not complete bipartite) or ...?\n\n            Actually, the problem is: we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (without creating multiple edges or loops) and we want the minimal t such that the graph has an odd cycle.\n\n            In graph theory, a graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycle. Therefore, the minimal t is the minimal number of edges to add to destroy the bipartiteness.\n\n            And destroying the bipartiteness can be done by:\n\n              - Adding one edge within a part (if there exists any missing edge in the same part) -> then we have an odd cycle (of length 3, actually, because the two endpoints of the edge are connected by a path of even length and the edge makes an odd cycle).\n\n            But if there is no missing edge within the same part in any connected component, then we must add at least two edges.\n\n            Why two? Because if we try to add two edges, then we can form a triangle (if we have three vertices, then we are missing three edges, but we are only adding two). Alternatively, we can form a 5-cycle? Actually, we can also form a triangle by connecting three vertices that are currently not connected. \n\n            However, note: we are not limited to the same connected component. \n\n            Consider: if the graph is bipartite and we have two connected components, then we can connect two vertices from the same set in one component and two vertices from the same set in another component? But wait, if we add two edges: one in the first component (same set) and one in the second component (same set), then we break the bipartiteness of both components. However, then the graph is still bipartite? Actually, no: if we break the bipartiteness in one component, then the entire graph is not bipartite. But wait, if we break the bipartiteness in one component, then that component is no longer bipartite, so the whole graph is not bipartite. \n\n            Actually, we only need to break the bipartiteness of one component. So if we can break the bipartiteness by adding one edge in one component, then we use t=1. But if we cannot break in any component with one edge, then we must break in one component by adding two edges? \n\n            However, note: we can also break the bipartiteness by connecting two different components? \n\n            Let me reexamine: \n\n            In a bipartite graph, we can assign two colors (say 0 and 1) to each vertex. Then, if we add an edge between two vertices of the same color (from the same component) then we break the bipartiteness.\n\n            But if we add an edge between two vertices from different components: then we can recolor the second component so that the two endpoints of the edge have different colors. Then the entire graph remains bipartite. \n\n            So adding edges between different components does not break the bipartiteness. \n\n            Therefore, the only way to break bipartiteness is to add an edge within the same connected component that connects two vertices of the same color (same bipartite set).\n\n            Now, if there is no such edge (i.e., in each connected component, the bipartite set is complete: all the edges between the two sets are present, and no edge within the same set is missing) then we cannot break with one edge.\n\n            Then we consider two edges: \n\n            How can we break bipartiteness with two edges? \n\n            We can break bipartiteness by creating an odd cycle. We can do this by:\n\n            Option A: In the same connected component: \n                We can add two edges that together form an odd cycle. \n\n                Example: Consider a connected bipartite graph. We can pick three vertices u, v, w. We need to form a triangle (odd cycle of length 3) but that requires three edges. Alternatively, we can form a cycle of length 5: we pick five vertices and form a 5-cycle. But that requires 5 edges.\n\n            Actually, the minimal odd cycle is 3. So we need to form a triangle. To form a triangle, we need to have three edges. But we are adding two edges. \n\n            However, if the graph is missing three edges of a triangle, then adding two of them is not enough.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break bipartiteness by adding two edges that connect two vertices in the same set (but in the same component) but wait, two edges alone cannot form an odd cycle. \n\n            Actually, consider: we can break bipartiteness by adding two edges that together with existing edges form an odd cycle. \n\n            Example: Consider a path of three vertices: [a-b-c] (which is a path of two edges). This is bipartite. The bipartite sets: {a, c} and {b}. Now, if we add edges (a,c) and (a,b) then we have a triangle: a-b-c-a. But note: we are adding two edges: (a,c) and (a,b). However, we can also form an odd cycle by adding two edges: (a,c) and (b,c) (then the cycle is a-b-c-a). \n\n            But wait, in the original graph, the edge (a,b) and (b,c) are already present. So we are only adding (a,c) and (b,c) to form the triangle? Actually, no: the cycle is a-b-c-a, which uses the existing edges (a,b) and (b,c) and the added edge (a,c). But note: we are only adding two edges. \n\n            However, we must check: are the two edges we are adding independent? In this example, we are adding two edges: (a,c) and (b,c). But note: the edge (a,c) is missing, and (b,c) is already present? Actually, the graph is [a-b-c] so (b,c) is present. Then we only need to add (a,c). \n\n            Wait, so if we have a path of three, then we can break bipartiteness by adding one edge (a,c). Then why did we consider two edges? \n\n            The key is: if the graph is bipartite and we have a connected component that is not complete bipartite, then we can break with one edge. \n\n            In the example above, the bipartite sets are {a,c} and {b}. The edge (a,c) is missing (because it is in the same set) and we can add it. So t=1.\n\n            Now, what if the graph is such that in every connected component, the bipartite sets are complete? \n\n            Example: two disjoint edges (each edge is a connected component). Each component: two vertices, say (a,b) and (c,d). The bipartite sets for the first component: {a} and {b}; for the second: {c} and {d}. Then, the same set in each component is a singleton, so no edge to add within the same set. \n\n            Then we must break bipartiteness by adding two edges. How?\n\n            We can break the bipartiteness of one component by adding two edges? But note: each component is just two vertices. We cannot add an edge within the same set (because the set has only one vertex) and adding an edge between the two sets is allowed (but that doesn't break bipartiteness). \n\n            Alternatively, we can break the bipartiteness by connecting two different components? \n\n            Actually, we can break bipartiteness by connecting two components with two edges. \n\n            Example: Consider two edges (a-b) and (c-d). Then we add edges (a-c) and (b-d). Then the graph has a cycle: a-b-d-c-a. The cycle length is 4 (even). \n\n            Alternatively, add edges (a-c) and (b-c): \n                Then the graph has edges: a-b, c-d, a-c, b-c. Then we have a cycle: a-b-c-a (length 3, odd). \n\n            But wait, we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (as long as no loops or parallel edges). \n\n            In the two disjoint edges example, we can break bipartiteness by adding two edges that form a triangle. Specifically, we can pick one vertex from the first edge and two from the second edge? \n\n            Actually, we have four vertices: a, b, c, d (with edges a-b and c-d). We want to form a triangle. We need three edges. But we are only adding two edges. \n\n            Alternatively, we can form an odd cycle of length 5? \n\n            We have four vertices. To form a cycle of length 5 we need five edges. \n\n            What is the minimal odd cycle we can form with two edges? \n\n            We must use the existing edges. The existing edges are two. Then we add two edges. Then we have a graph with 4 edges. \n\n            The smallest odd cycle we can form must be of length 3 or 5. \n\n            How about: \n                Start with two disjoint edges: a-b, c-d.\n                Add edges: a-c and b-d. Then the graph is a cycle of length 4 (even) and two edges (a-c, b-d) form a matching. Then no odd cycle.\n\n            Add edges: a-c and b-c. Then we have edges: a-b, c-d, a-c, b-c. Then the cycle: a-b-c-a (odd). \n\n            So we broke the bipartiteness by adding two edges. \n\n            Therefore, the minimal t is 2 in this case.\n\n            How many ways? \n\n            We need to choose two edges that together form an odd cycle. \n\n            Conditions for two edges to break bipartiteness: \n\n            We must form an odd cycle. The odd cycle must be formed by the two added edges and some existing edges.\n\n            Note: The two edges must be incident to at least one common vertex? \n\n            Actually, to form a triangle (a 3-cycle) we need three edges. But wait, we are only adding two. Then the third edge must already exist. \n\n            Example: We have two disjoint edges (a-b) and (c-d). Then we add two edges: (a-c) and (b-c). Then the triangle is a-b-c-a, but the edge a-b exists, and we added a-c and b-c. \n\n            Alternatively, we can form a triangle by adding two edges and using one existing edge. \n\n            In general, to form a triangle, we need three edges. We are adding two of them, so the third must be present. \n\n            Therefore, to break bipartiteness with two edges, we must have a triangle missing exactly two edges (and one edge is already present). \n\n            But note: the graph is bipartite initially. So in a triangle, the edges must be added because the graph was bipartite and the three edges were not all present.\n\n            Actually, we can break bipartiteness by forming a triangle if we have three vertices and two of the edges are present and we add the third. But wait, if two edges of a triangle are present, then the three vertices form a connected component (if the two edges share a common vertex) and then the third edge is the one missing. Then we break bipartiteness by adding that edge. But that is one edge.\n\n            However, we are considering two edges. \n\n            Alternatively, we can break bipartiteness by forming a cycle of length 5 (which is odd) by adding two edges. \n\n            Example: We have a path of four vertices: a-b-c-d (this is bipartite). Then we add two edges: a-c and b-d. Then we have a cycle: a-b-d-c-a. The cycle length is 4 (even). \n\n            Or: we add edges a-d and b-c. Then we have a cycle: a-b-c-d-a, which is even. \n\n            How about: we add edges a-c and b-d? Same as above.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break bipartiteness by forming a 5-cycle? \n\n            Example: We have a bipartite graph that is a chain of 5 vertices: a-b-c-d-e (so edges: a-b, b-c, c-d, d-e). Then we can add two edges: a-c and d-b? \n\n            Actually, we need to form a cycle of length 5: a-b-c-d-e-a. But we don't have e-a. Alternatively, we can form a cycle: a-b-c-a? But that requires edge a-c and then we have a triangle. But wait, we are adding two edges: a-c and then what? \n\n            Alternatively, we can form a cycle of length 5 by adding two edges: \n                Original: a-b-c-d-e (edges: a-b, b-c, c-d, d-e)\n                Add edges: a-d and b-e. Then we have a cycle: a-b-e-d-a? The cycle: a-b-e-d-a: \n                    a->b->e->d->a: edges: a-b (present), b-e (added), e-d (present? no, we have d-e, so we can traverse e-d backwards? Actually, we have d-e, so the edge is undirected. Then the cycle is a-b-e-d-a, and the edges are a-b, b-e, e-d, d-a. But we haven't added d-a. \n\n            Actually, we added a-d and b-e. Then the cycle is a-b-e-d-a: \n                a-b (present), b-e (added), e-d (present, because we have d-e) and d-a (added). \n\n            Then the cycle has length 4: a-b-e-d-a. \n\n            How to form a 5-cycle? \n\n            Example: \n                Original: a-b-c-d-e (edges: a-b, b-c, c-d, d-e)\n                Add edges: a-c and d-b. Then we have cycle: a-c-d-b-a? \n                    a-c (added), c-d (present), d-b (added), b-a (present). \n                    Cycle: a-c-d-b-a, which is of length 4.\n\n            Actually, to form a 5-cycle we need to add two edges that complete a 5-cycle. \n\n            But note: the minimal odd cycle is 3, and we are trying to break bipartiteness by adding two edges. \n\n            However, note: we can break bipartiteness by adding two edges that together with existing edges form a triangle (if two edges of the triangle are already present). \n\n            So the condition for t=2 is: \n\n            There exists a set of three vertices (a, b, c) such that two of the three edges (a-b, a-c, b-c) are present and the third is missing. Then we can break bipartiteness by adding the missing edge. But wait, that is t=1. \n\n            Alternatively, if we don't have a triangle missing one edge, then we can break by forming a 5-cycle? \n\n            Actually, the problem states: the minimum number of edges to add. So we are looking for the smallest t.\n\n            We have:\n\n            t=0: if the graph is not bipartite.\n\n            t=1: if the graph is bipartite and there exists at least one missing edge (non-edge) in the same bipartite set of a connected component.\n\n            t=2: if the graph is bipartite and there is no missing edge in the same bipartite set, but there exists a triangle (three vertices) for which two edges are present and the third is missing (so we can break with one edge) -> but wait, if two edges are present then the same bipartite set condition would have been satisfied: because the two edges would force the third edge to be missing? Actually, no: if two edges of a triangle are present, then the three vertices are connected and the graph is bipartite? \n\n            Let me check: a triangle is an odd cycle, so if two edges are present, then the graph is not a triangle, but it is a path of two edges. Then the graph is bipartite. \n\n            Actually, if we have two edges of a triangle (say a-b and b-c) then the three vertices form a path (a-b-c) which is bipartite. Then the third edge (a-c) is missing and we can break with one edge (t=1). \n\n            Therefore, the condition for t=1 is: there exists a pair of vertices (u, v) in the same bipartite set (same component) that are not adjacent. \n\n            Then, how can we break with two edges if there is no t=1? \n\n            Example: two disjoint edges (a-b, c-d). Then, we cannot break with one edge because there is no missing edge within the same set (each set in each component is a singleton). \n\n            Then, we must break by adding two edges that together form an odd cycle. \n\n            How? \n\n            We need to form an odd cycle. The smallest odd cycle is 3, but we can only add two edges. \n\n            We must use existing edges. \n\n            We have two edges: a-b and c-d.\n\n            We can form a 3-cycle if we add two edges that connect these two edges. \n\n            Example: add edges a-c and b-d. Then we have a cycle: a-b-d-c-a? \n                a-b (present), b-d (added), d-c (present? no, we have c-d, so yes), c-a (added). \n                Then the cycle is a-b-d-c-a, which is of length 4.\n\n            Alternatively, add edges a-c and b-c. Then we have a cycle: a-b-c-a (using edges a-b, b-c (added), and c-a (added)) -> wait, that forms a triangle? But we only added two edges: a-c and b-c. Then the triangle is a-b-c-a, but the edge a-b is present, and we added a-c and b-c. \n\n            But wait: the cycle a-b-c-a is of length 3 (odd). \n\n            However, note: the edge a-c and b-c are added, and the edge a-b is present. Then we have a triangle. \n\n            But in the initial graph, the two edges are disjoint. Then the three vertices a, b, c: \n                a is connected to b (by the existing edge) and we add a-c and b-c. \n\n            But note: the graph now has three vertices (a, b, c) and the fourth vertex d. \n\n            However, the problem does not require the entire graph to be connected. \n\n            The condition: we are allowed to form a cycle of odd length (simple). The triangle (a, b, c) is an odd cycle. \n\n            Therefore, we broke the bipartiteness by adding two edges.\n\n            But note: the two edges we added (a-c and b-c) are both incident to c. \n\n            How many ways? \n\n            We need to count the number of ways to add two edges such that they form an odd cycle. \n\n            Conditions for two edges to form an odd cycle:\n\n            There must be a set of three vertices (x, y, z) such that:\n\n              - The edge x-y is present (so that the cycle x-y-z-x is odd, and we add edges x-z and y-z).\n\n            But wait, we are allowed to use any existing edges. \n\n            Actually, we can break bipartiteness by forming an odd cycle of length greater than 3? \n\n            However, the minimal t is 2, so we are looking for the minimal number of edges to add. \n\n            So the condition for t=2 is: \n\n            The graph is bipartite, and there is no missing edge within the same bipartite set (so we cannot break with one edge). Then, we break by adding two edges that form a triangle (using one existing edge and two added ones) OR by adding two edges that form a 5-cycle? \n\n            But note: we are looking for the minimal t. So we must consider the minimal number of edges. \n\n            Actually, the minimal t is the minimal number of edges to add to make the graph non-bipartite. \n\n            Known: the minimal number of edges to add to a bipartite graph to destroy its bipartiteness is 1 if there exists a missing edge in the same set, otherwise 2.\n\n            However, is that always true? \n\n            Proof sketch: \n\n            In a bipartite graph, the graph is 2-colorable. \n\n            - If we can find two vertices in the same color class that are not adjacent, then adding the edge between them will create an odd cycle (of length 3). \n\n            - Otherwise, for every connected component, the bipartite set is complete (meaning: every pair of vertices in the same set is adjacent). Then, we cannot break with one edge. \n\n            Now, to break the bipartiteness, we must create an odd cycle. We can do that by:\n\n            Option 1: In the same connected component, we can pick three vertices that are not all connected by edges? Actually, the component is complete bipartite (every edge between the two sets is present) and no edge within the set. Then, we can form a triangle by adding two edges? \n\n            Example: a complete bipartite graph K_{m,n}. Then, we pick two vertices from the same set (say set A) and one from set B. Then, the two vertices in A are not adjacent (because the graph is bipartite). Then, we can break by adding one edge between the two in A. But wait, we said that there is no missing edge in the same set? \n\n            Actually, the condition for t=1 is: there exists a pair of non-adjacent vertices in the same set. \n\n            In a complete bipartite graph, there are no missing edges between the two sets, but the edges within the same set are absent. So if the same set has more than one vertex, then there are missing edges. \n\n            But wait, we said \"otherwise\" meaning: there is no missing edge in the same set. Then, the same set must be a clique? Actually, no: the same set in bipartite graph cannot have edges. \n\n            Correction: \n\n            In a bipartite graph, the bipartite sets are independent sets. So by definition, there are no edges within the same set. Therefore, if the graph is bipartite, then by definition, there are no edges within the same set. \n\n            But wait: we said \"if there is no missing edge in the same set\" meaning that the same set is complete? But complete on an independent set? \n\n            Actually, the condition for t=1 is: the graph is bipartite and there exists two vertices in the same set that are not adjacent. But since the graph is bipartite, there are no edges within the same set. Therefore, every pair of vertices in the same set is non-adjacent. \n\n            Then, the condition for t=1 is always satisfied if there is a set with at least two vertices. \n\n            However, wait: if a set has two vertices, then there is a missing edge (the edge",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges `t` that must be added to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and the number of ways `w` to add these `t` edges. The solution involves checking the graph's bipartiteness and analyzing its structure to find the required edges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Odd Cycles (t = 0)**:\n   - Use BFS or DFS to perform a bipartite check on each connected component. If any component is not bipartite, the graph contains an odd cycle, so `t = 0` and `w = 1`.\n\n2. **Bipartite Graph Handling**:\n   - If the graph is bipartite, check for missing edges within the same bipartite set (t = 1). For each connected component, count the number of non-edges in each bipartite set. The total ways to add one edge is the sum of these non-edges across all components.\n   - If no such edges exist (i.e., each bipartite set is fully connected), then `t = 2`. The number of ways to add two edges is calculated by considering all triangles (three vertices) where two edges are present and one is missing. Each such triangle contributes one way to add the two missing edges to form a triangle.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the graph has fewer than three vertices, it's impossible to form a triangle, so `t = 3` and `w = 1` if the graph is empty (no edges).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(m):\n        u = int(data[index]); v = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n        \n    color = [-1] * (n+1)\n    components = []\n    visited = [False] * (n+1)\n    comp_id = [-1] * (n+1)\n    comp_index = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            comp_index += 1\n            q = deque([i])\n            visited[i] = True\n            color[i] = 0\n            comp_parts = [set(), set()]\n            comp_parts[0].add(i)\n            while q:\n                node = q.popleft()\n                for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                    if not visited[neighbor]:\n                        visited[neighbor] = True\n                        color[neighbor] = color[node] ^ 1\n                        comp_parts[color[neighbor]].add(neighbor)\n                        q.append(neighbor)\n                    else:\n                        if color[neighbor] == color[node]:\n                            global_is_bipartite = False\n            comp_id[i] = comp_index\n            components.append((comp_parts[0], comp_parts[1]))\n    \n    if not global_is_bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n        \n    same_set_edges = 0\n    for part0, part1 in components:\n        total_possible_edges_in_part0 = len(part0) * (len(part0)-1) // 2\n        existing_edges_in_part0 = 0\n        for node in part0:\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor in part0:\n                    existing_edges_in_part0 += 1\n        existing_edges_in_part0 //= 2\n        missing_edges_in_part0 = total_possible_edges_in_part0 - existing_edges_in_part0\n        same_set_edges += missing_edges_in_part0\n        \n        total_possible_edges_in_part1 = len(part1) * (len(part1)-1) // 2\n        existing_edges_in_part1 = 0\n        for node in part1:\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor in part1:\n                    existing_edges_in_part1 += 1\n        existing_edges_in_part1 //= 2\n        missing_edges_in_part1 = total_possible_edges_in_part1 - existing_edges_in_part1\n        same_set_edges += missing_edges_in_part1\n        \n    if same_set_edges > 0:\n        print(\"1\", same_set_edges)\n        return\n        \n    t = 2\n    w = 0\n    if n < 3:\n        print(f\"{3} {1}\")\n        return\n        \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(i+1, n+1):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            if color[i] == color[j]:\n                continue\n            if j not in graph[i]:\n                for k in range(1, n+1):\n                    if k == i or k == j:\n                        continue\n                    if color[k] != color[i] and color[k] != color[j]:\n                        if i in graph[k] and j in graph[k]:\n                            w += 1\n                    elif color[k] == color[i]:\n                        if j in graph[k]:\n                            w += 1\n                    else:\n                        if i in graph[k]:\n                            w += 1\n                            \n    print(f\"{t} {w}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Bipartite Check**: The code first checks if the graph is bipartite using BFS.
