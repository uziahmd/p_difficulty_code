The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting from i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring is the border of this inner rectangle, and it has a width of 1 cell.\n\n The number of cells in the i-th ring is the perimeter of the inner rectangle (but note that the corners are counted once) \n so it is: 2 * (width + height) - 4? Actually, no: because the standard way to compute the perimeter of a rectangle made of cells is:\n\n However, note: the problem says the ring has width 1. So for an inner rectangle of size a x b, the ring would be the outermost layer of the rectangle.\n\n But wait: the ring is defined as \"all bordering cells on the inner rectangle\". That means we take the inner rectangle and then take the cells that are immediately adjacent to it? Actually, let's read the problem again.\n\n It says: the first ring goes along the edge of the plate -> that's the outermost border of the original w x h.\n\n Then the second ring goes 2 cells away from the edge. So actually, the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle that is two cells smaller in each dimension.\n\n How many cells does the i-th ring have?\n\n Consider the i-th ring (i starting at 1):\n   The inner rectangle has dimensions: (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))\n\n But note: the ring is the border of that inner rectangle, but wait the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. This matches: for i=1, the inner rectangle is w x h, and the border is the entire outer layer. For i=2, the inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4) (because 4*(2-1)=4) and the border is the next layer.\n\n However, note that the problem states: the second ring should be 2 cells away from the edge. This is achieved by having an inner rectangle that is 4 less in each dimension (so we remove two from the top, two from the bottom, two from the left and two from the right). \n\n Now, the number of cells in the i-th ring is the perimeter of the inner rectangle (if we consider the border as a cycle, but actually we are counting the cells). The inner rectangle has:\n\n   top row: from (0,0) to (0, h-1) for the first ring (i=1). But wait, the ring includes the entire outer border.\n\n Actually, the ring is the set of cells that are part of the border. The border of a rectangle of size a x b is:\n\n   top: a cells (the entire top row)\n   bottom: a cells (the entire bottom row)\n   left side (excluding the top and bottom): (b-2) cells\n   right side (excluding the top and bottom): (b-2) cells\n\n But wait, if we do that, we get: 2*a + 2*(b-2) = 2a + 2b - 4.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as the entire outer rectangle (which has perimeter 2*(a+b)) and then subtract the four corners which were counted twice? Actually, no: the standard formula for the number of cells in the border is 2*(a+b) - 4, because the four corners are shared by two sides and we don't want to double count? \n\n However, note: in the grid, the border is contiguous. Let me break down:\n\n   Top row: a cells (from (0,0) to (0,a-1))\n   Bottom row: a cells (from (a-1,0) to (a-1, a-1))? Wait, no: the inner rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), so we'll use a = w - 4*(i-1) and b = h - 4*(i-1).\n\n Actually, the rectangle has a rows and b columns? Or the other way? The input gives w (rows) and h (columns). So:\n\n   The inner rectangle for ring i has:\n        rows = w - 4*(i-1)\n        columns = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n Then the border (the ring) of this inner rectangle is:\n\n        top: columns (b) cells\n        bottom: columns (b) cells\n        left: rows-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate and moving inward. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle formed by reducing the original dimensions by 4*(i-1) in both width and height for the i-th ring (starting from i=1). The number of cells in each ring is given by the perimeter of this inner rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions `a x b` is calculated as `2*a + 2*b - 4` because the four corners are shared between adjacent sides and should not be double-counted.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. The number of cells in the ring is then derived from these dimensions using the perimeter formula. Summing these values for all k rings gives the total number of cells to be gilded.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring once, performing simple arithmetic operations for each. Since k is at most the floor of (min(w, h) + 1)/4, the complexity is O(k), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        total_cells += 2 * (a + b) - 4\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_cells` is initialized to zero to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Calculate Dimensions**: The inner rectangle's dimensions are computed by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both the original width and height. This adjustment accounts for the cells occupied by previous rings.\n   - **Check Validity**: If the computed dimensions become non-positive, the loop breaks early as further rings would not contribute any cells.\n   - **Perimeter Calculation**: The number of cells in the current ring is calculated using the formula `2*(a + b) - 4`, which effectively computes the perimeter of the inner rectangle.\n4. **Output Result**: The accumulated total number of cells (`total_cells`) is printed after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and careful handling of edge cases where inner rectangles might become invalid.",
