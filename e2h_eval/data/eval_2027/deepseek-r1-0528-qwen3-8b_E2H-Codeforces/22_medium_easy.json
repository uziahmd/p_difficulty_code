After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has two integers n and m, then n lines each with m characters (without spaces)\n We need to count the number of successful students. A student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., no other student has a higher mark in that subject).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines to get the gradebook.\n\n However, note: the input example is given as a list of strings, but actually we will read from stdin.\n\n We can do:\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   Then the first line is data[0], and the rest are data[1:].\n\n But note: the input might be provided as a string that we split? Actually, the problem says: \n   The first input line contains two integers n and m. Next n lines each containing m characters.\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\n However, the example input is given as a string that includes the newline. But note: the example input format is:\n\n   Input: \n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n This is just an example representation. In reality, we read from stdin.\n\n Let's assume we read from stdin.\n\n Approach:\n\n For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), we can find the maximum mark in that subject. Then, for each student i, we check for each subject j: \n   If the student's mark in subject j is equal to the maximum mark of subject j, then he is the best in that subject.\n\n However, note: if there are multiple students with the same maximum mark, they are all considered best in that subject.\n\n But the condition for a student to be successful is: there exists at least one subject where he is the best.\n\n So, for each student, we can check over all subjects: is there any subject j such that his mark is the maximum for subject j?\n\n But note: the maximum mark for subject j is the highest value in that column.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n and m.\n 2. Read the n lines (each line is a string of m characters).\n 3. Build a matrix (list of lists) or keep as list of strings.\n\n Alternatively, we can process without building a matrix by using columns.\n\n Let's do:\n\n   grades = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        s = input().strip()\n        grades.append(s)\n\n Then, we can create a list for each subject (column) to get the maximum.\n\n However, note: the marks are from 1 to 9, so we can also use the fact that we only have digits.\n\n Alternatively, we can transpose the matrix.\n\n Since n, m <= 100, we can do:\n\n   max_marks = [0] * m   # for each subject, the maximum mark\n\n   But wait, we want the maximum per subject (column). We can do:\n\n   for j in range(m):\n        col_max = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # grades[i][j] is the character at row i, column j\n            mark = int(grades[i][j])\n            if mark > col_max:\n                col_max = mark\n        max_marks[j] = col_max\n\n Then, for each student i, we check for any subject j (from 0 to m-1) such that int(grades[i][j]) == max_marks[j]. If at least one exists, then student i is successful.\n\n However, note: what if the maximum mark is 5, but there are multiple students with 5? Then each of them is best in that subject.\n\n But note: the condition for being the best is having the highest mark. And if there are multiple, then they are all best.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        2 2\n        55\n        55\n\n   Then for subject0: max_marks[0] = 5, and student0 has 5 -> best in subject0.\n        subject1: max_marks[1] = 5, and student0 has 5 -> best in subject1.\n        Similarly for student1.\n\n   So both students are successful.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   grades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   # If there are no students, then answer is 0.\n   if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        exit(0)\n\n   # Precompute max_marks for each column (subject)\n   max_marks = [0] * m\n   for j in range(m):\n        current_max = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Convert the char to int and compare\n            mark = int(grades[i][j])\n            if mark > current_max:\n                current_max = mark\n        max_marks[j] = current_max\n\n   # Now, for each student, check if there's at least one subject j where the student's mark equals max_marks[j]\n   count_successful = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if int(grades[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break   # no need to check other subjects\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n\n   print(count_successful)\n\n However, let's test with the first sample:\n\n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   We have three subjects (columns) and three rows.\n\n   Compute max_marks for each column:\n\n      Column0: [2, 2, 1] -> max=2\n      Column1: [2, 3, 1] -> max=3\n      Column2: [3, 2, 2] -> max=3\n\n   Then check each student:\n\n      Student0 (row0): \n          subject0: 2 == 2 -> successful, so count this student.\n\n      Student1 (row1):\n          subject0: 2 == 2 -> successful.\n\n      Student2 (row2):\n          subject0: 1 != 2 -> skip\n          subject1: 1 != 3 -> skip\n          subject2: 2 != 3 -> not successful.\n\n   So output is 2, which matches.\n\n   Second sample:\n\n        Input: \n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        We'll compute the maximum for each column:\n\n        Column0: [9,1,1] -> 9\n        Column1: [1,1,1] -> 1\n        Column2: [7,8,1] -> 8\n        Column3: [2,2,1] -> 2\n        Column4: [8,8,1] -> 8\n\n        Now check each student:\n\n        Student0: \n            subject0: 9==9 -> successful.\n\n        Student1:\n            subject0: 1 !=9\n            subject1: 1==1 -> successful.\n\n        Student2:\n            subject0: 1 !=9\n            subject1: 1==1 -> successful.\n\n        So all three are successful.\n\n        Output: 3.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a list of strings, but we are reading from stdin. So we must ensure the input reading is correct.\n\n   But note: the input might have extra spaces? The problem says: \"Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9.\" and the next n lines each containing m characters (without spaces).\n\n   So we can safely use input().strip().\n\n   But what if there are spaces in the input? The problem says the marks are not separated by spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we assume the input is as described.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Edge case: n=0 or m=0.\n\n   According to constraints: n, m >= 1, so we don't need to handle 0, but let's be safe.\n\n   But the constraint says: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.\n\n   So we can proceed.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a string that includes the newline. Our reading method should handle that.\n\n   We are using:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   This should work.\n\n   But note: what if the input is given in one line for the first part and then the next lines? The first input line is the two integers, then the next n lines.\n\n   This is standard.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   One more optimization: we can avoid converting the entire column to integers until necessary.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        max_marks = [0] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            # We can traverse the column j and take the max of the characters? But note: the characters are digits, so we can compare as characters? \n            # But the digits '1' to '9' have increasing ASCII values, so we can compare as characters.\n\n            # However, we are currently converting to int. We can also do:\n\n            # Option 1: compare as characters (since '1' < '2' etc.)\n\n            # But note: the marks are from 1 to 9, so the character representation is the same as the numeric order.\n\n            # We can do:\n\n            #   col_chars = [grades[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            #   max_char = max(col_chars)\n            #   max_marks[j] = int(max_char)   OR even better, we can keep it as a char and then when checking the student, compare the char with max_char?\n\n            # However, the problem: the student's mark is given as a char. So we can store the max_marks as char and then compare the char.\n\n            # But note: the same mark: '5' is the same as '5'. \n\n            # Why not do:\n\n            #   max_marks = [max([grades[i][j] for i in range(n)]) for j in range(m)]\n\n            # Then we can avoid converting to int until the comparison? Actually, we can compare the characters directly because they are in order.\n\n            # However, the problem does not specify if the input is given with leading zeros or anything, but the marks are from 1 to 9, so no zero. And the characters are digits.\n\n            # But note: the problem says \"Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9\", so we can rely on that.\n\n            # Then we can do:\n\n            #   max_marks_chars = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n            # Then for each student i and subject j, we check if grades[i][j] == max_marks_chars[j]\n\n            # This avoids converting to integers and might be faster.\n\n            # But the original method is clear too.\n\n   Since n and m are small (<=100), we can choose either.\n\n   Let me stick to the first method for clarity, but note: we are converting each mark to int for the max_marks and then again for the student? Actually, in the student loop we convert again.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute a matrix of integers to avoid repeated conversion.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        grades_int = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            row = [int(x) for x in input().strip()]\n            grades_int.append(row)\n\n        Then, for each column j, max_marks[j] = max(grades_int[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n        Then for each student i, we check: for any j, grades_int[i][j] == max_marks[j]\n\n   But note: the problem says the input is given as characters, so we have to convert anyway in the student loop.\n\n   However, if we do the integer conversion for the entire matrix, we use more memory (but n,m <=100, so 100*100=10000 integers, which is acceptable).\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        max_marks = [0] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_val = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                num = int(grades[i][j])\n                if num > max_val:\n                    max_val = num\n            max_marks[j] = max_val\n\n        Then for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if int(grades[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                    ...\n\n   But we are converting each element twice (once in the outer loop and once in the inner loop). That is 2*n*m conversions.\n\n   We can precompute a 2D list of integers for the entire gradebook.\n\n   Considering simplicity and avoiding repeated conversions, we can do:\n\n        grades_int = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            row = [int(char) for char in s]\n            grades_int.append(row)\n\n        max_marks = [0] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            max_marks[j] = max(grades_int[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n        Then for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grades_int[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    ...\n\n   But note: the problem doesn't require storing the entire integer matrix, but since n and m are small, it's acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says the input is given without spaces, so we can read the line and then split into characters? Actually, we are reading the whole line and then converting each character.\n\n   Another option: we can read the entire input and then split by newline and then by characters? But the input is given as consecutive characters.\n\n   But the above method is straightforward.\n\n   Let me choose the method that uses integer conversion for the entire matrix for clarity and to avoid repeated conversions.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades_int = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            # If the line has length m, then we can convert each character\n            row = []\n            for char in s:\n                row.append(int(char))\n            grades_int.append(row)\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use list comprehensions:\n        #   grades_int = [[int(char) for char in input().strip()] for _ in range(n)]\n\n        max_marks = [0] * m\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [grades_int[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_marks[j] = max(col)\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grades_int[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break   # break out of inner loop, but we still need to check the next student\n\n            # Actually, we break the inner loop for one student, then move to next.\n\n        But wait, the above counts the first subject j where the condition holds, and then breaks. But note: we are breaking the inner loop and then moving to the next student.\n\n        However, we are counting a student as soon as we find one j where the condition holds.\n\n        But note: we don't want to break the outer loop, so that's okay.\n\n        But wait: the above code counts the student and then breaks the inner loop. Then we go to the next student.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grades_int[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n        Which is the same.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, the problem says the input might be up to 100x100, so we are doing 100*100 comparisons in the worst-case (if we don't break early) but we break as soon as we find one.\n\n   The alternative without converting to integers:\n\n        We can compare the characters directly, but then we must know the maximum character in the column.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            grades_str = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n            max_marks_chars = [max(grades_str[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\n        But note: this is a list of characters. Then for each student i and subject j, we check:\n\n            if grades_str[i][j] == max_marks_chars[j]:\n\n        Then we don't need to convert the entire matrix.\n\n        How to compute max_marks_chars for each column j?\n\n            max_marks_chars[j] = max(grades_str[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\n        This is valid because the string comparison for single-digit characters is the same as numeric comparison.\n\n        Example: \n            '9' > '1' -> True, and so on.\n\n        This method is simpler and avoids integer conversion.\n\n   Let me implement that.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades_str = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Precompute max_marks_chars for each subject j\n        max_marks_chars = [0] * m   # We'll store the maximum character in the column j\n        for j in range(m):\n            # We want the maximum character in the j-th column across all rows\n            col_chars = [grades_str[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_char = max(col_chars)   # This works because the characters are digits and the max is lexicographically the largest, which is the same as numerically the largest.\n            max_marks_chars[j] = max_char\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grades_str[i][j] == max_marks_chars[j]:\n                    count += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let's test with the first sample:\n\n        grades_str = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n        For j=0: col_chars = ['2','2','1'] -> max_char = '2'\n        j=1: ['2','3','1'] -> '3'\n        j=2: ['3','2','2'] -> '3'\n\n        Then for student0: \n            j0: '2'=='2' -> count=1, break inner loop.\n\n        student1:\n            j0: '2'=='2' -> count=2, break.\n\n        student2:\n            j0: '1' !='2'\n            j1: '1' !='3'\n            j2: '2' !='3' -> no break, so not counted.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Second sample:\n\n        grades_str = ['91728','11828','11111']\n\n        j0: ['9','1','1'] -> '9'\n        j1: ['1','1','1'] -> '1'\n        j2: ['7','8','1'] -> '8'\n        j3: ['2','2','1'] -> '2'\n        j4: ['8','8','1'] -> '8'\n\n        student0: \n            j0: '9'=='9' -> count=1, break.\n\n        student1:\n            j0: '1' !='9'\n            j1: '1'=='1' -> count=2, break.\n\n        student2:\n            j0: '1' !='9'\n            j1: '1'=='1' -> count=3, break.\n\n        Output: 3.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the character comparison method.\n\n   However, note: the input might have newline characters? We are using strip(), which removes leading/trailing whitespace (including newlines). But the problem says the marks are given as a string of m characters. So the input line should be exactly m characters. But if there is a newline, strip() might remove it. But the problem says \"each containing m characters\", so the line without spaces should be of length m.\n\n   But if the input is provided with spaces, the problem says not. So we assume no spaces.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a string without spaces.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades_str = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            # It is expected that len(s) == m, but if there are any extraneous spaces, we might have to adjust?\n            # The problem says: \"Next n lines each containing m characters\", so we assume no spaces.\n\n            # But if the input has spaces, then strip() would remove them and the length might change.\n\n        To be safe, we can read without strip and then take the first m characters? Or the problem says the input format.\n\n   Since the problem states the input format, we assume the input is correct.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a string that includes the newline, and we are using strip() which removes the newline. Then we have the exact string of m characters.\n\n   However, if the input line has a trailing space, then strip() would remove that too.\n\n   The problem says: \"each containing m characters\", meaning the entire line (after stripping) should be m characters? Actually, the problem says \"Next n lines each containing m characters\", so the line must have exactly m characters.\n\n   But if we use strip(), then if there are spaces at the beginning or end, we remove them and then the length becomes less than m.\n\n   Example: input line \"223 \" (with a space at the end) would become \"223\" (without the space) and then we have 3 characters, which is correct. But the problem says the line has m characters, so including the space? No, the problem says \"each containing m characters\" and the characters are numbers from 1 to 9. So the space is not allowed.\n\n   Therefore, we can use strip() and then check the length? But the problem says the input is correct.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read the line without stripping and then take the first m characters.\n\n   Since the problem says the line has m characters, we can do:\n\n        s = input().rstrip('\\n')   # remove only the newline at the end, but leave any trailing spaces? Actually, the problem says the marks are not separated by spaces.\n\n   But the problem does not specify that there are no spaces, but the marks are given without spaces.\n\n   To be safe, we can read the line and then remove any non-digit characters? But the problem says the marks are numbers from 1 to 9.\n\n   However, the problem says \"each containing m characters\", so we assume the line has exactly m characters (digits) and possibly a newline. We can read the line and then take the first m characters.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input is given without spaces, so we assume the line has m digits and then maybe a newline.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        s = input()\n        s = s[:m]   # take the first m characters\n\n   But then if the input line has more than m characters, we take the first m. If it has less, then we have an issue.\n\n   Since the problem says the input is correct, we can assume that each line has exactly m characters (digits) and then a newline (or nothing) or spaces? The problem says \"without spaces\".\n\n   Given the ambiguity, let me read the problem statement again: \"Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9.\"\n\n   So each line should have m characters (all digits from 1 to 9). There should be no extra spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we can use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades_str = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()   # but if there are spaces, we remove them and then the length might be less than m?\n            # Instead, we can read the entire line and then take the first m non-whitespace characters? But the problem says without spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            s = input()\n            # Remove any non-digit? But the problem says digits only.\n\n        Since the problem says the input is correct, we can simply use:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n\n        and then if the length of s is not m, then we have an error. But the problem says the input is correct.\n\n   I think using strip() is safe because the input is supposed to be the m digits and then maybe a newline or spaces. But the problem says \"without spaces\", so we hope there are no spaces.\n\n   However, the problem says the input format, so we assume the input is as described.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades_str = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n   But note: if the input line has a trailing space, then strip() removes it and then we have m characters? Only if the line originally had m+ k (k spaces) and then we remove the spaces and the trailing newline, we get the m digits. But the problem says the line has m characters (digits). \n\n   Actually, the problem says the input is the gradebook, so the line should be exactly the m digits. We are reading from stdin, and the input may come from a file or console.\n\n   The problem does not specify whether there are any extra spaces. So to be safe, we can do:\n\n        s = input()\n        s = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, s))   # remove any non-digit, but the problem says digits only, so this is redundant.\n\n   But the problem says the characters are from 1 to 9, so no non-digit.\n\n   Since the constraints are small, we can also check the length.\n\n   However, the problem says the input is correct, so we can assume the input has exactly m digits.\n\n   I'll use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades_str = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            if len(s) > m:\n                s = s[:m]   # in case there are extra characters at the end\n            elif len(s) < m:\n                # then we need to pad? But the problem says m characters, so this should not happen.\n                # But if it happens, we can pad with what? The problem doesn't say. So we assume it's correct.\n                # Alternatively, we can break if the length is not m.\n                pass\n            grades_str.append(s)\n\n   But the problem says the input is correct, so we assume each line is exactly m characters.\n\n   So the final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades_str = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Then compute max_marks_chars and count.\n\n   However, if the input line has more than m characters, we are taking the entire stripped string (which might be longer) and then in the j-th column we are accessing the j-th character. But if the string is longer than m, then we are reading beyond the intended m? Actually, no: because the problem says m subjects and each row has m characters. The extra characters are not part of the gradebook.\n\n   But the problem says the input is correct, so we assume the input has exactly m characters per row.\n\n   We'll proceed with the above.\n\n   Let me submit the code with the character comparison method.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        grades_str = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If the input line has more than m characters, we are going to use the first m? But we used strip, so if there are trailing spaces, they are removed. \n        # But the problem says the input is without spaces, so we assume each line is exactly m characters.\n\n        # Precompute the maximum character for each subject (column)\n        max_marks_chars = [0] * m   # We'll use a list of characters, but initially 0 (which is not a char) -> we can initialize as None or use a list of single element?\n\n        # Alternatively, we can set to a very small character, but easier to use the built-in max.\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            # Extract the j-th character from each row\n            col_chars = [row[j] for row in grades_str]\n            max_char = max(col_chars)   # This gives the maximum character in the column\n            max_marks_chars[j] = max_char\n\n        count_successful = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(m):\n                if grades_str[i][j] == max_marks_chars[j]:\n                    count_successful += 1\n                    break\n\n        print(count_successful)\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            \"3 3\"\n            \"223\"\n            \"232\"\n            \"112\"\n\n        Example 2: \n            Input: \n                \"3 5\"\n                \"91728\"\n                \"11828\"\n                \"11111\"\n\n   Both work.\n\n   But note: what if a subject has multiple maximums? Then the condition holds for all those students. And we break for each student as soon as one subject is found.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require to consider the same student multiple times. We are breaking the inner loop for the student as soon as we find one subject.\n\n   This is efficient.\n\n   We'll submit this code.\n\n   One more edge: n=1, m=1\n\n        Input: \n            \"1 1\"\n            \"1\"\n\n        Then max_marks_chars[0] = '1'\n        Then check the student: '1' == '1' -> successful, output 1.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Another edge: n=1, m=2\n\n        Input: \n            \"1 2\"\n            \"21\"\n\n        Then for subject0: ['2'] -> max='2'; subject1: ['1'] -> max='1'\n        Student0: subject0: '2'=='2' -> successful.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Therefore, we are confident.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the problem says the input is from stdin, so we use input().\n\n   But note: in some environments, input() might be slow for large inputs, but n, m <=100, so it's okay.\n\n   Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of each student in each subject.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves iterating through each column and keeping track of the maximum value encountered.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students. The check can be optimized by breaking early once a successful subject is found for a student.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades_str = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_marks_chars = [0] * m\n\nfor j in range(m):\n    col_chars = [row[j] for row in grades_str]\n    max_char = max(col_chars)\n    max_marks_chars[j] = max_char\n\ncount_successful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if grades_str[i][j] == max_marks_chars[j]:\n            count_successful += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count_successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The first line of input is read to get the dimensions (n students and m subjects). The subsequent n lines are read as strings, each representing a student's marks across all subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the maximum mark is determined by examining each student's mark in that subject. This is done using a list comprehension to gather all marks for a subject and then applying the `max` function.\n3. **Counting Successful Students**: Each student is checked against the maximum marks of each subject. If a student has the highest mark in any subject, they are counted as successful, and the inner loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary checks.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance by leveraging column-wise maximum calculations and early termination during the success check, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
