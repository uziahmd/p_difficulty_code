The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: \n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   string A (Nikephoros' sequence) and string B (Polycarpus' sequence)\n\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n Instead, we note that the two players use cyclic sequences.\n\n Let m = len(A), k = len(B). The game proceeds for n rounds.\n\n In round i (0-indexed), Nikephoros uses A[(i * m + start) % m] and Polycarpus uses B[(i * k + start) % k].\n But note: the problem says they cyclically show the items starting from the first one.\n\n However, we can break down the n rounds into cycles of length LCM(m, k) but note that n might not be a multiple of LCM(m,k). \n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n   For each index j in the combined cycle (with period T = LCM(m, k)), we can determine the outcome for the round corresponding to that index.\n\n But note: the two sequences have independent cycles. The round i is determined by:\n   x_i = (i mod m) for A, and y_i = (i mod k) for B? Actually, no: because they start at the beginning, so for round 0: \n        A[0] and B[0]\n   round 1: A[1] and B[1]\n   ...\n   round m-1: A[m-1] and B[m-1]\n   round m: A[0] and B[m mod k] (which is B[m % k])\n\n However, note that the sequences are independent. We can think of the entire game as being composed of complete cycles of length T (where T = LCM(m, k)). But note that the two sequences repeat independently.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can compute the total number of rounds that fall in a particular residue class modulo the LCM of the two periods? Actually, we can consider the entire set of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) and then for each distinct pair (a, b) we know the outcome (who wins or if draw) and how many times that pair appears in the first T rounds.\n\n 2. Then, we can compute the total number of losses (red spots) for each player over the n rounds.\n\n How?\n\n Let T = LCM(m, k). Then, the pattern of pairs (a, b) repeats every T rounds. However, note that the rounds are indexed from 0 to n-1.\n\n We can break the n rounds into:\n   full_cycles = n // T\n   remainder = n % T\n\n Then, the outcomes for the first T rounds will repeat full_cycles times, and then we simulate the next 'remainder' rounds.\n\n But note: T can be as large as m*k (which is 10^6 since m,k<=1000) and n up to 2e9, so T can be up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n However, wait: we are only required to handle m,k up to 1000, so T = LCM(m,k) <= 1000*1000 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: 2e9 / T might be very large, but we don't need to iterate over each cycle. We can precompute the outcome for each pair (a, b) for one cycle (T rounds) and then multiply by full_cycles and add the remainder.\n\n However, note: the rounds are not independent in the sense of the indices. Actually, we can consider the entire set of residues (mod m, mod k) and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Not exactly, but we can iterate over all pairs (i, j) such that i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1] and count how many rounds have (A[i], B[j]).\n\n But note: the round index i (from 0 to n-1) gives:\n   a = A[i % m]\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n So the pair (a, b) is determined by the residues (i mod m, i mod k). The set of residues (x,y) that occur in the first T rounds (with T = LCM(m,k)) is exactly the set of pairs (x,y) such that x runs from 0 to m-1 and y runs from 0 to k-1, but with the condition that the round index i must satisfy i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k). This system has a solution if and only if x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k))? Actually, the set of (x,y) that appear is all pairs (x,y) for which there exists an integer i such that i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k). This is equivalent to requiring that x ≡ y (mod g) where g = gcd(m,k). But actually, we don't need to worry because T is the LCM, and in the interval [0, T-1] (which is one full cycle) every residue pair (x,y) that satisfies x mod g == y mod g will appear exactly once? \n\n Actually, the standard result: the number of solutions for i in [0, T-1] to the system i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k) is either 0 or 1. And the system has a solution if and only if x ≡ y (mod g) (with g = gcd(m,k)). \n\n However, we don't need to use that to count the pairs. Instead, we can simply note that the total number of rounds is n, and the pattern of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds.\n\n But note: the total number of distinct pairs (x,y) that appear is exactly the number of pairs (x,y) such that x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] and x ≡ y (mod g) is not necessary. Actually, in one cycle of T rounds, every pair (x,y) (with x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1]) does not necessarily appear. The condition is that the system of congruences i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k) has a solution. The set of pairs (x,y) that appear is exactly those for which x ≡ y (mod g). And the total number of pairs that appear is T, because we have T distinct residues modulo T.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the math and just iterate over the first T rounds (which is 1e6 maximum) and record the outcome for each round.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Compute T = LCM(m, k). We can compute T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k). But note: we need to compute the GCD.\n\n 2. Precompute an array `outcomes` for the first T rounds (each round i from 0 to T-1). For each round i:\n        a_index = i % m\n        b_index = i % k\n        a_char = A[a_index]\n        b_char = B[b_index]\n\n        Then, determine the outcome:\n\n        According to the rules:\n          - If a_char == b_char: draw -> no red spot.\n          - Else, check:\n            Rock (R) beats Scissors (S): R vs S -> R wins, so the one who played R doesn't get a spot, the one who played S does.\n            Scissors (S) beats Paper (P): S vs P -> S wins.\n            Paper (P) beats Rock (R): P vs R -> P wins.\n\n        Therefore, for a round:\n            If (a_char, b_char) is (R, S): then Nikephoros wins -> no spot for him, but Polycarpus gets one.\n            If (a_char, b_char) is (S, P): then Nikephoror wins? No: wait, let's map:\n\n            Actually, if we denote:\n                Outcome for (A, B):\n                    A wins: \n                        (R, S) -> A wins\n                        (S, P) -> A wins\n                        (P, R) -> A wins\n                    B wins:\n                        (S, R) -> B wins\n                        (P, S) -> B wins\n                        (R, P) -> B wins\n\n            So, if A wins, then Nikephoros (the one using A) gets no spot, and Polycarpus (using B) gets one.\n            If B wins, then Polycarpus (using B) gets no spot, and Nikephoros (using A) gets one.\n\n        Therefore, we can count:\n            Let loss_A = 0   (for Nikephoros)\n            Let loss_B = 0   (for Polycarpus)\n\n        For round i in [0, T-1]:\n            if A[i % m] == B[i % k]:\n                continue\n            elif (A[i % m] == 'R' and B[i % k] == 'S') or (A[i % m] == 'S' and B[i % k] == 'P') or (A[i % m] == 'P' and B[i % k] == 'R'):\n                # Then A wins: so B loses -> Polycarpus gets a spot\n                loss_B += 1\n            else:\n                # Then B wins: so A loses -> Nikephoros gets a spot\n                loss_A += 1\n\n 3. Now, we have the counts for one cycle of T rounds.\n\n 4. Then, the total number of full cycles in n rounds: cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n\n 5. Then, total_red_spots_Nikephoros = cycles * loss_A + (additional losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephoros)\n    Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n 6. To compute the additional part for the remainder, we can simulate the first 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) and count the losses.\n\n However, note that T can be up to 10^6, and remainder can be up to T-1 (which is 10^6) so simulating remainder rounds is acceptable because remainder < T (and T is at most 10^6).\n\n But note: n can be 2e9, and T is at least 1, so remainder is less than T (so less than 10^6) so we can simulate up to 10^6 rounds.\n\n However, we can also precompute an array for the entire cycle and then use the fact that the first T rounds are known.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the entire cycle of T rounds and then:\n\n    loss_A_total = (n // T) * loss_A_cycle + (additional loss_A in the first remainder rounds)\n    similarly for loss_B.\n\n 7. But note: we already computed the entire cycle of T rounds. We can also store the outcomes for each round in the cycle (whether it's a loss for A, loss for B, or draw) and then for the remainder rounds, we just iterate from 0 to remainder-1.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Step 1: Read n, A, B.\n    Step 2: m = len(A), k = len(B)\n    Step 3: Compute T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)   [We need a gcd function]\n\n    Step 4: Precompute the cycle of T rounds (if T==0, then skip, but m,k>=1 so T>=1)\n\n        losses_A_cycle = 0\n        losses_B_cycle = 0\n\n        for i in range(T):\n            a_char = A[i % m]\n            b_char = B[i % k]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                losses_B_cycle += 1\n            else:\n                losses_A_cycle += 1\n\n    Step 5: cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n    Step 6: Now, simulate the first 'rem' rounds to get the additional losses.\n\n        add_A = 0\n        add_B = 0\n        for i in range(rem):\n            a_char = A[i % m]\n            b_char = B[i % k]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                add_B += 1\n            else:\n                add_A += 1\n\n    Step 7: Total for Nikephoros (A) = cycles * losses_A_cycle + add_A\n            Total for Polycarpus (B) = cycles * losses_B_cycle + add_B\n\n    Step 8: Print(f\"{Total_A} {Total_B}\")\n\n However, note: the problem says the two integers: first integer is the number of red spots on Nikephoros, second on Polycarpus.\n\n But wait: in our simulation, we counted:\n        When A wins: we add to losses_B_cycle (meaning Polycarpus gets a spot)\n        When B wins: we add to losses_A_cycle (meaning Nikephoros gets a spot)\n\n And then we did the same for the remainder.\n\n Example: First sample input: \n        Input: \n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        We expect: 3 2\n\n        Let's do the cycle: \n            m=3, k=4 -> T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        Then we simulate 12 rounds? Then we take 7 rounds.\n\n        But note: the example game was 7 rounds. The example output is 3 for Nikephoros and 2 for Polycarpus.\n\n        However, the example game is 7 rounds, so we are only going to simulate 7 rounds.\n\n        But note: the example rounds are:\n\n            Round0: R vs R -> draw\n            Round1: P vs S -> A: P, B: S -> (P, S): B wins -> so Nikephoros gets a spot (counted in loss_A_cycle for this round)\n            Round2: S vs P -> A: S, B: P -> (S, P): A wins -> so Polycarpus gets a spot\n            Round3: R vs P -> A: R, B: P -> (R, P): B wins -> Nikephoros gets a spot\n            Round4: P vs R -> A: P, B: R -> (P, R): A wins -> Polycarpus gets a spot\n            Round5: S vs S -> draw\n            Round6: R vs P -> same as round3: B wins -> Nikephoros gets a spot\n\n        So for 7 rounds: \n            Nikephoros: 3 losses (round1, round3, round6)\n            Polycarpus: 2 losses (round2, round4)\n\n        Now, in our cycle simulation for the first 7 rounds (without the cycle repetition, because we are not repeating the entire cycle):\n\n        We did:\n\n            for i in range(7):   [i from 0 to 6]\n\n            i=0: (R,R) -> draw\n            i=1: (P,S) -> B wins -> add_A +=1\n            i=2: (S,P) -> A wins -> add_B +=1\n            i=3: (R,P) -> B wins -> add_A +=1\n            i=4: (P,R) -> A wins -> add_B +=1\n            i=5: (S,S) -> draw\n            i=6: (R,P) -> B wins -> add_A +=1\n\n        Then add_A = 3, add_B = 2.\n\n        Since cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, so total_A = 3, total_B = 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But what if n=12? Then cycles=1, and remainder=0. Then we would have:\n\n            losses_A_cycle (from 12 rounds) = 4 (because in 12 rounds, how many times does A win and B win? We need to compute for 12 rounds.)\n\n        Let's compute the entire 12 rounds:\n\n            i=0: (R,R) -> draw\n            i=1: (P,S) -> B wins -> A:1\n            i=2: (S,P) -> A wins -> B:1\n            i=3: (R,P) -> B wins -> A:2\n            i=4: (P,R) -> A wins -> B:2\n            i=5: (S,S) -> draw\n            i=6: (R,P) -> B wins -> A:3\n            i=7: (P,S) -> B wins -> A:4   (Note: at i=7: A[7 % 3] = A[1]='P', B[7 % 4]=B[3]='P'? Wait, let me check:\n\n            A = \"RPS\", so:\n                i=0: R\n                i=1: P\n                i=2: S\n                i=3: R (since 3%3=0 -> R)\n                i=4: P (4%3=1 -> P)\n                i=5: S (5%3=2 -> S)\n                i=6: R (6%3=0 -> R)\n                i=7: P (7%3=1 -> P)\n\n            B = \"RSPP\", so:\n                i=0: R\n                i=1: S\n                i=2: P\n                i=3: P\n                i=4: R (4%4=0 -> R)\n                i=5: S (5%4=1 -> S)\n                i=6: P (6%4=2 -> P)\n                i=7: P (7%4=3 -> P)\n\n            So round7: (P, P) -> draw? Then:\n\n            Correction: \n                i=0: (R,R) -> draw\n                i=1: (P,S) -> B wins -> A:1\n                i=2: (S,P) -> A wins -> B:1\n                i=3: (R,P) -> B wins -> A:2\n                i=4: (P,R) -> A wins -> B:2\n                i=5: (S,S) -> draw\n                i=6: (R,P) -> B wins -> A:3\n                i=7: (P,P) -> draw\n\n            Then i=8: \n                A[8%3] = A[2] = 'S'\n                B[8%4] = B[0] = 'R'\n                (S,R): A wins? -> (S,R) is one of the winning conditions for A? \n                    According to the rules: \n                    Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n                    So R beats S -> meaning (R, S) is a win for R (the one playing R) -> so if A plays S and B plays R, then B wins (because R beats S). \n                    So: (S, R) -> B wins.\n\n            i=9: \n                A[9%3] = A[0] = 'R'\n                B[9%4] = B[1] = 'S'\n                (R,S): A wins -> so A wins.\n\n            i=10:\n                A[10%3]=A[1]='P'\n                B[10%4]=B[2]='P'\n                (P,P): draw\n\n            i=11:\n                A[11%3]=A[2]='S'\n                B[11%4]=B[3]='P'\n                (S,P): A wins.\n\n            Now, let's tabulate:\n\n            i0: draw\n            i1: B wins (A:1)\n            i2: A wins (B:1)\n            i3: B wins (A:2)\n            i4: A wins (B:2)\n            i5: draw\n            i6: B wins (A:3)\n            i7: draw\n            i8: B wins (A:4)\n            i9: A wins (B:3)\n            i10: draw\n            i11: A wins (B:4)\n\n            So in 12 rounds: \n                A wins: i2, i4, i9, i11 -> 4 wins for A -> so 4 losses for B.\n                B wins: i1, i3, i6, i8 -> 4 wins for B -> 4 losses for A.\n\n            Therefore, for 12 rounds: \n                loss_A_cycle = 4\n                loss_B_cycle = 4\n\n            Then if n=12, we have cycles=1, remainder=0 -> total_A = 4, total_B = 4.\n\n        But the problem: the example input was 7 rounds, and we got 3 and 2.\n\n        The code above should work.\n\n        However, note: we computed the entire cycle of T=12 rounds and then multiplied by cycles and added the remainder.\n\n        The example input was:\n\n            n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        We computed the first 7 rounds (without a full cycle) and got 3 and 2.\n\n        Another example: the second sample input:\n\n            Input: \n                5\n                RRRRRRRR\n                R\n\n            Output: 0 0\n\n        Why? Because both sequences are all 'R'. So every round is a draw.\n\n        So we must be careful: the sequences might be longer than the cycle.\n\n        Let's test with the second sample:\n\n            n=5\n            A=\"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8)\n            B=\"R\" (k=1)\n\n            T = LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n            Then, we simulate 5 rounds (remainder=5) and the cycle of 8 rounds.\n\n            In each round, the pair is (R, R) -> draw.\n\n            So loss_A_cycle for 8 rounds = 0, and then for 5 rounds: 0.\n\n            Thus, output: 0 0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But wait, why did the example say: ['5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'] -> output ['0 0']?\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the LCM computation: we need to compute gcd(m,k). We can use Euclidean algorithm.\n\n        Let's write a helper function for gcd.\n\n        But note: the LCM formula: LCM(a,b) = (a*b) // gcd(a,b). But note that a*b might be large? m,k<=1000, so a*b <= 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: if m and k are 1000, then T = (1000*1000)//gcd(1000,1000) = 1000000//1000 = 1000. So T=1000.\n\n        But actually, the LCM of two numbers a and b is defined as the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            def gcd(a, b):\n                if b == 0:\n                    return a\n                return gcd(b, a % b)\n\n        However, note that the modulus operation might lead to recursion depth issues for large numbers? But our numbers are <=1000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use iterative:\n\n            def gcd(a, b):\n                while b:\n                    a, b = b, a % b\n                return a\n\n        Then T = (m * k) // gcd(m,k)\n\n        But wait: what if m or k is 0? The problem states that m,k>=1.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import math   # Alternatively, we can use math.gcd, but the problem doesn't require external libraries? \n            But the problem says \"You can consider that the given lines only contain characters 'R', 'S' and 'P'.\" and we are allowed to use standard libraries.\n\n        However, the problem doesn't specify that we must use standard libraries, but we can. Since the constraints are small, we can also write our own gcd.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"You can consider that the given lines only contain characters 'R', 'S' and 'P'\", so we don't need to validate the strings.\n\n        Let me use math.gcd if available, but if we are to avoid imports, we can define our own.\n\n        The problem does not require any specific library, but since we are in a competition environment, we can use math if we want.\n\n        However, let's write our own gcd to be safe (in case we are not allowed to use math for some reason).\n\n        Alternatively, the problem constraints are small, so even a naive Euclidean algorithm is efficient.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n, then A, then B.\n\n            m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n            def gcd(a, b):\n                while b:\n                    a, b = b, a % b\n                return a\n\n            T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n            Then proceed as above.\n\n        But note: if m*k is 0, but m,k>=1, so no.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem says n can be up to 2e9, but our T is at most 10^6 (since m,k<=1000, then T<=1000000). So we can safely iterate T times.\n\n        But what if m and k are 1? Then T=1, which is fine.\n\n        Let's test with a small example.\n\n        Example: \n            n=1\n            A='R'\n            B='R'\n\n            Then T = LCM(1,1)=1.\n\n            Cycle: \n                i=0: A[0]=='R', B[0]=='R' -> draw -> losses_A_cycle=0, losses_B_cycle=0.\n\n            Then cycles = 1//1 = 1, remainder=0.\n\n            So total_A = 1*0 + 0 = 0, total_B = 1*0 + 0 = 0.\n\n        Example: \n            n=1\n            A='R'\n            B='S'\n\n            Then T=1.\n\n            i=0: (R,S) -> B wins -> losses_A_cycle +=1, losses_B_cycle unchanged.\n\n            Then cycles=1, remainder=0.\n\n            total_A = 1*1 + 0 = 1, total_B = 1*0 + 0 = 0.\n\n        This is correct: in the only round, Nikephoros (A) loses.\n\n        Example: \n            n=1\n            A='S'\n            B='R'\n\n            Then (S,R): B wins? Actually, (S,R) means A=S and B=R. \n            According to the rules: Rock beats Scissors, so B wins. Therefore, we add 1 to A's losses.\n\n        So the condition for B wins is not just the opposite, but we defined:\n\n            B wins when (a_char, b_char) is not one of the A wins conditions.\n\n            Alternatively, we can define:\n\n            if a_char == b_char: draw\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                # A wins\n            else:\n                # B wins\n\n            The else condition covers:\n                (R, P), (S, R), (P, S)\n\n            Check (S,R): that is (a_char='S', b_char='R') -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so falls into else -> B wins. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n        We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n        Note: There are three outcomes, and the else condition catches the three cases that are wins for B.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check by:\n\n            if a_char == b_char: \n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                # A wins\n            else:\n                # B wins\n\n        This is clear.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            A_str = input().strip()\n            B_str = input().strip()\n\n            m = len(A_str)\n            k = len(B_str)\n\n            # If both sequences are empty, but the problem says m,k>=1, so skip.\n\n            def gcd(a, b):\n                while b:\n                    a, b = b, a % b\n                return a\n\n            T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n            # Precompute the entire cycle T rounds\n            losses_A_cycle = 0\n            losses_B_cycle = 0\n\n            # We are going to iterate over i from 0 to T-1\n            # For each i, we get the character from A and B\n            for i in range(T):\n                a_char = A_str[i % m]\n                b_char = B_str[i % k]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    losses_B_cycle += 1\n                else:\n                    losses_A_cycle += 1\n\n            cycles = n // T\n            remainder = n % T\n\n            # Now, simulate the first 'remainder' rounds\n            add_A = 0\n            add_B = 0\n            for i in range(remainder):\n                a_char = A_str[i % m]\n                b_char = B_str[i % k]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    add_B += 1\n                else:\n                    add_A += 1\n\n            total_A = cycles * losses_A_cycle + add_A\n            total_B = cycles * losses_B_cycle + add_B\n\n            print(f\"{total_A} {total_B}\")\n\n        Let's run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \n                7\n                RPS\n                RSPP\n\n            Output: 3 2\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input:\n                5\n                RRRRRRRR\n                R\n\n            Output: 0 0\n\n        Example 3: \n            Input: \n                1\n                R\n                S\n\n            Output: 1 0\n\n        Example 4:\n            Input:\n                1\n                S\n                R\n\n            Output: 1 0   (because (S,R) is a win for B, so A loses -> 1 spot for A)\n\n        But wait: in example 4, we have:\n            A='S', B='R': \n                Condition: (S,R) is not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so else: B wins -> so we add to add_A (which is for A's losses) -> correct.\n\n        Example 5:\n            Input:\n                2\n                RS\n                ST   # Actually, let me choose: \n                # Let me use: \n                #   A=\"RS\", B=\"ST\" -> but wait, the strings are given as containing only 'R','S','P'\n\n        But the problem says the strings only contain these three.\n\n        We assume valid input.\n\n        However, note: the example input might have been provided in the example as:\n\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        We read from stdin.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n\n        But note: performance: T is at most 10^6, and remainder is at most T (so 10^6). Then we do two loops of at most 10^6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        However, note: worst-case T=10^6, then the first loop (for the cycle) is 10^6, and the second loop (for remainder) is 10^6, so total operations 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the problem says n can be up to 2e9, but T is at most 10^6, so the cycle computation is O(T) and the remainder is O(remainder) which is <= T, so worst-case 2e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: we are doing two separate loops: one for the entire cycle (T) and one for the remainder (<=T). But we can also combine the two: we can simulate the entire n rounds without having to compute the cycle separately? Actually, no, because we use the cycle to compute the repeated part.\n\n        Alternatively, we can simulate the entire n rounds by iterating from 0 to n-1? But n can be 2e9, so we cannot iterate 2e9 times.\n\n        Our current method breaks the n rounds into cycles and remainder, and the cycle is T (at most 10^6) so we do two loops of at most 10^6.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            A = input().strip()\n            B = input().strip()\n\n            m = len(A)\n            k = len(B)\n\n            def gcd(a, b):\n                while b:\n                    a, b = b, a % b\n                return a\n\n            T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n            # Precompute the entire cycle T rounds\n            losses_A_cycle = 0\n            losses_B_cycle = 0\n\n            for i in range(T):\n                a_char = A[i % m]\n                b_char = B[i % k]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    losses_B_cycle += 1\n                else:\n                    losses_A_cycle += 1\n\n            cycles = n // T\n            rem = n % T\n\n            add_A = 0\n            add_B = 0\n            for i in range(rem):\n                a_char = A[i % m]\n                b_char = B[i % k]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    add_B += 1\n                else:\n                    add_A += 1\n\n            print(cycles * losses_A_cycle + add_A, cycles * losses_B_cycle + add_B)\n\n        Let me test with the examples again.\n\n        Example 1: \n            n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n            T = (3*4)//gcd(3,4)=12//1=12.\n\n            Then we simulate 12 rounds (cycle) and then 7 rounds (remainder). But wait, we don't need to simulate the entire cycle? We only need the cycle counts and then the remainder.\n\n            We computed the cycle counts: \n                losses_A_cycle = 4 (from the 12-round example above) -> but wait, above we computed for 12 rounds and got 4 for A and 4 for B.\n\n            Then for 7 rounds, we simulate the first 7 rounds and got 3 for A and 2 for B.\n\n            Then total_A = (7//12)*4 + 3 = 0*4+3 = 3\n            total_B = (7//12)*4 + 2 = 0*4+2 = 2.\n\n            But wait, above I computed the 12 rounds and got 4 for A and 4 for B, but then the 7 rounds simulation gave 3 for A and 2 for B.\n\n            However, note: the 7 rounds simulation does not use the cycle of 12. It is independent.\n\n            So the code is correct.\n\n        But wait, in the 12-round example we computed manually 4 wins for A and 4 wins for B. However, in the 7 rounds we only had 3 wins for A and 2 wins for B.\n\n        The cycle is fixed: the entire 12 rounds have 4 wins for A and 4 wins for B. Then the first 7 rounds are the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\n        The code correctly counts the first 7 rounds separately.\n\n        However, note: the cycle of 12 rounds is the entire set of residue pairs (mod m, mod k). The first 7 rounds are indeed the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But wait: the example input was:\n\n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        and we got 3 and 2.\n\n        But the cycle we computed for 12 rounds (losses_A_cycle=4, losses_B_cycle=4) is for the entire 12 rounds.\n\n        Then if we do 12 rounds, we get 4 and 4.\n\n        This is consistent.\n\n        One more test: 12 rounds.\n\n            n=12\n            A=\"RPS\"\n            B=\"RSPP\"\n\n            cycles = 12 // 12 = 1\n            remainder = 0\n\n            total_A = 1 * 4 + 0 = 4\n            total_B = 1 * 4 + 0 = 4\n\n        So we output \"4 4",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently computing the result without simulating each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The goal is to count how many times each player loses (i.e., receives a red spot) over `n` rounds.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one full cycle of `LCM(m, k)` rounds and then handling the remaining rounds separately.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in the cycle, determine the winner or if it's a draw. Count the losses for each player during the cycle.\n   - **Efficient Calculation**: Use the cycle counts to compute the total losses over full cycles and then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves iterating over `T = LCM(m, k)` rounds, which is feasible since `m` and `k` are at most 1000, making `T` at most 1,000,000. This ensures the solution is efficient even for large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n    losses_A_cycle = 0\n    losses_B_cycle = 0\n\n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            losses_B_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            losses_A_cycle += 1\n\n    cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n\n    add_A = 0\n    add_B = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            add_B += 1\n        else:\n            add_A += 1\n\n    total_A = cycles * losses_A_cycle + add_A\n    total_B = cycles * losses_B_cycle + add_B\n\n    print(total_A, total_B)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths `m` and `k` determines the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in the cycle `T`, the current moves are determined by the sequences' cyclic nature. The outcome (win, loss, or draw) is evaluated based on the game rules.\n4. **Loss Counting**: The number of losses for each player during the cycle is counted.\n5. **Handling Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total losses are computed by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of full cycles (`n // T`) and adding the losses from the remaining rounds (`n % T`).\n6. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance.",
