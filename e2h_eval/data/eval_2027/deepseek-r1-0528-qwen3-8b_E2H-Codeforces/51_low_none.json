Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is to check two things:\n 1. The total letters in the first two lines (combined) must be exactly the same as the third line (the pile).\n    - That means the multiset of letters in the pile must equal the multiset of letters from the first two lines.\n\n However, note: the problem says there are no extra letters and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\n So we have to use exactly the letters from the first two names (without any extra) to form the pile.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and remove any newline characters.\n 2. Concatenate the first two strings (guest's name and host's name) and compare the sorted list of characters with the sorted list of characters of the third string (the pile).\n\n But note: what if there are spaces? The problem says they contain only uppercase letters and no spaces. \n So we can safely work with the entire string.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n   Combined first two: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n   Third: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n However, wait: the example input is given as a multi-line string but the actual input has three separate lines.\n\n Let's break down the example:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Guest: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Host: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But note: \n        Combined guest and host: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> length 13 + 8 = 21\n        Pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> let's count: S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 20? \n\n   Actually, let me count the combined guest and host:\n\n        SANTACLAUS: 10 letters? Actually, let me write: S A N T A C L A U S -> 10\n        DEDMOROZ: 8 letters: D E D M O R O Z -> 8\n\n        Total: 18 letters.\n\n   And the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 18? Let's count: \n        S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S -> 18.\n\n   So indeed 18 letters.\n\n   But wait, the example output says YES.\n\n   However, the example input representation was given as a string with '\\n' in it. In reality, the input would be:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But note: the example provided in the problem also includes other examples. We must handle all cases.\n\n Approach:\n   Read the three lines, strip them to remove any extraneous whitespace (like newline).\n\n   Then, combine the first two lines (string concatenation) and then compare the sorted version of the combined string and the sorted version of the third string.\n\n   However, we must account for the possibility that the third string might have the same letters but in different order.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Expected: NO\n\n        Why? Because the combined letters of the first two should be the same as the third.\n\n        First two: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Third: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Let's sort the first two: \n            PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI -> sorted: ['A','A','A','E','I','J','L','N','O','O','O','P','P','P','K','U','U','U','U']? Wait, let me do it properly.\n\n        Alternatively, we can just compare the sorted counts.\n\n   Another approach: use frequency counts.\n\n   We can do:\n        s1 = first line\n        s2 = second line\n        s3 = third line\n\n        If sorted(s1+s2) == sorted(s3): YES, else NO.\n\n   But note: the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the total length is at most 200.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the multiset of letters in the pile matches the multiset of letters from the first two input strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** The three lines of input are read and stripped of any extraneous whitespace (like newline characters).\n2. **Combine Names:** The first two strings (guest's name and host's name) are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Check Letter Counts:** The sorted list of characters from the combined names is compared with the sorted list of characters from the pile. If both lists are identical, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the original names; otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the required condition by leveraging sorting to compare the counts of each character in both strings. The solution handles all edge cases, including extra letters or missing letters, by ensuring the character counts match exactly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines of input, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combining Names:** The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string (`combined`).\n3. **Sorting and Comparison:** The characters of the `combined` string and the pile string are sorted alphabetically. If the sorted versions of both strings are identical, it confirms that the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names, allowing them to be rearranged into the original names. The result is printed as \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on this comparison.\n\nThis method ensures that we accurately verify whether the pile can be used to reconstruct the original names without any extra or missing letters. The use of sorting simplifies the comparison process, making the solution both efficient and easy to understand.",
