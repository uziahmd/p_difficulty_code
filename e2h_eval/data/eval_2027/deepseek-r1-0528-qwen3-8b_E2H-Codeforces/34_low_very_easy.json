And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, the average is the sum of the k consecutive days divided by k.\n Then, we are to output the average of these averages? \n\n But note: The example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" has two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n The averages are (3+4)/2 = 3.5 and (4+7)/2 = 5.5. Then, what is the overall average?\n However, note that the problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n Actually, let's read the problem again: \n \"To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration.\"\n\n And then: \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n This means: we have to compute the average of the averages for each week.\n\n But note: There is a simpler way. The overall average over all weeks can be computed by:\n\n total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} [ (a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{i+k-1}) ] / (n-k+1) ?\n\n However, wait: the average for a week i is S_i / k, and then the overall average is (S_0/k + S_1/k + ... + S_{m-1}/k) / m, where m = n-k+1.\n\n Alternatively, we can write: \n   overall_average = (S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{m-1}) / (k * m)\n\n But note: the entire sleep data is used in the sum of the S_i's. How many times is each element a_i used?\n\n Consider an element at position j (0-indexed). It appears in a week starting from index max(0, j-k+1) to min(n-k, j). \n Actually, an element a_j appears in all weeks that start from index i such that i <= j and i >= j-k+1 and i >=0 and i <= n-k.\n\n Alternatively, the element a_j appears in (min(j, n-k) - max(0, j-k+1) + 1) weeks? \n\n But note: the first element a0: appears only in the first week (if k>=1 and j=0, then weeks from 0 to 0, because 0<=j<0+k and j>=0-k+1 -> but j-k+1=-k+1 which is negative, so from 0 to min(n-k, 0) -> just 0). Similarly, the last element a_{n-1}: appears only in the last week (if n-k is the last week index, then j must be >= (n-k)*k? Actually, no).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to compute the sum for each week and then average. But note the constraints: n up to 200,000, so we need an O(n) solution.\n\n Let m = n-k+1, the number of weeks.\n\n Then, the total sum of all weeks is the sum of the first m windows.\n\n We can precompute the prefix sum to quickly calculate the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n, k and the list a.\n 2. Precompute the prefix sum array, say `pref`, where:\n      pref[0] = 0\n      pref[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]\n\n    Then the sum of a week starting at index i (0-indexed) is pref[i+k] - pref[i].\n\n 3. Then, the total sum of all weeks is:\n        total_weeks_sum = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (pref[i+k] - pref[i])\n\n    But note: we can also compute this without the loop by knowing how many times each element is included.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n        total_weeks_sum = 0\n        for i in range(0, n-k+1):\n            total_weeks_sum += (pref[i+k] - pref[i])\n\n 4. Then, the overall average is total_weeks_sum / (k * (n-k+1))\n\n Why? Because we are averaging the averages of each week. The average for week i is (pref[i+k]-pref[i])/k, and then we average these over m weeks: \n        (sum_{i} (pref[i+k]-pref[i])/k) / m = total_weeks_sum / (k * m)\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the total_weeks_sum is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. Each week is defined as a contiguous block of `k` days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks. The goal is to compute the average sleep time across all these weeks efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the average sleep time for each week (a sequence of `k` consecutive days) and then find the overall average of these weekly averages. Given the constraints (n can be up to 200,000), a brute-force approach would be too slow. Instead, we use a sliding window technique with prefix sums to optimize the solution.\n2. **Intuition**: The sum of sleep times for each week can be quickly computed using a prefix sum array. The prefix sum array allows us to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time. Once we have the total sum of all weekly sleep times, dividing by the product of the number of days per week (`k`) and the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) gives the desired average.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct an array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the first `i` elements of the original array. This helps in calculating the sum of any subarray in O(1) time.\n   - **Sliding Window**: Use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of each week's sleep times by subtracting the prefix sums at the start and end of the window.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) for constructing the prefix sum array and O(n) for computing the total sum of all weeks. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the prefix sum array, which is efficient given the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    pref = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    total_weeks_sum = 0\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    for i in range(num_weeks):\n        total_weeks_sum += (pref[i+k] - pref[i])\n        \n    total_days_counted = k * num_weeks\n    average = total_weeks_sum / total_days_counted\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array `pref` is constructed such that `pref[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the sleep times array. This allows efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Total Week Sum Calculation**: For each week (from day 0 to day `k-1`, day 1 to day `k`, etc.), the sum of sleep times is computed using the prefix array. The total sum of all weekly sleep times is accumulated in `total_weeks_sum`.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The overall average is derived by dividing `total_weeks_sum` by the total number of days counted across all weeks (`k * num_weeks`). The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages prefix sums to minimize computation time, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
