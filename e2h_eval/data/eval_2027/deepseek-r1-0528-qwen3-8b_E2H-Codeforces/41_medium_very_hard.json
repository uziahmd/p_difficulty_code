There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: n, h, m and then m lines of [l, r, x]\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities, but note that the restrictions might overlap.\n\n Idea:\n We have to assign a height for each spot from 0 to h (with the condition that in any segment [l_i, r_i] the maximum is <= x_i).\n\n However, note: the restrictions might be conflicting. But the problem states that we must satisfy all restrictions.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can consider that the entire street must satisfy all restrictions. Each restriction i imposes that for every j in [l_i, r_i], house[j] <= x_i.\n\n 2. But note: if two restrictions overlap, then the house at an overlapping spot must be <= the minimum of the x_i's of the restrictions that cover that spot.\n\n 3. However, we also have the global constraint that each house can be at most h.\n\n 4. Therefore, for each spot j, the maximum allowed height is:\n    - Let base = h (the overall maximum)\n    - For each restriction i that covers j (i.e., l_i <= j <= r_i), then house[j] must be <= min(x_i for all such restrictions) but note: actually, we must satisfy the maximum of the restrictions that cover j? Actually, no: each restriction requires that the tallest house in its segment is <= x_i. So if a spot j is covered by multiple restrictions, then house[j] must be <= the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover j? Not necessarily: because one restriction might have a higher x_i and another a lower one. Actually, the condition is: the house j must be at most the minimum of all the x_i values for the restrictions that cover j. Why? Because if there is a restriction that says house j must be <= x_i, then it must be <= that x_i. And if there are multiple, then it must be <= the smallest x_i among them.\n\n 5. But wait: what if two restrictions don't impose independent constraints? Actually, the condition is: for each restriction i, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] <= x_i. This implies that for each j in [l_i, r_i], house[j] <= x_i. Therefore, for a fixed j, house[j] must be <= x_i for every restriction i that includes j. Thus, the maximum allowed at j is the minimum x_i over all restrictions that include j, but also not exceeding h.\n\n 6. However, note: there might be no restriction covering j? Then we use h.\n\n 7. But wait: what if a restriction does not cover j? Then we don't have a direct constraint from that restriction on j. However, the restriction might indirectly constrain j through other houses? Actually, no: the condition for a restriction only constrains the houses in its segment. So for a house j, the only constraints come from the restrictions that explicitly include j.\n\n 8. Therefore, we can precompute for each spot j, the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include j. Let this value be max_allowed[j]. Then we must have 0 <= house[j] <= min(max_allowed[j], h). But note: if there is no restriction covering j, then max_allowed[j] would be infinity? Then we set it to h.\n\n 9. However, is that sufficient? Consider: the condition for a restriction i is that the maximum house in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. If we set each house j to the minimum between h and the maximum x_i of the restrictions that cover j, then for a restriction i, the maximum house in [l_i, r_i] is the maximum of the values we set in that interval. Since each house j in [l_i, r_i] is set to at most x_i (because x_i is one of the restrictions covering j, so our max_allowed[j] is <= x_i), then the condition is satisfied.\n\n 10. But wait: what if we set a house j to a value lower than max_allowed[j]? That is allowed. However, we want to maximize profit. The profit for a house with height a is a^2. Therefore, for each house j, we would like to set it to the maximum allowed value (max_allowed[j]) because the square function is increasing for nonnegative integers. However, note: we cannot set a house to more than max_allowed[j] (which is the minimum x_i of restrictions covering j, but capped at h). But what if by setting a house j to a lower value we could satisfy some other condition? Actually, no: because the only constraints are that house[j] <= max_allowed[j] and the condition for each restriction i is automatically satisfied if each house j in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i (and note that for any j in [l_i, r_i], max_allowed[j] <= x_i). Therefore, the maximum we can set house[j] is max_allowed[j] (if max_allowed[j] <= h) or h otherwise.\n\n 11. But wait: there is a catch. The condition is that the tallest house in a segment [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i. If we set every house j to max_allowed[j] (which is <= x_i for every restriction i that covers j) then the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is at most max{ max_allowed[j] for j in [l_i, r_i] }.\n\n 12. However, note: max_allowed[j] is defined as the minimum x_i for which j is in [l_i, r_i]. But consider: for a restriction i, we require that the maximum house in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. If we set house[j] = max_allowed[j] for every j, then the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is the maximum of { max_allowed[j] for j in [l_i, r_i] }.\n\n 13. Now, is it true that for every j in [l_i, r_i], max_allowed[j] <= x_i? Yes, because for each j in [l_i, r_i], we have that j is in restriction i, so max_allowed[j] <= x_i. Therefore, the maximum over [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\n 14. Therefore, we can set each house j to the maximum allowed value (which is the minimum x_i for restrictions covering j, but capped at h) and get a valid solution.\n\n 15. But wait: is it always optimal to set each house to the maximum allowed value? Since the profit is a^2 and a^2 is increasing with a, yes. So we set house[j] = min(max_allowed[j], h). Then the total profit is the sum of (min(max_allowed[j], h))^2 for j from 1 to n.\n\n 16. However, let me test with the first example:\n\n     Example 1: n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x1=1 -> for spot1: max_allowed[1]=1\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x2=3 -> for spot2: max_allowed[2]=3\n        Restriction3: [3,3] with x3=2 -> for spot3: max_allowed[3]=2\n\n     Then the heights are [1,3,2] and profit = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n     Example 2: n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [2,3] with x1=8 -> affects spots2 and 3: max_allowed[2]=min(8, ...) but initially no other restriction, so 8.\n        Restriction2: [3,4] with x2=7 -> affects spots3 and 4: max_allowed[3]=min(8,7)=7, max_allowed[4]=7.\n\n        Then the heights are [10,8,7,7] -> profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n 17. But wait: why was the first house set to 10? Because the first house is not covered by any restriction, so max_allowed[1] = h = 10.\n\n 18. Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n      Step 1: Precompute an array `max_allowed` of length n (for spots 1 to n) with initial value set to a big number (or None) for each spot.\n\n      Step 2: For each restriction (l, r, x):\n          For each spot j from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed) in the array, update:\n              max_allowed[j] = min(max_allowed[j], x)\n\n      Step 3: Then for each spot j, set the height to min(max_allowed[j], h). Then compute the profit as the sum of (height_j)^2.\n\n 19. However, consider the following: what if a restriction does not cover a spot? Then we leave that spot with the initial big number, and then we cap by h. But what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions? Then we take the minimum x_i. And then we cap by h.\n\n 20. But note: the initial value for max_allowed should be set to something that is larger than h (since x_i can be up to h, and we are taking minimum). However, if we set the initial value to h+1, then the minimum between h+1 and x_i (which is <= h) will be x_i. Then we cap by h: so if x_i <= h, then we use x_i, else we use h? But wait, the problem says x_i is between 0 and h, so we don't need to worry about x_i > h.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can set the initial value for max_allowed to h+1. Then after processing all restrictions, for a spot j that has no restriction, max_allowed[j] remains h+1, so we set it to min(h+1, h) = h.\n\n 22. But note: the problem says x_i can be 0, so we might have a spot j that is covered by a restriction with x_i=0. Then the house must be 0.\n\n 23. Let's do:\n\n        max_allowed = [h+1] * n   (for n spots, 0-indexed)\n\n        For each restriction (l, r, x):\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                    max_allowed[j] = x\n\n        Then for each j, height = min(max_allowed[j], h)   [But wait, if x is less than or equal to h, then we are already capping by x? Actually, no: we are storing the minimum x_i, and then we cap by h. However, if x_i is greater than h, we cap by h. But note: the input says x_i is between 0 and h, so we don't get x_i > h. So we can just set:\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            max_allowed = [h] * n   # but wait, if there is a restriction with x_i < h, then we update to a smaller value.\n\n        However, we must consider that if a spot is not covered by any restriction, we want to use h. But if we start with h and then update only when we see a restriction, then for no-restriction spots we keep h.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            max_allowed = [10**9] * n   # a big number, then take min with h at the end.\n\n        Then after updating with all restrictions, set:\n            height[j] = min(max_allowed[j], h)\n\n 24. But note: the restrictions are independent and we want the minimum x_i that covers j.\n\n 25. However, there is a potential issue: what if a restriction has x_i that is greater than h? The problem states that x_i is between 0 and h, so we don't have to worry.\n\n 26. Therefore, code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        # Initialize an array for the maximum allowed height for each spot, initially set to a big number (greater than h)\n        max_allowed = [10**9] * n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x = int(data[2])\n            # Convert to 0-indexed indices: from l-1 to r-1\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                    max_allowed[j] = x\n\n        # Now, for each spot, the maximum allowed height is min(max_allowed[j], h)\n        total_profit = 0\n        for j in range(n):\n            height_val = min(max_allowed[j], h)\n            total_profit += height_val * height_val\n\n        print(total_profit)\n\n 27. Let me test with the examples.\n\n  Example 1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        max_allowed initially: [10**9, 10**9, 10**9]\n        After first restriction: [1, 10**9, 10**9]\n        After second: [1, 3, 10**9]\n        After third: [1,3,2]\n\n        Then set: \n            spot0: min(1,3)=1 -> 1^2=1\n            spot1: min(3,3)=3 -> 9\n            spot2: min(2,3)=2 -> 4\n            Total: 1+9+4=14 -> correct.\n\n  Example 2:\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: [2,3,8], [3,4,7]\n\n        max_allowed initially: [10**9,10**9,10**9,10**9]\n        After first: [10**9,8,8,10**9]\n        After second: [10**9,8,7,7]\n\n        Then set: \n            spot0: min(10**9,10)=10 -> 100\n            spot1: 8 -> 64\n            spot2: 7 -> 49\n            spot3: 7 -> 49\n            Total: 100+64+49+49 = 262 -> correct.\n\n 28. However, wait: what if there are multiple restrictions and the same spot is covered by two restrictions, one with x_i=5 and one with x_i=3? Then we set to 3, which is correct.\n\n 29. But wait: what if a restriction is given with x_i=0? Then the house must be 0. Then the profit for that house is 0. That is acceptable.\n\n 30. However, consider the following: is it possible that by lowering one house we can relax the constraints on adjacent houses? \n\n     Let me think: the constraints are independent per segment. The condition for a segment [l_i, r_i] is that the maximum in that segment is <= x_i. If we set a house to a value lower than the maximum allowed, then the condition for the segments that cover that house is still satisfied. Moreover, the condition for segments that do not cover that house is independent. \n\n     But note: the condition for a segment is that the maximum is <= x_i. Therefore, we cannot set a house to a value that is too high (above the restrictions) but we can set it arbitrarily low. \n\n     However, the goal is to maximize the profit, and since the profit is the square of the height, we want each house to be as high as possible. Therefore, for each house, we set it to the maximum allowed by the restrictions (which is the minimum x_i for the restrictions covering it, but not exceeding h). \n\n     But wait: what if two restrictions that do not cover the same house interact through a segment condition? \n\n     Example: Consider two restrictions that do not cover the same house, but they overlap in a way that if we set one house too high, then a segment condition might be violated by the combination. However, note: each restriction condition is local to its segment. \n\n     Actually, the above reasoning is correct because we are ensuring that every house is set to a value that is <= every x_i of the restrictions that cover it. Then for any segment [l_i, r_i], every house in that segment is <= x_i (by the definition of max_allowed for each house). Therefore, the maximum in the segment is <= x_i.\n\n     However, consider a different scenario: \n\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x1=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x2=3\n\n        Then for both houses, we set to min(3,10)=3. Then the maximum in [1,2] is 3 which is <=5 and <=3, so both conditions are satisfied.\n\n     But what if we set the first house to 3 and the second house to 3? Then the maximum is 3, which satisfies both. \n\n     Now, what if we set the first house to 2 and the second house to 3? Then the maximum is 3, still satisfies both. But the profit is 2^2+3^2=4+9=13, whereas if we set both to 3 we get 9+9=18. So we want the maximum.\n\n     Therefore, the above method sets each house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions (the minimum x_i that covers it). This is indeed the maximum we can set each house individually.\n\n 31. But wait: what if a segment condition is enforced by having the maximum in the entire segment, and we set a house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions, but then the maximum in the segment might be limited by a lower house elsewhere? \n\n     Actually, no: the condition for the segment is that the maximum is <= x_i. If we set every house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions (which is the minimum x_i for the restrictions that cover that house) then for a segment [l_i, r_i], the maximum house in that segment is the maximum of the values we set. Since each house j in [l_i, r_i] is set to at most x_i (because x_i is one of the restrictions covering j), then the entire segment's maximum is <= x_i.\n\n     However, consider: what if a house is covered by a restriction with a very low x_i, but then if we set that house to that low value, and then a neighboring house is set to a higher value (but still within the restrictions that cover it) but that higher value is not allowed by the first restriction? \n\n     Example: \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x1=2\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x2=5\n        Restriction3: [1,2] with x3=4   (this is not given, but note: the condition for the entire segment [1,2] must be <=4, but we have a house1=2 and house2=5, then the maximum is 5 which violates the third restriction.)\n\n     Wait, but in the above example, we did not account for the third restriction. The problem says there are m restrictions. In the above, if we have three restrictions, then the third restriction [1,2] with x3=4 would require that the maximum in [1,2] is <=4. Then the house2 must be <=4. But our method sets house2 to min(5,10)=5, which violates the third restriction.\n\n     Therefore, we must account for all restrictions. The above method only considers the minimum x_i for the restrictions that cover the individual houses. But note: the third restriction is a separate restriction that covers house2, so when processing the third restriction, we would set house2 to min(5,4)=4. Then house1 is set to min(2,10)=2, and house2 to min(4,10)=4. Then the maximum in [1,2] is 4, which is <=4. \n\n     However, in the example above, the third restriction was given. The method uses all restrictions. So if there is a restriction [1,2] with x3=4, then during the third restriction update, we set both house1 and house2 to at most 4. \n\n     But wait: house1 is already set to 2 by the first restriction, and the third restriction would set house1 to min(2,4)=2. Similarly, house2 is set to min(5,4)=4.\n\n     Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n 32. However, note that the example I constructed had three restrictions. The problem input gives m restrictions and we process all of them. The method above processes all restrictions.\n\n 33. But wait, what if we have two restrictions that together imply a constraint that is not captured by the individual constraints on each house?\n\n     Example: \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x1=3\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x2=4\n\n        Then for house1: min(3,4)=3, for house2: min(3,4)=3. Then the maximum in [1,2] is 3, which is <=3 and <=4. So both are satisfied.\n\n     Another example: \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x1=3\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x2=3\n        Restriction3: [1,2] with x3=2\n\n        Then for house1: min(3,2)=2, house2: min(3,2)=2. Then the maximum in [1,2] is 2, which is <=2, and the individual restrictions: house1<=3 and house2<=3 are satisfied.\n\n 34. Therefore, the solution is to:\n\n        Read n, h, m.\n        Initialize an array `max_allowed` of n elements, each set to a big number (like 10**9).\n        For each of the m restrictions:\n            l, r, x = map(int, line.split())\n            For j from l-1 to r-1 (inclusive):\n                if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                    max_allowed[j] = x\n\n        Then for each j, set height = min(max_allowed[j], h) and add height^2.\n\n        Print the sum.\n\n 35. But wait: what if a restriction has x_i that is negative? The problem says x_i is between 0 and h, so no.\n\n 36. However, note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the constraints say x_i from 0 to h. So we are safe.\n\n 37. Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: Input \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\" -> Output 14.\n        Example 2: Input \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\" -> Output 262.\n\n 38. But wait: the example input format in the problem is:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        However, the problem reads from stdin. We are reading the first line, then the next m lines.\n\n 39. But wait: what if there are multiple restrictions and the same spot is updated multiple times? Our update is taking the minimum, so we are effectively computing the tightest restriction (lowest x_i) that covers the spot.\n\n 40. However, consider: the problem says the restrictions are given independently. We must satisfy all. So the house must be <= the minimum x_i of all restrictions covering it.\n\n 41. Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n 42. But wait: what if we have two restrictions that cover the same spot, one with x_i=5 and one with x_i=3? Then the house must be <=3. Our code will update the spot to 3 (if we process the 3 first) or to 5 then update to 3 (if we process the 5 first then the 3). So the order of processing doesn't matter.\n\n 43. Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n 44. However, note: the problem says the restrictions are independent and we must satisfy all. Our method ensures that.\n\n 45. One more edge: if there are no restrictions (m=0). Then we set all houses to h. Then profit = n * h^2.\n\n     Example: n=2, h=3, m=0 -> profit= 3^2+3^2=18.\n\n 46. But wait: what if h is 0? Then we set all houses to 0, profit=0.\n\n 47. Given the constraints (n, h, m >=1, but note: the problem says m>=1? Actually, the problem says \"There are m zoning restrictions\", and m>=1 because the input first line gives m (and m>=1). But the problem statement says \"m (1 ≤ n,h,m ≤ 50)\" so m>=1. So we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n 48. However, the problem says \"m (1 ≤ ... ≤ 50)\", meaning m can be from 1 to 50, so no need for m=0.\n\n 49. Code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        max_allowed = [10**9] * n   # initialize with a big number\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l = int(data[0])\n            r = int(data[1])\n            x = int(data[2])\n            # update the segment [l-1:r] (0-indexed)\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                    max_allowed[j] = x\n\n        total = 0\n        for j in range(n):\n            # We must not exceed h\n            if max_allowed[j] > h:\n                height_val = h\n            else:\n                height_val = max_allowed[j]\n            # But wait: we set max_allowed[j] to the minimum x_i (which is <=h) or the big number. Then we cap by h. Actually, we can do:\n            # height_val = min(max_allowed[j], h)\n            total += height_val * height_val\n\n        print(total)\n\n 50. Alternatively, we can simply do:\n\n        total = 0\n        for j in range(n):\n            height_val = min(max_allowed[j], h)\n            total += height_val * height_val\n\n 51. But note: if we set max_allowed[j] to 10**9 (big) and h is 50, then min(10**9,50)=50.\n\n 52. Since n, h, m are small (<=50), we can do this.\n\n 53. However, wait: what if the big number is too big? It doesn't matter because we are taking min with h.\n\n 54. Let's run the provided examples.\n\n  Example1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n        max_allowed becomes [1,3,2] -> then [min(1,3)=1, min(3,3)=3, min(2,3)=2] -> 1+9+4=14.\n\n  Example2:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        max_allowed becomes [10**9,8,7,7] -> then [min(10**9,10)=10, 8,7,7] -> 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n 55. Submit.\n\n 56. But wait: consider the following example where a restriction has x_i that is greater than h? The problem says x_i is between 0 and h, so we don't have to worry. But if we do, then we cap by h anyway.\n\n 57. However, note: the problem says \"0 <= x_i <= h\", so we are safe.\n\n 58. But wait: what if we have a restriction that covers a spot and x_i is 0? Then we set that spot to 0.\n\n 59. Example: n=1, h=5, m=1: [1,1,0] -> profit=0.\n\n 60. This is correct.\n\n 61. Final code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        max_allowed = [10**9] * n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                    max_allowed[j] = x\n\n        total_profit = 0\n        for j in range(n):\n            height_val = min(max_allowed[j], h)\n            total_profit += height_val * height_val\n\n        print(total_profit)\n\n 62. But wait: the problem says the first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines. We are reading m lines.\n\n 63. However, the sample input is given as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n     But when running, we read from stdin. So if we are given two test cases, we need to read until EOF? \n\n     The problem says: \"You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\"\n\n     And the input format is as described.\n\n     However, note: the problem does not specify multiple test cases. The first line is the first test case, then the next m lines. Then the next test case? Or is there only one test case?\n\n     Looking at the example input: it is given as two strings in a list, but in reality, the input is one test case.\n\n     The problem says: \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\"\n\n     So we assume one test case.\n\n 64. But wait, the example input is provided as two examples. However, the problem says:\n\n        Input:\n          ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        Output:\n          ['14', '262']\n\n     This suggests that the example input is two separate test cases? But the problem statement says:\n\n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m.\n\n     Then m lines.\n\n     So if there are two test cases, the input would be:\n\n        3 3 3\n        1 1 1\n        2 2 3\n        3 3 2\n        4 10 2\n        2 3 8\n        3 4 7\n\n     But wait, the problem says \"There are m zoning restrictions\", and m is given in the first line. So the entire input is one test case.\n\n     However, the example output is two numbers. \n\n     Let me check the problem statement again: \n\n        Example Input:\n            ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        Example Output:\n            ['14', '262']\n\n     This formatting is confusing. Actually, the example input is provided as two separate test cases, but the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n     But note: the constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and m restrictions. There is no indication of multiple test cases.\n\n     However, the example input is given as two strings. How should we interpret?\n\n     Looking at the problem statement: \n\n        \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n        Then it shows the input and output.\n\n     But the input format is:\n\n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m (1 ≤ n,h,m ≤ 50)\n\n        Each of the next m lines contains three integers l_i, r_i, x_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, 0 ≤ x_i ≤ h)\n\n     This means that the entire input is one test case.\n\n     But the example output is two integers, one for each test case. \n\n     Wait, the example input is provided as two separate strings. This might be a representation of two test cases. However, the problem does not say there are multiple test cases.\n\n     Clarification: the problem says \"Print a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\"\n\n     So we are to output one integer per test case. But the input format description does not mention multiple test cases.\n\n     Since the constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and the input format is fixed, we assume one test case.\n\n     However, the example input is provided as two test cases. This is likely a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n     But the problem says:\n\n        Input:\n          ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        Output:\n          ['14', '262']\n\n     This might be intended to show two examples. \n\n     How should we handle multiple test cases?\n\n     The problem does not specify. But note: the constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and the input format is one test case.\n\n     However, the example input is two test cases. \n\n     I re-read the problem: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. \n\n     Since the problem does not specify the number of test cases, and the input format is fixed (one test case), we assume one test case.\n\n     But the example input is two test cases. This is confusing.\n\n     After reading the problem statement again: \n\n        \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m (1 ≤ n,h,m ≤ 50) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.\"\n\n        Then m lines.\n\n     So the input is one test case.\n\n     However, the example input is given as two strings. This is just for illustration of two examples.\n\n     Therefore, we write the code for one test case.\n\n 65. But wait: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then provides two examples. \n\n     The competition problem might have multiple test cases. However, the constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and the input format is fixed. \n\n     Let me check: the problem statement says \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" (singular).\n\n     And the example input is two separate examples.\n\n     Actually, the problem might be designed to have multiple test cases. But the input format does not specify how many test cases.\n\n     Since the problem statement does not specify, and the constraints are small, we must ask for clarification.\n\n     However, the problem says: \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\", so if we are to process multiple test cases, then the first line would be the first test case's n, h, m, then the next m lines, then the next test case's n, h, m, etc.\n\n     But wait, the constraints say n, h, m from 1 to 50, and the input format is fixed.\n\n     But the example input is provided as two separate test cases in one string. \n\n     I think the problem intended to provide two separate test cases. \n\n     How to handle?\n\n     Since the problem does not specify, but the example output is two numbers, we must assume that there can be multiple test cases.\n\n     But the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases. \n\n     In competitive programming, if the problem does not specify the number of test cases, we assume one.\n\n     However, the example input is two. \n\n     Let me check the constraints: n, h, m from 1 to 50. The total number of restrictions is m (<=50) and n<=50.\n\n     We can read until EOF. The problem says \"Each of the next m lines\", so we read m lines after the first line.\n\n     But if there are multiple test cases, then the input starts with n, h, m, then m lines, then the next test case's n, h, m, then m lines, and so on.\n\n     However, the problem statement does not say that.\n\n     Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example input is two test cases, I decide to read until EOF and process each test case.\n\n    ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. Each house's height must comply with all restrictions that apply to its spot, and the overall goal is to choose the highest possible heights for each house within these constraints to maximize the profit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the maximum height for each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height. The profit is maximized by setting each house's height as high as possible within the constraints imposed by all relevant restrictions.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house at position `j`, the maximum allowable height is the minimum value among all the restrictions that include this position. This is because each restriction requiring the house to be no taller than a certain value must be satisfied, so the house cannot exceed the smallest of these values.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Initialization**: Start by initializing an array `max_allowed` where each element is set to a very large number (indicating no restrictions initially).\n   - **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the `max_allowed` array to reflect the minimum height constraint for each position in the specified range.\n   - **Height Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, for each position, the allowable height is the minimum between the `max_allowed` value and the global maximum height `h`.\n   - **Profit Calculation**: Sum the squares of the allowable heights for all positions to get the maximum profit.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, updating each position in its range. With `n` positions and `m` restrictions, the complexity is O(m * n), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it))\n    h = int(next(it))\n    m = int(next(it))\n    \n    max_allowed = [10**9] * n\n    \n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(next(it))\n        r = int(next(it))\n        x = int(next(it))\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                max_allowed[j] = x\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for j in range(n):\n        height_val = min(max_allowed[j], h)\n        total_profit += height_val * height_val\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first three values are `n` (number of spots), `h` (maximum height per house), and `m` (number of restrictions).\n2. **Initialization**: The `max_allowed` array is initialized with a large number (10^9) to represent no restrictions initially.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the `max_allowed` array to the minimum value between the current restriction's height and the existing value for each position in the specified range.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, each position's height is set to the minimum of its `max_allowed` value and the global maximum height `h`. The profit is the sum of the squares of these heights.\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures all constraints are met while maximizing the profit by leveraging simple array operations and arithmetic calculations.",
