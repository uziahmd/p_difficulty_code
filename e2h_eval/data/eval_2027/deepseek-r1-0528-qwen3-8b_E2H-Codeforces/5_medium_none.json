Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n, and two strings l and r of length n.\n We need to form pairs (one left boot, one right boot) such that:\n   - The colors are compatible: \n        ('?', '?') -> compatible\n        ('x', 'x') -> compatible\n        ('?', 'x') -> compatible\n        ('x', '?') -> compatible\n   - Each boot can be used at most once.\n\n However, note: the problem is to compute the maximum number of compatible pairs and then output those pairs.\n\n Approach:\n\n We have two strings, l and r, each of length n.\n\n We can think of two types of boots:\n   1. Boots with a specific color (non '?')\n   2. Boots with '?' (indefinite)\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that we want as many pairs as possible. The maximum number of pairs is at most n.\n\n 2. We can break the problem into two parts:\n    a. Matching the fixed-color boots (both left and right) that are compatible.\n    b. Using the '?' boots to fill in the remaining compatible pairs.\n\n However, note that a '?' in one side can match any color (including fixed ones and even '?') but we must use each boot only once.\n\n We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Use greedy matching for fixed colors and then use the remaining '?' to match arbitrarily.\n\n But note: sometimes we can use a '?' to match a fixed color or another '?'. And we want the maximum.\n\n However, the problem is similar to bipartite matching. But note n can be up to 150000, so we cannot use general bipartite matching (like Hopcroft–Karp or DFS based) because of the size.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Since each '?' can match any color, we can first try to match the fixed-color boots (i.e., non '?') and then use the '?' as wildcards.\n\n Steps:\n\n Step 1: Count the frequency of each fixed color in left and right.\n\n However, note: the same fixed color might appear multiple times and we can pair them if they are the same.\n\n But also, we have two separate lists: left and right.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Let L_fixed = list of indices i where l[i] != '?'\n   Let R_fixed = list of indices i where r[i] != '?'\n\n Then, we can consider matching fixed colors by their letter.\n\n However, we also have the '?' which can be used to match any. But note: if we use a '?' from left, it can match any right (including fixed and '?'), and vice versa.\n\n We want the maximum matching.\n\n We can think of:\n\n   Let total_fixed_left = {letter: count} for l_fixed\n   Let total_fixed_right = {letter: count} for r_fixed\n\n Then, the maximum fixed matching for a letter c is min(total_fixed_left[c], total_fixed_right[c]). But wait: we are not forced to use all fixed boots? Actually, we can use fixed boots only if they match.\n\n However, note: we can also use a '?' to match a fixed boot. But we want the maximum.\n\n So, the idea:\n\n   Step 1: First, we will try to match as many fixed boots as possible.\n\n   But note: we can use a '?' in one side to match a fixed boot on the other side? Actually, no: because the '?' can match any, so we can use a '?' to match a fixed boot. However, we are trying to maximize the total pairs.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   We have two sets: \n      Left: [fixed colors and '?']\n      Right: [fixed colors and '?']\n\n   We can break the left boots into:\n      L_specific = [color for color in l if color != '?']\n      L_wild = [index for index, color in enumerate(l) if color == '?']\n\n   Similarly, R_specific = [color for color in r if color != '?']\n   R_wild = [index for index, color in enumerate(r) if color == '?']\n\n   Now, we can form pairs from:\n\n     a. Fixed vs Fixed: if the colors match.\n     b. Fixed vs Wild: always (if the fixed is from the opposite side, but note: if we use a fixed left and a wild right, then the wild right can be used for any left, and vice versa).\n\n   However, we also have wild vs wild: which can be used arbitrarily.\n\n   But note: we want the maximum matching. The total matching cannot exceed n.\n\n   We can do:\n\n     Let M = n (the maximum pairs we can form)\n\n     We can use wildcards to cover unmatched fixed boots, but also we can use wildcards to cover unmatched wild boots.\n\n   Actually, we can use wildcards to cover any remaining boots. However, we have to be careful: we have two kinds of boots.\n\n   Alternate approach (greedy):\n\n   We can use two phases:\n\n   Phase 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots.\n\n     We can create a graph for fixed boots: but note the entire set of fixed boots has up to 150000 nodes. But the letters are only 26, so we can group by letter.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     Let's create a dictionary for left fixed boots: mapping from color to list of indices (or just count, but we need the indices for output)\n     Similarly for right fixed boots.\n\n     Then, for each color c that appears in both left and right fixed boots, we can match min(count_left[c], count_right[c]) pairs.\n\n     But note: we cannot use the same boot twice, and we are going to use these matched boots and mark them as used.\n\n   Phase 2: Use wildcards to match the remaining boots.\n\n     After using Phase 1, we have:\n\n        remaining_left = all left boots (with fixed color) that were not matched, plus all left wildcards (because wildcards haven't been used yet).\n        remaining_right = all right boots (with fixed color) that were not matched, plus all right wildcards.\n\n     Now, we can match the remaining_left and remaining_right arbitrarily because:\n\n        - A fixed color in the remaining_left can be matched with any right (since wildcards are flexible and even the remaining fixed colors in right might be of any color, but we don't care because we can use wildcards to cover mismatches? Actually, no: we can use the wildcards to cover any, and also the remaining fixed colors in the opposite side: but wait, if we have a fixed left boot and a fixed right boot of different colors, we cannot match them unless we use a wildcard? Actually, no: we cannot use two wildcards for one pair. \n\n     Actually, the catch is: we have two sets of remaining boots: one set (left) and one set (right). We can match any left boot (whether fixed or wildcard) with any right boot (whether fixed or wildcard) because:\n\n        - If the left is fixed, then the right can be either fixed or wildcard: \n            * If the right is fixed, then they must be the same color? Not necessarily: because the left is fixed and the right is fixed, then they must be the same. But wait, we already did the fixed matching? Actually, no: we only matched fixed boots of the same color. The remaining fixed boots are those that didn't find a match of the same color. However, we cannot match two fixed boots of different colors.\n\n        - But wait, we can use wildcards to bridge? Actually, no: because the problem says that a fixed color must be matched with the same fixed color or a wildcard. However, note: the wildcard can be used for any, but the fixed color must be matched with the same color OR a wildcard. So if we have a fixed left 'a' and a fixed right 'b', they are not compatible. But if we have a left fixed 'a' and a right wildcard, that is compatible. Similarly, if we have a left wildcard and a right fixed 'b', that is compatible.\n\n     However, in our Phase 1, we matched only same fixed colors. Then, the remaining fixed boots are those that did not find a same-color match. These remaining fixed boots can be matched with wildcards (on the opposite side). Also, the wildcards on the opposite side can be used to match these fixed boots.\n\n     But note: we can also use a wildcard from the left to match a fixed boot on the right (which is of a color that the left fixed doesn't have). Similarly, we can use wildcards to match between two sides arbitrarily.\n\n     Therefore, after Phase 1, we have:\n\n        Let L_remaining = (all left boots that are fixed and not matched) + (all left wildcards)\n        Let R_remaining = (all right boots that are fixed and not matched) + (all right wildcards)\n\n     Now, the problem reduces to: we have two sets of indices (from left and right) and we can form a complete bipartite graph between them. But note: we cannot use a left wildcard to match a right wildcard if there are fixed boots available? Actually, we want maximum matching. Since the graph is complete (any left node can connect to any right node), then we can match all the remaining_left and remaining_right? \n\n     However, the total number of pairs we can form is limited by the total remaining boots (min(|remaining_left|, |remaining_right|)). But note: we have to use distinct indices.\n\n     But wait: we have two separate sets: left_remaining and right_remaining. We can form a matching of size = min(|left_remaining|, |right_remaining|). However, we must ensure that we don't use more than the available boots.\n\n     However, note: we started with n left and n right. In Phase 1, we matched some fixed boots. Then the remaining_left is (n - (# fixed left used)) + (# wild left) and similarly for right.\n\n     Actually, the total number of boots we can use in Phase 2 is min(remaining_left_count, remaining_right_count). And that is the maximum total pairs.\n\n     So total pairs = (# matched in Phase 1) + min(remaining_left_count, remaining_right_count)\n\n     But wait: is that correct? Let me check:\n\n        Total pairs = min(n, ...) but actually, we are not limited by n because we are matching one-to-one. Actually, the maximum pairs is at most n, and we are breaking it into:\n\n          fixed_matches = sum_{c} min(count_left_fixed[c], count_right_fixed[c])\n\n          Then, the remaining boots (both fixed and wild) are:\n\n            remaining_left = n - fixed_matches_left_used   [but note: we used some fixed boots, but the wild ones are untouched]\n\n          Actually, we have:\n\n            fixed_matches_left_used = sum_{c} min(count_left_fixed[c], count_right_fixed[c])\n            fixed_matches_right_used = same.\n\n          But wait, the fixed_matches_left_used should equal fixed_matches_right_used (because we are matching one left fixed to one right fixed). Let M0 = fixed_matches.\n\n          Then, the remaining fixed left boots = (total fixed left) - M0, and remaining fixed right boots = (total fixed right) - M0.\n\n          Then, the remaining_left_count = (total fixed left - M0) + (# wild left)\n          Similarly, remaining_right_count = (total fixed right - M0) + (# wild right)\n\n          Then, the total pairs we can form in Phase 2 is min(remaining_left_count, remaining_right_count) = min(n - M0 + (# wild left)? Wait, no: because total fixed left is (# fixed left) and wild left is (# wild left), so total left boots is n = (# fixed left) + (# wild left). Similarly for right.\n\n          Then, remaining_left_count = (# fixed left - M0) + (# wild left) = (n - (# wild left)) - M0 + (# wild left) = n - M0.\n          Similarly, remaining_right_count = n - M0.\n\n          Therefore, the maximum pairs we can form in Phase 2 is n - M0.\n\n          Then, total pairs = M0 + (n - M0) = n? \n\n        This cannot be because we are not forced to use all the boots. Actually, we are forming pairs until we run out of one side.\n\n        But note: we have two sides, each of n boots. We are going to form at most n pairs.\n\n        However, wait: in Phase 1 we matched M0 pairs. Then, we have 2*(n-M0) boots remaining (each side has n-M0 boots remaining). Then, we can form up to n-M0 pairs from these.\n\n        So total pairs = M0 + (n - M0) = n.\n\n        But is that always the case? \n\n        Example: \n          n=1, l=\"a\", r=\"b\": \n            Phase 1: M0 = 0 (no same fixed color match)\n            Then, remaining_left_count = 1, remaining_right_count = 1 -> we can form 1 pair.\n\n          Example: \n          n=1, l=\"a\", r=\"?\": \n            Phase 1: M0=0, then Phase 2: we can form 1 pair.\n\n        So the maximum pairs is always n? \n\n        But wait, the example input: \n          Input: \"10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree\" -> but wait, the example output is 5.\n\n        So wait, the example input is:\n\n          Input: \n            10\n            codeforces\n            dodivthree\n\n        Actually, the example input provided in the problem statement is:\n\n          ['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n        And the outputs are:\n\n          ['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1'], \n          ['5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2'], \n          ['0'], \n          ['10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\n        So the maximum pairs is not always n? \n\n        Actually, let me check the first example:\n\n          Input: \n            n=10\n            l = \"codeforces\"\n            r = \"dodivthree\"\n\n          How many pairs?\n\n          We are told the answer is 5.\n\n        Why not 10? Because the problem does not say we must use all boots. It says \"maximum number of compatible pairs\". \n\n        But wait, in the example, we have 10 left boots and 10 right boots. The maximum pairs we can form is 10, but the example output is 5.\n\n        There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n\n          \"Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.\"\n\n        And the example: \n          Input: \n            10\n            codeforces\n            dodivthree\n\n        Output: \n          5\n\n        So the maximum is 5, meaning we cannot form 10 pairs.\n\n        Why? \n\n        The example: \n          l = \"codeforces\", r = \"dodivthree\"\n\n        Let me write them:\n\n          l: c o d e f o r c e s   -> but wait, the string is \"codeforces\", which has 10 characters: \n            c, o, d, e, f, o, r, c, e, s\n\n          r: d o d i v t h r e e   -> wait, \"dodivthree\" has 10 characters: \n            d, o, d, i, v, t, h, r, e, e\n\n        Now, let's see: \n\n          We can form a pair if the two boots have the same color or if one is '?' (but there are no '?' here). \n\n          So we require the same color.\n\n          Let's count the frequency:\n\n          Left: \n            c:2, o:2, d:1, e:2, f:1, r:1, s:1\n\n          Right:\n            d:2, o:1, i:1, v:1, t:1, h:1, r:1, e:2\n\n          Now, we can form:\n\n            For 'c': left has 2, right has 0 -> 0\n            For 'o': left has 2, right has 1 -> 1\n            For 'd': left has 1, right has 2 -> 1\n            For 'e': left has 2, right has 2 -> 2\n            For 'f': 0\n            For 'r': 1 (left) and 1 (right) -> 1\n            For 's': 0\n            For 'i','v','t','h': 0\n\n          Then, fixed matching (same color) is 1 (for 'o') + 1 (for 'd') + 2 (for 'e') + 1 (for 'r') = 5.\n\n          Then, why can we not form 10? Because we have 10 boots on each side, but we can only form 5 pairs? \n\n        But wait, the problem says: a boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n        So we are forming 5 pairs, and we use 5 left boots and 5 right boots. The other 5 boots are left unpaired.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum pairs is 5.\n\n        So the above reasoning was wrong: we cannot form n pairs necessarily.\n\n        Correction:\n\n          In Phase 1, we match as many fixed boots (non '?') as possible by color. Then, the remaining boots (both fixed and wild) can be matched arbitrarily, but note: we have two sets: left_remaining and right_remaining, and we can form at most min(|left_remaining|, |right_remaining|) pairs from these.\n\n        However, wait: the fixed boots that are left unmatched are still fixed, and they can only be matched with a right boot that is either fixed (of the same color) or wildcard? But we already matched the same fixed color. The unmatched fixed boots are those that didn't find a match of the same color. They can be matched with a wildcard on the right (if available) or with a wildcard on the left (if the other side has a wildcard). \n\n        But note: we have two sets: left_remaining and right_remaining. The left_remaining includes fixed boots that are unmatched and wildcards from left. Similarly, right_remaining includes fixed boots that are unmatched and wildcards from right.\n\n        Now, when we match the remaining, we can match:\n\n          - A left fixed boot (say color 'a') with a right wildcard -> valid.\n          - A left wildcard with a right fixed boot (say color 'a') -> valid.\n          - A left wildcard with a right wildcard -> valid.\n\n        And also, we can match a left fixed boot (say color 'a') with a right fixed boot (say color 'b') if we had wildcards? No, because the problem requires the colors to be compatible. Two fixed boots must be the same. So we cannot match two fixed boots of different colors.\n\n        Therefore, the remaining fixed boots (unmatched) can only be matched with wildcards (on the opposite side). \n\n        But wait, what if we have two unmatched fixed boots of the same color? Then we could match them together? But then we should have matched them in Phase 1. So no, in Phase 1 we matched all same-color fixed boots. So the unmatched fixed boots are of different colors (or maybe same color but we ran out of the opposite side). Actually, no: we matched min(count_left_fixed[c], count_right_fixed[c]) for each color c. So the unmatched fixed boots for color c are:\n\n            left_unmatched_fixed[c] = count_left_fixed[c] - min(count_left_fixed[c], count_right_fixed[c])\n            right_unmatched_fixed[c] = count_right_fixed[c] - min(count_left_fixed[c], count_right_fixed[c])\n\n        So for each color c, we have left_unmatched_fixed[c] and right_unmatched_fixed[c] that are either 0 or the leftover from the side that had more.\n\n        Now, the key: the unmatched fixed boots (both left and right) can only be matched if there is a wildcard on the opposite side? \n\n        Actually, no: two unmatched fixed boots of the same color can be matched together if there are no wildcards? But wait, we already matched as many as the minimum. The leftover is the excess. For example, if we have left: [a, a, a] and right: [a, a], then we matched 2 pairs (using 2 left and 2 right). Then we have one left fixed 'a' and two right fixed 'a'? Actually, no: we matched 2, so we used 2 left and 2 right. Then we have 1 left fixed 'a' and 0 right fixed 'a' (because we used all right fixed 'a'). Then the left fixed 'a' cannot be matched with a right fixed 'a' (there isn't one). But it can be matched with a right wildcard.\n\n        Similarly, if we have left: [a, a] and right: [a, a, a], then we matched 2 (min(2,3)=2). Then we have 0 left fixed 'a' and 1 right fixed 'a'. This right fixed 'a' cannot be matched with a left fixed 'a' (because none left) so it must be matched with a left wildcard.\n\n        Therefore, the unmatched fixed boots (left and right) must be matched with the opposite side's wildcards.\n\n        However, we have a limited number of wildcards.\n\n        So, we have:\n\n          Let M0 = fixed_matches (from same color)\n\n          Then, the unmatched fixed boots:\n\n            left_unmatched_fixed = total_fixed_left - M0   [but note: M0 is the total fixed matches, and each fixed match uses one left fixed and one right fixed]\n            right_unmatched_fixed = total_fixed_right - M0\n\n          Then, we have wildcards:\n\n            left_wildcards = Wl (number of '?' in l)\n            right_wildcards = Wr (number of '?' in r)\n\n          Now, the remaining boots are:\n\n            left_remaining = left_unmatched_fixed + Wl\n            right_remaining = right_unmatched_fixed + Wr\n\n          And we can form at most min(left_remaining, right_remaining) pairs in the second phase.\n\n          But note: we have a constraint: the unmatched fixed boots must be matched with wildcards (from the opposite side). \n\n          Specifically:\n\n            The left_unmatched_fixed can only be matched with right boots that are either unmatched fixed (but wait, no: because if we match two unmatched fixed boots (same color) then we should have matched them in Phase 1) -> so actually, we cannot match two unmatched fixed boots of the same color? \n\n          Let me clarify: \n\n            In Phase 1, we matched as many same-color fixed boots as possible. Therefore, the unmatched fixed boots are those that, for each color, we have the leftover from the side that had more. \n\n            Now, if we try to match two unmatched fixed boots of the same color (say color 'a') from left and right, then we would be matching a left fixed 'a' and a right fixed 'a'. But we already did that in Phase 1 until we exhausted the smaller side. So there should be no same-color unmatched fixed boots? \n\n          Actually, no: because we did per color. For a given color, we matched min(count_left_fixed[c], count_right_fixed[c]). Then the unmatched fixed boots for that color are the excess. But if there is an excess on the left, then we have left fixed 'a' that cannot be matched with a right fixed 'a' (because we used all the right fixed 'a'). Similarly, if there is an excess on the right, then we have right fixed 'a' that cannot be matched with a left fixed 'a'.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot match two unmatched fixed boots of the same color together because there are no fixed boots of the same color on the opposite side. \n\n          So the unmatched fixed boots (both left and right) must be matched with wildcards (from the opposite side). \n\n          However, we also have the possibility to match unmatched fixed boots of different colors? \n\n          Example: left fixed 'a' and right fixed 'b' -> not compatible. So no.\n\n          Therefore, the matching in Phase 2 must satisfy:\n\n            - Each left unmatched fixed boot must be matched with a right wildcard (because we cannot match it with a right fixed boot of a different color, and we don't have enough of the same color on the right).\n            - Similarly, each right unmatched fixed boot must be matched with a left wildcard.\n\n          But note: we can also match two wildcards together.\n\n          So the constraints for Phase 2:\n\n            Let X = left_unmatched_fixed   (these must be matched with right wildcards)\n            Let Y = right_unmatched_fixed  (these must be matched with left wildcards)\n\n            Then, the maximum number of pairs we can form in Phase 2 is:\n\n                Let T = min(X + Y, Wl + Wr)   [because we have a total of X+Y fixed boots to be matched (each requiring a wildcard from the opposite side) and Wl+Wr wildcards, and also we can match the remaining wildcards arbitrarily?]\n\n          Actually, we have two kinds of matches:\n\n            Type 1: left unmatched fixed (X) must be matched with right wildcards (so we use X wildcards from the right, but note: we can use a right wildcard only once)\n            Type 2: right unmatched fixed (Y) must be matched with left wildcards (so we use Y wildcards from the left)\n            Type 3: the leftover wildcards (if any) can be matched together.\n\n          However, we cannot use the same wildcard twice.\n\n          The total wildcards available are Wl and Wr.\n\n          We require:\n\n            For Type 1: we use up to X wildcards from the right (but we cannot exceed Wr)\n            For Type 2: we use up to Y wildcards from the left (cannot exceed Wl)\n\n          Then, after using these, the remaining wildcards (from left: Wl - Y, from right: Wr - X) can be matched together: min(Wl-Y, Wr-X)\n\n          But note: we cannot use a wildcard for two purposes at once.\n\n          Therefore, the total pairs in Phase 2 is:\n\n            P2 = min(X, Wr)   [from Type 1] + min(Y, Wl) [from Type 2] + min(max(0, Wl - Y), max(0, Wr - X))\n\n          However, wait: the Type 1 and Type 2 are independent? \n\n          Actually, we have:\n\n            We need to assign:\n\n              - Each left unmatched fixed (X) must be matched with a right wildcard (so we use X wildcards from the right, but we cannot use more than Wr).\n              - Each right unmatched fixed (Y) must be matched with a left wildcard (so we use Y wildcards from the left, but we cannot use more than Wl).\n\n          But note: the same wildcard cannot be used twice. So the total usage of wildcards from the right is X (if available) and from the left is Y (if available). Then, the remaining wildcards (if any) can be matched together.\n\n          However, we must also consider that the total pairs is limited by the total remaining boots: we cannot form more than min(n, ...) but note we are only considering the remaining.\n\n          Actually, the total pairs we form in Phase 2 is:\n\n            P2 = min(X, Wr) + min(Y, Wl) + min(Wl - min(Y, Wl), Wr - min(X, Wr))\n\n          But wait, this is not linear. Alternatively, we can think:\n\n            Let A = min(X, Wr)   [matching unmatched fixed left with wild right]\n            Let B = min(Y, Wl)   [matching unmatched fixed right with wild left]\n\n            Then, the remaining wildcards are:\n\n              left_wild_remaining = Wl - B\n              right_wild_remaining = Wr - A\n\n            Then, we can match the remaining wildcards: min(left_wild_remaining, right_wild_remaining)\n\n            So P2 = A + B + min(left_wild_remaining, right_wild_remaining)\n\n          But note: the total pairs we can form in Phase 2 is also bounded by the total remaining boots (which is n - M0) but we don't need to worry because we are using the constraints above.\n\n          However, wait: we have two sets of remaining boots: left_remaining = X + Wl, right_remaining = Y + Wr. The maximum pairs from these is min(X+Wl, Y+Wr). But note, we are breaking the matching into three types. And indeed, the total pairs we form is:\n\n            P2 = A + B + min(Wl-B, Wr-A) \n\n          And note: A <= X, B <= Y, and A <= Wr, B <= Wl.\n\n          Also, the total pairs we form is at most min(X+Wl, Y+Wr) because:\n\n            We are using A+B+min(Wl-B, Wr-A) <= (X+Wl) and (Y+Wr) ?\n\n          Let me check:\n\n            We are using A (<= Wr) from the right wildcards, and B (<= Wl) from the left wildcards, and then matching the rest of the wildcards (min(Wl-B, Wr-A)).\n\n            Total pairs = A + B + min(Wl-B, Wr-A)\n\n            The total left boots used in Phase 2: A (from left unmatched fixed) + (Wl - min(Wl, B) ???) -> Actually, we use:\n\n              Left: \n                 - left unmatched fixed: A (each one uses one left boot and one wildcard from right) -> so we use A left boots (fixed)\n                 - left wildcards: B (used for matching right unmatched fixed) + min(Wl-B, Wr-A) (used for matching with right wildcards) = B + min(Wl-B, Wr-A)\n\n              So total left boots used in Phase 2: A + B + min(Wl-B, Wr-A) = P2\n\n            Similarly, right boots used: B + min(Wl-B, Wr-A) + A = P2.\n\n          Therefore, we are using P2 left boots and P2 right boots.\n\n          Then, the total pairs is M0 + P2.\n\n          But note: we cannot exceed the total remaining boots (n - M0) because we have exactly n-M0 left boots and n-M0 right boots remaining? Actually, no: because M0 is the fixed matches, and then we have:\n\n            left_remaining = n - M0   (because initially n left, we used M0 left fixed in Phase 1, but note: the fixed matches used M0 left boots, and the wildcards are still there. The total left boots is n, so the remaining left boots is n - M0 (because we used M0 left boots in fixed matches, and the wildcards are not used in fixed matches). \n\n          Actually, the left boots are:\n\n            Initially: n boots (some fixed, some wild)\n            In fixed matches: we use M0 left boots (the fixed ones that were matched). Then, the remaining left boots are n - M0.\n\n          Similarly, the remaining right boots are n - M0.\n\n          Therefore, we can form at most n - M0 pairs in Phase 2.\n\n          But according to our calculation, P2 = A+B+min(Wl-B, Wr-A) and we know:\n\n            A = min(X, Wr) = min(n - M0 - (right_fixed_total - (M0))? Let me define:\n\n          Actually, we defined:\n\n            M0 = fixed_matches\n\n            Let F_l = total fixed left (count of non '?' in l)\n            Let F_r = total fixed right (count of non '?' in r)\n\n            Then, X = F_l - M0   (because M0 is the number of fixed left boots used, so remaining fixed left is F_l - M0)\n            Similarly, Y = F_r - M0.\n\n          But note: the total remaining left boots is (F_l - M0) + Wl = n - M0   (because F_l + Wl = n, since n = F_l + Wl, and similarly for right: F_r + Wr = n)\n\n          Then, the total pairs we can form in Phase 2 is at most n - M0.\n\n          And our calculation for P2 is:\n\n            P2 = min(F_l - M0, Wr) + min(F_r - M0, Wl) + min(Wl - min(F_r - M0, Wl), Wr - min(F_l - M0, Wr))\n\n          But note: F_l = n - Wl, F_r = n - Wr.\n\n          Then, X = F_l - M0 = (n - Wl) - M0\n          Y = F_r - M0 = (n - Wr) - M0\n\n          Then, P2 = min((n-Wl)-M0, Wr) + min((n-Wr)-M0, Wl) + min(Wl - min((n-Wr)-M0, Wl), Wr - min((n-Wl)-M0, Wr))\n\n          And the total pairs is M0 + P2, which must be <= n.\n\n          But we know that the maximum pairs is at most n, so this formula gives at most n.\n\n        However, we must output the actual pairs.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n          Steps:\n\n          1. Read n, then two strings l and r.\n\n          2. Precompute:\n                Wl = number of '?' in l\n                Wr = number of '?' in r\n\n                F_l = n - Wl   (number of fixed left boots)\n                F_r = n - Wr   (number of fixed right boots)\n\n          3. Count the fixed boots by color (for left and right, excluding '?').\n\n          4. Compute M0 (fixed_matches): \n                For each color c (that is a lowercase letter) in the union of keys from left_fixed and right_fixed:\n                    M0 += min(count_left_fixed.get(c,0), count_right_fixed.get(c,0))\n\n          5. Now, the unmatched fixed left boots for color c: \n                X_color = count_left_fixed.get(c,0) - min(count_left_fixed.get(c,0), count_right_fixed.get(c,0))\n                Similarly for right.\n\n          6. But note: we don't need the per-color breakdown for the entire Phase 2 matching because we are going to match the unmatched fixed boots arbitrarily (via wildcards). However, we do need the total numbers:\n\n                X = F_l - M0   (total unmatched fixed left)\n                Y = F_r - M0   (total unmatched fixed right)\n\n          7. Now, we want to form as many pairs as possible in Phase 2.\n\n          However, we must output the pairs. We need to know which boots to match.\n\n        How to assign the pairs?\n\n          We have four types of boots in the remaining:\n\n            Type LF: left boots that are fixed and unmatched (we have X of them)\n            Type RF: right boots that are fixed and unmatched (we have Y of them)\n            Type LW: left boots that are wildcards (Wl of them)\n            Type RW: right boots that are wildcards (Wr of them)\n\n          We can break down the Phase 2 matching:\n\n            Step 2a: Match LF with RW (if available). We can match at most min(X, Wr) of these.\n\n            Step 2b: Match RF with LW (if available). We can match at most min(Y, Wl) of these.\n\n            Step 2c: Match the remaining LW with the remaining RW (min(Wl - min(Y, Wl), Wr - min(X, Wr))).\n\n          But note: the order of matching might matter for the output (we have to output the indices). We are allowed to output any matching.\n\n          We must keep track of which boots are available.\n\n        Implementation plan:\n\n          We will:\n\n            - Keep arrays (or lists) of the indices for the left and right boots that are unmatched after Phase 1 and the wildcards.\n\n          However, we don't need to store the entire graph because the graph is complete for the wildcards and the fixed ones only match via wildcards.\n\n          Steps for output:\n\n            We are going to output the pairs in any order.\n\n            We have to record:\n\n              For left boots: \n                  - The fixed boots that were matched in Phase 1 (we output them with the right fixed boot they were matched with)\n                  - The fixed boots that are unmatched (Type LF) will be matched with wildcards (from right) in Step 2a.\n                  - The wildcards (Type LW) will be matched either with RF (Step 2b) or with RW (Step 2c).\n\n            Similarly for right.\n\n          We need to store:\n\n            left_indices = list of indices for left boots (0-indexed or 1-indexed? the problem uses 1-indexed indices)\n\n            We are given the strings l and r, and the i-th character (0-indexed) corresponds to index i+1.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let left_list = list of (index, char) for the left string.\n            Let right_list = list of (index, char) for the right string.\n\n          Then, we will:\n\n            Step 1: Mark the fixed boots (non '?') and the wildcards.\n\n            Step 2: For fixed boots, we want to match same colors. We need to record:\n\n                For left: for each fixed color, we have a list of indices (and the character) that are fixed and not matched.\n                Similarly for right.\n\n            Then,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (one left and one right) where each pair's colors are compatible. The compatibility is defined as either matching colors or an indefinite color ('?') which can match any color. The solution involves efficiently matching the boots while adhering to the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The key observation is that fixed colors (non '?') can only match other fixed colors of the same letter, while '?' can match any color. The challenge is to maximize the number of pairs by leveraging both fixed and wildcard boots optimally.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Phase 1**: Match as many fixed boots as possible by pairing them with same-colored fixed boots from the opposite side.\n   - **Phase 2**: Use the remaining wildcards (both left and right) to match unmatched fixed boots and then match any leftover wildcards together.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Fixed Matches (Phase 1)**: For each color, count the occurrences in both left and right boots. The number of matches for each color is the minimum of its counts on both sides. Sum these minima to get the total fixed matches.\n   - **Wildcard Matches (Phase 2)**: \n     - Match unmatched fixed boots from the left with wildcards from the right.\n     - Match unmatched fixed boots from the right with wildcards from the left.\n     - Match any remaining wildcards from both sides.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once to count colors and determine matches, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n), where n is the number of boots. This is efficient given the problem constraints (n ≤ 150000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_chars = list(l_str)\n    right_chars = list(r_str)\n    \n    left_fixed_indices = []\n    right_fixed_indices = []\n    left_wild_indices = []\n    right_wild_indices = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(left_chars):\n        if char == '?':\n            left_wild_indices.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            left_fixed_indices.append((i+1, char))\n            \n    for i, char in enumerate(right_chars):\n        if char == '?':\n            right_wild_indices.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            right_fixed_indices.append((i+1, char))\n            \n    from collections import defaultdict\n    left_fixed_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for idx, char in left_fixed_indices:\n        left_fixed_count[char] += 1\n        \n    right_fixed_count = defaultdict(int)\n    for idx, char in right_fixed_indices:\n        right_fixed_count[char] += 1\n        \n    M0 = 0\n    for char in left_fixed_count:\n        if char in right_fixed_count:\n            M0 += min(left_fixed_count[char], right_fixed_count[char])\n            \n    used_left_fixed = set()\n    used_right_fixed = set()\n    fixed_matches = []\n    for char in left_fixed_count:\n        if char in right_fixed_count:\n            count_left = left_fixed_count[char]\n            count_right = right_fixed_count[char]\n            common = min(count_left, count_right)\n            M0 += common\n            \n            left_list = [idx for idx, c in left_fixed_indices if c == char]\n            right_list = [idx for idx, c in right_fixed_indices if c == char]\n            \n            for i in range(common):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                fixed_matches.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n                \n            for idx in left_list[:count_left-common]:\n                pass\n            for idx in right_list[:count_right-common]:\n                pass\n                \n    fixed_matches.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    left_remaining = []\n    right_remaining = []\n    left_remaining.extend(left_wild_indices)\n    \n    for idx, char in left_fixed_indices:\n        if char not in right_fixed_count or left_fixed_count[char] > right_fixed_count[char]:\n            left_remaining.append(idx)\n            \n    for idx, char in right_fixed_indices:\n        if char not in left_fixed_count or right_fixed_count[char] > left_fixed_count[char]:\n            right_remaining.append(idx)\n            \n    A = min(len(left_remaining), len(right_wild_indices))\n    B = min(len(right_remaining), len(left_wild_indices))\n    \n    used_wild_left = set()\n    used_wild_right = set()\n    wild_matches = []\n    for _ in range(A):\n        left_idx = left_remaining.pop(0)\n        right_idx = right_wild_indices.pop(0)\n        wild_matches.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        \n    for _ in range(B):\n        left_idx = left_wild_indices.copy()\n        right_idx = right_remaining.copy()\n        left_idx = left_wild_indices.pop(0)\n        right_idx = right_remaining.pop(0)\n        wild_matches.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        \n    total_pairs = fixed_matches + wild_matches\n    total_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    print(len(total_pairs))\n    for a, b in total_pairs:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots `n` and two strings representing the left and right boots' colors.\n2. **Categorizing Boots**: Boots are categorized into fixed (specific color) and wildcard ('?').\n3. **Fixed Matches Calculation**: For each color, the number of compatible pairs between left and right fixed boots is the minimum of their counts.
