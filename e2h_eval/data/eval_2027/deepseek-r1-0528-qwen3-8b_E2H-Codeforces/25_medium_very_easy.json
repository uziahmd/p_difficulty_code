При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one string t (the received message) and we need to check if it can be the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message s, where an error caused the two copies to overlap.\n\n Conditions:\n - The entire string t must be formed by two copies of s with a positive overlap (overlap length L such that 0 < L < len(s)).\n - However, note that if the entire string is just two copies without any overlap (so no merging) then that is not considered an error. Similarly, if the string is not formed by two copies at all, then we output \"NO\".\n\n Steps:\n\n Let n = len(t)\n We are going to consider: \n   There exists a string s (non-empty) such that t is the concatenation of two copies of s with an overlap of L (1 <= L < len(s)).\n\n But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical and the overlapping part must be positive and less than the length of s.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   Let s be the base string. Then the received string t is of the form: s[0: len(s)-L] + s[0:len(s)] (if we break it as two parts: the first part goes from start to (len(s)-L-1) and the second part is the whole s, but note the overlapping).\n\n Actually, the process: \n   We send two copies of s. In the error case, they merge by overlapping. So the resulting string is:\n        s + s[L:]   but wait, actually the merging is such that the end of the first s matches the beginning of the second s for L characters.\n\n   Therefore, the entire string t is: \n        t = s + s[L:]   but note that the first part is actually s without the last L characters? \n\n   Actually, the first copy is sent completely, then the second copy starts being merged from the first L characters. So the second copy's first L characters are already present in the first copy. \n\n   So the total string is: \n        s[0: len(s) - L] + s   OR\n\n   Alternatively, we can see that the entire string t must satisfy:\n        t[0: n - L] = s[0: n - L]   and then the last L characters of t are the first L characters of s.\n\n   But note: the entire string is built from two copies of s. So we have:\n\n        s = t[0: k] for some k (which is the length of s). Then the second copy would start at index k, and we require that the prefix of the second copy (of length L) matches the suffix of the first copy (of length L). And then the rest of the second copy (from L to k) is appended.\n\n   But note: the entire string t must be exactly the first copy (without the last L characters?) plus the entire second copy? Actually, no: the entire second copy is sent, but the overlapping part is already provided by the first copy. So the total length is |s| + |s| - L = 2*k - L.\n\n   And we know the total length n = 2*k - L, so L = 2*k - n.\n\n   Conditions on k (length of s): \n        k must be at least ceil(n/2) because we have two copies and an overlap (so at least one character must be overlapped). Actually, note that the entire string t is of length n, and we have n = 2*k - L, and L>=1 and L<k, so k must be in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1] (because L = 2*k - n must be at least 1 and less than k, so 2*k - n >=1 => k >= (n+1)//2, and 2*k - n < k => k < n).\n\n   However, note: the entire string t must also satisfy that the first k-L characters of t equal the first k-L characters of s (which is the first k of t) and then the next L characters (from k-L to k) must equal the first L characters of s (which is the first L of t's first k). \n\n   Alternatively, we can try to find a split such that:\n\n        Let k be the length of s (so s = t[0:k]). Then the second copy is t[k:], but note that the second copy should start with an overlap of L. However, the second copy is exactly s, so the beginning of the second copy (which is s[0]) must match the end of the first copy (which is s[-L:]).\n\n   Actually, the second copy is s, and the first copy is s. The error causes the last L characters of the first copy to merge with the first L characters of the second copy. Therefore, the entire string t is:\n\n        t = s[0: k - L] + s   (because the first copy sends the first k - L characters (so that the last L characters are omitted from the first copy's transmission because they will be covered by the second copy's beginning) and then the second copy sends the entire s.\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify that the first copy is truncated. It says that two identical messages are sent and the error causes them to merge. So the entire first copy is sent and the entire second copy is sent, but the overlapping part is omitted. Therefore, the resulting string is:\n\n        t = s[0: k] + s[L:]\n\n   And the length of t is k + k - L = 2k - L.\n\n   Now, we can also note: the condition for the overlap is that the suffix of the first copy (last L characters) must equal the prefix of the second copy (first L characters). Since the second copy is s, the prefix is s[0:L]. Therefore, the last L characters of the first copy (which is s[-L:]) must equal s[0:L].\n\n   So, the conditions are:\n        Let k be the length of s (so k is between ceil((n+1)/2) and n-1).\n        Then we require that the last L characters of s (where L = 2*k - n) must equal the first L characters of s.\n\n   But note: we don't know k. However, we can also express k in terms of n and L: k = (n + L) // 2, but we have two variables.\n\n   Another approach: iterate over possible k (the length of s). k must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1.\n\n   For a fixed k (so s = t[0:k]), the overlap L is defined by L = 2*k - n.\n\n   Conditions for L:\n        L must be an integer and 0 < L < k.\n\n   Then we check that the last L characters of s (i.e., s[k-L:k]) are equal to the first L characters of s (i.e., s[0:L]).\n\n   But note: there is another possibility: the entire string t might be broken into two copies of s in a different way? Actually, the problem states that the two messages are identical. So s must be the same for both.\n\n   However, note: we can also consider that the two copies are not necessarily contiguous in the sense that the first copy is the entire s and the second copy is the entire s, but the overlapping part is taken from the beginning of the second copy and the end of the first copy.\n\n   But wait: what if the string t is \"ababab\"? This can be formed by two copies of \"abab\" with an overlap of 2? Then k=4, L=2, then the string t would be of length 4+4-2=6, which is correct. But also, we can form \"ababab\" from two copies of \"aba\" with an overlap of 1? Then k=3, L= 2*3-6=0 -> invalid. Or two copies of \"ab\" with an overlap of 2? Then k=2, L=2*2-6=-2 -> invalid.\n\n   Actually, we must have L = 2*k - n, and n is the length of t. For \"ababab\", n=6.\n\n   Possibilities for k (from ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(7/2)=4 to 5 (since k from 4 to 5, because n-1=5)):\n        k=4: L=2*4-6=2. Then check: s = t[0:4] = \"abab\". Then the last 2 characters of s are \"ab\", and the first 2 characters of s are \"ab\" -> match. So valid.\n\n        k=5: L=2*5-6=4. Then check: s = t[0:5]=\"ababa\". Last 4 characters: \"baba\", first 4: \"abab\" -> not equal.\n\n   So we found one solution: s = \"abab\".\n\n   But note: the example input has 'abababab' -> output YES with s='ababab'. Let's check that:\n\n        t = 'abababab', n=8.\n        k must be from ceil((8+1)/2)=ceil(9/2)=5 to 7.\n\n        k=5: L=2*5-8=2. s = t[0:5]='ababa'. Last 2: 'ba', first 2: 'ab' -> no.\n        k=6: L=2*6-8=4. s = t[0:6]='ababab'. Last 4: 'abab', first 4: 'abab' -> yes. So s='ababab'.\n\n        But wait, the example output says: YES\\nababab.\n\n   However, note the example input includes: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n   The example output: \n        'YES\\nabrakadabra' for the first,\n        'YES\\nacaca' for the second,\n        'NO' for the third,\n        'YES\\nababab' for the fourth,\n        'NO' for the fifth.\n\n   So our method for the fourth: \n        t = 'abababab' (n=8)\n        k from 5 to 7.\n\n        k=5: L=2 -> doesn't work.\n        k=6: L=4 -> works, so we output 'ababab'\n\n   But wait, the example output for the fourth is 'ababab'. That matches.\n\n   However, note the second example: \n        Input: 'acacacaca' (n=9)\n\n        k from ceil((9+1)/2)=5 to 8.\n\n        k=5: L=2*5-9=1 -> s='acaca'. Check: last 1 of s: 'a', first 1: 'a' -> valid. So we can use k=5.\n\n        But note: the example output is 'acaca' (which is s='acaca').\n\n        However, note that the example input was 'acacacaca' (which is 9 characters). The two copies of 'acaca' (length 5) would give a string of length 5+5-1=9, which matches.\n\n   But wait, the example input also says: \n        Input: 'abcabc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\n        Let's check: t='abcabc', n=6.\n\n        k from 3 to 5.\n\n        k=3: L=2*3-6=0 -> invalid (must be positive).\n        k=4: L=2*4-6=2. s='abca'. Last 2: 'ca', first 2: 'ab' -> no.\n        k=5: L=2*5-6=4. s='abcab'. Last 4: 'bcab', first 4: 'abca' -> no.\n\n        So no k satisfies, so we output 'NO'.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений.\" meaning that if the entire string is just two copies without any non-overlapping part, that is not an error. But note: our condition requires an overlap of positive length (less than the length of s). The example \"abcabc\" is two copies without any overlap (so the entire second copy is appended without merging). So we correctly output 'NO'.\n\n   But wait, what about the example \"abcd\"? \n        n=4.\n        k from 2 to 3.\n        k=2: L=2*2-4=0 -> invalid.\n        k=3: L=2*3-4=2. Then s='abc'. Last 2: 'bc', first 2: 'ab' -> no. -> NO.\n\n   This matches the problem statement.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n        Read the string t.\n\n        n = len(t)\n\n        If n == 0: then output \"NO\" (but the input is non-empty, so skip)\n\n        Consider k from floor((n+1)/2) to n-1 (inclusive). But note: k must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1. We can let k_min = (n+1)//2 (ceiling division) and k_max = n-1.\n\n        For each k in the range [k_min, k_max]:\n            L = 2*k - n\n            If L is not positive or L >= k, skip (but by our k range, L should be positive? Actually, from k_min = ceil((n+1)/2) we have 2*k_min >= n+1, so L = 2*k_min - n >= 1. And L < k because k_min is chosen such that 2*k_min > n, and k increases so L decreases? Actually, we require L < k, so 2*k-n < k => k < n, which is satisfied by k_max = n-1.\n\n            Then, we check if the last L characters of t[0:k] are equal to the first L characters of t[0:k].\n\n            If we find one k for which this holds, then we output:\n                \"YES\"\n                s = t[0:k]\n\n            Then break.\n\n        If no k in the range satisfies, output \"NO\".\n\n   However, note: there is an alternative representation. The problem says that the two copies are identical. But note: what if the entire string t is formed by two copies of s, but the two copies are not starting at the beginning? Actually, the problem states that the two messages are sent consecutively. So the first copy is s and the second copy is s. The error causes the end of the first copy to merge with the beginning of the second copy.\n\n   Our method above assumes that s is the first k characters of t.\n\n   But wait, could s be a substring that does not start at the beginning? \n\n   Example: t = \"aabaa\", n=5.\n\n        k_min = ceil((5+1)/2)=ceil(6/2)=3, k_max=4.\n\n        k=3: L=2*3-5=1. s = \"aab\". Last 1: \"b\", first 1: \"a\" -> no.\n        k=4: L=2*4-5=3. s = \"aaba\". Last 3: \"aba\", first 3: \"aab\" -> no.\n\n        So we output \"NO\".\n\n   But consider: is there a possibility that s is not the first k characters? \n\n   According to the problem, the two messages are sent consecutively. So the entire string t is the result of the first copy (which is s) and then the second copy (which is s) with an overlap. Therefore, the first copy must be at the beginning. \n\n   However, note: the problem does not say that the base string s must appear at the beginning. But the process is: we send two copies of s. The first copy is s, and the second copy is s. The entire string t is then the first copy (without the last L characters) and then the entire second copy (so the entire second copy is appended). But wait, the entire second copy is sent, but the overlapping part is already in the first copy. \n\n   Actually, the resulting string is: s[0: k - L] + s, and the entire string must start with s[0: k - L]. \n\n   But note: we are taking s as the first k characters. How do we know that the base string s is the first k characters? \n\n   The problem says: \"определите возможное значение s\". The example outputs are always the first part of the string.\n\n   However, consider: maybe the base string s is not necessarily the first k characters? \n\n   Let me reexamine: The two copies are consecutive. The first copy is s and the second copy is s. The error causes the two copies to merge. The entire string t is the first copy (which is s) and then the second copy (which is s) but the overlapping part is omitted. \n\n   Therefore, the entire string t must start with s (at least the first k-L characters) and then the remaining part is the entire second copy (which is s). But note: the second copy is s, so the entire string t must be:\n\n        t = s[0: k - L] + s\n\n   And the length of t is (k - L) + k = 2k - L.\n\n   Also, the last L characters of the first copy (which is s[0:k]) must be the same as the first L characters of the second copy (which is s[0:L]).\n\n   Therefore, the entire string t must be composed of s (the base string) and then the entire second copy (which is s) without the overlapping part. \n\n   But note: the first copy is s, so the first k characters of t must be s (unless the first copy is truncated by the merging? Actually, the merging doesn't truncate the first copy, it just omits the overlapping part from the beginning of the second copy. \n\n   However, the entire first copy is sent, so the first copy is s. Then the second copy is s, but the first L characters of the second copy are already provided by the end of the first copy. So the entire string is:\n\n        t = s + s[L:]\n\n   And the length of t is k + (k - L) = 2k - L.\n\n   But note: the first k characters of t must be s. So we can only consider s = t[0:k] for the first copy.\n\n   Therefore, our method is correct: we take the first k characters as s.\n\n   However, what if the string t is \"xabcabc\", and the base string s is \"abcab\", then the two copies would be:\n\n        First copy: \"abcab\"\n        Second copy: \"abcab\", but the overlap is 3 (because the last 3 of the first copy are \"cab\", and the first 3 of the second copy are \"abc\", which don't match). \n\n   But wait, the example input does not include such cases. \n\n   But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. So the base string s must be the same for both. And the entire string t is built from the two copies. \n\n   However, there is another possibility: the base string s might appear multiple times in t. But the problem does not require that s is the minimal period or anything. \n\n   But note: the example input: \"acacacaca\" (n=9) is solved by s=\"acaca\", which is the first 5 characters.\n\n   However, consider: t = \"abcabcabc\", n=9.\n\n        k_min = ceil((9+1)/2)=5, k_max=8.\n\n        k=5: L=2*5-9=1. s=\"abcab\", last 1: \"b\", first 1: \"a\" -> no.\n        k=6: L=2*6-9=3. s=\"abcabc\", last 3=\"abc\", first 3=\"abc\" -> yes.\n\n        So we output s=\"abcabc\". \n\n        But wait, is that correct? \n            Two copies of \"abcabc\": \n                First copy: \"abcabc\"\n                Second copy: \"abcabc\", and the overlap L=3: the last 3 of the first copy is \"abc\", and the first 3 of the second copy is \"abc\". \n                Then the resulting string is: \"abcabc\" + \"abc\" (the second copy without the first 3) -> \"abcabcabc\", which is t.\n\n        So yes.\n\n   But note: the example input also includes \"tatbt\", which is 'tatbt' (n=5). \n\n        k_min = ceil((5+1)/2)=3, k_max=4.\n\n        k=3: L=2*3-5=1. s=\"tat\", last 1=\"t\", first 1=\"t\" -> valid. So we output \"YES\\ntat\".\n\n        However, the example output for \"tatbt\" is \"NO\".\n\n   Wait, let me check the example input: the fifth example is \"tatbt\", and the expected output is \"NO\".\n\n   Why? \n\n        t = \"tatbt\", n=5.\n\n        k=3: L=1, then s = \"tat\". Then the entire string should be: \n            First copy: \"tat\"\n            Second copy: \"tat\", but we take the second copy without the first L=1 character: so the second copy part is \"at\" (because the first character is already provided by the last L=1 of the first copy). \n            Then the entire string is \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tata\" (length 4) but wait, we have t=\"tatbt\" (length 5). \n\n        What went wrong?\n\n        Actually, the formula: the entire string is s + s[L:].\n\n        s = \"tat\", L=1, then s[L:] is \"at\", so the entire string is \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tata\", which is length 4, but our t is length 5.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for the length is that n = 2*k - L. Here, 2*3-1=5, so n=5. Then the entire string should be:\n\n            t = s[0: k] + s[L:]   -> \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tata\" -> but that is 4 characters.\n\n        Wait, let me recalc: \n            k=3, L=1, then the entire string length = k + (k - L) = 3 + (3-1)=5. \n\n        But how is that? \n            The first copy is the entire s (3 characters) and the second copy is the entire s except the first L characters? Actually, no: the second copy is sent entirely, but the overlapping part is already provided by the first copy. So we don't need to send the first L characters again.\n\n        So the second copy is s, but we omit the first L characters because they are already there. Therefore, the second copy contributes k - L characters.\n\n        Then the total length is k (first copy) + (k - L) (second copy) = 2*k - L.\n\n        So for k=3, L=1, the total length is 5.\n\n        Now, how is the string built?\n            First copy: s = \"tat\" -> \"t a t\"\n            Then, we need to append the second copy without the first L=1 character. The second copy is \"tat\", so without the first character we get \"at\".\n\n            Then the entire string is \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tata\" (4 characters) but wait, that is 4, not 5.\n\n        Let me break down:\n\n            The first copy: we send \"t a t\".\n            Then the second copy: we send \"t a t\", but the first character 't' is already at the end of the first copy. So we only send the remaining part: \"a t\".\n\n            So the entire string is \"t a t a t\" -> \"tatat\" (5 characters). \n\n        How do we get that?\n\n            Actually, the entire string is built as:\n\n                t = s + (s[L:] if we are to include the entire second copy without the first L, but note: the second copy is s, so we break s into two parts: the first L characters (which are already in the first copy) and the rest.\n\n            So the second copy's data is s[L:], which is \"at\" (two characters). Then the entire string is:\n\n                t = s + s[L:]   -> \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tat\" + \"a\" + \"t\" -> \"tatat\", which is 5 characters.\n\n        But wait, the example input is \"tatbt\", which is 5 characters: 't','a','t','b','t'. \n\n        Our constructed string is \"tatat\", which is different from \"tatbt\".\n\n        Therefore, the example input \"tatbt\" does not match the pattern for k=3, L=1.\n\n        Why did we get a match for the condition on the last L and the first L? \n            Condition: last L of s (which is \"t\") must equal the first L of s (which is \"t\"). That is true.\n\n        But the entire string we built is \"tatat\", which is not \"tatbt\". \n\n        So what is the issue?\n\n        The issue is that the entire string t must be exactly the first copy (s) and then the second copy without the first L characters. \n\n        For t = \"tatbt\", we have:\n\n            s = t[0:3] = \"tat\"\n\n            Then the second copy without the first L=1 character is t[3:3+ (3-1)]? \n\n        Actually, the second copy is s, so we take s[L:] = \"at\", so the entire string is \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tatat\", but the given t is \"tatbt\".\n\n        Therefore, the condition we checked (that the last L of s equals the first L of s) is necessary, but is it sufficient?\n\n        No, because we also require that the entire string t is the concatenation of s and s[L:]. \n\n        In our example, t is \"tatbt\", and if we set s = \"tat\", then s + s[L:] = \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tatat\", which is not \"tatbt\".\n\n        So we must also check that the entire string t is equal to s + s[L:].\n\n        But note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. The entire string t is built by the first copy (s) and then the second copy (s) without the first L characters. \n\n        Therefore, the entire string t must be:\n\n            t = s + s[L:]\n\n        So we must check two things for a candidate k (with L=2*k-n):\n\n          1. The last L characters of s (which is t[0:k]) are equal to the first L characters of s.\n          2. The entire string t is equal to s + s[L:].\n\n        However, note that the entire string t is of length n, and we have n = 2*k - L, and s is of length k, so s + s[L:] is of length k + (k - L) = 2*k - L = n. So the length matches.\n\n        Then condition 2 is: t == s + s[L:]\n\n        But note: s = t[0:k], and s[L:] = t[L: k] (since s is t[0:k])? \n\n        Actually, s[L:] is the substring of s from index L to the end, which is t[L: k] (if k is the length of s). Then the entire string built is t[0:k] + t[L:k]. \n\n        But note: the entire string t has length n = 2*k - L, so the second part should be of length k - L, and we have:\n\n            t[0:k] + t[L:k] = t[0:k] + t[L:L+(k-L)] = t[0:k] + t[L:k] (which is the substring from L to k, inclusive? Actually, slicing in Python: t[L:k] is from index L to k-1, but we want k - L characters? \n\n        Actually, we want to take s[L:] which is k - L characters. \n\n        But note: s = t[0:k] (length k). Then s[L:] is from index L to the end of s, so from L to k-1, which is k - L characters.\n\n        Then the entire string built is:\n\n            t_built = t[0:k] + t[L:k]   (because t[L:k] is the substring from index L to k-1, which is exactly s[L:])\n\n        Now, what is the length of t_built? \n            len(t_built) = k + (k - L) = 2*k - L = n.\n\n        Then we require that t_built equals t.\n\n        So for the example \"tatbt\", k=3, L=1:\n\n            t_built = t[0:3] + t[1:3] = \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tatat\"\n\n            But t = \"tatbt\", which is not equal to \"tatat\".\n\n        Therefore, we must check that t == t[0:k] + t[L:k].\n\n        So the algorithm becomes:\n\n            n = len(t)\n            k_min = (n+1)//2   # because ceil((n+1)/2) is the same as (n+1)//2 for integer n (ceiling division for (n+1)/2)\n            k_max = n-1\n\n            for k in range(k_min, k_max+1):\n                L = 2*k - n\n                if L < 1 or L >= k:\n                    continue\n\n                s = t[:k]\n                # Check the overlap condition: last L of s must equal first L of s.\n                if s[-L:] != s[:L]:\n                    continue\n\n                # Now, build the entire string from two copies: first copy is s, second copy is s[L:]\n                built_string = s + s[L:]\n\n                if built_string == t:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    print(s)\n                    exit(0)   # or break and then after the loop output NO.\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        Now, test with \"tatbt\": \n            n=5, k_min=(5+1)//2=3, k_max=4.\n\n            k=3: L=1, s=\"tat\", s[-1:]=\"t\", s[:1]=\"t\" -> condition holds.\n                built_string = \"tat\" + \"at\" = \"tatat\", which is not \"tatbt\" -> skip.\n\n            k=4: L=2*4-5=3, then s = t[0:4]=\"tatb\", then check: last 3 of s is \"atb\", first 3 of s is \"tat\" -> not equal -> skip.\n\n            Then output \"NO\", which matches.\n\n        Now, test with the example \"acacacaca\" (n=9):\n\n            k_min = (9+1)//2=5, k_max=8.\n\n            k=5: L=1, s=\"acaca\", last 1=\"a\", first 1=\"a\" -> condition holds.\n                built_string = \"acaca\" + \"c\" (because s[L:] is \"acaca\"[1:]==\"caca\") -> wait, no: \n                    Actually, s=\"acaca\", L=1, then s[L:] is \"caca\", so built_string = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is the input.\n\n            So we output \"YES\" and \"acaca\".\n\n        Now, test with \"abababab\" (n=8):\n\n            k_min= (8+1)//2 = 4 (because (8+1)//2 = 9//2 = 4 in integer floor division, but we want ceiling of (8+1)/2 = 4.5 -> 5? \n\n            Let me recalc: \n                k_min = ceil((n+1)/2) = ceil(9/2)=5, so k_min=5, k_max=7.\n\n            k=5: L=2*5-8=2, s=\"abab\", last 2=\"ab\", first 2=\"ab\" -> condition holds.\n                built_string = \"abab\" + \"ab\"[2:] -> \"abab\" + \"\" (because s[L:] is s[2:] which is \"ab\"[2:4] -> \"ab\" without the first two? Actually, s[2:4] is \"ab\", so built_string = \"ababab\", which is 6 characters, but n=8.\n\n            Wait, wait: the length of built_string should be 2*k - L = 10-2=8? \n\n            Actually, built_string = s + s[L:] = \"abab\" + s[2:] = \"abab\" + \"ab\" = \"ababab\", which is 6 characters. \n\n            Why is that? \n\n            We have: k=5, so s = t[0:5] = \"abab?\" -> wait, the input is \"abababab\" (8 characters). \n\n            Correction: the input string t is \"abababab\", so for k=5, s = t[0:5] = \"ababa\" (if we take 5 characters from \"abababab\", then the first 5 are \"ababa\").\n\n            Then L=2*5-8=2, and s[-2:]=\"ba\", s[:2]=\"ab\" -> condition fails.\n\n            Then k=6: L=2*6-8=4, s=t[0:6]=\"ababab\", last 4=\"abab\", first 4=\"abab\" -> condition holds.\n                built_string = \"ababab\" + \"abab\"[4:] -> \"ababab\" + \"ab\" (because s[4:] is the substring from index4 to the end, which is \"ab\") -> \"abababab\", which is the input.\n\n            So we output \"YES\\nababab\".\n\n        But wait, the example output for the fourth example is \"ababab\", which is correct.\n\n        However, I initially thought k_min was 4 for n=8, but we calculated k_min = (8+1)//2 = 9//2 = 4 (floor division). But we need ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n        Note: ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 if n is even? Actually, we can compute:\n\n            ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1) // 1 ? \n\n        Actually, we can use: \n            k_min = (n+1) // 2 + (1 if (n+1) % 2 != 0 else 0)   -> no, simpler: ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b, but for a=n+1, b=2: ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 = (n+2)//2? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            k_min = (n+1) // 2   if (n+1) is even? \n\n        But note: \n            For n=8: (8+1)//2 = 9//2 = 4 (in integer floor division). But ceil(9/2)=5.\n\n        So we cannot use floor division for ceil.\n\n        Actually, we can use: \n            k_min = (n+1) // 2  # This gives floor((n+1)/2). But we need ceil((n+1)/2) ?\n\n        Let me clarify: \n            We require k_min = ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n            ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1 + 1) // 2   when using integer floor division? \n\n            Because: ceil(x) = (x + 1 - epsilon) in integer floor division? \n\n            Actually, for integer x and y, ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b.\n\n            Here, a = n+1, b=2: ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1 + 2 - 1) // 2 = (n+2) // 2.\n\n        So k_min = (n+2) // 2.\n\n        Let me test:\n            n=8: (8+2)//2 = 10//2=5 -> correct.\n            n=9: (9+2)//2=11//2=5 (floor) -> but ceil((9+1)/2)=ceil(10/2)=5 -> correct.\n            n=5: (5+2)//2=7//2=3 -> ceil(6/2)=3 -> correct.\n\n        So we can set:\n            k_min = (n+2) // 2   # This gives the ceiling of (n+1)/2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use math.ceil, but the problem says the string length is at most 100, so we can use:\n\n            import math\n            k_min = math.ceil((n+1)/2)\n\n        But note: (n+1)/2 might be integer, then ceil is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with a positive overlap. The overlap must be such that the end of the first copy of `s` merges with the beginning of the second copy of `s`, and the merged string exactly matches `t`. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be constructed by taking the first `k` characters of `t` (denoted as `s`) and then appending the substring of `s` starting from the `L`-th character (where `L` is the overlap length). The total length of `t` must be `2*k - L`, and `L` must be a positive integer less than `k`.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over possible values of `k` (the length of `s`) from `(n + 2) // 2` to `n - 1` (inclusive). For each `k`, we compute `L` as `2*k - n`. We then check if the last `L` characters of `s` match the first `L` characters of `s`. Additionally, we verify that the concatenation of `s` and `s[L:]` equals `t`.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks at most `n` possible values of `k` (since `k` ranges from approximately `n/2` to `n-1`). Each check involves slicing and comparing strings, which is linear in the length of `s`. Given that `n` is up to 100, this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    k_min = (n + 2) // 2\n    k_max = n - 1\n    \n    for k in range(k_min, k_max + 1):\n        L_val = 2 * k - n\n        if L_val < 1 or L_val >= k:\n            continue\n            \n        s = t[:k]\n        if s[-L_val:] != s[:L_val]:\n            continue\n            \n        built_string = s + s[L_val:]\n        if built_string == t:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s)\n            return\n            \n    print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read from standard input.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the input string is empty, the output is \"NO\".\n3. **Range Calculation**: The minimum and maximum values for `k` (the length of `s`) are calculated based on the length of `t`.\n4. **Iteration and Validation**: For each candidate `k`, the overlap length `L_val` is computed. The algorithm checks if the last `L_val` characters of `s` match the first `L_val` characters of `s`. If they do, it constructs the expected string by concatenating `s` and `s[L_val:]` and checks if it matches `t`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, \"YES\" and `s` are printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed after all possibilities are exhausted.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could have been formed by merging two copies of `s` with a positive overlap, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
