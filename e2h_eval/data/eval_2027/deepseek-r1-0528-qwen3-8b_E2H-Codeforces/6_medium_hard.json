Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (l, r, cost)\n We need two vouchers i and j such that:\n   (1) They don't intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n   (2) The sum of their durations is exactly x: (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x.\n\n We are to minimize the total cost (cost_i + cost_j).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Note: The duration of a voucher i is d_i = r_i - l_i + 1.\n\n 2. We are looking for two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x.\n\n 3. The condition of non-intersection: \n        Condition 1: if we take voucher i first and then j (so i is [l_i, r_i] and j is [l_j, r_j]), then we require r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i.\n\n    But note: the two vouchers are not ordered in time necessarily. So we have two cases:\n        Case A: [l_i, r_i] ends before [l_j, r_j] starts -> r_i < l_j.\n        Case B: [l_j, r_j] ends before [l_i, r_i] starts -> r_j < l_i.\n\n 4. We can break the problem by grouping vouchers by duration. Let's create a dictionary (or list) mapping duration to a list of (l, r, cost) but we might want to store more information.\n\n However, note that x can be up to 400,000 (since n, x, and the days up to 200000, so x<=400000) and the duration d_i must be at least 1 and at most 200000.\n\n 5. Alternative approach:\n\n    We are going to iterate over possible durations d from 1 to x-1 (since d1>=1, d2=x-d1, so d from 1 to x-1). For each d, we consider the set of vouchers with duration d and the set of vouchers with duration x-d.\n\n    Then, for each pair (v1 from d, v2 from x-d) we check if they are disjoint.\n\n    But the total number of vouchers could be large (n up to 200000) and the number of distinct durations is also large (up to 200000). We cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n 6. We need to preprocess:\n\n    Let's group the vouchers by duration. Then for each duration d, we want to store the vouchers (l, r, cost) and maybe we can index them by something.\n\n 7. However, the non-intersection condition: \n        For two vouchers (a: [l1, r1]) and (b: [l2, r2]):\n          They are disjoint if r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n    This condition is symmetric.\n\n 8. We can try to fix one voucher and then look for the other. But how?\n\n    Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d, a sorted list of the intervals (by their start or end) and then use binary search to quickly find an interval in the complementary duration (x-d) that does not overlap.\n\n    But note: the condition for two intervals not overlapping is two possibilities.\n\n    Actually, for two intervals to be disjoint, we require that the entire interval of one is before the entire interval of the other. So we can consider two cases:\n\n        Case 1: [l1, r1] (duration d) and [l2, r2] (duration x-d) such that r1 < l2.\n        Case 2: [l1, r1] (duration d) and [l2, r2] (duration x-d) such that r2 < l1.\n\n    But note: the two cases are symmetric. We can consider without loss of generality that the first voucher has duration d and the second has duration x-d, but we must consider both orders? Actually, the problem does not specify order.\n\n    However, we can fix the two groups: let group_d be the list of vouchers with duration d, and group_xd be the list of vouchers with duration x-d.\n\n    Then we want to find the minimal cost for a pair (v1 in group_d, v2 in group_xd) such that either:\n        (a) v1's end < v2's start, OR\n        (b) v2's end < v1's start.\n\n    But note: we are allowed to assign the two durations arbitrarily. However, since the two durations are fixed (d and x-d), we can do:\n\n        For each voucher in group_d, we look for a voucher in group_xd that starts after the voucher's end (for condition (a)) OR a voucher in group_xd that ends before the voucher's start (for condition (b)).\n\n    However, condition (b) is: if we have a voucher in group_xd that ends before the current voucher's start, then the two are disjoint. Similarly, condition (a) is: if we have a voucher in group_xd that starts after the current voucher's end.\n\n    But note: the two conditions are independent. However, we cannot mix the same voucher twice.\n\n 9. We can do:\n\n        For each duration d (from 1 to x-1):\n            Let d1 = d, d2 = x-d.\n            We have two groups: group_d and group_xd (if d2 is out of range, skip).\n\n            Then, we want to consider two scenarios:\n\n                Scenario 1: We take a voucher from group_d and a voucher from group_xd such that the voucher from group_d ends before the voucher from group_xd starts.\n                    For a voucher v in group_d, we require that the next voucher w in group_xd has w.l > v.r.\n\n                Scenario 2: We take a voucher from group_d and a voucher from group_xd such that the voucher from group_xd ends before the voucher from group_d starts.\n                    For a voucher v in group_d, we require that there exists w in group_xd with w.r < v.l.\n\n            But wait: actually, the two conditions are:\n\n                Condition (a): [v] (duration d) and [w] (duration x-d) are disjoint if w.l > v.r OR w.r < v.l.\n\n            However, note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive? Actually, no: it's the standard disjoint condition. But we can split into two separate queries.\n\n            However, we can restructure: \n\n                We want the minimal total cost for two vouchers (one from d, one from x-d) such that they are disjoint.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                For group_d, we can sort by r (end) and then for each voucher v in group_d, we look in group_xd for a voucher w such that w.l > v.r (for condition (a)) and then take the minimal cost for such w.\n\n                Similarly, we can sort group_xd by l (start) and then for each voucher v in group_d, we look in group_xd for a voucher w such that w.r < v.l (condition (b)).\n\n            But note: the two conditions are independent and we are allowed to choose any two. However, we must not count the same pair twice.\n\n            However, observe: a pair (v, w) will satisfy exactly one of the conditions (unless they are disjoint in both ways? Actually, no: if one condition holds, the other doesn't because the intervals are disjoint only if one is entirely to the left of the other). So a pair is disjoint if and only if one condition holds. But note: the condition is \"at least one\", so if both hold, that's still disjoint. However, if both hold, then the two intervals are separated by two gaps? Actually, no: if one interval is entirely to the left and the other entirely to the right, then the condition holds. But if one is to the left and they don't touch, then condition (a) holds. If one is to the right and they don't touch, condition (b) holds. But note: if the two intervals are such that [v] is [1,3] and [w] is [4,6], then condition (a) holds (because 3<4). Also, condition (b) does not hold because 6>=1. Similarly, if [w] is [7,9] then condition (a) holds and condition (b) doesn't.\n\n            However, what if [v] is [1,3] and [w] is [5,6]? Then condition (a): 3<5 -> holds. Condition (b): 6>=1 -> doesn't hold.\n\n            What if [v] is [3,5] and [w] is [1,2]? Then condition (b): 2<3 -> holds.\n\n            So we can handle the two conditions separately and then combine.\n\n            But note: the two conditions are not symmetric in the groups: we are taking one from group_d and one from group_xd. However, we must consider both orders? Actually, no: we are fixing the duration d and x-d. But the two conditions are:\n\n                Condition (a): w.l > v.r   (v from group_d, w from group_xd)\n                Condition (b): w.r < v.l   (v from group_d, w from group_xd)\n\n            However, we can also consider: what if we swap the roles? Actually, the problem does not assign which voucher is taken first. But note: the condition is symmetric. However, when we fix the durations, we are effectively considering one way. But wait: the two conditions are:\n\n                Condition (a): [v] is entirely to the left of [w]\n                Condition (b): [w] is entirely to the left of [v]\n\n            But note: the durations are fixed: d and x-d. So if we consider condition (a) for (v, w) then we are effectively having the voucher of duration d on the left and the voucher of duration x-d on the right. Similarly, condition (b) would have the voucher of duration x-d on the left and the voucher of duration d on the right. But wait, we are considering the same two vouchers? Actually, no: because the durations are fixed, we cannot swap the durations. However, note that the problem does not specify which voucher is taken first. But the condition is about the time intervals.\n\n            Actually, the two conditions are for the same two vouchers, but the condition is defined without assigning which voucher is which. However, the two conditions are:\n\n                Condition (a): the entire first voucher (with duration d) ends before the second voucher (with duration x-d) starts.\n                Condition (b): the entire second voucher (with duration x-d) ends before the first voucher (with duration d) starts.\n\n            But note: we are not forced to assign the voucher with duration d as the first one. The condition is just about the two intervals. So we can have two possibilities:\n\n                Possibility 1: The voucher with duration d is entirely to the left of the voucher with duration x-d.\n                Possibility 2: The voucher with duration x-d is entirely to the left of the voucher with duration d.\n\n            Therefore, we must consider both.\n\n            However, note: we are iterating over d and x-d. In our iteration, we consider d and x-d. But if we consider d and x-d, then we are effectively considering:\n\n                Group_d: duration d\n                Group_xd: duration x-d\n\n            Then we consider condition (a): for a voucher in group_d, we look for a voucher in group_xd that starts after the end of the first.\n\n            Condition (b): for a voucher in group_d, we look for a voucher in group_xd that ends before the start of the first.\n\n            But wait, condition (b) is the same as: the voucher from group_xd is entirely to the left of the voucher from group_d. And condition (a) is the opposite.\n\n            However, note: if we consider the same two groups, then condition (a) and (b) are independent and we can compute both.\n\n            But we must be cautious: we are only considering the two groups. We don't need to consider swapping the durations because we are iterating over all d from 1 to x-1. However, if we consider d and x-d, then when d' = x-d, we would consider the same two groups again (but then we would get the same pairs). Therefore, we must avoid double counting. But note: the problem requires two distinct vouchers, and the two groups are distinct (unless d = x-d, then we have the same group). \n\n            How to handle d = x-d?\n                Then we are looking for two distinct vouchers from the same group (with duration d = x/2). Then we must ensure that we don't pick the same voucher twice.\n\n            But note: the problem says two distinct vouchers.\n\n            So we have two cases:\n\n                Case 1: d != x-d: Then we consider group_d and group_xd separately. Each pair (v, w) with v in group_d and w in group_xd is considered once.\n\n                Case 2: d == x-d: Then we are looking for two distinct vouchers from the same group. Then we must consider the same group twice? Actually, we are iterating d from 1 to x-1, so when d = x-d, then x must be even and d = x/2. Then we are looking at the same group. Then we must consider two distinct vouchers from that group that are disjoint.\n\n            However, note: the condition for two distinct vouchers from the same group (both duration d, and d+d = x) is that they are disjoint.\n\n            But we can handle both cases by:\n\n                For each duration d (from 1 to floor((x-1)/2) and then separately for d from ceil(x/2) to x-1? Actually, we can iterate d from 1 to x//2 (inclusive) and then if d == x-d, then we use the same group, otherwise two different groups.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate d from 1 to x-1, and then:\n\n                if d < x-d: we process (d, x-d) and then later we will process (x-d, d) but that's the same pair? Actually, we must avoid processing the same pair twice. But note: the two conditions (a) and (b) are independent and we are considering the two groups separately. However, the two groups are the same when d = x-d. Otherwise, we are processing two distinct groups, and the pairs (v from d, w from x-d) are different from (w from x-d, v from d) only if we swap the roles. But in our conditions, we are fixing the role: for condition (a) we require that the voucher from d is to the left, and for condition (b) we require the opposite. So we are covering both orders.\n\n            However, wait: we are not swapping the groups. We are always taking the first voucher from group_d and the second from group_xd. Then we are checking two conditions for the same assignment: \n                Condition (a): group_d's voucher ends before group_xd's starts.\n                Condition (b): group_xd's voucher ends before group_d's starts.\n\n            But note: condition (b) is: the entire group_xd voucher is to the left of the group_d voucher. This is the same as if we had swapped the groups? \n\n            Actually, we are not swapping the groups. We are considering the same two groups and two conditions. But the two conditions are independent and we are covering both orders.\n\n            However, if we do:\n\n                For d from 1 to x-1:\n                    d1 = d, d2 = x-d\n\n            Then when d is less than x-d, we process (d, x-d). Then when d becomes x-d (if x-d is between 1 and x-1) we process (x-d, d) which is the same as (d, x-d) because we are iterating d from 1 to x-1. So we would process the same pair of groups twice.\n\n            To avoid that, we can iterate d from 1 to (x-1)//2 (integer division) and then if x-d is within [1, x-1] and d <= x-d, then we process. But wait, we must process both cases: when d < x-d and when d == x-d.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate d from 1 to (x-1) and then only process if d <= x-d. Then we cover every unordered pair of durations (d, x-d) exactly once. But note: if we do that, then we are missing the case when d > x-d? Actually, no: because if d > x-d, then x-d < d, and we would have already processed the pair (x-d, d) when d was x-d (but then we would have required d <= x-d, which is false). \n\n            So we can restrict d from 1 to floor(x/2). Then:\n\n                For d in range(1, (x//2)+1):\n                    Let d1 = d, d2 = x - d.\n\n                    Then, if d1 == d2, then we are using the same group. Otherwise, we use two different groups.\n\n            But wait, if x is odd, then d runs from 1 to floor(x/2). For example, x=5: d from 1 to 2 (because 5//2 = 2). Then d2 for d=1 is 4, for d=2 is 3.\n\n            However, what if we have a duration d that is greater than x-d? Then we skip? Actually, we don't need to process because the same pair is covered by the smaller d. But note: we are iterating by d from 1 to floor(x/2). Then we cover:\n\n                d=1, d2=4 (for x=5)\n                d=2, d2=3 (for x=5)\n\n            And then we don't process d=3,4,5,... but that's okay because the pairs (3,2) and (4,1) are the same as (1,4) and (2,3) respectively.\n\n            However, note: the condition for two vouchers is independent of the order. But our conditions (a) and (b) are defined for a fixed assignment: the first voucher from group_d and the second from group_xd. \n\n            But wait: if we are considering (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) as the same, then we are effectively covering the same pairs. However, the two conditions (a) and (b) are defined differently. \n\n            Actually, no: condition (a) for (d, x-d) is: [voucher from d] ends before [voucher from x-d] starts.\n            Condition (b) for (d, x-d) is: [voucher from x-d] ends before [voucher from d] starts.\n\n            Now, if we consider the same two vouchers but swap the groups, then we are effectively considering the same two intervals, but the conditions become:\n\n                Condition (a) for (x-d, d): [voucher from x-d] ends before [voucher from d] starts -> this is condition (b) for the original (d, x-d) assignment.\n                Condition (b) for (x-d, d): [voucher from d] ends before [voucher from x-d] starts -> this is condition (a) for the original (d, x-d) assignment.\n\n            But wait, we are not swapping the groups arbitrarily: we are processing the same two groups in two different orders. However, we are not doing that: we are only processing (d, x-d) for d from 1 to floor(x/2). So we are processing the two groups without swapping.\n\n            However, note: the two conditions (a) and (b) are necessary and sufficient for the two intervals to be disjoint. And we are processing each unordered pair of groups (d, x-d) once. But in our processing, we are considering two conditions for the same assignment (d, x-d). \n\n            But what if we have two different assignments for the same two intervals? Actually, we are considering the two conditions for the same assignment (d, x-d). That is, we are considering:\n\n                Condition (a): [d] is left of [x-d]\n                Condition (b): [x-d] is left of [d]\n\n            And these two conditions are independent and together they cover the entire disjointness condition for the two intervals. \n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                For d from 1 to (x//2) (inclusive) [if x is even, then d goes up to x//2; if x is odd, then d goes up to (x-1)//2]:\n\n                    Let d1 = d, d2 = x - d.\n\n                    If d1 == d2, then we are working with one group (the same). Then we must consider two distinct vouchers from that group that are disjoint.\n\n                    Else, we have two groups.\n\n            But wait: if we are processing d from 1 to floor(x/2), then for d1 < d2, we process (d1, d2). And we don't process (d2, d1) because d2 is greater than d1 and we are only going up to floor(x/2). However, we are covering both conditions (a) and (b) for the same two groups (without swapping the groups). \n\n            However, note: condition (a) and (b) are defined for a fixed assignment of durations to the two groups. So we are not missing any disjoint pair.\n\n            Example: \n                Consider two vouchers: \n                    voucher1: (l1, r1) with duration d1 (smaller)\n                    voucher2: (l2, r2) with duration d2 (larger)\n\n                Then the two conditions are:\n                    Condition (a): r1 < l2   -> then they are disjoint (v1 is entirely to the left of v2)\n                    Condition (b): r2 < l1   -> then they are disjoint (v2 is entirely to the left of v1)\n\n                But note: the condition (b) requires that the larger-duration voucher ends before the start of the smaller one. This is a very strict condition: the entire longer voucher must be to the left of the entire shorter one.\n\n            But wait: what if the two durations are the same? Then we are processing d1 = d2 = x/2. Then we are considering two distinct vouchers from the same group. Then the conditions become:\n\n                Condition (a): r1 < l2   -> then the first voucher (from the group) is to the left of the second.\n                Condition (b): r2 < l1   -> then the second voucher is to the left of the first.\n\n            But note: the two conditions are independent and we can use either. However, we cannot use the same voucher twice.\n\n 10. Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Preprocessing.\n\n            Read n, x.\n            For each voucher, read (l, r, cost). Compute duration = r-l+1.\n\n            Create a dictionary: groups = {}\n            For each voucher (l, r, cost, duration d):\n                groups[d] = list of (l, r, cost)\n\n            Also, we need to index the groups by duration.\n\n        Step 2: For d from 1 to (x//2) (inclusive):\n\n            Let d1 = d, d2 = x - d.\n\n            If d2 not in groups and d1 not in groups: skip.\n\n            Now, we have two cases:\n\n                Case A: d1 == d2 (i.e., x is even and d1 = x/2)\n                    Then we are using the same group for both. We need to find two distinct vouchers from groups[d1] that are disjoint.\n\n                    How to do that efficiently?\n\n                    We can sort the group by l (or by r) and then use two pointers or binary search.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can precompute for each group (for a fixed duration d) a sorted list of the intervals by l and by r.\n\n                    Then, for a voucher (l, r) in the group, we want to find another voucher (l', r') such that either:\n                        r < l'   (then the first is entirely to the left of the second) OR\n                        r' < l   (then the second is entirely to the left of the first)\n\n                    But note: the condition for two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] to be disjoint is that one ends before the other starts. Since the durations are the same, we can also consider the relative positions.\n\n                    However, we can do:\n\n                        Sort the group by l (the start). Then for each voucher (l, r) (we skip the same voucher), we can:\n\n                            Condition (a): find a voucher with l' > r (entirely to the right) -> then we can take the minimal cost voucher among those that start after r.\n\n                            Condition (b): find a voucher with r' < l (entirely to the left) -> then we can take the minimal cost voucher among those that end before l.\n\n                    But note: the same voucher cannot be used twice.\n\n                    However, we are storing the entire list. We can precompute for the group (for each duration) two sorted lists:\n\n                        sorted_by_start: list of (l, r, cost) sorted by l.\n                        sorted_by_end: list of (r, l, cost) sorted by r? Or we can store separately.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can precompute for each group a sorted list by l and then by r? Actually, we want to quickly query:\n\n                        Condition (a): Given a voucher (l, r) (from the same group, duration d), we want to find a voucher (l', r') such that l' > r. We can store all vouchers by their start. Then we can do:\n\n                            In sorted_by_start (by l), we can find the first voucher with l' >= some value. Specifically, we want l' > r.\n\n                            Then, we can also precompute the minimum cost for vouchers in the group that have l' > r.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can precompute for the entire group (for duration d) a data structure that allows:\n\n                        Query1: Find the minimal cost voucher in the group with start > r (for condition (a)).\n                        Query2: Find the minimal cost voucher in the group with end < l (for condition (b)).\n\n                    How to do that?\n\n                    We can precompute for each group (for each distinct duration) two arrays:\n\n                        sorted_starts = sorted(l for (l, r, cost) in group[d])\n                        But we need to store the entire tuple and then extract the cost.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can create two dictionaries for each group:\n\n                        min_cost_by_start_greater = ... ?\n\n                    Actually, we can do:\n\n                        For the same group (same duration d), we want to answer:\n\n                            Query1: For a given r (from a voucher in the group), find the minimal cost of a voucher in the group with l' > r.\n\n                            Query2: For a given l (from a voucher in the group), find the minimal cost of a voucher in the group with r' < l.\n\n                    We can precompute:\n\n                        For Query1: \n                            Sort the group by l (start). Then we can create an array of (l, cost) and then for each l, we want to know the minimal cost for any voucher with l >= some value. Then we can do:\n\n                                sorted_l = sorted(l for (l, r, cost) in group[d])\n                                Then, we can create an array of costs and then do a suffix minimum array (from high l to low l) for the minimal cost.\n\n                        Similarly, for Query2: \n                            Sort the group by r (end). Then we can create an array of (r, cost) and then for each r, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with r <= some value. Then we can do a prefix minimum array.\n\n                    However, we have to be careful: we are storing the entire list of vouchers for the group.\n\n                    Steps for same group (d1 == d2):\n\n                        Let arr = list of (l, r, cost) for duration d1.\n\n                        Build two arrays:\n\n                            By start (l): \n                                sorted_by_l = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                                Then, we can extract the starts and the costs. Then, we can do:\n\n                                    starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_l]\n                                    costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_l]\n                                    Then, build an array min_suffix[i] = minimum cost from i to the end (in terms of increasing l).\n\n                            Then, for a voucher (l0, r0, cost0) in the group, we want to find the minimal cost for a voucher with l > r0.\n\n                            We can do a binary search in starts for the first index where starts[i] > r0, then take min_suffix[i] (if exists).\n\n                        Similarly, by end (r):\n                                sorted_by_r = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                                ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_r]\n                                costs_by_r = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_r]\n                                Then, build a prefix minimum array: min_prefix[i] = minimum cost from 0 to i (in terms of increasing r).\n\n                            Then, for a voucher (l0, r0, cost0), we want to find the minimal cost for a voucher with r < l0.\n\n                            Binary search in ends for the last index where ends[i] < l0, then take min_prefix[i] (if exists).\n\n                        Then, for each voucher in the group, we compute:\n\n                            candidate1 = Query1: minimal cost for a voucher with start > r0 (using the by_start structure)\n                            candidate2 = Query2: minimal cost for a voucher with end < l0 (using the by_end structure)\n\n                            Then the minimal cost for this voucher is min(candidate1, candidate2) [if both exist]\n\n                        Then we take the minimum over all vouchers.\n\n                    However, note: we must not use the same voucher twice. But the queries are over the entire group (including itself). So we have to exclude the current voucher.\n\n                    But wait: the condition for disjointness requires two distinct vouchers. So we must not consider the same voucher.\n\n                    How to exclude the current voucher?\n\n                    We can store the entire list and then remove the current voucher from the group for the query? That would be too slow.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can precompute the entire group and then for each voucher, we consider the entire group except itself? But we are building a static structure for the group.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        Precompute the entire group's structure (min_suffix and min_prefix) without removing any.\n\n                        Then, when querying for a voucher, we get the minimal cost from the entire group (which might include itself). Then we must compare with the current voucher's cost? Actually, no: the condition for disjointness does not require distinctness? Actually, the problem says two distinct vouchers. So we must not use the same voucher.\n\n                    Therefore, we must ensure that the voucher we pick is not the same as the current one.\n\n                    But note: the condition for disjointness of two intervals: if we use the same voucher twice, then the intervals are [l, r] and [l, r] -> they are not disjoint unless the interval is empty? Actually, the condition is: at least one of the following: r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1. If the same voucher, then r1 = r and l2 = l, so r1 < l2 becomes r < l -> false. Similarly, r2 < l1 becomes r < l -> false. So the same voucher is not disjoint.\n\n                    Therefore, we must not consider the same voucher. \n\n                    But our query method (using the entire group) might return the same voucher. How to avoid?\n\n                    Idea: we can store the entire group and then for each voucher, we can temporarily remove it and then query? But that would be O(n^2) per group.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can store the entire group and then when we do the query, we remember that the minimal cost from the entire group might be from the same voucher. Then we can do:\n\n                        candidate1 = minimal cost for a voucher with start > r0 (from the entire group) \n                        candidate2 = minimal cost for a voucher with end < l0 (from the entire group)\n\n                    Then, if the minimal cost voucher we found is the current voucher, then we must look for the next best.\n\n                    But wait: the same voucher has l0 and r0. In the by_start structure, we have a voucher with l = l0. We are querying for l > r0. Since r0 = l0 + d1 - 1 (because the duration is d1 = r0-l0+1) and d1>=1, then r0 = l0 + d1 - 1 >= l0. So we require l' > r0 >= l0. Therefore, the same voucher (l0) is not included because l0 <= r0, so we are safe for condition (a): the same voucher has l0 <= r0, so we require l' > r0, so the same voucher is not included.\n\n                    Similarly, for condition (b): we require r' < l0. The same voucher has r0 = l0 + d1 - 1 >= l0, so r0 >= l0, so the same voucher is not included.\n\n                    Therefore, we don't need to worry about excluding the same voucher in the same group (when d1==d2). \n\n                    But wait: what if there are two identical vouchers? Then we have two vouchers with the same (l, r, cost). Then they are distinct. So we can use two different vouchers with the same (l, r, cost). And the condition (a) for the first and (b) for the second? \n\n                    Example: two vouchers: [1,3,4] and [1,3,4] (same). Then condition (a): the first ends at 3, the second starts at 1 -> 3 < 1? No. Condition (b): the second ends at 3, the first starts at 1 -> 3 < 1? No. So they are not disjoint.\n\n                    Therefore, even if the vouchers are identical, they are not disjoint. But note: the problem requires two distinct vouchers. However, two distinct vouchers with the same interval are not disjoint.\n\n                    So our query for condition (a) and (b) naturally excludes the same voucher because the condition is strict (l' > r0) and (r' < l0). And the same voucher has l0 and r0 such that r0 = l0 + d1 - 1, so l0 <= r0, so condition (a) requires l' > r0 >= l0, so the same voucher is excluded. Similarly, condition (b) requires r' < l0, and the same voucher has r0 = l0 + d1 - 1 >= l0, so it's excluded.\n\n                    However, what if there are two different vouchers with the same (l, r)? Then they are not the same voucher (because they are distinct) but they have the same interval. Then condition (a) and (b) still fail. So we are safe.\n\n                    But note: the problem says \"two distinct vouchers\". The input may contain duplicate vouchers? The problem does not say they are distinct. So we must account for duplicates.\n\n                    However, our grouping by duration does not distinguish by the entire voucher. But we are storing all vouchers.\n\n                    So we are okay.\n\n                Case B: d1 != d2.\n\n                    Then we have two groups: group_d1 and group_d2.\n\n                    We need to consider two conditions:\n\n                        Condition (a): For a voucher v in group_d1, we require a voucher w in group_d2 such that w.l > v.r.\n                        Condition (b): For a voucher v in group_d1, we require a voucher w in group_d2 such that w.r < v.l.\n\n                    But note: condition (b) is the same as: the entire group_d2 voucher is to the left of the group_d1 voucher.\n\n                    We can precompute for group_d2:\n\n                        Structure for condition (a): \n                            We want to quickly find the minimal cost voucher in group_d2 with l > some value.\n\n                            Steps:\n                                Sort group_d2 by l (start). Then, we can create an array of (l, cost) and then a suffix minimum array (from high l to low l) so that for a given l0, we can find the minimal cost for a voucher with l >= l0? Actually, we need l > v.r (which is a specific value). \n\n                            Similarly, for condition (b):\n                                We want to find the minimal cost voucher in group_d2 with r < some value (v.l).\n\n                    However, note: we are iterating over all vouchers in group_d1. We can precompute for group_d2:\n\n                        For condition (a): \n                            Let arr_d2 = list of (l, r, cost) for group_d2.\n                            Sort by l, then create an array of l's and an array of the same length storing the minimal cost from that index to the end (suffix minimum by l).\n\n                        Then, for a voucher v from group_d1 (with r = r_v), we want the minimal cost in group_d2 with l > r_v.\n\n                        We can do:\n\n                            Use binary search to find the first index in the sorted-by-l array of group_d2 such that l > r_v.\n\n                        Similarly, for condition (b):\n                            Sort group_d2 by r (end). Then create a prefix minimum array (by r) so that for a given l",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping the vouchers by their durations and then checking for compatible pairs that meet the non-overlapping condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to quickly access all vouchers of a specific duration when needed.\n2. **Handling Same and Different Durations**: For each possible duration `d` (from 1 to `x//2`), we check if there exists another voucher with duration `x - d`. If `d` equals `x - d`, we handle the case where both vouchers have the same duration. Otherwise, we handle the case where the two vouchers have different durations.\n3. **Non-Overlapping Condition**: For each voucher in the first group, we search in the second group for a voucher that does not overlap with it. This involves checking if the end of the first voucher is before the start of the second (or vice versa) using binary search on pre-sorted lists of start and end times.\n4. **Cost Minimization**: For each valid pair of vouchers, we keep track of the minimal total cost encountered during the search.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_right, bisect_left\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    intervals = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        intervals.append((l, r, cost_val))\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for l, r, cost_val in intervals:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        if d not in groups:\n            groups[d] = []\n        groups[d].append((l, r, cost_val))\n    \n    ans = float('inf')\n    processed_durations = set()\n    \n    for d1 in range(1, x // 2 + 1):\n        if d1 in processed_durations:\n            continue\n        d2 = x - d1\n        processed_durations.add(d1)\n        processed_durations.add(d2)\n        \n        if d1 == d2:\n            if d1 not in groups:\n                continue\n            arr = groups[d1]\n            if len(arr) < 2:\n                continue\n                \n            sorted_by_l = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: x[0])\n            starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_l]\n            costs_arr = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_l]\n            suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_l)\n            suffix_min[-1] = costs_arr[-1]\n            for i in range(len(sorted_by_l)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(costs_arr[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n                \n            sorted_by_r = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: x[1])\n            ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_r]\n            prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_r)\n            prefix_min[0] = costs_arr_sorted[0]\n            for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_r)):\n                prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], costs_arr_sorted[i])\n            \n            for (l, r, cost_val) in arr:\n                pos = bisect_right(starts, r)\n                if pos < len(starts):\n                    candidate_cost = suffix_min[pos]\n                    if candidate_cost != cost_val:\n                        ans = min(ans, cost_val + candidate_cost)\n                pos2 = bisect_left(ends, l) - 1\n                if pos2 >= 0 and pos2 < len(ends):\n                    candidate_cost2 = prefix_min[pos2]\n                    if candidate_cost2 != cost_val:\n                        ans = min(ans, cost_val + candidate_cost2)\n        else:\n            if d1 not in groups or d2 not in groups:\n                continue\n            group1 = groups[d1]\n            group2 = groups[d2]\n            \n            if not group1 or not group2:\n                continue\n                \n            sorted_group2_by_start = sorted(group2, key=lambda x: x[0])\n            starts2 = [v[0] for v in sorted_group2_by_start]\n            costs2 = [v[2] for v in sorted_group2_by_start]\n            suffix_min2 = [0] * len(sorted_group2_by_start)\n            suffix_min2[-1] = costs2[-1]\n            for i in range(len(sorted_group2_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min2[i] = min(costs2[i], suffix_min2[i+1])\n                \n            sorted_group2_by_end = sorted(group2, key=lambda x: x[1])\n            ends2 = [v[1] for v in sorted_group2_by_end]\n            costs2_end = [v[2] for v in sorted_group2_by_end]\n            prefix_min2 = [0] * len(sorted_group2_by_end)\n            prefix_min2[0] = costs2_end[0]\n            for i in range(1, len(sorted_group2_by_end)):\n                prefix_min2[i] = min(prefix_min2[i-1], costs2_end[i])\n                \n            for (l1, r1, cost1) in group1:\n                pos_start = bisect_right(starts2, r1)\n                if pos_start < len(starts2):\n                    cand1 = suffix_min2[pos_start]\n                    ans = min(ans, cost1 + cand1)\n                pos_end = bisect_left(ends2, l1) - 1\n                if pos_end >= 0:\n                    cand2 = prefix_min2[pos_end]\n                    ans = min(ans, cost1 + cand2)\n                    \n    if ans == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The input is read and parsed into a list of tuples, each representing a voucher's start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration (end day - start day + 1) into a dictionary where keys are durations and values are lists of voucher details.\n3. **Processing Durations**: For each duration `d` from 1 to `x//2`, the algorithm checks for the complementary duration `x - d`. If both durations are the same, it processes vouchers within the same group; otherwise, it processes vouchers from two different groups.\n4. **Binary Search for Non-Overlap**: For each voucher in the first group, the algorithm uses binary search to find vouchers in the second group that do not overlap (either ending before the start of the first voucher or starting after the end of the first voucher). The minimal cost for valid pairs is tracked.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all possible pairs, the minimal total cost is printed if valid pairs exist; otherwise, `-1` is printed indicating no solution. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
