For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (tone index) in a 12-note circle.\n    Let's assign:\n        C: 0\n        C#: 1\n        D: 2\n        D#: 3\n        E: 4\n        F: 5\n        F#: 6\n        G: 7\n        G#: 8\n        A: 9\n        B: 10\n        H: 11   # Note: In some systems, H is B, but here we have 12 notes and the problem says after H is C, so we use 0-based index.\n\n 2. However, note that the input might have sharps and the example includes 'C#', 'B', and 'F'. Also, the example ordering: \n    For \"C E G\": \n        C -> 0, E -> 4, G -> 7.\n    Then we can arrange the notes in increasing order (but cyclic). But wait: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest, and the scale is cyclic.\n\n 3. Since the chord is an unordered set, we need to check for all permutations? Actually, we can consider the 12-tone circle and then take the distances modulo 12.\n\n 4. We are to check for two patterns (for major and minor) in the circular arrangement.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\", and similarly for minor.\n\n Important: the entire circle has 12 tones, so the distance from a note to itself is 0, and then going forward (clockwise) we have 12 tones.\n\n But note: the distance from E to C: \n    E is at 4, then next notes: F(5), F#(6), G(7), G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), C(0). \n    From 4 to 0: if we go up: from 4 to 0 by wrapping around: 12 - (4-0) = 12 - 4 = 8? Actually, the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (as given in the example).\n\n So we define a function to compute the shortest distance in the circle? But note: the problem defines the distance from the lowest tone to the uppest one. However, the example says from E to C is 8, which is the upward direction? Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\".\n\n However, when forming the chord, we are allowed to order arbitrarily. So we should consider the three notes and look for an ordering (a cyclic shift) such that the intervals are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Map the input notes to their indices.\n\n 2. Since the chord is cyclic, we can arrange the three notes in sorted order (in terms of the circular arrangement) but we must consider the circularity.\n\n 3. We have three distinct notes (since a chord is a set, and the problem says triad, so three distinct notes). But wait: what if there are duplicates? The problem says \"unordered set\", so we assume distinct.\n\n 4. We can do:\n\n    Let the three notes be represented by three numbers a, b, c.\n\n    We can arrange them in increasing order (on a circle) by considering the circular arrangement.\n\n    Alternatively, we can fix one note and then consider the other two in the circle. But note: the chord definition does not require consecutive notes in the original circle, but consecutive in the ordered triplet.\n\n    We can generate the six permutations (orderings) of the three notes, and for each ordering (x, y, z) we check:\n\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12   [if negative, adjust by adding 12 and then mod 12?]\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n        But wait: the problem does not require the entire octave, just the distance in the musical scale from the lowest to the highest. However, we are allowed to wrap around.\n\n    However, note the example: \"C E G\" -> C=0, E=4, G=7. Then the distances: 4 and 3 (from 0 to 4:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves analyzing the intervals (distances) between the notes in their ordered sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to a unique index in a 12-note chromatic scale. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, up to 'H' which is 11.\n2. **Handling Input**: The input consists of three space-separated notes. We parse these notes and convert them into their corresponding indices.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Since the chord is unordered, we consider all possible orderings of the three notes to check for the major and minor chord patterns.\n4. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation of the three notes, we calculate the intervals between consecutive notes. A major chord requires intervals of 4 and 3 semitones, while a minor chord requires intervals of 3 and 4 semitones.\n5. **Decision Making**: If any permutation matches the major or minor pattern, we classify the chord accordingly. If no permutation matches either pattern, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_map = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    a, b, c = data\n    \n    def get_index(note):\n        if note in notes_map:\n            return notes_map[note]\n        return None\n    \n    try:\n        x = get_index(a)\n        y = get_index(b)\n        z = get_index(c)\n    except:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n    \n    if x is None or y is None or z is None:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations([x, y, z]):\n        p1, p2, p3 = perm\n        d1 = (p2 - p1) % 12\n        d2 = (p3 - p2) % 12\n        total = d1 + d2\n        if total == 7 and d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if total == 7 and d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_map` dictionary assigns each note to its corresponding position in the 12-note scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is split into three parts, each representing a note. These notes are converted to their respective indices using the `get_index` function.\n3. **Permutations Check**: All six possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each ordering, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated modulo 12 to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Pattern Recognition**: The intervals for each permutation are checked against the major (4 and 3 semitones) and minor (3 and 4 semitones) chord patterns. If a match is found, the corresponding flag (`found_major` or `found_minor`) is set.\n5. **Result Determination**: Based on the flags, the program outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if no valid pattern is found. This approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the notes to determine the chord type.",
