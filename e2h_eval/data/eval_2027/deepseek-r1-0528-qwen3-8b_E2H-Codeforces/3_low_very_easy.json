Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers for the lantern positions.\n The idea is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps between the lanterns and also the edges (from 0 to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to l).\n\n However, note that the problem states that the street is from 0 to l, and the lanterns can be at any points (including 0 and l).\n\n Approach:\n - The entire street must be covered. We can break the problem into:\n   a) The gap from the start (0) to the first lantern.\n   b) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   c) The gap from the last lantern to the end (l).\n\n For a) and c): \n   - The required d for the leftmost part is from 0 to the first lantern: we need d >= (first_lantern - 0)/2? \n     Actually, note: the lantern at position a0 lights from (a0 - d) to (a0 + d). To cover 0, we require a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0.\n     But wait, if we set d = a0, then the left side of the first lantern covers from 0 to a0 + a0, but actually we don't need to cover beyond a0 to the right with this one.\n\n However, let's think differently:\n\n We can consider the entire street as being covered if for every point x in [0, l], there exists a lantern at position a_i such that |x - a_i| <= d.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the maximum gap that must be covered by the light. Note that the light from a lantern extends d to the left and d to the right.\n\n Steps in detail:\n\n 1. Sort the lantern positions: let's call the sorted list `lanterns`.\n 2. Check the leftmost coverage: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must extend from 0 to itself. So the required d for the left edge is (lanterns[0] - 0) / 2? Actually, no: the first lantern must cover 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is `lanterns[0]`. So the light must reach 0, which means d must be at least `lanterns[0]` (because from the lantern at `lanterns[0]`, we go left by `lanterns[0]` to 0). But wait, if we have multiple lanterns, we might not need the first lantern to cover the entire left edge by itself.\n\n Actually, we can consider the entire coverage as:\n\n   The street is covered if:\n     - The leftmost lantern's left boundary is <= 0 (which is automatically satisfied if d>=lanterns[0] because the left boundary is lanterns[0]-d, so we require lanterns[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=lanterns[0]).\n     - Similarly, the rightmost lantern's right boundary must be >= l, so d >= (l - lanterns[-1]).\n\n But also the gaps between lanterns: between two consecutive lanterns, say at positions a and b (a < b), the gap is (b - a). The entire gap must be covered by the two adjacent lanterns. The middle of the gap is (a+d) and (b-d) must meet or overlap. Actually, the two lanterns together must cover from a-d to b+d. The condition for the gap is that the light from the left lantern must extend to at least the right lantern, i.e., a + d >= b - d  => 2*d >= (b - a). So d must be at least (b - a)/2.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   candidate1 = lanterns[0]   # because we need to cover from 0 to lanterns[0]\n   candidate2 = l - lanterns[-1] # because we need to cover from lanterns[-1] to l\n\n   candidate3 = for each consecutive pair (lanterns[i], lanterns[i+1]): (lanterns[i+1] - lanterns[i]) / 2\n\n Then the answer is the maximum of these candidates? \n\n But note: for the edges, we don't require d to be exactly the entire length, but the condition is:\n\n   For the left edge: d must be at least lanterns[0] (so that the first lantern reaches 0). However, if we set d = lanterns[0], then the first lantern covers [0, 2*lanterns[0]].\n\n   For the right edge: d must be at least (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are positioned at specific points along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This allows us to systematically analyze the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges of the street.\n2. **Check Edge Conditions**: The entire street must be covered from both ends (0 to the first lantern and the last lantern to `l`). The required `d` for these edge conditions is the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0) and from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n3. **Analyze Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap that needs to be covered by their combined light is half the distance between them. This ensures that the light from adjacent lanterns overlaps sufficiently to cover the space between them without any unlit gaps.\n4. **Determine Minimum `d`**: The solution involves finding the maximum value among the three computed values: the left edge coverage, the right edge coverage, and the largest gap coverage between consecutive lanterns. This ensures that all parts of the street are adequately lit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    positions = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    positions.sort()\n    \n    left_gap = positions[0]  # d must be at least this to cover from 0 to the first lantern\n    right_gap = l - positions[-1]\n    \n    max_mid_gap = 0.0\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n        mid_gap_needed = gap / 2.0\n        if mid_gap_needed > max_mid_gap:\n            max_mid_gap = mid_gap_needed\n            \n    candidates = [left_gap, right_gap, max_mid_gap]\n    d = max(candidates)\n    \n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns. These values are read from standard input.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the analysis of gaps between them and the edges of the street.\n3. **Edge Conditions**: The left edge condition requires `d` to be at least the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0). Similarly, the right edge condition requires `d` to be at least the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (`l`).\n4. **Gap Analysis**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap that needs to be covered is half the distance between them. This ensures that the light from adjacent lanterns overlaps sufficiently.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum `d` required to light the entire street is the maximum value among the left edge, right edge, and the largest gap coverage values. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to ensure the entire street is lit, leveraging sorting and gap analysis to determine the optimal `d`.",
