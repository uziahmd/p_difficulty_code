He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string only contains 'a', 'b', 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends 'c' so there might be no 'c'? Actually, the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (or both). However, note that the problem states that A gives a string of only 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's.\n\n But note: the example input \"aabc\" is valid. Let's break down the process:\n\n Steps:\n - The initial string from A: consists of some number of 'a's (at least one).\n - Then B appends some number of 'b's (at least one? The problem says \"some number\", but the note says at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist. So after B, we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n - Then C appends some number of 'c's, which must be equal to the total count of 'a' OR the total count of 'b' in the entire string (which includes the original 'a's and the appended 'b's, and note that the 'c' count is set by the current total counts).\n\n However, note that the entire string must satisfy:\n   - All 'a's must come first (from A) and then 'b's (from B) and then 'c's (from C). Why? Because A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's.\n\n Therefore, the string should be divided into three segments:\n   [all 'a's] -> [all 'b's] -> [all 'c's]\n\n But wait, what if there are no 'b's? Then the condition fails because the problem states that B appends some number (so at least one) of 'b's? Actually, the problem says: \"they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist\". So after B, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the entire string to be split into three non-empty contiguous parts? Actually, the process is:\n   A: string of 'a's (non-empty)\n   B: appends some 'b's (so now the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b')\n   C: appends some 'c's (which must be either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b' in the entire string at that time)\n\n But note: the entire string after C is given to us. And the process implies:\n   - The string must be in the form: zero or more 'a's, then zero or more 'b's, then zero or more 'c's? Actually, note that A provides at least one 'a', and B appends at least one 'b', so the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. But C appends at least one 'c'? Not necessarily: if the number of 'c' is zero, then the condition would require that the number of 'c' (0) equals the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. However, the problem says \"C appends some number\", meaning he can append zero? The problem says \"some number\", which typically includes zero? But note: the example does not say zero is allowed.\n\n However, reading the problem statement: \n   \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\"\n\n In programming problems, \"some number\" usually means at least one? But the example says \"it is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both\", so that includes the case where it equals the same number for both. But note: the problem does not explicitly say \"at least one\", so we must consider the possibility of zero?\n\n But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. If we allow zero, then we must have that the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' is zero, but then the problem states that after B, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So if C appends zero 'c's, then the condition requires that the number of 'c' (0) equals the number of 'a' (which is positive) or the number of 'b' (positive) -> that would fail.\n\n Therefore, C must append at least one 'c'? Actually, the problem says \"some number\", which in many contexts in competitive programming means zero or more, but note the condition that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. Since the numbers of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1, then the number of 'c' must be at least 1 (because if we set it to 0, then 0 != count_a and 0 != count_b, since count_a>=1 and count_b>=1). So we can assume that C appends at least one 'c'.\n\n However, let's reexamine: the problem says \"C appends some number\", and then the condition is that the number of 'c' equals the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. The number of 'a' and 'b' in the entire string at the time of C's appending is the original 'a' plus any 'a' from A, and the original 'b' from B. But note: the entire string at the time of C's turn is the string from A and B. So the count of 'a' is the count from A, and the count of 'b' is the count from B.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check that the string is composed of three contiguous blocks: first all 'a's (at least one), then all 'b's (at least one), then all 'c's (at least one). Why at least one for 'c'? Because C appends some number (and we deduced that if zero, it wouldn't match the condition unless the count of 'a' or 'b' is zero, which they aren't). But wait, what if the string does not contain any 'c'? Then the condition is not met because C must append some 'c's (if we require at least one) and the condition about the count must hold. However, the problem states that the string we have is the one after C appends. So if the string does not have any 'c', then C did not append any? Then the condition is that the number of 'c' (0) must be equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. But the problem says after B, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So 0 != count_a (unless count_a is 0, but count_a is at least 1) and 0 != count_b (same). So no, the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"the string\" we have is the one after C appends. So if the string has no 'c', then C appended 0. But the condition requires that the number of 'c' (0) equals the number of 'a' (which is >=1) or the number of 'b' (>=1) -> fails. So the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n Therefore, the string must be divided as:\n   [a...a][b...b][c...c] with at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n But wait, what if the string is \"aaa\"? Then there's no 'b' and no 'c'. -> invalid.\n What if the string is \"aaab\"? Then no 'c' -> invalid.\n\n So the conditions are:\n\n Condition 1: The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n Condition 2: The string must be in non-decreasing order (by letter) meaning:\n   All 'a's must come before 'b's, and all 'b's must come before 'c's.\n\n Condition 3: Let:\n   n_a = count of 'a'\n   n_b = count of 'b'\n   n_c = count of 'c'\n\n Then, the condition for C is that n_c must be equal to either n_a or n_b.\n\n However, note: when C appends the 'c's, the entire string at that time (before appending 'c') has:\n   n_a (from A) and n_b (from B). Then C appends n_c = either n_a or n_b, so the final string has:\n        total_a = n_a\n        total_b = n_b\n        total_c = n_c (which is either n_a or n_b)\n\n But note: the entire string we have is the final string, so the counts we use are the final counts.\n\n However, wait: the condition is stated as \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". Now, note: the string at the time of C's appending is the one after B. So the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the string at that time are exactly the ones we see in the final string (because no 'c' was present before). And the 'a' and 'b' counts in the final string are the same as in the intermediate string (since we are only adding 'c's at the end). So the condition is that the number of 'c' (which is the appended part) must be equal to the total number of 'a' or the total number of 'b' in the entire string (which is the same as the intermediate string).\n\n Therefore, condition 3: n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n But wait: what if there are no 'b's? Then the condition fails because the problem requires at least one 'b' (after B). Similarly, we require at least one 'a' and one 'b' and one 'c'.\n\n However, note: the process requires that after B, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the intermediate string (without the 'c's) must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends 'c's (at least one) so the final string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n But wait: what if the entire string is \"ab\"? Then we have no 'c'. Then condition 3 fails because n_c=0, and 0 != 1 (n_a=1) and 0 != 1 (n_b=1). So we correctly return NO.\n\n However, consider the example: \"aabc\" -> \n   S = \"aabc\"\n   n_a = 2, n_b = 1, n_c = 1 -> condition 3: n_c (1) is equal to n_b (1) -> YES.\n\n Another example: \"aaabccc\" -> \n   n_a = 3, n_b = 1, n_c = 3 -> condition 3: 3==3 (n_a) -> YES.\n\n Example: \"bbacc\" -> \n   This string does not have the right order. The letters: \n        b, b, a, c, c -> so we have an 'a' in the middle. This breaks the condition that all 'a's must be first, then 'b's, then 'c's. So we must check the order.\n\n Steps to solve:\n\n 1. Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. (If not, print \"NO\")\n 2. Check that the string is non-decreasing: \n        Traverse the string and ensure that we never see an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', and similarly for 'b' after a 'c'.\n    Alternatively, we can split the string into three parts: \n        Part1: as long as the character is 'a'\n        Part2: then as long as the character is 'b'\n        Part3: then as long as the character is 'c'\n\n    But note: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccca\"? Then we have an 'a' at the end -> invalid.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='a': i++\n        Then from i to j, we expect only 'b's until we hit a non-'b'\n        Then from j to end, we expect only 'c's.\n\n    But we can also use:\n\n        if the string does not have the pattern: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's, then it's invalid.\n\n 3. Then check that the count of 'c' is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n However, note: what if the string has multiple segments? For example, \"aabbcc\" is valid, but what if there are extra letters? The problem says the string only has 'a','b','c'.\n\n But the condition 2 (order) will catch if there are out-of-order letters.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'. Actually, we can do:\n\n        if 'a' not in S or 'b' not in S or 'c' not in S:\n            return \"NO\"\n\n However, note: what if the string is \"aabbcc\"? Then it has all three. But what if the string is \"aabbcccc\" and the condition on counts holds? Then we must check the counts.\n\n But wait: the problem states that the entire string is built by the process. So the order must be strictly increasing from 'a' to 'b' to 'c'. \n\n Alternative approach:\n\n        We can traverse and check that the characters are non-decreasing.\n\n        Let last = None\n        for char in S:\n            if char < last: \n                # because 'a'<'b'<'c', so if we see a decrease, invalid.\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n            last = char\n\n        However, this only checks that the string is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is necessary and sufficient for the three-letter sequence (if the string only contains 'a','b','c').\n\n        But note: the string might have only two letters? Then we don't have a 'c'. We already checked that there is at least one 'c'. So we must check the presence of all three.\n\n        Actually, the above traversal would work for checking the order, but we must also check the existence of all three letters.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if not all(ord(c) in (ord('a'), ord('b'), ord('c')) for c in S): \n            # but the input is guaranteed to be only these, so skip.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Check that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'. \n            if 'a' not in S or 'b' not in S or 'c' not in S:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n        Step 2: Check that the string is non-decreasing (i.e., each character is >= the previous one).\n\n            for i in range(1, len(S)):\n                if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n        Step 3: Count the number of 'a', 'b', 'c'\n\n            n_a = S.count('a')\n            n_b = S.count('b')\n            n_c = S.count('c')\n\n        Step 4: Check that n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b\n\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, consider the example \"aabc\": \n        Step 1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Step 2: \n            'a' -> 'a' (ok)\n            'a' -> 'b' (ok, since 'a'<'b')\n            'b' -> 'c' (ok, since 'b'<'c')\n            So passes step2.\n        Step 3: n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> condition holds (n_c==n_b) -> YES.\n\n Example \"aaabccc\":\n        Step1: has 'a','b','c'\n        Step2: \n            \"a\"->\"a\": ok\n            \"a\"->\"a\": ok\n            \"a\"->\"b\": ok\n            \"b\"->\"c\": ok\n            \"c\"->\"c\": ok\n            \"c\"->\"c\": ok\n            \"c\"->\"c\": ok -> passes.\n        Step3: n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3 -> condition holds (n_c==n_a) -> YES.\n\n Example \"bbacc\":\n        Step1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Step2: \n            First char 'b'\n            Second char 'b' -> ok\n            Third char 'a': 'a' < 'b'? -> yes, so 'b' to 'a' is decreasing -> fails step2 -> NO.\n\n But wait, the example output for \"bbacc\" is \"NO\", which matches.\n\n However, consider a different example: \"aabbbccc\" with n_a=2, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> condition: 3==2? no, 3==3 -> yes -> YES.\n\n Another example: \"aabbbcccc\" -> n_a=2, n_b=3, n_c=4 -> condition: 4==2? no, 4==3? no -> NO.\n\n But wait, what if the string is \"abacaba\"? \n        This string is not non-decreasing because 'a','b','a' -> 'a' after 'b' is less than 'b'. So step2 fails.\n\n However, what if the string is \"aabbcc\"?\n        Condition: \n            Step1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n            Step2: non-decreasing: \n                'a','a','b','b','c','c' -> valid.\n            Step3: n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> condition: 2==2 or 2==2 -> YES.\n\n But wait, the problem says: C appends a number of 'c' that is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (in the entire string at the time of appending). In the entire string at the time of appending, the counts of 'a' and 'b' are the same as in the final string (since no 'c' was present). So the condition is that the appended 'c's (which is 2) must be equal to the number of 'a' (which is 2) OR the number of 'b' (which is 2). So it holds.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify that the entire string must have the counts of 'a' and 'b' being the same. It just requires that the appended 'c's are one of the two.\n\n However, there is an important point: the process is fixed. The counts of 'a' and 'b' in the entire string (after C) are the same as the counts at the time of C's turn (because we are only adding 'c's). \n\n But wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" and we have n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> condition holds (n_c==n_b). But note: the intermediate string (before C) had 4 'a's and 3 'b's, and then C appends 3 'c's. So the condition is satisfied.\n\n However, consider the example \"aaaabbbc\": \n        This has n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=1 -> condition: 1==4? no, 1==3? no -> NO.\n\n But note: the order is correct (all 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c'). However, the condition on the counts fails.\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" and we have n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> condition holds.\n\n One more edge: what if the string has no 'b'? Then step1 fails (because we require at least one 'b').\n\n Similarly, if the string has no 'a', then step1 fails.\n\n Therefore, the code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check non-decreasing order\n        for i in range(1, len(s)):\n            if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Count the letters\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n However, wait: what if the string has more than three letters? For example, \"aabbccc\" is valid, but what if the string is \"aabbcccd\"? Then the order is still non-decreasing, but then we have an extra 'd'? No, the input is guaranteed to be only 'a','b','c'. \n\n But note: the problem says the string only consists of 'a','b','c'. So we are safe.\n\n However, consider the following: what if the string is \"aaaabbbccc\" and the counts are as above. But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' appended (which is the entire count of 'c') must equal the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the entire string (which is the same as the intermediate string). So the condition is correct.\n\n But wait: the problem says the entire string after C is given, and the condition for C is that the number of 'c' (the entire count) must be equal to the number of 'a' (which is the same as the intermediate string) or the number of 'b' (same as the intermediate). So our counts are the final counts, but the condition uses the intermediate counts. However, the intermediate counts are the same because we haven't added any 'c' until C's turn. \n\n Therefore, the above code should work.\n\n However, consider the example \"abc\": \n        Step1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Step2: \n            'a'->'b' -> ok (increasing)\n            'b'->'c' -> ok -> passes.\n        Step3: n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> condition: 1==1 or 1==1 -> YES.\n\n Example \"abbccc\": \n        n_a=1, n_b=2, n_c=3 -> condition: 3==1? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n But wait, the process: \n        A gives a string of 'a's: \"a\"\n        B appends two 'b's: \"abb\"\n        Then C appends 3 'c's. But the condition for C: the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' (which is 1) OR the number of 'b' (which is 2). 3 is not 1 and not 2 -> so it's invalid. Correct.\n\n However, note: the example \"aabc\" (which is \"aabc\") is valid because the condition for C is that the number of 'c' (1) is equal to the number of 'b' (1). \n\n But wait: in \"aabc\", the intermediate string (after B) is \"aab\", so the number of 'a' is 2, the number of 'b' is 1. Then C appends 1 'c'. The condition is that the number of 'c' (1) is equal to the number of 'a' (2) or the number of 'b' (1). It is equal to the number of 'b'. So condition holds.\n\n However, note: the entire string we have is \"aabc\", so the counts we use are:\n        n_a = 2, n_b = 1, n_c = 1.\n\n But the condition in the problem is based on the intermediate string (after B) which has n_a=2 and n_b=1. However, in our code we are using the final counts. But note: the final counts for 'a' and 'b' are the same as the intermediate because we didn't change them. The final string's 'a' and 'b' counts are the same as the intermediate. And the 'c' count is the one we just appended.\n\n Therefore, we can use the final counts because the condition is defined as: the number of 'c' (which is the entire count) must be equal to the number of 'a' (which is the same as the intermediate) or the number of 'b' (same as intermediate). \n\n So the code is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"abbbccc\"? \n        This string: \n            n_a=1, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> condition: 3==1? no, 3==3? yes -> YES.\n\n Example: \"abbbccc\" is valid.\n\n However, consider a tricky one: \"aaabbbccc\" (as above) is valid.\n\n But wait, what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" and the condition is that the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' (3) or the number of 'b' (3). So 3==3 -> YES.\n\n Now, what if the string is \"aaaabbbbcccc\"? \n        n_a=4, n_b=4, n_c=4 -> condition: 4==4 -> YES.\n\n But wait, what if the string is \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\" (with 4 a's, 8 b's, and 8 c's)? \n        Condition: 8==4? no, 8==8 -> YES.\n\n However, note: the process: \n        After B, the string has 4 a's and 8 b's. Then C appends 8 c's. The condition is that the number of 'c' (8) must be equal to the number of 'a' (4) OR the number of 'b' (8). It is equal to the number of 'b'. So valid.\n\n But wait, what if the string is \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\" (with 4 a's, 8 b's, and 4 c's)? \n        Then condition: 4==4 (a) or 4==8 (b) -> YES (because 4==4).\n\n However, note: the condition is that the number of 'c' (which is 4) is equal to the number of 'a' (4) OR the number of 'b' (8). So 4==4 -> YES.\n\n But wait, how did we get 4 c's? The process: C appends 4 c's. But the condition says the number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' (4) or the number of 'b' (8). So it is valid.\n\n However, note: the entire string must be in the form of contiguous blocks. Our code checks for non-decreasing order, so if we have \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\", that's valid. But if we have interleaving, then it fails.\n\n But wait, what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (each count=2)? Then condition: 2==2 -> YES.\n\n However, consider a string that is not in contiguous blocks: \"acb\" -> \n        Step1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Step2: \n            'a'->'c' -> ok (because 'a'<'c')\n            'c'->'b' -> not ok (because 'c'>'b') -> NO.\n\n So our code correctly rejects \"acb\".\n\n But note: the problem says that the string is built by appending at the end. So the order must be: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check non-decreasing order\n        for i in range(1, len(s)):\n            if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n Let's test with the examples provided:\n\n Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> YES (our code returns YES)\n Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> NO (our code returns NO because of the order: 'b' then 'b' then 'a' -> violates non-decreasing)\n Example 3: \"aabc\" -> YES (our code returns YES)\n\n But wait, the example input is given as:\n        Input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n        Expected Output: ['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n However, note: the example input format: the first and only line.\n\n Our code reads one string.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as a list? Actually, the problem says the first and only line consists of a string.\n\n So we are good.\n\n However, wait: what if the string is \"abc\"? \n        Step1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Step2: \n            'a'->'b' -> ok\n            'b'->'c' -> ok -> passes.\n        Step3: n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n But wait, the problem says: after B, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends 1 'c'. The condition is that the number of 'c' (1) is equal to the number of 'a' (1) or the number of 'b' (1). So YES.\n\n But note: the intermediate string (after B) is \"ab\", so the number of 'a'=1, 'b'=1. Then C appends 1 'c'. Then the final string is \"abc\". This is valid.\n\n However, consider the example \"abb\": \n        This string doesn't have 'c'. So step1: missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n Example \"aab\": \n        Missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n Example \"a\": \n        Missing 'b' and 'c' -> NO.\n\n Example \"b\": \n        Missing 'a' and 'c' -> NO.\n\n Example \"c\": \n        Missing 'a' and 'b' -> NO.\n\n Example \"ab\": \n        Missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n Example \"ac\": \n        Missing 'b' -> NO.\n\n Example \"ba\": \n        Order: 'b' then 'a' -> decreases -> NO.\n\n Example \"caa\": \n        Order: 'c' then 'a' -> decreases -> NO.\n\n Example \"cba\": \n        Order: 'c' then 'b' then 'a' -> decreases -> NO.\n\n Example \"aabbcc\": YES.\n\n Example \"aabbccccc\": \n        Condition: n_c=5, n_a=2, n_b=2 -> 5==2? no, 5==2? no -> NO.\n\n Example \"aabbccccc\" is invalid.\n\n Example \"aabbccccc\" has the correct order, but the condition on counts fails.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the string is built by the process. The process requires that the number of 'c' (appended) is either the number of 'a' (2) or the number of 'b' (2). But we have 5 'c's, so it's invalid.\n\n Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n But wait: what if the string has only one type of letter repeated? For example, \"aaa\" -> fails step1 (no 'b' and no 'c') -> NO.\n\n Another example: \"aabb\" -> fails step1 (no 'c') -> NO.\n\n Another example: \"aabbccd\" -> wait, the string is \"aabbccd\", which has a 'd'? No, the input is guaranteed to be 'a','b','c'. So we don't have to worry.\n\n However, note: the problem says the string only consists of 'a','b','c'. So we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" and the condition is that the number of 'c' is 3, which is equal to the number of 'a' (3) and the number of 'b' (3) -> both true, but we only require one.\n\n Therefore, we are done.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of the 'a' and to the number of the 'b' at the same time.\" So we are covering that.\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"abc\" (each count=1) -> YES.\n\n One more: \"aaabbbccc\" (each count=3) -> YES.\n\n But wait, what if the string is \"aaabbbcccccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=6)? \n        Condition: 6==3? no, 6==3? no -> NO.\n\n But note: the condition is that the number of 'c' (6) must be equal to the number of 'a' (3) OR the number of 'b' (3). So NO.\n\n However, wait: the process: \n        After B, the string is \"aaabbb\", so the number of 'a' is 3, 'b' is 3. Then C appends 6 'c's. The condition is that the number of 'c' (6) must be equal to 3 or 3. It isn't, so NO.\n\n But note: the entire string is \"aaabbbcccccc\", and the counts are as above.\n\n However, what if the string is \"aaabbbcccccc\" and we break the order? Then step2 would catch.\n\n But wait, the string \"aaabbbcccccc\" is non-decreasing, so step2 passes.\n\n So the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'. We are checking for the presence of each. But note: the non-decreasing condition and the fact that we are only dealing with 'a','b','c' ensures that if the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c', then the non-decreasing condition and the order would require that the first occurrence of 'a' is at the beginning, then 'b', then 'c'. \n\n But what if the string is \"abacaba\"? \n        This string has all three, but the order is not non-decreasing (because of the 'a' after 'b'). So it fails step2.\n\n Therefore, we are good.\n\n Let me run through the examples again with the code:\n\n Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> YES\n Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> NO (due to order)\n Example 3: \"aabc\" -> YES\n\n But wait, the example \"aabc\": \n        The order: \n            'a'->'a' (ok)\n            'a'->'b' (ok)\n            'b'->'c' (ok) -> so passes step2.\n\n        Counts: \n            a:2, b:1, c:1 -> 1==2? no, 1==1? yes -> YES.\n\n Example \"abc\": \n        a:1, b:1, c:1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n Example \"aabbcc\": \n        a:2, b:2, c:2 -> 2==2 -> YES.\n\n Example \"aaaabbbccc\": \n        a:4, b:3, c:3 -> 3==4? no, 3==3 -> YES.\n\n Example \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\": \n        a:4, b:8, c:8 -> 8==4? no, 8==8 -> YES.\n\n Example \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\": \n        a:4, b:8, c:8 -> YES.\n\n Example \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\" (with 4 a's, 8 b's, and 4 c's): \n        Condition: 4==4 (a) -> YES.\n\n Example \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\" (with 4 a's, 8 b's, and 5 c's): \n        Condition: 5==4? no, 5==8? no -> NO.\n\n Example \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\" (with 4 a's, 8 b's, and 9 c's): \n        Condition: 9==4? no, 9==8? no -> NO.\n\n Example \"aaaabbbbbbbbbbccccccccccccccc\" (with 4 a's, 8 b's, and 8 c",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order with certain constraints. The solution involves checking three main conditions: the presence of all required characters, the correct order of characters, and the count condition for the number of 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Check Non-decreasing Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order, meaning all 'a's must come before any 'b's, and all 'b's must come before any 'c's. This ensures the string follows the sequence of operations where 'a's are added first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's.\n3. **Count Condition for 'c's**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This ensures that the number of 'c's appended by C matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string at the time of appending.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Character Presence Check**: The code checks if the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any character is missing, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Order Check**: The code verifies that the string is in non-decreasing order by comparing each character with the previous one. If any character is found to be out of order, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n4. **Count Condition Check**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters are calculated. If the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's, the code prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string can be constructed according to the specified operations, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
