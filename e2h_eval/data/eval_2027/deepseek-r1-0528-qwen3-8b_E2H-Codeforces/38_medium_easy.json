    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two integers: \n   n = minimum number of nodes required to have exactly p pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability.\n   m = maximum number of unidirectional pairs (over all edges in the graph) in such a graph with n nodes.\n\n Note: The condition for p-reachable is that the graph must contain exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) (with u < v) such that u and v are mutually reachable.\n\n Observation:\n In a directed graph, mutual reachability forms equivalence classes (strongly connected components). However, note that the problem counts only pairs (u, v) with u < v.\n\n Let the graph have k strongly connected components (SCCs). Then, within each SCC, every pair (u, v) with u != v is mutually reachable. So the number of mutual pairs inside one SCC of size s is C(s,2) = s*(s-1)//2.\n\n But note: the problem says \"exactly p\" ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability.\n\n Also, there might be edges between different SCCs? However, if we have a DAG of SCCs, then there are no mutual reachabilities across different SCCs (by definition). Therefore, the total mutual pairs is the sum over each SCC of C(s_i,2).\n\n Now, we want to form a graph with exactly p mutual pairs (with u < v) and we want to minimize the total number of nodes (n = sum_i s_i).\n\n Additionally, we are to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v, a path from u to v but not from v to u) in the entire graph (with n nodes) among all graphs that achieve the p mutual pairs.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Representing the graph as a DAG of SCCs, the mutual pairs come only from the cycles (each SCC). So we need to decompose the graph into SCCs such that the sum of C(s_i,2) for each SCC is p, and we want to minimize the total nodes (which is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs).\n\n How to minimize the total nodes?\n We know that if we use an SCC of size s, it contributes C(s,2) = s*(s-1)//2 to p.\n\n We want to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each triangular number is T(s) = s*(s-1)//2) and minimize the total nodes (which is the sum of the s_i's). This is similar to the coin change problem where we use coins of denominations being triangular numbers and we want to minimize the total value of the nodes (the coins are the SCCs) for a fixed total of p.\n\n However, note: we can also have multiple SCCs. The goal is to minimize the total number of nodes (n) so that the sum of the triangular numbers (from the SCCs) is at least p? Actually, we need exactly p.\n\n But note: we can break the graph arbitrarily. We can choose any set of SCCs (each of size at least 1) such that the sum of T(s_i) is p. However, note that the problem requires exactly p.\n\n However, observe: the mutual pairs are defined only by the SCCs. The entire graph must have exactly p mutual pairs (each mutual pair is counted once for u < v). Therefore, the sum of T(s_i) must equal p.\n\n But wait: is that the case? Yes, because each SCC of size s_i contributes T(s_i) pairs, and there are no mutual pairs between different SCCs.\n\n So we need to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each triangular number is T(s) = s*(s-1)//2) and minimize the total nodes (n = sum_i s_i).\n\n However, note: we are allowed to have multiple SCCs. We are not forced to use a single SCC. We can use several SCCs.\n\n But how do we choose the SCCs? We can choose any set of sizes (s_1, s_2, ..., s_k) such that:\n   T(s_1) + T(s_2) + ... + T(s_k) = p.\n\n And we want to minimize n = s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k.\n\n However, note: we cannot break an SCC arbitrarily? Actually, we can choose the graph arbitrarily. The minimal representation is achieved by using as few nodes as possible, which is equivalent to using the largest possible SCCs first because T(s) grows quadratically and the node count s is linear.\n\n Why? Because for a fixed amount of mutual pairs, if we use one big SCC of size s, then T(s) = s*(s-1)//2. Alternatively, if we break that SCC into two SCCs, say of sizes a and b (a+b = s), then T(a)+T(b) = a*(a-1)//2 + b*(b-1)//2, which is less than T(s) because:\n   T(a)+T(b) = (a^2 - a + b^2 - b)/2 = (a^2 + b^2 - (a+b))//2\n   and T(s) = (a+b)*(a+b-1)//2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - a - b)//2.\n\n Since a^2+b^2 <= (a+b)^2 - 2ab, we have T(a)+T(b) <= T(s) - ab, so breaking an SCC reduces the total mutual pairs.\n\n Therefore, to achieve a fixed p, we should use as few SCCs as possible, and within that, use the largest possible SCCs.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we want to represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each T(s) for s>=1) and minimize the total nodes (which is the sum of the s_i). \n\n Note: the triangular numbers are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, ... (for s=1: T(1)=0, s=2: T(2)=1, s=3: T(3)=3, etc.)\n\n We can use dynamic programming? But p can be up to 200000.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a greedy approach: use the largest triangular numbers (largest s) until the sum reaches p.\n\n However, note: we require the sum to be exactly p.\n\n Another idea: we can use the following:\n\n   Let f(n) = n(n-1)//2, the n-th triangular number (for n>=1).\n\n We want to write p as a sum of triangular numbers (each >=0) and minimize the total nodes (the sum of the corresponding n_i).\n\n But note: the triangular numbers for n=1 is 0, n=2 is 1, n=3 is 3, etc.\n\n However, we cannot use fractional SCCs. Each SCC must be of integer size.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to use distinct SCCs. We can use multiple SCCs of the same size.\n\n However, the minimal representation is achieved by using as many large triangular numbers as possible (because they give more pairs per node). \n\n But wait: we want to minimize the total nodes. Consider: if we use an SCC of size s, we get T(s) pairs and use s nodes.\n\n We want to minimize the total nodes for a fixed p.\n\n This is similar to the problem: given denominations of coins (the triangular numbers) and a target p, we want to minimize the total value of the coins (but note: here the denomination is the triangular number, and we want the total denomination to be p, and the cost of a coin of denomination T(s) is s nodes). \n\n However, the denominations are not arbitrary: they are T(s) for s>=1. And we have an unlimited supply.\n\n So we can use a DP where:\n   dp[i] = minimum total nodes to achieve i mutual pairs.\n\n Then:\n   dp[0] = 0\n   for i from 1 to p:\n        dp[i] = min_{s>=2} { dp[i - T(s)] + s }   [if i>=T(s)]\n\n But note: we can also use multiple SCCs of the same size.\n\n However, p can be up to 200000, and the triangular numbers go up to about sqrt(2*p) ~ 632 (since 632*631//2 = around 200000). So we would iterate s from 2 up to about 632, and then for each i from T(s) to p, update dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-T(s)]+s)\n\n But the state goes up to 200000, and we have about 631 triangular numbers, so the inner loop would run 200000 * 631 which is too high.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the triangular numbers and then use a BFS-like or use a different approach.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the minimum number of nodes (n) and then the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n However, there is an alternative: we can use the fact that the minimal representation is achieved by using as many large triangular numbers as possible. But we need to represent p exactly.\n\n Another observation: the minimal total nodes is achieved by using the largest triangular numbers (i.e., the largest SCCs) as much as possible.\n\n However, we can also use the following greedy: we want to use the largest triangular numbers (largest s) that are <= p, and then subtract and continue.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use multiple SCCs. The minimal total nodes is the minimal solution to:\n\n   Find nonnegative integers a_1, a_2, ... (each a_s is the number of SCCs of size s) such that:\n        sum_{s} a_s * T(s) = p\n   and minimize sum_{s} a_s * s.\n\n Since the triangular numbers grow quadratically, we can try to use as many large SCCs as possible.\n\n However, note: the triangular numbers are not complete (they don't cover all integers). For example, 2 cannot be represented as a triangular number (unless we use two triangles: 1+1, i.e., two SCCs of size 2, then we get 1+1=2). \n\n Actually, the representation is not necessarily unique. We need the minimal total nodes.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following known fact: the minimal representation of p as a sum of triangular numbers (allowing repetition) is achieved by using the greedy algorithm with the triangular numbers in decreasing order, but sometimes we may need to break a triangle into smaller ones.\n\n However, note that the triangular numbers are the numbers 0,1,3,6,... and they are not consecutive. There is a known result in number theory that every positive integer is representable as the sum of three triangular numbers (Gauss), but that is for nonnegative integers and with repetition. However, we are minimizing the total nodes, so we need the minimal representation.\n\n But note: we can also use zeros (i.e., SCCs of size 1, which contribute 0). So effectively, we can ignore zeros because they don't add to p but add one node.\n\n However, we must represent p exactly.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let T = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, ...] up to the largest T(s) <= p.\n\n Then, we can use dynamic programming for small p, but p can be up to 200000.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a mathematical insight.\n\n Insight: The minimal total nodes is achieved by using as few SCCs as possible, and each SCC should be as large as possible.\n\n We can consider: what is the minimal n such that the maximum number of mutual pairs we can have (with n nodes) is at least p?\n\n Actually, we need exactly p.\n\n We can also consider: the maximum mutual pairs with n nodes is achieved by having one big SCC (complete graph) which gives T(n) = n*(n-1)//2.\n\n So the minimal n must satisfy: T(n) >= p.\n\n But note: we are allowed to break the graph arbitrarily. We can have multiple SCCs. So the minimal n is the smallest integer n such that the maximum mutual pairs (with n nodes) is at least p? \n\n However, we are not limited to one SCC. We can have multiple SCCs. The total mutual pairs is the sum of the triangular numbers of the SCCs.\n\n We want the minimal n (the total number of nodes) such that we can form a decomposition of some integer >= p into triangular numbers (each from an SCC) and the sum of the sizes is n.\n\n But note: we must form exactly p.\n\n However, we can use zeros (nodes that are isolated, which don't form any mutual pairs). But note: if we have an isolated node, then it doesn't form any mutual pair. So the total mutual pairs is still the sum of the triangles from the other SCCs.\n\n Therefore, the minimal n must be at least the minimal integer n such that there exists a decomposition of p into triangular numbers (each of which is T(s) for s<=n) and the sum of the s_i (the sizes) is n.\n\n But wait, the nodes are partitioned into the SCCs. So the total nodes is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs.\n\n However, we can also have SCCs of size 1 (which contribute 0) and we can break an SCC arbitrarily.\n\n So the minimal n is the minimal integer such that p can be written as a sum of triangular numbers (each from an SCC of size at most n) and the sum of the sizes (the s_i) is minimized.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use SCCs of any size (each size s gives T(s) and uses s nodes). We want to minimize the total nodes.\n\n We can use a greedy method: we want to use the largest triangular numbers (largest s) first because they give more pairs per node.\n\n However, we must represent p exactly.\n\n Steps for minimal n:\n\n   Let n_min be the smallest integer such that T(n_min) >= p, but wait: we can use multiple SCCs. Actually, we can use several SCCs of size 2, each giving 1. So if p is 100000, we can use 100000 SCCs of size 2, then n_min = 200000. But if we use one SCC of size 1414 (since 1414*1413//2 = 1000005 which is >100000) then we can use that and maybe break the rest? \n\n Actually, we want to minimize the total nodes. The total nodes is the sum of the sizes. We want to minimize that.\n\n We can use a two-step process:\n\n   Step 1: Find the minimal n (the total nodes) such that the maximum mutual pairs we can have with n nodes is at least p? \n\n   But note: we are allowed to have exactly p. We need the minimal n for which there exists a set of SCCs (with sizes s_1, s_2, ..., s_k) such that:\n        sum_i T(s_i) = p, and\n        sum_i s_i = n.\n\n   And we want to minimize n.\n\n   This is equivalent to: we want to choose a multiset of triangular numbers (each T(s) for s>=1) that sum to p, and we want to minimize the sum of the corresponding s_i.\n\n   Since T(s) = s*(s-1)//2, and s_i is increasing as T(s) increases, we can use a greedy: use the largest triangular numbers (largest s) as long as T(s) <= p.\n\n   Algorithm for minimal n:\n\n        Let n = 0\n        Let remaining = p\n\n        While remaining > 0:\n            Find the largest s such that T(s) <= remaining.\n            Then, we use one SCC of size s, and then subtract T(s) from remaining, and add s to n.\n\n        But is this minimal?\n\n        Example: p=2.\n\n          Largest s: T(2)=1, then remaining=1, then next s=2 (T(2)=1) -> total n=4.\n\n        But we can represent p=2 by two SCCs of size 2: then n=4, which is the same.\n\n        However, consider p=1: \n          Use one SCC of size 2: then n=2.\n\n        Now, what if we use two SCCs of size 2 for p=2? Then n=4. Alternatively, we can also use one SCC of size 3 (which gives 3) and then we have negative? That doesn't work.\n\n        But note: we can use multiple SCCs. However, we are constrained by the fact that we cannot exceed p.\n\n        Another idea: use dynamic programming but optimized for the range [0, p] and states being the minimal total nodes for achieving a given p.\n\n        However, p can be up to 200000.\n\n        We can precompute the triangular numbers up to about sqrt(2*p) (around 632). Then, for each p from 0 to 200000, we do:\n\n            dp[i] = minimum total nodes to achieve i mutual pairs.\n\n            Then, for each triangular number t (from the list T) that is <= i, we have:\n                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-t] + s)   # s is the size that gives t (i.e., t = s*(s-1)//2)\n\n        But the state is 200000, and the triangular numbers are about 632, so the inner loop runs 200000 * 632 ~ 126e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to be careful.\n\n        However, we can optimize by iterating only over the triangular numbers that are <= i, and we can precompute the list of triangular numbers and their corresponding s.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precomputation:\n                Let max_tri = 0\n                s = 1\n                while max_tri <= 200000:\n                    tri = s*(s-1)//2\n                    if tri > 200000: break\n                    store (tri, s)\n                    s += 1\n\n            Then, let dp[0] = 0\n            For i from 1 to p:\n                dp[i] = a big number\n                for each (t, s_size) in the list of triangular numbers:\n                    if i >= t:\n                        candidate = dp[i-t] + s_size\n                        if candidate < dp[i]:\n                            dp[i] = candidate\n\n            Then the minimal n is dp[p].\n\n        But wait: we must use exactly p. However, the above dp is for representing p exactly.\n\n        However, the problem says: we need exactly p.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to use SCCs of size 1 (which give 0) arbitrarily. But if we use an SCC of size 1, then we are adding 1 node and 0 to p. So we can use as many as we want. But that would mean that we can always represent any p (by the above dp) and then we can pad with zeros (nodes of size 1) without affecting p. However, our dp above does not account for zeros. \n\n        Actually, we are required to have exactly p. So if we don't use an SCC of size 1, then we are only using SCCs that contribute at least 1. But note: the problem does not require to use all nodes in mutual pairs. We can have isolated nodes (size 1) and they don't contribute to p. So the minimal n might be larger than the minimal representation without zeros.\n\n        However, wait: the above dp already considers the minimal nodes to achieve p. And we are allowed to have additional nodes (isolated) but they don't help in reducing the total nodes for achieving p. They only add nodes without helping. So the minimal n is the one we computed.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to have an SCC of size 1 (which is allowed) and it doesn't contribute to p. So we can have:\n\n            dp[i] = minimal nodes to achieve exactly i mutual pairs (without any isolated nodes) and then we can always add any number of isolated nodes (each adding 1 node and 0 to p). \n\n        However, we are required to have exactly p mutual pairs. So we don't need to add any extra mutual pairs. But the problem does not restrict the total number of mutual pairs beyond the requirement of exactly p. \n\n        Therefore, we must represent p exactly, and then we can have any number of isolated nodes (if we want to minimize the total nodes, we wouldn't add any because they don't help and only increase the node count). So the minimal n is the minimal representation without isolated nodes.\n\n        However, note: the representation without isolated nodes is the one we are doing.\n\n        But wait: what if we break an SCC? We can break an SCC of size s into two SCCs (and possibly more) and the total mutual pairs decreases. So we cannot arbitrarily remove mutual pairs by breaking, we can only decrease the total mutual pairs.\n\n        Therefore, we must represent p exactly. The dp above should work.\n\n        However, the state is 200000 and we have about 632 triangular numbers. The total operations would be about 200000 * 632 = 126400000, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we might need to optimize.\n\n        But note: the triangular numbers are increasing and we can break the inner loop when t > i.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over the triangular numbers only for those that are <= i. We can precompute the list of triangular numbers (t, s) and then for each i, we iterate over the list until t<=i.\n\n        However, we can also use a different approach: since the triangular numbers are sparse, we can use a BFS-like for the minimal representation? Or use a mathematical formula.\n\n        But the constraints are up to 200000, and 126 million iterations in Python might be borderline (in PyPy/C++ it's acceptable, in Python it might be a few seconds). But note that p can be up to 200000, and we are iterating for each i from 1 to 200000 and for each triangular number (about 632) that is <= i.\n\n        We can precompute the list of triangular numbers and then for each i, we iterate over the triangular numbers that are <= i. But we can also precompute an array of the triangular numbers and then use binary search to find the last triangular number <= i, then iterate from the beginning until that index.\n\n        But the number of triangular numbers is about 632, so we can just iterate over the entire list for each i (and check if t<=i). The inner loop runs about 632 times for each i, so 200000*632 ~ 126e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if we code in C++ but in Python we must hope that the machine is fast enough.\n\n        However, let me calculate: 126e6 iterations in Python might take a few seconds (assuming each iteration is a simple min operation). We can try to optimize by storing the list of triangular numbers and then breaking early.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a dictionary or an array of dp, and then for each triangular number, update the dp from the back.\n\n        Another way (unbounded knapsack style):\n\n            dp[0] = 0\n            For each triangular number (t, s) in the list:\n                For j from t to p:\n                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t] + s)\n\n        This is the standard unbounded knapsack. However, note: we can use each triangular number multiple times (since we can have multiple SCCs of the same size). \n\n        But wait: the problem allows multiple SCCs of the same size. So it is an unbounded knapsack.\n\n        However, we are allowed to use as many as we want. Then we can do:\n\n            dp = [10**9]*(p+1)\n            dp[0] = 0\n            tri_list = [] # list of (t, s) for s from 1 to about 632 (until t<=p)\n            s = 1\n            while s*(s-1)//2 <= p:\n                t_val = s*(s-1)//2\n                tri_list.append( (t_val, s) )\n                s += 1\n\n            for t_val, s_val in tri_list:\n                for j in range(t_val, p+1):\n                    if dp[j-t_val] != 10**9:\n                        dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-t_val] + s_val)\n\n        Then the minimal nodes is dp[p].\n\n        But wait: the above is an unbounded knapsack and we are iterating for each coin (triangular number) and then for j from t_val to p. This is the standard way and the complexity is O(p * |tri_list|) = 200000 * 632 = 126e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the order of the coins: we are iterating over each coin and then updating j from t_val to p. This is correct for unbounded knapsack.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to use the same triangular number multiple times.\n\n        Let's test with p=1: \n            tri_list: for s=2: t_val=1, s_val=2; for s=3: t_val=3>1 -> stop.\n            Then, for the coin (1,2): update j=1: dp[1] = min(inf, dp[0]+2) = 2.\n\n        p=2:\n            j=2: we can use two coins of 1: dp[2] = min(inf, dp[1]+2) = 2+2 = 4.\n\n        But wait: we can use two coins of 1: that means two SCCs of size 2, which gives 4 nodes. Is that minimal? Yes, because we cannot represent 2 with one SCC (the next smallest is 3, which gives 3 which is too much).\n\n        p=3:\n            We can use one SCC of size 3: t_val=3, then dp[3] = min(inf, dp[0]+3) = 3.\n\n        p=4:\n            We can use one SCC of size 3 (3) and one SCC of size 2 (1): then 3+1=4, and nodes = 3+2=5.\n            Alternatively, four SCCs of size 2: 4 nodes? Actually, four SCCs of size 2: then mutual pairs = 1+1+1+1=4, and nodes=8. \n            But wait, we can also use one SCC of size 4: T(4)=6, which is too much. So the minimal is 5.\n\n            Our algorithm: \n                tri_list: s=2: (1,2); s=3: (3,3); s=4: (6,4) -> 6>4, so stop at s=3.\n\n                dp[0]=0\n                Process (1,2): update j=1 to 2, then j=2: dp[2]=min(inf, dp[1]+2)=2+2=4, j=3: dp[3]=min(inf, dp[2]+2)=4+2=6, j=4: dp[4]=min(inf, dp[3]+2)=6+2=8.\n\n                Then process (3,3): update j=3: dp[3]=min(6, dp[0]+3)=min(6,3)=3; j=4: dp[4]=min(8, dp[1]+3)=min(8,2+3)=5.\n\n                So dp[4]=5.\n\n        So the algorithm works.\n\n        However, note: we must use the same triangular numbers repeatedly. The above does unbounded.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require to minimize the number of SCCs, so using the same triangular number multiple times is allowed.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the minimal nodes n_min = dp[p] (if we set dp[0]=0 and initialize with a large number).\n\n        But wait: what if p=0? Then we don't need any SCC that contributes mutual pairs. Then we can have zero nodes? Actually, the graph must have at least one node? Or we can have zero nodes? \n\n        According to the problem: ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v. With zero nodes, there are no pairs. So p=0 requires zero nodes? \n\n        But note: the graph has nodes. The problem says \"minimum number of nodes\", so if we have no nodes, then n=0. But the problem says \"ordered pair of nodes\", so if there are no nodes, then there are no pairs. \n\n        However, the input p=0, then we output two integers: the minimal nodes and then the maximum unidirectional pairs.\n\n        Example: Input '0' -> Output '0 0'\n\n        But note: the example input includes ['0'] -> output ['0 0'].\n\n        Now, we have to compute n_min = dp[0] = 0 for p=0.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read p.\n\n            If p==0:\n                n_min = 0\n                Then we need to compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n            But wait, the problem says: \"Also, among all such p-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes, let G denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs of nodes. Find this number.\"\n\n            What is the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in a graph with n_min nodes that is p-reachable (p=0)?\n\n            Conditions for p=0: the graph must have exactly 0 pairs (u,v) with u<v and mutual reachability. \n\n            This means that the graph must be such that there are no strongly connected components of size>=2. So every node is an isolated node (no edges) OR the graph is a DAG of isolated nodes (so no cycles). \n\n            In such a graph, the only edges we can have are from one node to another, but these edges are unidirectional (because if there were a cycle, then that cycle would form an SCC and we would have mutual pairs). \n\n            Therefore, the graph is a DAG of isolated nodes. Then, the total number of edges we can have is the number of edges in a complete DAG (with no cycles) on n_min nodes.\n\n            However, note: we can also have edges that are not part of cycles? Actually, in a DAG, there are no cycles, so every edge is unidirectional? \n\n            But note: the definition of unidirectional: (u, v) is unidirectional if there is a path from u to v and not from v to u.\n\n            In a DAG, if there is an edge from u to v, then we cannot have a path from v to u (unless there is a cycle, but there isn't). However, we can have multiple edges and paths? \n\n            Actually, the graph is simple? The problem does not specify, but typically in graph problems we assume simple directed graphs.\n\n            So the graph is simple and directed. Then, the maximum number of edges in a DAG is the number of edges in a complete DAG, which is n_min*(n_min-1)//2 (each pair of nodes has an edge in one direction only). \n\n            But wait: in a complete DAG, we can orient the edges arbitrarily as long as there is no cycle. However, the maximum number of edges in a DAG on n_min nodes is indeed n_min*(n_min-1)//2 (by having a total order and directing edges from lower to higher). \n\n            Then, the total number of unidirectional pairs (edges) is the total number of edges, because each edge is unidirectional (since there is a path from u to v, but not from v to u, because the graph is acyclic). \n\n            However, note: the definition of unidirectional is for ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v. And the graph has n_min nodes. The total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n_min*(n_min-1). But the graph is directed, so the maximum number of edges is n_min*(n_min-1). \n\n            But wait, the definition of unidirectional requires a path from u to v and no path from v to u. In a complete DAG (with a topological order) we have an edge from u to v if u < v (in the topological order) and no edge from v to u. Then, the path from u to v exists (via the direct edge) and there is no path from v to u (because the edge is only from u to v). So each edge is unidirectional.\n\n            Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (edges) is the maximum number of edges in a DAG, which is n_min*(n_min-1).\n\n            But wait: the problem says \"ordered pair of nodes (u, v)\" and we are counting edges. However, the definition of unidirectional is for a pair (u, v) (with u != v). And note: the graph is directed, so an edge from u to v is the same as the ordered pair (u, v). \n\n            However, the problem says: \"there exists a path from u to v and there are no paths from v to u\". \n\n            In a DAG, if we have an edge from u to v, then we have a path from u to v (the edge) and no path from v to u (because the edge is only one way and the graph is acyclic). \n\n            But note: we can have multiple edges? The problem does not specify, but typically we assume simple graphs. \n\n            However, the problem does not specify. But note: the example: p=3, output is \"3 0\". \n\n            For p=3, the minimal nodes is 3. Then the maximum unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\n            Why 0? \n\n            The graph must be 3-reachable. The graph with 3 nodes must have exactly 3 mutual pairs. \n\n            How? The mutual pairs are the pairs (u,v) with u<v and mutual reachability. The total mutual pairs is 3. \n\n            The complete graph (all edges) has one SCC (the whole graph) and the number of mutual pairs is C(3,2)=3. \n\n            Then, the graph is strongly connected. \n\n            Then, the unidirectional pairs: for any two nodes, there is a path from u to v and from v to u. Therefore, no edge is unidirectional. \n\n            So the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\n            Therefore, for p=3, we must have a strongly connected graph. \n\n            Now, for p=0, the graph must have 0 mutual pairs. Then the graph must have no cycles. Then the maximum unidirectional pairs is the maximum edges in a DAG, which is n_min*(n_min-1).\n\n            However, wait: the graph must be p-reachable, meaning exactly p mutual pairs. For p=0, we require 0 mutual pairs. And we have n_min=0, then the graph has 0 nodes, then no edges, so 0 unidirectional pairs.\n\n            But wait: the minimal nodes is 0. Then we output \"0 0\".\n\n            However, if p=0, then we must have 0 mutual pairs. With n_min=0, we have no nodes, so no edges, and that satisfies.\n\n            But what if we have n_min=0, then the graph has 0 nodes, so the maximum unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\n            Now, what about p=1?\n\n            Minimal nodes: we found that dp[1]=2. Then the graph has 2 nodes. \n\n            Conditions: the graph must have exactly 1 mutual pair. \n\n            The mutual pairs: we have two nodes. The only pair is (u,v) with u<v. To have mutual reachability, the graph must have a cycle between the two nodes? Then we need an edge from u to v and from v to u. Then the graph has two edges. \n\n            Then, the unidirectional pairs: \n                (u,v): there is a path (direct edge) and there is a path from v to u (the other edge) -> not unidirectional.\n                (v,u): similarly, not unidirectional.\n\n            So there are 0 unidirectional pairs.\n\n            However, wait: the problem says \"among all such p-reachable graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs\".\n\n            So we must consider all graphs with 2 nodes and exactly 1 mutual pair.\n\n            How can we have 1 mutual pair? The mutual pair must be (u,v) (with u<v). Then we must have a path from u to v and from v to u. But that requires two edges (cycle). \n\n            Alternatively, is there another way? \n\n            The definition: mutual reachability for (u,v) (with u<v) requires that there is a path from u to v and from v to u. \n\n            Therefore, the graph must have a cycle. \n\n            But note: the graph has two nodes. The only way to have a cycle is to have both edges. \n\n            Then, the graph is fixed: two edges. Then there are 0 unidirectional pairs.\n\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is exactly p-reachable, and among all such graphs, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional node pairs. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and there exists mutual reachability between u and v (i.e., paths in both directions).\n   - The goal is to find the smallest graph (minimum nodes) that meets this condition and then determine the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (edges where only one direction exists) in such a graph.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Mutual Reachability**: Nodes involved in mutual reachability form strongly connected components (SCCs). The number of mutual pairs (u, v) with u < v in an SCC of size `s` is given by the triangular number `T(s) = s*(s-1)/2`.\n   - **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the total number of nodes, we should use the largest possible SCCs since each node in a large SCC contributes more mutual pairs per node.\n   - **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to compute the minimal nodes required to achieve exactly `p` mutual pairs by summing triangular numbers from SCCs.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Precompute all triangular numbers up to the target `p`. For each value from 0 to `p`, compute the minimal nodes needed using these triangular numbers.\n   - **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: For the minimal node graph, the maximum unidirectional pairs are derived from the complete DAG structure on these nodes, which allows all possible edges without cycles.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Precomputation**: The triangular numbers are computed up to the square root of `2*p`, which is O(sqrt(p)).\n   - **DP Solution**: The DP involves iterating over each triangular number for each value up to `p`, resulting in O(p * number of triangular numbers) operations. Given `p` can be up to 200,000, this is feasible with optimizations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    p = int(data[0])\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    max_tri = 0\n    tri_list = []\n    s_val = 1\n    while True:\n        tri_val = s_val * (s_val - 1) // 2\n        if tri_val > p:\n            break\n        tri_list.append((tri_val, s_val))\n        s_val += 1\n        \n    dp = [10**9] * (p + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n    \n    for t_val, s_size in tri_list:\n        for j in range(t_val, p + 1):\n            if dp[j - t_val] != 10**9:\n                if dp[j] > dp[j - t_val] + s_size:\n                    dp[j] = dp[j - t_val] + s_size\n                    \n    n_min = dp[p]\n    \n    if n_min == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n    else:\n        max_unidirectional = n_min * (n_min - 1)\n        print(f\"{n_min} {max_unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single integer `p`.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If `p` is 0, the output is \"0 0\" since no nodes are needed.\n3. **Triangular Numbers Calculation**: Compute all triangular numbers (T(s) for s from 1 upwards) that are less than or equal to `p`.\n4. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Initialize a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimal nodes needed for `i` mutual pairs. The array is initialized to a large value except for `dp[0]` which is 0.\n5. **DP Array Population**: For each triangular number, update the DP array from the triangular value up to `p` to reflect the minimal nodes required.\n6. **Output**: The minimal nodes `n_min` is derived from `dp[p]`. The maximum unidirectional pairs for this graph is `n_min * (n_min - 1)`, as each pair can have a one-way edge in a DAG structure.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging dynamic programming and properties of triangular numbers to minimize nodes and maximize unidirectional pairs.",
