Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is to check two things:\n 1. The total letters in the first two lines (combined) must be exactly the same as the third line (the pile).\n    - That means the multiset of letters in the pile must equal the multiset of letters from the first two names.\n\n However, note: the problem says there are no extra letters and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\n So we have to use exactly the letters from the first two names (without any extra) to form the two names.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest's name and host's name) and remove all spaces (if any, though the problem says uppercase letters and no spaces? but the example has '\\n' so we split by newline).\n 2. Read the third string (the pile) and remove spaces (if any) or just consider the string as given (since the input is by lines, we can split and then combine without spaces? Actually the example input is given with '\\n', so we should split and then take the first two and the third).\n\n But note: the input example is given as:\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n However, we are reading from stdin, so we can do:\n\n Let's read the three lines:\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n Then, the combined letters = guest + host\n\n We need to check if the sorted list of the combined letters is the same as the sorted list of the pile.\n\n However, note: the example input might have multiple lines, but the problem says each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as a string with newlines, so we can read each line separately.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says: the input file consists of three lines.\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   s1 = input().replace('\\n','')\n   s2 = input().replace('\\n','')\n   s3 = input().replace('\\n','')\n\n But actually, using strip() is enough because the problem says they contain only uppercase letters and the length does not exceed 100.\n\n However, note: the example input has '\\n' in the string representation, but when reading from stdin, the input() function will read until the newline and the next call will read the next line.\n\n So, we can simply do:\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n Then, combine = guest + host\n\n Then, check if sorted(letters from pile) == sorted(letters from combine)\n\n But wait, what if the lengths are different? Then it's \"NO\".\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   if len(combine) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n   else:\n        if sorted(combine) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n However, let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n   guest = 'SANTACLAUS'\n   host = 'DEDMOROZ'\n   combine = 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n\n   pile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   But wait, the example input is provided as: \n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   Actually, the example input has the third string as 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'. \n\n   But note: the example output is YES.\n\n   Now, let's count the letters in the example:\n\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 10 letters\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters\n   Total: 18 letters\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> Let's count: \n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 18 letters.\n\n   Now, sort both:\n\n   combine = 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'\n   sorted_combine = sorted('SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ') \n\n   pile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n   sorted_pile = sorted('SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS')\n\n   Are they the same?\n\n   Let me write the sorted list for combine:\n\n   combine: \n      A: 2 (from 'A' in 'SANTACLAUS' and one from 'A' in 'DEDMOROZ'? Wait, no: \n          SANTACLAUS: A appears 2 times? Actually, let me break down:\n\n          SANTACLAUS: \n            S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n          DEDMOROZ:\n            D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n          Total: \n            A:2, C:1, D:2, E:1, L:1, M:1, N:1, O:2, R:1, S:2, T:1, U:1, Z:1\n\n   Now, pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n          S: appears in SANTA (2), then again at the end? Actually: \n          SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS: \n            S: 3? (one in SANTA, one in CLAUS? Actually, let's break:\n\n          S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n          Counting:\n            A: 2 (positions: 2nd and 7th)\n            C:1, D:2, E:1, L:1, M:1, N:1, O:2, R:1, S:3, T:1, U:1, Z:1\n\n          So, the counts don't match: A:2 vs 2, but S:2 in combine and 3 in pile? \n\n   Wait, this doesn't match. But the example says YES.\n\n   Let me reexamine the example input:\n\n   The example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n   But wait, the example input is actually:\n\n        Line1: 'SANTACLAUS'\n        Line2: 'DEDMOROZ'\n        Line3: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\n   And the example output is YES.\n\n   However, the example also says:\n\n        In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\n\n   So, the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'. \n\n   But wait, the expected combined name is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\", but the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". \n\n   How can they be the same?\n\n   Let me write the expected combined name: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   And the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   They have the same set of letters? \n\n   Expected: \n        SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ -> \n        S:2, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Pile: \n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S:3, A:2, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Wait, the pile has an extra S? \n\n   But wait, the example input is:\n\n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Actually, the example says: \n\n        In the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.\n\n   This implies that the pile is exactly the letters from the two names.\n\n   However, the example output is YES.\n\n   Let me recount the two names:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> letters: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> Wait, that's 10 letters, but note: \n            SANTACLAUS: \n                S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        Host: DEDMOROZ -> \n            D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Combined: \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Now, the pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n            S: (at beginning, then after TAMA, then at the end) -> \n            S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n            Count:\n                S: 3\n                A: 3 (because we have A at index1, index4, index15)\n                N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        So now the counts match: \n            S:3, A:3, ... etc.\n\n        But wait, the guest had S:2 and the host didn't contribute an S. Then the combined total is 3 S's.\n\n        And the pile has 3 S's.\n\n        So the example input is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the method is to compare the sorted list of the combined string (guest+host) and the sorted list of the pile.\n\n   But note: the example input has two lines for the names and one line for the pile.\n\n   However, the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But that is just a representation. When we read from stdin, we get three lines.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        Input: \n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Expected: NO.\n\n        Let's compute:\n\n            Guest: \"PAPAINOEL\" -> 9 letters\n            Host: \"JOULUPUKKI\" -> 10 letters\n            Combined: 19 letters.\n\n            Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> Let's count: \n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI -> 19 letters.\n\n            Now, check the letters:\n\n            Guest: PAPAINOEL -> \n                P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1\n\n            Host: JOULUPUKKI ->\n                J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1\n\n            Combined:\n                P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n            Pile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI -> \n                J:1, O:3, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n            Not matching: \n                Combined: O:2, Pile: O:3 -> extra O in pile.\n\n            Also, note: the example says: \n                \"In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".\"\n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'\"\n\n            But according to our count: \n                Combined has 3 P's, pile has 2 P's -> so pile is missing one P, and combined has 2 L's and pile has 2 L's? \n\n            Wait, let me recount the pile:\n\n                JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n                Breaking down the pile:\n\n                J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n                Now, count:\n\n                J:1\n                O:3 (first O, then another O, then another O)\n                U:3 (first U, then another U, then another U)\n                L:3 (first L, then an L, then an L) -> wait, that's 3 L's?\n                N:1\n                A:2\n                P:2\n                I:2\n                E:1\n                K:2\n\n            Now, combined has L:2, but pile has L:3 -> extra L.\n\n            So the example says: there's an extra letter 'L'. \n\n            Also, P:3 in combined, but pile has P:2 -> missing one P.\n\n            So the condition fails because the total letters must be exactly the same.\n\n            Since the pile has 3 L's and 2 P's (while needed 2 L's and 3 P's) then the sorted lists won't match.\n\n            Therefore, we output \"NO\", which matches.\n\n   Example 3:\n\n        Input: \n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Expected: NO.\n\n        Let's check:\n\n            Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> 11 letters\n            Host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> 14 letters\n            Combined: 25 letters.\n\n            Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> 25 letters.\n\n            Now, let's count the letters:\n\n            Guest: \"BABBONATALE\" -> \n                B:3, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:1, (and the rest: R?

So there's an extra L.\n\n                So the sorted lists won't match.\n\n            Thus, we output \"NO\".\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        Read the three lines.\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        s1 = guest + host\n        if len(s1) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(s1) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        s1 = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" -> 18 letters\n        pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> 18 letters\n        sorted(s1) should equal sorted(pile) -> YES.\n\n   Example 2: \n        s1 = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\" -> 19 letters\n        pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> 19 letters, but sorted(s1) != sorted(pile) -> NO.\n\n   Example 3: \n        s1 = \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\" -> 25 letters\n        pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" -> 25 letters, but sorted(s1) != sorted(pile) -> NO.\n\n   This should work.\n\n   However, note: the example input representation in the problem statement was given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   But when we read, we are stripping each line. The example input has newline characters, but using strip() will remove any leading/trailing whitespace (including newline). \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        guest = input().replace('\\n', '')\n        host = input().replace('\\n', '')\n        pile = input().replace('\\n', '')\n\n   But the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters.\n\n   It's safe to use strip().\n\n   Let me run the code on the provided examples.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a list of strings in the problem, but when we read from stdin, we get three separate lines.\n\n   We'll assume the input is provided as three lines.\n\n   Code:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        s1 = guest + host\n\n        if len(s1) != len(pile):\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if sorted(s1) == sorted(pile):\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   This is efficient for strings up to 200 characters (each line up to 100, so combined 200). Sorting 200 characters is very fast.\n\n   Let's submit.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the lengths of the combined names and the pile must be equal, and the multiset of letters in both must match.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from the standard input, representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Check Lengths**: Compare the length of the combined names with the length of the pile. If they differ, output \"NO\" immediately since it's impossible to form the names with extra or missing letters.\n4. **Check Letter Counts**: If the lengths match, sort both the combined names and the pile. If the sorted strings are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the same letters in the same quantities, so output \"YES\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    s1 = guest + host\n    \n    if len(s1) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if sorted(s1) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three lines of input, each stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace (though the problem guarantees uppercase letters and no spaces).\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string `s1`.\n3. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of `s1` matches the length of the pile. If not, it prints \"NO\" because the letters cannot form the required names without extra or missing letters.\n4. **Sorting and Comparison**: If the lengths match, the program sorts both `s1` and the pile. If the sorted strings are identical, it means the pile has exactly the same letters as the combined names, allowing the names to be reconstructed. The program then prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the feasibility of reconstructing the names from the given pile by leveraging simple string operations and comparison.",
