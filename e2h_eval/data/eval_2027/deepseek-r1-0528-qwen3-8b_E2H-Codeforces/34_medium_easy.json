And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n For each week, the average is the sum of the k consecutive days divided by k.\n Then, we are to compute the overall average over all weeks.\n\n However note: The problem asks for the average sleep time over all weeks. \n But note: there are (n-k+1) weeks. So we need to compute:\n   total_sum = (sum of week1 + sum of week2 + ... + sum of week_{n-k+1}) / (n-k+1)\n\n But wait: Let's break down the example: \n   Input: \"3 2\" and [3,4,7]\n   Weeks: [3,4] -> (3+4)/2 = 3.5, [4,7] -> (4+7)/2 = 5.5\n   Then overall average: (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 9/2 = 4.5\n\n However, the example output is \"9.0000000000\". \n\n Wait, let me re-read the example: \n   \"the result is .\"\n\n Actually, the example in the problem says: \n   \"if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n But then the example output is '9.0000000000'. \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n The problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n However, note that the example output is 9.0, which is the total sum of the two weeks (3+4+4+7 = 18) divided by the number of weeks (which is 2)? \n But wait: 18/2 = 9. \n\n Alternatively, if we consider the entire data as being averaged over the entire week set? \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" but then they are averaging over the weeks.\n\n But note: the example input \"3 2\" and [3,4,7] has two weeks. The average per week would be (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5.\n\n However, the example output is 9.0. \n\n This discrepancy indicates that I might have misinterpreted the problem.\n\n Let me read again: \n   \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n And then: \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n But the example output is provided as '9.0000000000'. \n\n Actually, looking at the example outputs:\n\n   Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" -> Output \"9.0000000000\"\n   Example 2: Input \"1 1\\n10\" -> Output \"10.0000000000\"\n   Example 3: Input \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" -> Output \"28964.2857142857\"\n\n Let me recast:\n\n Example 2: n=1, k=1 -> one week: [10]. Then the average over the one week is 10.0.\n\n Example 1: n=3, k=2 -> two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n   The problem says: \"the result is\" without specifying, but the output is 9.\n\n What is 9? It is the total sum of the sleep times in the two weeks (3+4+4+7 = 18) divided by the total number of days? \n But note: the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" but then they are considering multiple weeks.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the average sleep time per day, but then multiplied by k? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and then they are considering multiple weeks (so the overall average per week).\n\n However, the example output for the first example is 9, which is not the average per week (which is 4.5) but the average per day? \n\n Actually, let me check the third example:\n\n   Input: 8 2, and the array [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\n   There are 7 weeks (since n-k+1 = 8-2+1 = 7). \n\n   Each week is two consecutive days.\n\n   The answer is 28964.2857142857.\n\n   How did they get that?\n\n   Let's compute the total sum of all weeks: \n     Week1: 1+2 = 3\n     Week2: 2+4 = 6\n     Week3: 4+100000 = 100004\n     Week4: 100000+123 = 100123\n     Week5: 123+456 = 579\n     Week6: 456+789 = 1245\n     Week7: 789+1 = 790\n\n   Total sum of all weeks = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n\n   Let me calculate step by step:\n      3+6 = 9\n      9+100004 = 100013\n      100013+100123 = 200136\n      200136+579 = 200715\n      200715+1245 = 201960\n      201960+790 = 202750\n\n   Then the average over the 7 weeks is 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n   So the problem is: \n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = (sum of the first week) + (sum of the second week) + ... \n        Then, the average = total_sleep_in_all_weeks / total_weeks\n\n   But wait, why isn't the average per week just the average of the averages of the individual weeks? \n\n   Actually, note: \n        average_week_i = (week_i_sum) / k\n        Then, the overall average = (1/(n-k+1)) * sum_i(average_week_i) \n        = (1/(n-k+1)) * ( (week_1_sum + week_2_sum + ...) / k ) \n        = ( (week_1_sum + week_2_sum + ...) ) / (k*(n-k+1))\n\n   However, our calculation above for the first example was:\n        total_sleep_in_all_weeks = 18\n        total_weeks = 2\n        average = 18/2 = 9.\n\n   But according to the alternative formula, we would have:\n        average = ( (3+4+4+7) ) / (2*2) = 18/4 = 4.5.\n\n   Why the discrepancy?\n\n   Let me clarify the problem statement: \n        \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n   The example output is 9 for the first example. \n\n   But note: the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" and there are two weeks. \n   The total sleep time in the two weeks is 18 hours, so the average per week is 18/2 = 9.\n\n   However, wait: the definition of \"per week\" is the average sleep per week. In the two weeks, the sleep per week is 3.5 and 5.5, so the average of these two is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 4.5.\n\n   But the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". \n\n   Now I see two interpretations:\n      A) The average sleep time per week, meaning for each week we take the average and then we average those (i.e., the mean of the weekly means).\n      B) The total sleep time over all weeks divided by the number of weeks.\n\n   However, the problem does not say to average the weekly means. It says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and then says we consider k consecutive days as a week and there are n-k+1 weeks.\n\n   But note: the example output is 9, which is the total sleep time (across all days) divided by the number of weeks, not by the number of days.\n\n   Alternatively, think about it: \n        In the first example, the entire two weeks have 3+4+4+7 = 18 hours. \n        Since there are two weeks, the average per week is 18/2 = 9.\n\n   However, if we use the weekly average, then we are saying: \n        Week1: 3.5, Week2: 5.5 -> average per week is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 4.5.\n\n   The problem says \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and in statistics, sometimes \"average per week\" can be interpreted as the total amount of sleep divided by the number of weeks, or as the average of the daily averages.\n\n   But note: the example output is 9, which is the total sleep over the two weeks (18) divided by the two weeks (9 per week). \n\n   So the problem is actually: \n        total_sleep = sum_{i=1}^{n-k+1} (sum_{j=0}^{k-1} a[i+j])\n        Then, average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and a week is k consecutive days. \n\n   But note: the total_sleep is the sum of all sleep in the entire period? Actually, the entire period is n days, but we are grouping into overlapping weeks? \n\n   Actually, the entire period is from day1 to day n, and we are considering every contiguous k-day segment. The total_sleep is the same as the sum of all the numbers in the array, but each number is counted as many times as it appears in a week.\n\n   How many times is each day counted?\n        Day i is included in the weeks that start from max(1, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k+1) ? \n\n   Actually, for day i, the weeks that include day i are the ones that start from j such that j <= i <= j+k-1.\n        j from max(1, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k+1) (but note: the last week starts at n-k+1, and the week must end at or before n)\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the total_sleep as the sum of all the weeks. \n\n   There is a simpler way: \n        total_sleep = (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1}) * (how many times each element is counted) ?\n\n   Actually, we can use a sliding window and prefix sums to avoid recalculating the entire week for each week.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let total_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n   We want to compute S = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} a[j])\n\n   We can do:\n        Let prefix[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]\n\n        Then the sum for the week starting at i (0-indexed) is prefix[i+k] - prefix[i]\n\n        Then total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (prefix[i+k] - prefix[i])\n\n   But note: we can also use a single pass with a sliding window.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the entire array is used, and the element at position j (0-indexed) is included in the weeks that start from max(0, j-k+1) to j (if we consider 0-indexed). The number of weeks that include a_j is (j+1) if j < k-1, but actually:\n\n        The first week that includes a_j is the week starting at index j0 = max(0, j-k+1) (if we start week index at 0) and the last week that includes a_j is the week starting at index j (if j+k-1 <= n-1, but note: the last week starts at n-k, so the condition for including a_j is that the week must start at <= j and >= j-k+1, and the week must start at >=0 and <= n-k.\n\n        Actually, the week starting at s (0-indexed) includes days s to s+k-1. Then a_j is included if s <= j <= s+k-1 -> s in [max(0, j-k+1), j] (but note: s cannot exceed n-k). So the number of weeks that include a_j is: \n            s_min = max(0, j-k+1)\n            s_max = min(j, n-k)   [because the last week that includes a_j must start at most j, and the last week overall is n-k (0-indexed, because the first week starts at 0, the last at n-k)]\n\n        But wait, the week starting at s must satisfy s <= j and s>=0 and s<=n-k. Also, from the condition j<=s+k-1 => s>=j-k+1.\n\n        So the count for a_j is: count_j = min(j, n-k) - max(0, j-k+1) + 1\n\n        Then total_sleep = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a[j] * count_j\n\n   However, we can avoid this by using a sliding window for the entire array.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints are up to 200,000, so we need an O(n) solution.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the total_sleep by:\n\n        total_sleep = (sum of the first k) + (sum of the next k) + ... \n\n        We can use a prefix sum array.\n\n   Steps for prefix sum:\n\n        Let P[0] = 0\n        P[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a[i-1]\n\n        Then the sum for week i (starting at index i) is P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n        Then total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (P[i+k] - P[i])\n\n        Then average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n   But note: the example [3,4,7] with k=2, n=3:\n\n        P[0]=0, P[1]=3, P[2]=7, P[3]=11\n\n        Week0 (i=0): P[0+2]-P[0] = 7-0 = 7\n        Week1 (i=1): P[1+2]-P[1] = 11-3 = 8\n\n        Then total_sleep = 7+8 = 15, and average = 15/2 = 7.5, but expected is 9.\n\n   Wait, what? That doesn't match.\n\n   Let me check: \n        Week0: days0 and day1: 3+4 = 7 -> correct.\n        Week1: days1 and day2: 4+7 = 8 -> correct.\n\n        Then the total_sleep is 7+8 = 15, and there are 2 weeks, so 15/2 = 7.5, but the example output is 9.\n\n   But wait, the example output is 9, which is (3+4+4+7) / 2? \n\n        (3+4+4+7) = 18, then 18/2 = 9.\n\n   However, note that the two weeks together use the days: \n        Week0: [3,4]\n        Week1: [4,7]\n        So the total_sleep is 3+4+4+7 = 18.\n\n   But our method using the prefix sum for the windows gave 7+8=15.\n\n   Why? \n\n   Because the prefix sum method for a window [i, i+k-1] is correct, but note that we are summing the windows separately. \n\n   However, the issue is that the two weeks together are not disjoint. The day1 (the second day) is counted twice.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and we are to consider each week independently. \n\n   The total_sleep is the sum of the sleep in each week. Since the weeks overlap, we are counting the same day multiple times.\n\n   The example: \n        Week0: [3,4] -> 7\n        Week1: [4,7] -> 8\n        Total_sleep = 7+8 = 15.\n\n   But wait, that doesn't add up to 3+4+4+7=18. \n\n   Actually, the two weeks together have the days: \n        Day0: 3 (appearing once)\n        Day1: 4 (appearing twice)\n        Day2: 7 (appearing once)\n\n   So total_sleep should be 3 + 4*2 + 7 = 3+8+7 = 18.\n\n   Therefore, the prefix sum method I described above is correct for each window, but when we add the windows we are effectively counting:\n\n        Week0: [3,4] -> adds 3 and 4\n        Week1: [4,7] -> adds 4 and 7\n\n        So the total_sleep is 3+4+4+7 = 18.\n\n   But wait, how do we compute 18 using the prefix array?\n\n        We have:\n          P[0] = 0\n          P[1] = 3\n          P[2] = 3+4 = 7\n          P[3] = 3+4+7 = 11\n\n        Then the first window (week0) from index0 to index1: P[2]-P[0] = 7\n        The second window (week1) from index1 to index2: P[3]-P[1] = 11-3 = 8\n\n        Then total_sleep = 7+8 = 15, which is missing 3.\n\n   Why? Because the second window uses the prefix sum at index1 (which is 3) and subtracts the prefix sum at index1 (which is 3) from the prefix sum at index3 (which is 11). \n\n   But note: the prefix array is defined as P[i] = sum(a[0:i]), so the window [1,2] (0-indexed indices 1 to 2) is a[1]+a[2] = 4+7 = 11-3=8, which is correct.\n\n   Then why do we get 15 and not 18?\n\n   The mistake is that the two weeks are:\n\n        Week0: a0+a1 = 3+4\n        Week1: a1+a2 = 4+7\n\n        So the total_sleep is (3+4) + (4+7) = 3 + 4 + 4 + 7 = 18.\n\n   But our calculation with the prefix array is:\n\n        Week0: P[2] - P[0] = 7 - 0 = 7\n        Week1: P[3] - P[1] = 11 - 3 = 8\n\n        7+8=15.\n\n   This does not equal 18.\n\n   What is the problem? \n\n   The issue is that the prefix array P is defined as the cumulative sum from 0 to i-1. \n\n   The window from index i to index i+k-1 (inclusive) is from the i-th element to the (i+k-1)-th element.\n\n   Then the sum for the window starting at i is: \n        P[i+k] - P[i]   [because P[i+k] = a0+...+a_{i+k-1}, and P[i] = a0+...+a_{i-1}, so subtracting gives a_i + ... + a_{i+k-1}]\n\n   For i=0: \n        P[0+2] = P[2] = a0+a1 = 3+4 = 7, and P[0]=0 -> 7.\n\n   For i=1:\n        P[1+2] = P[3] = a0+a1+a2 = 3+4+7 = 11, and P[1]=a0=3 -> 11-3 = 8.\n\n   Then the total_sleep is 7+8 = 15, but the actual total_sleep (if we were to list all the numbers) is 3 (from week0) and 4 (from week0) and 4 (from week1) and 7 (from week1) -> 3+4+4+7=18.\n\n   The problem: the two weeks are overlapping, and the prefix array method for the second window includes the first element (a0) and then subtracts the first element (a0) so that the second window becomes a1+a2.\n\n   But wait, why is the total_sleep 15 and not 18? \n\n   Actually, the problem does not define total_sleep as the sum of the sleep in the entire set of weeks. \n\n   The problem says: \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n   And each week is considered independently. \n\n   But note: the example output is 9, which is 18/2.\n\n   So the problem is: the total_sleep is the sum of the sleep in each week (with overlapping) and then we divide by the number of weeks.\n\n   However, the example output is 9, which is 18/2.\n\n   So we must compute 18, not 15.\n\n   How to compute 18?\n\n   We can note that the entire set of weeks is:\n\n        Week0: [3,4] -> 7\n        Week1: [4,7] -> 8\n\n        Total_sleep = 7+8 = 15? \n\n   But wait, 7+8 is 15, and 15 is not 18.\n\n   Let me recast: \n\n        The total_sleep is the sum of the sleep in each week. \n\n        But the sleep in week0 is 3+4 = 7.\n        The sleep in week1 is 4+7 = 8.\n\n        So the total_sleep (if we are counting the sleep in each week separately) is 7+8=15.\n\n   Then the average per week is 15/2 = 7.5.\n\n   But the example output is 9.\n\n   Now I'm confused.\n\n   Let me read the example again: \n\n        \"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\n   And the example output is '9.0000000000'\n\n   Another possibility: the problem is asking for the average sleep time per day, but then multiplied by k? \n\n   Or maybe the problem is asking for the average sleep time over the entire period (all days) divided by k? \n\n   But wait, the entire period has 3 days: 3+4+7=14, and 14/3 ≈ 4.666..., which is not 9.\n\n   Or: the average sleep time per day is 14/3 ≈ 4.666..., and then the average per week (which is 2 days) would be 4.666... * 2 = 9.333..., which is not 9.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the total_sleep (counting each day only once) divided by the total number of days? \n\n        Total_sleep (each day counted once) = 3+4+7 = 14\n        Number of days = 3\n        Average per day = 14/3 ≈ 4.666...\n\n   Then the average per week (if a week is 2 days) would be (14/3) * 2 = 28/3 ≈ 9.333...\n\n   Not 9.\n\n   Or: the average per week is the total_sleep (each day counted once) divided by the number of weeks? \n\n        Number of weeks = 2\n        Then 14/2 = 7 -> not 9.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: \n\n        \"Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.\n\n         The doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week).\"\n\n         \"Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration.\"\n\n   And the example output is 9.\n\n   The key: the example input \"3 2\\n3 4 7\" has two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. \n\n   The average amount of hours of sleep per week is defined as the average of the weekly averages? \n\n        Weekly average for week0: (3+4)/2 = 3.5\n        Weekly average for week1: (4+7)/2 = 5.5\n        Then the average of these two weekly averages is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\n   Or is it defined as the total_sleep (which is the sum of all the sleep in the weeks, i.e., 3+4+4+7=18) divided by the total number of days in the weeks? \n\n        Total days in the weeks: 4 days (two weeks * 2 days) -> 18/4 = 4.5.\n\n   But the example output is 9.\n\n   Or: the average amount of hours of sleep per week is defined as the total_sleep (which is the sum of the sleep in the weeks) divided by the number of weeks? \n\n        18/2 = 9.\n\n   But wait, the total_sleep is 18, and the number of weeks is 2, so 18/2 = 9.\n\n   How do we compute the total_sleep (18) from the array? \n\n        We must count each day as many times as it appears in a week.\n\n        Day0 (3) appears in week0 -> 1 time.\n        Day1 (4) appears in week0 and week1 -> 2 times.\n        Day2 (7) appears in week1 -> 1 time.\n\n        So total_sleep = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3+8+7 = 18.\n\n   Therefore, the problem is: \n\n        total_sleep = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (a[j] * (number of weeks that include day j))\n\n        Then, average = total_sleep / (number of weeks)   [where number of weeks = n-k+1]\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and if we consider that a week is k days, then the average per week should be the total_sleep divided by the number of weeks? \n\n        Yes, because the total_sleep is the sum of sleep over all weeks (each week's sleep is counted), and then we divide by the number of weeks.\n\n   However, note that this is not the same as the average of the weekly averages (which is called the mean of means) because the latter would be (sum_{i} (weekly_sum_i/k)) / (n-k+1) = (total_sleep/k) / (n-k+1) = total_sleep/(k*(n-k+1)).\n\n   But the example output is 9, which is total_sleep/(n-k+1) = 18/2 = 9.\n\n   Therefore, the problem is asking for:\n\n        total_sleep = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a[j] * (number of weeks containing day j)\n\n        Then, average = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n   How to compute the number of weeks containing day j (0-indexed)?\n\n        A week is defined by its start index s (0-indexed) and covers days [s, s+k-1].\n\n        Day j is included in a week starting at s if and only if s <= j <= s+k-1.\n\n        Rearranged: j-k+1 <= s <= j.\n\n        But s must be in the range [0, n-k] (because the first week starts at 0 and the last at n-k).\n\n        So the smallest s can be is max(0, j-k+1) and the largest s can be is min(j, n-k).\n\n        Therefore, the number of weeks containing day j is: num_weeks_j = min(j, n-k) - max(0, j-k+1) + 1\n\n   Then:\n\n        total_sleep = 0\n        for j in range(n):\n            L = max(0, j-k+1)\n            R = min(j, n-k)\n            count_j = R - L + 1\n            total_sleep += a[j] * count_j\n\n        total_weeks = n-k+1\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   Let's test with the first example:\n\n        n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n        j=0:\n            L = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0\n            R = min(0,3-2)=min(0,1)=0\n            count_0 = 0-0+1 = 1\n            contribution = 3*1 = 3\n\n        j=1:\n            L = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0\n            R = min(1,1)=1\n            count_1 = 1-0+1 = 2\n            contribution = 4*2 = 8\n\n        j=2:\n            L = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1\n            R = min(2,1)=1\n            count_2 = 1-1+1 = 1\n            contribution = 7*1 = 7\n\n        total_sleep = 3+8+7 = 18\n        total_weeks = 3-2+1 = 2\n        average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Example 2: \"1 1\\n10\"\n\n        n=1, k=1, a=[10]\n\n        j=0:\n            L = max(0,0-1+1)=max(0,0)=0\n            R = min(0,1-1)=min(0,0)=0\n            count_0 = 0-0+1 = 1\n            total_sleep = 10\n            total_weeks = 1-1+1 = 1\n            average = 10/1 = 10.0\n\n   Example 3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n\n        We have n=8, k=2, so total_weeks = 8-2+1 = 7.\n\n        We need to compute the count for each of the 8 days.\n\n        j=0: L=max(0,0-2+1)=0, R=min(0,6)=0 -> count=1\n        j=1: L=max(0,1-2+1)=0, R=min(1,6)=1 -> count=2\n        j=2: L=max(0,2-2+1)=1, R=min(2,6)=2 -> count=2\n        j=3: L=max(0,3-2+1)=2, R=min(3,6)=3 -> count=2\n        j=4: L=max(0,4-2+1)=3, R=min(4,6)=4 -> count=2\n        j=5: L=max(0,5-2+1)=4, R=min(5,6)=5 -> count=2\n        j=6: L=max(0,6-2+1)=5, R=min(6,6)=6 -> count=2\n        j=7: L=max(0,7-2+1)=6, R=min(7,6)=6 -> count=1\n\n        Then total_sleep = \n           1*1 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 + 789*2 + 1*1\n          = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n          = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n\n        Let me compute step by step:\n\n          1+4 = 5\n          5+8 = 13\n          13+200000 = 200013\n          200013+246 = 200259\n          200259+912 = 201171\n          201171+1578 = 202749\n          202749+1 = 202750\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        Which matches.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Read n, k and the list a.\n\n        total_weeks = n -

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time per week for Polycarp over all possible weeks in his sleep records. Each week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks in total. The challenge is to efficiently compute the average sleep time across all these weeks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each day's sleep time is included in multiple weeks, specifically in all weeks that start from `max(0, j - k + 1)` to `min(j, n - k)`, where `j` is the day index (0-based). The number of weeks a day `j` appears in is given by `count_j = min(j, n - k) - max(0, j - k + 1) + 1`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of calculating the sum for each week separately (which would be inefficient for large `n`), we can leverage the fact that each day's contribution to the total sleep time is proportional to the number of weeks it appears in. By summing up each day's sleep time multiplied by its count of appearances across all weeks, we get the total sleep time for all weeks combined. Dividing this total by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`) gives the desired average.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iterating over each day, computing its contribution to the total sleep time based on its appearance count in weeks, and then averaging this total over all weeks. This approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each day exactly once, making it O(n) in time complexity. The space complexity is O(1) additional space (apart from storing the input array), as we only need a few variables to accumulate the total sleep time and the average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    total_sleep = 0.0\n    for j in range(n):\n        L = max(0, j - k + 1)\n        R = min(j, n - k)\n        count_j = R - L + 1\n        total_sleep += a[j] * count_j\n        \n    average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of days) and `k` (days per week), followed by an array `a` of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n2. **Initial Checks**: If there are no valid weeks (`total_weeks` is zero), the result is trivially zero.\n3. **Total Sleep Calculation**: For each day `j`, compute how many weeks include this day (`count_j`). Multiply the day's sleep time by `count_j` and accumulate this into `total_sleep`.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Divide the accumulated `total_sleep` by the number of weeks (`total_weeks`) to get the average sleep time per week.\n5. **Output**: Print the average formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging the overlapping nature of the weeks and minimizing redundant calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
