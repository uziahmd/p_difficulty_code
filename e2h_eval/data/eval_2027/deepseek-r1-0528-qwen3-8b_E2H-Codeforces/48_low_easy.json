            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: either two integers or one integer and an 'R'\n The next line is a string representing a non-negative integer in base `a` (which may have leading zeros, but the length is at most 1000)\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the given number from base a to base 10 (if it's not zero) and then convert that base-10 number to a Roman numeral.\n    But note: the input might be in base a, and a can be as low as 2 and up to 25. Also, if the number is 0, then we don't output anything? But note the guarantee: for Roman numerals, the number won't be 0.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we convert the given string (in base a) to a base-10 integer, then convert that base-10 integer to base b (which is an integer between 2 and 25). However, note the example: \n        Input: \"12 13\\nA\"\n        Here, base a=12, so the digit 'A' represents 10 in base 12. Then we convert the base-10 number 10 to base 13. In base 13, 10 is represented by the digit 'A'.\n\n 3. Important: The input string for the number can have leading zeros, but we must omit leading zeros in the output.\n\n However, note the guarantee: \n   - For Roman numerals: the number is <= 300010 and not 0.\n   - For other bases: the number won't be greater than 10^15^10 (but actually that seems too big, so likely the problem meant the number in base 10 might be large? But note: the input string has length <= 1000, and base a is between 2 and 25, so the maximum value in base 10 would be (a-1) * (a^(n-1)) ... which for base 25 and n=1000 is enormous. However, the problem says \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" \n But wait: 10^15^10 is 10^(15*10) = 10^150, which is huge. However, the problem says \"the number\" meaning the value? Or the string representation? Let me read again: \n      \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n Actually, the note says: \"the number\" (meaning the value) in Roman case is <= 300010, and in the other case the number (value) is <= 101510.\n\n So, if b is not R, then the value of c (base 10) is <= 101510. But wait, the input string is in base a, and a can be up to 25, and the string length is up to 1000? How can the value be <= 101510?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" So we are safe to convert the entire string from base a to base 10 only if the base 10 value is <= 101510? \n\n However, note: if we have a base a and a long string, but the base 10 value is bounded by 101510, then the string might represent a number that is small even if the base is high? Actually, the condition is on the value, so we can safely convert the entire string from base a to base 10, because the base 10 value is at most 101510 (which is about 10^5), so the base 10 integer will fit in Python's int.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the number\" (the value) is <= 1015",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of converting to the Roman numeral system. The solution involves handling two main cases: converting between standard bases or converting from a standard base to the Roman numeral system.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the first line to determine the source base `a` and target base `b`. The target base can be either an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals.\n2. **Conversion to Base 10**: Convert the input string (which is in base `a`) to a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the string, considering its positional value in base `a`.\n3. **Base Conversion**:\n   - If the target base `b` is an integer, convert the base 10 integer to base `b`. Special cases include handling bases higher than 10 by using letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.).\n   - If the target base is 'R', convert the base 10 integer to a Roman numeral. This involves breaking down the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, then mapping each segment to the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the input number is zero (though the problem guarantees it won't be zero for Roman numerals) and ensure leading zeros are omitted in the output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    num_str_line = data[1].strip()\n    \n    if len(first_line) == 2:\n        try:\n            a = int(first_line[0])\n            b = int(first_line[1])\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input\")\n            return\n    else:\n        a = int(first_line[0])\n        if first_line[1] == 'R':\n            b = 'R'\n        else:\n            print(\"Invalid input\")\n            return\n\n    n_str = num_str_line\n\n    if n_str == '':\n        print(\"\")\n        return\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        # Convert from base a to base 10\n        base10_val = 0\n        neg_flag = False\n        for char in n_str:\n            if char == '-':\n                neg_flag = True\n                continue\n            if char.isdigit():\n                digit = int(char)\n            else:\n                digit = ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n            if digit >= a:\n                print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n                return\n            base10_val = base10_val * a + digit\n\n        if base10_val == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n            return\n\n        if neg_flag:\n            print(\"Roman numerals do not represent negative numbers\")\n            return\n\n        if base10_val > 300010:\n            print(\"Number too large for Roman numerals\")\n            return\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            roman_map = [\n                ('M', 1000),\n                ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n                ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50),\n                ('XL', 40), ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5),\n                ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n            ]\n            res = ''\n            for numeral, value in roman_map:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res += numeral\n                    n -= value\n            return res\n\n        roman_num = to_roman(base10_val)\n        print(roman_num)\n\n    else:\n        # Standard base conversion\n        try:\n            base10_val = 0\n            neg_flag = False\n            for char in n_str:\n                if char == '-':\n                    neg_flag = True\n                    continue\n                if char.isdigit():\n                    digit = int(char)\n                else:\n                    digit = ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n                if digit >= b:\n                    print(\"Invalid digit for base\", b)\n                    return\n                base10_val = base10_val * a + digit\n\n            if base10_val == 0:\n                print(\"0\")\n                return\n\n            if neg_flag:\n                print(\"Negative numbers are not supported\")\n                return\n\n            if base10_val > 10**1510:\n                print(\"Number too large\")\n                return\n\n            digits = []\n            while base10_val:\n                remainder = base10_val % b\n                base10_val //= b\n                if remainder < 10:\n                    digits.append(str(remainder))\n                else:\n                    digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n\n            result = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n            print(result)\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"Error:\", e)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the first line to get the source and target bases. The second line contains the number to be converted.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string is converted from base `a` to a base 10 integer. Each character is processed to determine its digit value, considering both numeric and alphabetic representations.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the base 10 integer is converted to Roman numerals by mapping segments of the number to corresponding Roman numeral symbols (e.g., 1000 to 'M', 900 to 'CM', etc.).\n4. **Standard Base Conversion**: For other target bases, the base 10 integer is converted by repeatedly dividing by the target base and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to their respective digits (including letters for values greater than 9).\n5. **Edge Handling**: The program checks for invalid inputs, negative numbers, and ensures leading zeros are omitted in the output. Special cases like zero or very large numbers are handled according to the problem constraints.",
