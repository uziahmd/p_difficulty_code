The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n Conditions: \n   The plate is w x h.\n   We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost), the second 2 cells away, etc.\n   Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n How to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n   The i-th ring is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n   However, note that the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n   But note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (so the outermost ring) and the second one 2 cells away.\n\n   The ring is the border of the current rectangle. So if the current rectangle has dimensions n x m (n = w - 4*(i-1), m = h - 4*(i-1)), then the border (ring) would be:\n        total cells in the border = 2*(n + m) - 4   [because each side has n or m, but corners are counted twice so subtract 4]\n\n   However, let's check with the example:\n\n   Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> w=3, h=3, k=1.\n      For the first ring (i=1): \n          n = 3, m = 3.\n          Cells = 2*(3+3) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8. Matches.\n\n   Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> w=7, h=9, k=1.\n      First ring: n=7, m=9.\n      Cells = 2*(7+9) - 4 = 2*16 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28. Matches.\n\n   Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> two rings.\n      First ring: as above, 28 cells.\n      Second ring: i=2, so we use the inner rectangle: w' = 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, h'=9-4*(2-1)=5.\n      Then the ring for the inner rectangle: 2*(3+5) - 4 = 2*8-4 = 16-4 = 12.\n      Total = 28 + 12 = 40. Matches.\n\n   But wait: the problem says k rings. We must stop when the ring becomes invalid. The input condition says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n   However, note: the condition for the i-th ring is that the inner rectangle must have positive dimensions? Actually, the problem states that k is bounded by that formula.\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Read the input: w, h, k.\n     2. We'll iterate for i from 1 to k (inclusive) and for each ring i:\n            n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        But note: the ring is only defined if n_i >= 2 and m_i >= 2? Actually, the border requires at least 2x2 (so that the border is non-empty). \n        However, the problem states that k is bounded by floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). So we don't need to worry about negative or zero dimensions.\n\n     3. For each ring i, the number of cells is 2*(n_i + m_i) - 4.\n\n   However, wait: what if the inner rectangle has only one row or one column? Then the border formula still holds? Let's test:\n\n        Example: 1x1 -> but our k is at least 1 and the condition k<=floor((min(1,1)+1)/4) = floor((1+1)/4)=floor(2/4)=0, so k cannot be 1. So we are safe.\n\n        Example: 2x2 -> k<=floor((min(2,2)+1)/4)=floor(3/4)=0, so again k=0 is the maximum.\n\n        Example: 3x3 -> k<=floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> so k=1 is allowed.\n\n        The border for 3x3: 2*(3+3)-4 = 8, which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the plan is to sum the borders for i from 1 to k.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the first ring is the outermost, then the next one is 2 cells away, etc.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   But wait",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate and moving inward by 2 cells for each subsequent ring. The width of each ring is 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into a grid of `w` rows and `h` columns. The first ring (outermost) is placed along the edge of the plate. Each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells inward from the previous one. The number of rings `k` is constrained such that the inner dimensions of the smallest ring are at least 2x2.\n2. **Key Insight**: For the i-th ring, the inner rectangle dimensions are `(w - 4*(i-1))` by `(h - 4*(i-1))`. The number of cells in this ring is calculated as the perimeter of this inner rectangle minus 4 (since each corner is counted twice in the perimeter calculation).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for that ring, and sum the cells of all rings. The solution leverages simple arithmetic operations to determine the number of cells for each ring efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        if n_i <= 0 or m_i <= 0:\n            break\n        total_cells += 2 * (n_i + m_i) - 4\n    \n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`, representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings.\n2. **Iterating Over Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. The dimensions are adjusted by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from both `w` and `h` to account for the previous rings.\n3. **Calculating Cells per Ring**: The number of cells in each ring is derived from the formula `2*(n_i + m_i) - 4`, which computes the perimeter of the inner rectangle minus 4 to correct for overlapping corners.\n4. **Termination Condition**: If at any point the inner rectangle dimensions become non-positive, the loop breaks early to avoid invalid calculations.\n5. **Output Result**: The total number of cells across all rings is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging simple arithmetic and iteration, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
