A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink available: k * l milliliters.\n    - Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend? Actually, note: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n      But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    However, note that the group has n friends and they are making toasts such that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n    The total drink required for one toast by all friends is n * nl (because each friend needs nl for one toast).\n    Similarly, the total lime slices needed for one toast is n * 1 (since each friend needs one slice) but wait: actually, the problem says \"a slice of lime\", meaning one per friend per toast. So for one toast, we need n slices.\n\n    But note: they have c limes, each cut into d slices -> total slices = c * d.\n\n    Similarly, the salt required for one toast is n * np.\n\n    However, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n 2. Therefore, for T toasts, the requirements are:\n    - Drink: T * (n * nl)   [because each toast requires n*nl milliliters]\n    - Lime slices: T * n   [each toast requires n slices]\n    - Salt: T * (n * np)   [each toast requires n*np grams]\n\n 3. But note: the problem says \"each friend needs\" these for one toast. And they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n 4. We can also think in terms of limiting factors:\n\n    Let:\n        total_drink = k * l\n        total_slices = c * d\n        total_salt = p\n\n    Then, the maximum number of toasts (for the entire group) is limited by:\n\n        T_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)   [but wait, actually: for one toast, the drink needed is n * nl? Yes, because each of the n friends gets nl for one toast]\n\n        However, note: the example: \n            Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n            Here: n=3, k=4, l=5 -> total_drink = 20\n            nl=3, so for one toast the drink needed is 3 * 3 = 9? But wait, the example says: \n                \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\"\n\n            Why 20/3? \n\n        Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So for one toast, the entire group needs n * nl milliliters.\n\n        But the example calculation: 20 / 3 = 6. That 3 is the nl (which is 3). However, wait: the example uses nl=3, but then the drink per toast is 3? Or is it 3 for the entire group?\n\n        Actually, the example says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" -> so for one toast, one friend gets 3 ml. There are 3 friends -> 9 ml per toast.\n\n        Then why 20/3? That would be 6.66... -> 6. But 6 toasts require 6 * 9 = 54 ml, which is more than 20. \n\n        This indicates I misunderstood.\n\n        Let me check the example again: \n            Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\n            The example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\"\n\n        What if the drink requirement per toast is not per friend but for the entire group? Actually, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", meaning for one toast, one friend gets nl. So for one toast, the entire group gets n * nl.\n\n        Then the example: \n            n=3, nl=3 -> per toast, the drink needed is 3*3 = 9 ml.\n            Total drink available: 20 ml -> maximum toasts from drink: floor(20 / 9) = 2 (because 2*9=18 <=20, 3*9=27>20)\n\n        But the example says 6 toasts. \n\n        Alternatively, maybe the problem means that the entire group's toast requirement is considered together? Let me read again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n        However, the example calculation says: \"20 / 3 = 6\", meaning they are using nl=3 as the drink per toast (without multiplying by n). \n\n        Let me look at the sample output: 2 toasts per friend. So total toasts for the group is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n        How did they get 6? They took the total drink (20) and divided by the drink per toast (nl) but wait, what is the drink per toast? \n\n        Actually, note: the drink requirement is stated per friend. So for one toast, each friend needs nl, so total drink for one toast is n * nl. \n\n        But the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Here they divided by 3 (nl) and got 6, which is the total number of toasts for the entire group. \n\n        Why is that? \n\n        Explanation: In the example, they are considering that each toast only requires nl milliliters? But that doesn't match because there are multiple friends.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that the drink is shared and the toast is made for the entire group? \n\n        Let me reexamine the problem statement: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n        This implies that to make one toast, each friend must have one set of these. So the entire group requires n * nl ml of drink for one toast.\n\n        However, the example calculation does:\n\n            Drink: 4 bottles * 5 ml = 20 ml -> 20 / 3 (nl) = 6.66... -> 6 toasts.\n\n        But wait, if one toast requires 3 ml (for the entire group) then 6 toasts require 18 ml, which is within 20. \n\n        But the problem says \"each friend\" needs nl. Then how can one toast require 3 ml for the entire group? It should be 3*n = 9 ml.\n\n        There seems to be a contradiction.\n\n        Let me check the example input: the sample input is \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\", and the output is 2.\n\n        The example says: \n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        Then they say: \"The limes are enough for 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\n        Wait, here they are dividing the total toasts (from drink) by 3. \n\n        But note: the drink calculation gives 6 toasts (for the entire group?) or per friend?\n\n        Actually, the example is computing the total number of toasts the entire group can make, and then dividing by the number of friends.\n\n        How did they get 6 from the drink? They did: total_drink / nl = 20 / 3 = 6.\n\n        This suggests that in their calculation, one toast requires nl milliliters, not n*nl.\n\n        But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. \n\n        This means that if there are n friends, then one toast requires n * nl milliliters.\n\n        However, in the example, if we use the correct requirement (n*nl) then:\n\n            Drink: 20 ml, per toast: 3*3 = 9 ml -> 20 // 9 = 2 toasts (entire group). Then each friend can make 2 toasts.\n\n        But then why does the example say 6 toasts from drink? \n\n        Let me read the example carefully: \n\n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        This calculation is not matching the requirement (n*nl). \n\n        After reading the problem again: the key is that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. \n\n        Alternate interpretation: \n\n        Instead of thinking about the entire group requiring n*nl per toast, we can think: \n\n        Each toast, each friend gets nl milliliters. But note: the drink is being distributed among the friends. However, the problem states that they are making toasts, and each toast requires that each friend gets nl milliliters. \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me break down the example:\n\n        Input: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        According to the example, the drink calculation is 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n        Then the lime: 10*8 = 80 slices, and each toast requires 1 slice per friend? But wait, the problem says \"a slice of lime\" per friend per toast. So for one toast, we need 3 slices. Then the total toasts from lime would be 80 / 3 = 26.66... -> 26.\n\n        And salt: 100 / (3*1) = 33.33... -> 33.\n\n        Then the minimum of 6, 26, 33 is 6. Then we divide by 3 (number of friends) to get 2 toasts per friend.\n\n        But wait, the example says: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n        They used 80 for lime and 100 for salt. \n\n        For lime: total_slices = 80, and each toast requires 3 slices (because there are 3 friends) so 80/3 ~ 26 toasts, but the example used 80 without dividing by 3?\n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            \"The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\"\n\n        This implies that they are calculating the total number of lime slices (80) and then saying that one toast requires 1 slice (not 3) per friend? \n\n        Wait, no: the problem says \"each friend needs a slice of lime\". So one toast requires 3 slices (one per friend). \n\n        But the example says: \"The limes are enough for 80 toasts\" meaning that they are using one slice per toast (regardless of the number of friends)? \n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n        Let me clarify with the problem statement: \n\n        \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\"\n\n        This means that for one toast, each friend must have one slice. So for one toast, we need n slices.\n\n        However, the example calculation for lime: 10 limes * 8 slices = 80 slices. Then they say \"it is enough for 80 toasts\". \n\n        This implies that they are assuming that one toast only requires one slice (independent of the number of friends). \n\n        But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs a slice\", so if there are 3 friends, then one toast requires 3 slices. Then 80 slices would only support 80//3 = 26 toasts (for the entire group). \n\n        However, the example does not do that.\n\n        There is an important note: the example output is 2, and they compute:\n\n            min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n        So the example is treating the drink and salt in a way that does not account for the number of friends, and the lime is also treated as if each toast requires one slice (not n slices).\n\n        Let me compare:\n\n        For drink: total_drink / nl = 20 / 3 = 6 -> this is the total number of toasts (for the entire group) if we assume that one toast requires nl milliliters (not n*nl).\n\n        For lime: total_slices = 80, and they use 80 toasts (so one toast uses one slice).\n\n        For salt: total_salt / np = 100 / 1 = 100 toasts.\n\n        Then the limiting factor is the drink: 6 toasts for the entire group.\n\n        Then each friend can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n        But wait, if one toast requires 3 ml per friend (so 9 ml per toast), then 6 toasts require 54 ml, but we only have 20. \n\n        This indicates that the example is not consistent.\n\n        After reading the problem again: \n\n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" \n\n        This is per toast. So for one toast, the entire group requires n * nl milliliters, n * 1 slices, and n * np grams.\n\n        Then, the entire group can make T toasts if:\n\n          T * (n * nl) <= k * l\n          T * (n * 1) <= c * d\n          T * (n * np) <= p\n\n        Then T_max = min( floor(k*l / (n*nl)), floor(c*d / (n*1)), floor(p / (n*np)) )\n\n        Then the number of toasts per friend is T_max / n? Actually, no: T_max is the total number of toasts for the entire group. Then each friend makes T_max / n? But wait, T_max is the total toasts, and since each friend makes the same number, then each friend makes T_max / n toasts? \n\n        However, note: T_max is the maximum number of toasts the entire group can make. Since there are n friends, then each friend makes T_max // n toasts? \n\n        But wait, the example: \n            n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        Using the above:\n\n            Drink: T_drink = 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 -> 2 (floor division)\n            Lime: T_lime = (10*8) / (3*1) = 80/3 -> 26 (floor division)\n            Salt: T_salt = 100 / (3*1) = 100/3 -> 33 (floor division)\n\n            Then T_max = 2.\n\n            Then each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        But wait, the example output is 2, but the example explanation used a different calculation (which gave 6 toasts for the entire group and then divided by 3 to get 2 per friend). \n\n        The example explanation was incorrect? Or was there a misinterpretation?\n\n        Actually, the example explanation says:\n\n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\"\n\n        But according to the requirement, the drink per toast is 9 ml (n*nl). So 20/9 is about 2.22, so floor is 2.\n\n        Why did they do 20/3? \n\n        Let me see: if the requirement were that one toast requires nl ml (and not n*nl) then 20/3 = 6. But the problem says \"each friend needs nl\", so it should be n*nl.\n\n        However, the example output is 2, and the correct calculation (with n*nl) gives 2.\n\n        The example explanation seems to have a mistake. They wrote:\n\n            \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n        But if we use the correct requirements:\n\n            Drink: 20 / (3*3) = 2 (toasts for the entire group)\n            Lime: 80 / (3*1) = 26 (toasts for the entire group)\n            Salt: 100 / (3*1) = 33 (toasts for the entire group)\n\n            Then T_max = 2, and then each friend makes 2 (because the entire group makes 2 toasts and there are 3 friends, but wait: if the entire group makes 2 toasts, then each friend makes 2 toasts? Actually, no: each toast involves all friends. So if the entire group makes 2 toasts, then each friend has been toasted 2 times.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the problem's requirement is:\n\n            One toast requires:\n                drink: n * nl milliliters\n                lime: n * 1 slices\n                salt: n * np grams\n\n        Then the entire group can make at most:\n\n            T = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n*1), p // (n*np) )\n\n        Then the number of toasts each friend can make is T (the total toasts for the group) divided by the number of friends? \n\n        But note: T is the total toasts for the entire group. Since each toast is consumed by all friends, each friend will have T toasts.\n\n        However, wait: if the entire group makes T toasts, then each friend is part of T toasts. So each friend makes T toasts.\n\n        But that can't be: because the toasts are shared. Actually, the problem says \"each friend needs\" these for one toast. So if the entire group makes T toasts, then each friend will have T toasts (since every toast they participate in, they consume their portion).\n\n        However, the example: T=2, so each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        But wait, if the entire group makes 2 toasts, then each friend is present at 2 toasts. So yes, each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        However, let me consider: if there are 3 friends and they make 2 toasts, then we are having 2 rounds of toasting, and each round each friend drinks, so each friend drinks 2 times.\n\n        So the answer is T (the total toasts) is the same as the number of toasts per friend.\n\n        But wait, that is not the case: the total toasts is T, and the entire group consumes T * (n * nl) drink, etc. But the number of toasts each friend makes is exactly T.\n\n        However, the problem asks: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\n        So the answer is T (the total toasts for the entire group) is the same as the number of toasts each friend makes.\n\n        But wait, that doesn't sound right because if the entire group makes 2 toasts, then each friend is involved in 2 toasts, so each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        However, note: the entire group makes 2 toasts, meaning there are 2 events. Each event, all friends are present. So each friend is present at 2 events -> 2 toasts.\n\n        So the answer is T (the total toasts) is the number of toasts each friend makes.\n\n        But wait, what if the toasts are shared? Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... for one toast\", meaning that for one toast, each friend must have their own portion. So the entire group cannot have more than T toasts because then the drink runs out (if T is limited by drink). \n\n        However, note: we are calculating T as the minimum of the three resources divided by the requirement per toast (which includes n portions). \n\n        Then the answer is T.\n\n        But wait, let's check the example: \n\n            Input: ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', ...]\n\n            Our calculation: T = min( (4*5)//(3*3), (10*8)//(3*1), 100//(3*1) ) \n                            = min(20//9, 80//3, 100//3) \n                            = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n            Output: 2.\n\n        Now the second example:\n\n            Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n            Drink: (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n            Lime: (1*19) // (5*1) = 19 //5 = 3\n            Salt: 90 // (5*3) = 90//15 = 6\n\n            T = min(50, 3, 6) = 3\n\n            Output: 3.\n\n        Third example:\n\n            Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n            Drink: (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n            Lime: (25*23) // (10*1) = 575 //10 = 57\n            Salt: 1 // (10*1) = 1//10 = 0\n\n            T = 0\n\n            Output: 0.\n\n        But wait, the example outputs are:\n\n            ['2', '3', '0']\n\n        However, in the second example, the expected output is 3.\n\n        But note: the example input string is: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\", and the output is 3.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            Read the input line and split into 8 integers.\n\n            Let n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            total_slices = c * d\n            total_salt = p\n\n            # Requirement per toast for the entire group:\n            drink_per_toast = n * nl\n            lime_per_toast = n * 1   # because each friend needs one slice, so n slices per toast\n            salt_per_toast = n * np\n\n            # Maximum toasts the entire group can make (T) is limited by each resource:\n            T_drink = total_drink // drink_per_toast\n            T_lime = total_slices // lime_per_toast\n            T_salt = total_salt // salt_per_toast\n\n            T = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n\n            Print(T)\n\n        However, wait: the example explanation used a different method (dividing the total resource by the requirement per friend, not per toast) and then dividing by the number of friends. But our calculation matches the sample outputs.\n\n        But wait, the first example: \n            Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 -> output 2.\n\n        However, the example explanation said: \n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\n        They were not consistent: they used the requirement for one toast as nl (which is 3) for drink, and for lime they used 1 slice per toast (so 80 toasts from 80 slices) and for salt 1 gram per toast (so 100 toasts from 100 grams). Then they took the minimum (6) and divided by 3.\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n\n            T_drink_entire_group = total_drink // nl   [without multiplying by n] -> 20//3=6\n            T_lime_entire_group = total_slices // 1     -> 80\n            T_salt_entire_group = p // np               -> 100//1=100\n\n            Then T = min(6,80,100) // n = 6//3 = 2.\n\n        Why is this method giving the same result? \n\n        Because in the problem, the requirement per toast is actually defined per friend, but then when we calculate the total toasts for the entire group, we must account for the fact that the same toast is used by all friends. \n\n        However, the requirement for one toast is n * nl (for drink) but the example explanation did: total_drink // nl. \n\n        This is incorrect if we use the requirement as stated. But note: \n\n            In the example, if we consider that the entire group's drink consumption for one toast is n * nl, then the maximum number of toasts (for the entire group) is floor(total_drink / (n*nl)).\n\n        However, the example explanation did:\n\n            They computed the maximum number of toasts for the entire group as floor(total_drink / nl) and then divided by n.\n\n        Why are these two methods equivalent?\n\n            Method1 (correct): \n                T = min(floor(total_drink / (n*nl)), floor(total_slices / (n*1)), floor(p / (n*np)))\n\n            Method2 (incorrect according to requirement but produces same result in example):\n                T1 = floor(total_drink / nl)\n                T2 = floor(total_slices / 1)\n                T3 = floor(p / np)\n                Then T = min(T1, T2, T3) // n\n\n        Let me test with the example:\n\n            Method1: \n                Drink: 20/(3*3)=20/9=2.22 -> 2\n                Lime: 80/(3*1)=80/3=26.66 -> 26\n                Salt: 100/(3*1)=100/3=33.33 -> 33\n                T = 2\n\n            Method2:\n                T1 = 20/3 = 6.66 -> 6\n                T2 = 80\n                T3 = 100\n                T = min(6,80,100) = 6, then 6//3=2.\n\n        They are the same.\n\n        Why?\n\n        Notice:\n\n            In Method1, the drink per toast is n*nl, so the entire group can have T toasts if T*(n*nl) <= total_drink.\n\n            In Method2, they are calculating the maximum number of toasts if we consider that the drink is used at a rate of nl per friend per toast, but then they divide by n to get the number of toasts per friend? \n\n        Actually, in Method2, they are effectively calculating the total amount of drink available per friend: total_drink / n, and then dividing by nl (the drink per toast per friend). \n\n        But wait, the drink is shared. The drink is total_drink, and there are n friends. But the requirement is per friend: nl per toast. Then the entire group's drink requirement for T toasts is T * n * nl.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the entire drink is available, and each friend can have at most total_drink / n ml. Then the number of toasts a friend can make is (total_drink / n) // nl.\n\n        Then for each friend, the drink limits them to (total_drink // n) // nl.\n\n        Similarly, for lime: each friend requires 1 slice per toast, and there are total_slices slices. But note: the slices are shared? Actually, the problem says the entire group must have the same number of toasts. \n\n        The lime requirement: each toast requires 1 slice per friend. So the total slices needed for T toasts is T * n. But also, we can think: each friend can use at most total_slices / n slices, and then the number of toasts per friend is (total_slices // n) // 1.\n\n        And for salt: each friend requires np grams per toast, so the total salt needed for T toasts is T * n * np. But per friend: the salt limit is p / n, and then the number of toasts per friend is (p // n) // np.\n\n        Then the answer for each friend is:\n\n            T_friend = min( (k*l) // (n * nl), (c*d) // (n * 1), p // (n * np) )\n\n        But wait, that's the same as the entire group's T (the total toasts) because:\n\n            In the entire group: T_total = T_friend * n? Not necessarily, because the limiting factor might be different.\n\n        Actually, the two methods are different:\n\n            Method1: \n                T_total = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n*np) )\n                Then each friend makes T_total toasts.\n\n            Method2 (per friend resource allocation):\n\n                T_friend_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)   [same as the entire group's drink constraint divided by n? No]\n\n        Let me explain:\n\n            In Method1, we calculate the entire group's total toasts T_total, and then each friend makes T_total toasts.\n\n            In Method2 (per friend):\n\n                The drink available per friend is (k*l) / n, and each toast requires nl, so the number of toasts per friend from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl) [which is the same as the entire group's T_total from drink].\n\n            So both methods are actually the same.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            T_total = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n*np) )\n\n            Print(T_total)\n\n        However, wait: in the lime calculation, the requirement per toast is n slices, so the entire group requires n slices per toast. But if we calculate per friend:\n\n            Each friend requires 1 slice per toast, and there are c*d slices. Then the entire group's total slices needed for T toasts is T * n. But also, we can think: the total slices is c*d, and each friend can use up to c*d / n slices, and then the number of toasts per friend is (c*d) // (n * 1) [same as above].\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n            drink_needed = n * nl\n            lime_needed = n * 1\n            salt_needed = n * np\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            total_lime = c * d\n            total_salt = p\n\n            T_drink = total_drink // drink_needed\n            T_lime = total_lime // lime_needed\n            T_salt = total_salt // salt_needed\n\n            T = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n            print(T)\n\n        But wait, the example explanation did:\n\n            They calculated: \n                drink: 20 / 3 = 6 (then divided by 3 -> 2)\n                lime: 80 / 1 = 80 (then divided by 3 -> 26.66 -> but they didn't do that, they took the minimum of 6,80,100 and then divided by 3)\n\n        Our method: \n            drink: 20 // (3*3) = 2\n            lime: 80 // (3*1) = 26\n            salt: 100 // (3*1) = 33\n            min(2,26,33)=2\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the entire group's drink requirement for one toast is n*nl, so we must use that.\n\n        But the example explanation used a different approach (which coincidentally produced the same result) but was not based on the requirement. \n\n        We'll use the requirement-based calculation.\n\n        But wait, the problem statement says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so we must use n*nl for the entire group.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Read the 8 integers.\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = ...\n            drink_required_per_toast = n * nl\n            lime_required_per_toast = n * 1   # because each friend needs one slice, so n slices\n            salt_required_per_toast = n * np\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            total_lime = c * d\n            total_salt = p\n\n            T_drink = total_drink // drink_required_per_toast\n            T_lime = total_lime // lime_required_per_toast\n            T_salt = total_salt // salt_required_per_toast\n\n            T = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n            print(T)\n\n        However, note: the example input order is: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example1: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n            n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n            drink_required_per_toast = 3*3 = 9\n            total_drink = 20 -> 20//9 = 2\n            lime_required_per_toast = 3\n            total_lime = 10*8=80 -> 80//3 = 26\n            salt_required_per_toast = 3\n            total_salt = 100 -> 100//3 = 33\n            T = 2 -> output 2.\n\n        Example2: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n            drink_required_per_toast = 5*4=20\n            total_drink = 1000 -> 1000//20=50\n            lime_required_per_toast = 5\n            total_lime = 1*19=19 -> 19//5=3\n            salt_required_per_toast = 5*3=15\n            total_salt = 90 -> 90//15=6\n            T = min(50,3,6)=3 -> output 3.\n\n        Example3: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n            drink_required_per_toast = 10*50=500\n            total_drink=1000000 -> 1000000//500=2000\n            lime_required_per_toast=10\n            total_lime=25*23=575 -> 575//10=57\n            salt_required_per_toast=10*1=10\n            total_salt=1 -> 1//10=0\n            T=0 -> output ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, based on the requirements per toast for the entire group.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made by a group of friends, considering constraints on drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of each resource per friend. The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total available resources (drink, lime slices, salt).\n   - Determining the resources required per toast for the entire group (since each friend needs their share).\n   - Finding the maximum number of toasts possible by the most constrained resource.\n   - Outputting the result, which is the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on identifying the bottleneck resource. For example, if the drink is insufficient to support a certain number of toasts when considering all friends, then that becomes the limiting factor, regardless of the availability of lime slices or salt.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves straightforward arithmetic operations:\n   - Compute the total available resources.\n   - Calculate the resources needed per toast for the entire group.\n   - Determine the maximum number of toasts possible by each resource constraint using integer division.\n   - The answer is the minimum value among these three calculations, representing the limiting factor.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1), suitable for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    drink_required = n * nl\n    lime_required = n * 1\n    salt_required = n * np\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    T_drink = total_drink // drink_required\n    T_lime = total_lime // lime_required\n    T_salt = total_salt // salt_required\n    \n    T = min(T_drink, T_lime, T_salt)\n    print(T)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Resource Calculation**: \n   - **Drink Requirement**: Multiply the number of friends by the milliliters per toast per friend to get the total drink needed per toast for the entire group.\n   - **Lime Requirement**: Multiply the number of friends by one slice per toast per friend.\n   - **Salt Requirement**: Multiply the number of friends by the grams of salt per toast per friend.\n3. **Total Resources**: Calculate the total available drink, lime slices, and salt.\n4. **Maximum Toasts Calculation**: For each resource, compute how many toasts the total quantity can support using integer division. The smallest value among these is the maximum number of toasts the group can make.\n5. **Output**: Print the result, which is the number of toasts each friend can make (equivalent to the total toasts since all friends participate in each toast).\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by focusing on the limiting resource, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
