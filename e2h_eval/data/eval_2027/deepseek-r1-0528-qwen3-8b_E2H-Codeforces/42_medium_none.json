Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of files n and a list of file sizes.\n We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) such that there exists a moment during the copying process where both progress bars show the same integer.\n\n The first progress bar (current file) at byte x of file i: floor(100 * x / a_i)\n The second progress bar (overall) after copying x bytes of the current file (and all previous files completely): \n     total_so_far = (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{i-1} + x)\n     overall_progress = floor(100 * total_so_far / total)\n\n However, note that the second progress bar uses the entire sum (a1+...+an). Let total = sum(a_i for i=1..n)\n\n Important: The copying is sequential. We are updating after each byte.\n\n Observation:\n We have to consider the copying process step by step. However, the total number of bytes is at most 100*1000 = 100000 (since n<=100 and each a_i<=1000) but we cannot iterate over every byte (that would be too slow).\n\n Instead, we can consider the following:\n\n For a fixed integer k (from 0 to 100), we want to know if there exists an index i (file index) and a byte x (0 <= x <= a_i) such that:\n\n Condition 1: floor(100*x / a_i) = k   =>   k <= (100*x)/a_i < k+1   =>   (k * a_i) / 100 <= x < ((k+1)*a_i)/100\n\n But note: x must be an integer. Therefore, x must be in the interval [ceil(k*a_i/100), floor(((k+1)*a_i - 1)/100)]? Actually, let's re-express:\n\n Actually, the condition for the first progress bar is:\n   k <= (100*x)/a_i < k+1\n   => x >= ceil(k * a_i / 100) ? Not exactly: because k is an integer and the floor function.\n\n Actually, the condition is:\n   k <= (100*x)/a_i < k+1\n   => (k * a_i) <= 100*x < (k+1)*a_i\n\n So x must satisfy: ceil((k * a_i) / 100) <= x <= floor(((k+1)*a_i - 1) / 100) ? \n\n But note: we require the floor of (100*x)/a_i to be k. This happens if:\n   (k * a_i) <= 100*x < (k+1)*a_i\n\n However, since x is an integer, we can write:\n   x_min = ceil((k * a_i) / 100)   [but wait: if (k * a_i) is divisible by 100 then x_min = (k * a_i)//100, but actually we need x such that 100*x >= k*a_i and 100*x < (k+1)*a_i]\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   x_min = (k * a_i + 99) // 100   [because we want the smallest integer x such that 100*x >= k*a_i]?\n   But note: if (k*a_i) % 100 == 0, then x_min = k*a_i//100, otherwise we round up.\n\n However, the condition is: x must be at least (k * a_i + 99) // 100? Actually, we can set:\n   lower_bound = ceil(k * a_i / 100)   -> which is (k * a_i + 99) // 100 (if we use integer division rounding up)\n\n But wait: let me check: \n   If k * a_i = 150, then 150/100 = 1.5 -> ceil(1.5)=2, and (150+99)//100 = 249//100 = 2 -> correct.\n   If k * a_i = 200, then 200/100=2 -> ceil(2)=2, (200+99)//100=299//100=2 -> correct.\n\n Similarly, the upper bound for x is the maximum integer x such that 100*x < (k+1)*a_i, i.e., x < (k+1)*a_i/100, so x_max = floor(((k+1)*a_i - 1) / 100) ?\n\n Actually, we require 100*x < (k+1)*a_i  => x < (k+1)*a_i / 100, so the largest integer x is floor((k+1)*a_i/100 - epsilon) = floor(((k+1)*a_i - 1)/100) is not standard.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   x must be in [ceil((k * a_i) / 100), floor(((k+1)*a_i - 1)/100)]? \n\n But note: if (k+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then the condition 100*x < (k+1)*a_i requires x <= (k+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n Actually, the condition is: 100*x < (k+1)*a_i  => x <= (k+1)*a_i//100 - 1 if (k+1)*a_i % 100 == 0? Not exactly: because if (k+1)*a_i = 200, then x can be 1 (then 100*1=100 < 200) but also x=1 is less than 200/100=2. So the condition is x < (k+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum integer x is floor((k+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) or more simply: floor((k+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) is not needed. \n\n Actually, we can use: x must be at most floor((k+1)*a_i - 1) // 100? \n\n But note: the condition is 100*x < (k+1)*a_i, so x < (k+1)*a_i/100. Since x is integer, x <= floor((k+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9). However, we can also compute:\n\n   x_max = floor(( (k+1) * a_i - 1 ) / 100)   [this gives the largest integer x such that 100*x <= (k+1)*a_i - 1, which is equivalent to 100*x < (k+1)*a_i]\n\n However, note: if (k+1)*a_i is not an integer multiple of 100, then floor((k+1)*a_i/100) is the same as floor(((k+1)*a_i - 1)/100) only if (k+1)*a_i is not an integer multiple? Actually, no: consider (k+1)*a_i = 201, then (k+1)*a_i/100 = 2.01, floor(2.01)=2, and ((k+1)*a_i-1)=200, floor(200/100)=2 -> same. But if (k+1)*a_i=200, then (k+1)*a_i/100=2, floor(2)=2, and ((k+1)*a_i-1)=199, floor(199/100)=1 -> different.\n\n So we have two conditions for the current file i and k:\n\n   Condition 1: x must be in [L, R] where L = ceil(k * a_i / 100) and R = floor(((k+1)*a_i - 1) / 100)   [This R is the maximum x such that 100*x < (k+1)*a_i]\n\n However, note: the condition for the current file is independent, but then we have the overall progress bar:\n\n Condition 2: At the same moment, the overall progress bar shows k. The overall progress bar is computed as:\n\n   total_bytes = (sum of all previous files) + x\n   floor(100 * total_bytes / total) = k\n\n   => k <= (100 * total_bytes) / total < k+1\n   => (k * total) <= 100 * total_bytes < (k+1)*total\n\n   But note: total_bytes is the sum of the first i-1 files (which we denote as S) plus x (so S+x). And total is the entire sum (S + remaining bytes of the current file and all subsequent files? No, total is the entire sum of all n files, which is fixed: T = a1+a2+...+an.\n\n   So: total_bytes = S + x, where S = a1+a2+...+a_{i-1}\n\n   Then: (k * T) <= 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T\n\n   => x >= ceil((k*T - 100*S) / 100)   [but note: we have to ensure that the entire expression is nonnegative and we are bounded by the current file's size]\n\n However, note: x is already constrained by the current file (from 0 to a_i). Also, note that the overall progress bar updates only when we are in the middle of a file? Actually, the problem says: after each byte. So the overall progress bar is updated with the cumulative sum.\n\n But here's the catch: the overall progress bar at the moment of being in file i and having copied x bytes is:\n\n   total_bytes = (a1+a2+...+a_{i-1}) + x\n\n So the condition for the overall progress bar is:\n\n   k*T <= 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T\n\n   => x >= ceil((k*T - 100*S) / 100)   [if (k*T - 100*S) is negative, then x>=0 is automatically satisfied?] but note: we require nonnegative.\n\n However, note: k*T might be less than 100*S? Then the condition becomes x >= ceil((k*T - 100*S)/100) which is negative, so we take x>=0. But we must also consider the upper bound: x < ((k+1)*T - 100*S) / 100.\n\n But note: the overall progress bar condition must hold at the same time as the current file condition.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all files and all k from 0 to 100 independently because the same k might appear in multiple files and we have to account for the cumulative sum.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can simulate the entire process by iterating over files and within each file, we can consider the two conditions. However, the total number of bytes is too high.\n\n Insight:\n\n The overall progress bar only changes at the boundaries of each file and at the end of each file. Moreover, the current file progress bar changes every byte.\n\n But note: the problem asks for any moment. We are to find all k from 0 to 100 that appear at the same time on both bars.\n\n We can try:\n\n For each file i (from 0 to n-1) and for each k from 0 to 100, we can check if there exists an x (integer between 0 and a_i) such that:\n\n   Condition 1: k <= (100*x)/a_i < k+1\n   Condition 2: k <= (100*(S+x))/T < k+1, where S = total of first i files (excluding the current one? Actually, S = total of first i-1 files) and T = total of all n files.\n\n However, note: the overall progress bar at the moment of being in file i and having copied x bytes uses the entire total T (all files). So the condition is:\n\n   k*T <= 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T\n\n   => x must be in [max(0, ceil((k*T - 100*S)/100)), floor(((k+1)*T - 100*S - 1) / 100)]   [But note: the condition for the overall progress bar is: 100*(S+x) >= k*T and 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T]\n\n   => x_min_overall = max(0, ceil((k*T - 100*S)/100))   [if (k*T - 100*S) is negative, then we use 0]\n        x_max_overall = floor(((k+1)*T - 1 - 100*S) / 100)   [because 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T  => x < (k+1)*T/100 - S/100, and since S is fixed, we can rearrange? Actually, we can write: x <= floor(( (k+1)*T - 1 - 100*S ) / 100) ]\n\n But wait, we can also express the overall condition as:\n\n   x must be >= ceil((k*T - 100*S)/100) and < (k+1)*T/100 - S/100, but then we take the integer part.\n\n However, note: the overall condition does not depend on the current file's size a_i, only on S (the sum of the previous files) and T (the total). But the current file condition depends on a_i.\n\n Therefore, for a fixed file i and k, the x must satisfy:\n\n   Condition 1: x in [L1, R1] where L1 = ceil(k * a_i / 100), R1 = floor(((k+1)*a_i - 1)/100)\n   Condition 2: x in [L2, R2] where L2 = ceil((k*T - 100*S)/100) (if negative, then 0), and R2 = floor(((k+1)*T - 1 - 100*S) / 100) [but note: the condition for overall is strict: 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T, so x < ( (k+1)*T - 100*S ) / 100, so x <= floor(( (k+1)*T - 100*S - 1 ) / 100) ].\n\n Then, if the intervals [L1, R1] and [L2, R2] have a non-empty intersection, and that intersection is within [0, a_i], then k is achieved.\n\n However, note: the overall condition's lower bound: if (k*T - 100*S) is negative, then the condition is automatically satisfied for x>=0. So we can set L2 = max(0, ceil((k*T - 100*S)/100)).\n\n But note: the ceil function for negative numbers: in Python, we can use math.ceil, but if the value is negative, then we are taking the ceiling (which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number). However, if k*T - 100*S is negative, then (k*T - 100*S)/100 is negative, and ceil(negative) is the next integer towards zero? Actually, ceil(-0.5) is 0, but we want x>=0, so we take 0.\n\n Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   L2 = max(0, (k * T + 99) // 100 - (S * 100 // 100) ???)   -> wait, this is messy.\n\n Actually, let me rework the overall condition:\n\n   Condition 2: k*T <= 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T\n\n   => 100*(S+x) >= k*T   => x >= ceil((k*T - 100*S) / 100)   but if (k*T - 100*S) is negative, then we take 0.\n\n   We can define:\n        low_bound = (k * T - 100 * S + 99) // 100   [this is rounding up? Actually, (A+B-1)//B is ceiling of A/B for positive A,B?]\n\n   But wait: (k*T - 100*S) might be negative. We want the smallest integer x such that 100*(S+x) >= k*T.\n\n   If k*T <= 100*S, then even x=0 satisfies, so L2=0.\n\n   Otherwise, we need x >= ceil((k*T - 100*S)/100).\n\n   How to compute ceil(a/b) for positive b? But here, if k*T - 100*S is negative, then we don't use it. So:\n\n        if k*T <= 100*S:\n            L2 = 0\n        else:\n            # We need the smallest integer x such that 100*(S+x) >= k*T\n            # => x >= ceil((k*T - 100*S)/100)\n            # How to compute ceil without floating point?\n            # ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   for positive a and b? But here a = k*T - 100*S (positive) and b=100.\n\n            L2 = (k*T - 100*S + 99) // 100\n\n   Similarly, the upper bound for the overall condition is:\n\n        x < (k+1)*T/100 - S/100   => x <= floor((k+1)*T/100 - S/100 - 1e-9)   [but we can use integer arithmetic]\n\n   Actually, we require 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T   => x < ( (k+1)*T - 100*S ) / 100.\n\n   The largest integer x is floor(( (k+1)*T - 100*S - 1) / 100)   [because if ( (k+1)*T - 100*S ) is divisible by 100, then x must be strictly less than that quotient, so we subtract 1].\n\n   But note: we can also use:\n\n        R2 = ((k+1)*T - 100*S - 1) // 100   [but then if (k+1)*T - 100*S - 1 is negative, then R2 would be negative, but that is okay because then the condition fails?]\n\n   However, note: the overall condition must hold and we are in the middle of file i, so x must be at least 0 and at most a_i.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Precompute T = total = sum(a)\n   Precompute prefix sums: S0 = 0, S1 = a0, S2 = a0+a1, ... Sn = T.\n\n   For each file i (0-indexed), let S = prefix_sum[i] = a0+a1+...+a_{i-1} (if i==0 then S=0)\n\n   For k from 0 to 100:\n\n        Condition 1 (current file i):\n            L1 = ceil(k * a_i / 100)   [if k==0, then L1=0? yes, because 0<=0*anything<1 -> x>=0]\n            But note: if k=0, then 0 <= (100*x)/a_i < 1 => x < a_i/100, so x in [0, floor((a_i-1)/100)].\n\n            We can compute L1 = (k * a_i + 99) // 100   [because ceil(x) = (x + 99) // 100 for positive x?] but wait, what if k*a_i is negative? k>=0, a_i>=1, so k*a_i>=0.\n\n            Similarly, R1 = ( (k+1)*a_i - 1 ) // 100   [because x must be < (k+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum integer x is floor((k+1)*a_i - 1)/100)]\n\n        Condition 2 (overall progress):\n            If k*T <= 100*S + 100*a_i? Actually, we have two parts: the overall condition is defined by the entire cumulative sum.\n\n            But note: the overall condition uses the cumulative sum including the current file's x. So:\n\n            We require: 100*(S+x) >= k*T   and 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T.\n\n            The minimal x for condition 2: \n                if k*T <= 100*S: then L2 = 0\n                else: L2 = (k*T - 100*S + 99) // 100   [ceiling of (k*T-100*S)/100]\n\n            The maximal x for condition 2:\n                We require 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T  => x < ( (k+1)*T - 100*S ) / 100\n                So the maximum integer x is floor(( (k+1)*T - 100*S - 1) / 100)   [because if ( (k+1)*T - 100*S ) is divisible by 100, then x must be at most ( (k+1)*T - 100*S )/100 - 1]\n\n                R2 = ((k+1)*T - 100*S - 1) // 100\n\n            However, note: if (k+1)*T - 100*S - 1 is negative, then R2 will be negative, meaning the condition fails for the upper bound.\n\n        Now, we require that x is in [max(L1, L2), min(R1, R2)] and also 0<=x<=a_i.\n\n        If the interval [max(L1, L2), min(R1, R2)] is non-empty and overlaps with [0, a_i], then k is achievable.\n\n   But note: the current file condition also requires x to be at most a_i, so we must have x in [0, a_i]. Therefore, we can set:\n\n        low = max(L1, L2, 0)\n        high = min(R1, R2, a_i)\n\n        Then if low <= high, then there exists an x.\n\n   However, note: our L1 and R1 are computed from the current file, and they are in the range [0, a_i] (because x from 0 to a_i). But L2 and R2 might be outside [0, a_i] as well.\n\n   But note: the overall condition's x must be in [0, a_i] as well because we haven't finished the file? Actually, no: the overall condition is independent of the current file's size, but the x we use must be in [0, a_i]. So we must clamp x to [0, a_i].\n\n   However, in the above, we are clamping the interval to [0, a_i] by setting high = min(..., a_i). But note: the overall condition's R2 might be larger than a_i, then we clamp to a_i. Similarly, the current file condition's R1 is at most a_i (because (k+1)*a_i/100 might be > a_i? Actually, no: because k from 0 to 100, and a_i>=1, then (k+1)*a_i/100 can be as large as 101*a_i/100, which is > a_i, but then we are clamping by a_i.\n\n   But wait: the current file condition: x must be <= a_i. So we must ensure that the x we choose is at most a_i.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n        T = total\n        prefix[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1} for i from 0 to n (with prefix[0]=0, prefix[i] for the i-th file (0-indexed) is the sum of the first i files, so the current file is the i-th, then S = prefix[i])\n\n        For i in range(n):\n            S = prefix[i]   (sum of files 0 to i-1)\n            a = a_i = arr[i]\n            For k from 0 to 100:\n\n                # Current file condition:\n                if k == 100:\n                    # Then we require 100*x/a_i >= 100 -> x >= a_i, and the next k+1=101 is not allowed, so condition is x = a_i (because floor(100*x/a_i)=100, then 100<= (100*x/a_i) <101 -> x must be exactly a_i? Actually, if x=a_i, then (100*x)/a_i=100, which is floor(100) so 100. But then 100*x/a_i=100, which is 100.0 -> floor(100.0)=100. So k=100 is included for x=a_i.\n                    L1 = a_i   # because (100*a_i)/a_i = 100 -> so x must be at least a_i? Actually, the condition is: 100 <= (100*x)/a_i < 101 -> x must be >= a_i and < (101*a_i)/100. But x cannot exceed a_i (because we are copying the current file). So x must be a_i.\n\n                    R1 = a_i   # because x must be at most a_i, and the condition for the upper bound is x < (101*a_i)/100, which is always true for x<=a_i (since 101*a_i/100 > a_i). But then the condition is satisfied for x=a_i.\n\n                However, we can use the general formula for L1 and R1 for k from 0 to 99, and then handle k=100 separately? Or we can use:\n\n                    L1 = (k * a + 99) // 100\n                    R1 = ( (k+1) * a - 1) // 100\n\n                But for k=100, then L1 = (100*a + 99)//100 = (100*a + 99)//100 = a + (99)//100 -> which is a (since 99//100=0). But then R1 = (101*a - 1)//100. For a=1, that would be (101-1)//100=100//100=1. So for a=1, k=100: [a, (101*a-1)//100] = [1,1] -> correct.\n\n                However, note: the condition for k=100 is that x must be at least a (because (100*x)/a>=100) and x<=a. So x=a. The above R1 for k=100 is (101*a-1)//100, which for a=1 is 1, but for a=2: (202-1)//100=201//100=2, so that's okay.\n\n                But wait: the condition for the current file for k=100 is: 100 <= (100*x)/a < 101. Then x must be at least a (because 100*x>=100*a -> x>=a). And the upper bound: 100*x < 101*a -> x < 101*a/100. So x can be from a to floor((101*a-1)/100). But note: x cannot exceed a (the file size). Therefore, we must have x=a and then (100*a)/a =100, which is okay. But if a=100, then x must be 100, and (100*100)/100=100, which is okay. If a=101, then x must be 100 (because 100*100/101 < 100? wait, no: 100*x must be at least 100*101=10100. Then x>=101. But wait, the file size is 101, so x can be at most 101. Then 100*101/101=100, which is 100. So k=100 is achieved at x=101. But wait, the condition for k=100 is: floor(100*x/a)=100. For x=101 and a=101: floor(100*101/101)=floor(100)=100. But the condition for the upper bound: 100*x < 101*a -> 100*101 < 101*101 -> 10100 < 10201 -> true. So x=101 is allowed. But note: the file has 101 bytes, so x can be 101.\n\n                However, the above formula for R1 for k=100: (101*a-1)//100. For a=101: (101*101-1)//100 = (10201-1)//100 = 10200//100=102. Then the interval for the current file condition is [100,102] (for a=101). But x cannot exceed a (101). So the valid x is from 100 to 101. Then we must check the overall condition for x=100 and x=101.\n\n                But wait: the condition for the current file: k=100 requires x>=100 and x<101*101/100 -> x<102.01, so x from 100 to 102 (but we only have up to 101). So the condition is satisfied for x=100 and x=101.\n\n                However, note: if x=100, then (100*x)/a = 100*100/101 ≈ 99.0099 -> floor(99.0099)=99, so k=99, not 100. Therefore, the condition for k=100 is not satisfied for x=100. It is only satisfied for x=101.\n\n                So our current file condition for k=100 is: \n                    L1 = (100*a + 99) // 100 = (100*a + 99) // 100\n                    For a=101: (100*101+99)//100 = (10100+99)//100 = 10199//100 = 101 (because 10199 = 101*100 + 99 -> 10199//100=101). \n                    R1 = (101*a - 1) // 100 = (101*101-1)//100 = (10201-1)//100=10200//100=102.\n\n                Then the condition for the current file is x in [101,102] (intersected with [0,101] -> [101,101]). So x=101.\n\n                Then we must check the overall condition for x=101.\n\n                So the general formulas for L1 and R1 for k from 0 to 100 are:\n\n                    L1 = (k * a + 99) // 100\n                    R1 = ( (k+1) * a - 1 ) // 100\n\n                And note: the current file condition requires x to be in [L1, R1] and also x<=a_i (the file size) and x>=0.\n\n        Then, for the overall condition:\n\n            Condition 2: \n                if k*T <= 100*S + 100*a:   [But wait, we are going to use the entire cumulative sum including the current file's x. The condition is: 100*(S+x) >= k*T and 100*(S+x) < (k+1)*T.\n\n            We compute:\n\n                L2 = 0\n                if k*T > 100*S:\n                    L2 = (k*T - 100*S + 99) // 100   # ceiling of (k*T-100*S)/100\n\n                R2 = ( (k+1)*T - 100*S - 1 ) // 100   # floor(( (k+1)*T - 100*S - 1)/100)\n\n            Then, the x must be at least max(L1, L2, 0) and at most min(R1, R2, a_i).\n\n            And if max(L1, L2, 0) <= min(R1, R2, a_i), then k is achieved.\n\n   But note: the overall condition's upper bound must be at least the current file condition's lower bound? And the overall condition's lower bound must not exceed the current file condition's upper bound.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the overall condition's R2 might be negative, then we skip.\n\n   Example: n=1, a=[6] (first example). Then T=6, S=0 for the first (and only) file.\n\n   k=0: \n        Current file: L1 = (0*6+99)//100 = 0, R1 = (1*6-1)//100 = 5//100=0.\n        Overall: k*T=0, so L2=0; R2 = (1*6-1-0)//100 = (5)//100=0.\n        Then x must be in [0,0] and [0,0] -> x=0 -> k=0 is achieved.\n\n   k=16 (example output for the first test case includes 16, but wait the first test case is ['1\\n6'] and the output is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'. So let's check k=16 for the first test case (one file of size 6):\n\n        Condition 1: \n            L1 = (16*6+99)//100 = (96+99)//100 = 195//100 = 1\n            R1 = (17*6-1)//100 = (102-1)//100=101//100=1\n            So x=1.\n\n        Condition 2:\n            T=6, S=0, k=16: \n            k*T = 16*6=96, 100*S=0 -> condition: 96<=100*(0+x) < 17*6=102 -> 96<=100*x<102 -> x>= ceil(",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive such that at some point during the copying process, both the current file's progress bar and the overall progress bar display the same integer. The progress bars are updated after each byte is copied, and their values are floor percentages of the copied data.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the copying process of multiple files sequentially. For each file, we track the progress within that file (first progress bar) and the cumulative progress across all files (second progress bar). The challenge is to find all integers k (0 ≤ k ≤ 100) where there exists a byte x in some file such that both progress bars show k simultaneously.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each file and each possible k (0 to 100), we can compute the range of bytes x in the current file that would make the first progress bar show k. Similarly, we compute the range of bytes x (considering the cumulative sum up to the current file) that would make the second progress bar show k. The intersection of these two ranges must be non-empty for k to be valid.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Prefix Sums**: Precompute the cumulative sum of file sizes up to each file to efficiently calculate the total bytes copied so far.\n   - **Range Calculation**: For each file and each k, calculate the valid byte ranges for both progress bars. The intersection of these ranges must include at least one valid byte x (0 ≤ x ≤ current file size).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each file once and checks each k (0 to 100) for each file. With n files (n ≤ 100) and k up to 100, the complexity is O(n * 101), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(a_list)\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + a_list[i - 1]\n    \n    results = set()\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        S = prefix[i]\n        a = a_list[i]\n        for k in range(101):\n            if k == 0:\n                L1 = 0\n                R1 = (a - 1) // 100\n            else:\n                L1 = (k * a + 99) // 100\n                R1 = ((k + 1) * a - 1) // 100\n            \n            if k * total <= 100 * S:\n                L2 = 0\n            else:\n                L2 = (k * total - 100 * S + 99) // 100\n            \n            R2 = ((k + 1) * total - 100 * S - 1) // 100\n            \n            low_bound = max(L1, L2, 0)\n            high_bound = min(R1, R2, a)\n            \n            if low_bound <= high_bound:\n                results.add(k)\n    \n    for k in sorted(results):\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix array stores cumulative sums of file sizes to facilitate quick calculation of total bytes copied up to any point.\n3. **Progress Bar Simulation**: For each file and each possible k (0 to 100):\n   - **First Progress Bar (Current File)**: Calculate the range of bytes x in the current file that would result in the first progress bar showing k.\n   - **Second Progress Bar (Overall Progress)**: Calculate the range of bytes x (considering cumulative bytes) that would result in the second progress bar showing k.\n4. **Intersection Check**: The valid byte ranges for both progress bars must overlap.
