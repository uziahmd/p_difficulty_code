A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total amount of drink available: k * l milliliters.\n    - Each toast requires nl milliliters per friend? Actually, note: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n      But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n    However, note that the group has n friends and they are making toasts such that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n    The total drink required for T toasts (by all friends) is: T * n * nl   [because each toast uses nl ml for each friend?]\n\n    But wait, let's re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So one toast requires nl * n milliliters in total?\n    Actually, no: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", meaning for one toast each friend must have nl ml. Therefore, for one toast, the entire group uses n * nl ml.\n\n    Similarly, for the salt: one toast requires np grams in total (because each friend doesn't require multiple salt? Actually, the problem says \"each friend needs ... salt\", but then the requirement is given as np grams. However, the example: \n        Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n        Here, nl = 3, np = 1.\n\n    Let me parse the example:\n\n    They have 4 bottles of 5 ml -> 20 ml total.\n    Each toast requires 3 ml per friend -> so for one toast, the drink needed is 3 * 3 = 9 ml? But wait, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". \n\n    Why divide by 3? Because the example says: 20 / 3 = 6.66... -> floor to 6? But wait, the example then says: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n    Actually, the example breaks down the resources as:\n\n    Drink: 20 ml -> each toast requires 3 ml per friend? But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So for one toast, the drink needed is 3 ml * 3 friends = 9 ml? Then 20 / 9 = 2.22 -> 2 toasts? \n\n    However, the example calculation was 20 / 3 = 6. This implies that the drink requirement per toast is only nl (which is 3) in total, not multiplied by the number of friends? \n\n    Let me clarify from the problem statement: \n        \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n    This means that for one toast, we need:\n        - For each friend: nl ml of drink, one lime slice, and np grams of salt? \n    But wait, that would mean the salt requirement: if each friend needs np grams, then for one toast we need n * np grams of salt.\n\n    However, the example input: nl=3, np=1. Then for one toast, drink required: 3 ml * 3 friends = 9 ml, lime slices: 3 (one per friend), and salt: 1 gram * 3 friends = 3 grams.\n\n    But the example does:\n\n        Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 = 6 (if we consider 3 ml per toast, but wait 3 is nl, and nl is per friend). \n\n    There seems to be a confusion. Let me check the example output: 2 toasts per friend.\n\n    Alternatively, the problem might mean that the entire group makes T toasts, and each toast requires:\n        - Drink: T * nl * n   (because each toast requires each friend to have nl ml, so total drink per toast is n * nl)\n        - Lime slices: T * n   (each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast)\n        - Salt: T * np * n    ? But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs np grams of salt\", so per toast, each friend gets np grams? Then per toast, the salt needed is n * np.\n\n    However, the example says: \n        \"The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\"\n\n    How did they get 80? \n        They have c=10 limes, and each lime is cut into d=8 slices -> 80 slices.\n        Each toast requires n=3 slices (one per friend). So the number of toasts from limes is 80 / 3 = 26.66... -> 26.\n\n    But wait, the example says: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n    The example breaks down the resources differently:\n\n        Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml. Then 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> 6 toasts (if we consider that one toast requires 3 ml?).\n\n    But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. If there are 3 friends, then one toast requires 3 * nl ml. But wait, the example uses nl=3, so 9 ml per toast. Then 20/9 ~ 2 toasts.\n\n    However, the example calculation uses 20/3=6. This suggests that the drink requirement is only nl per toast, not multiplied by n.\n\n    Let me read again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n    This can be interpreted as: for one toast, the drink required is nl * (number of friends) because each friend needs nl. But wait, the example does:\n\n        Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n    If we consider that one toast requires 3 ml (the nl) and then we have 20 ml, then 20/3=6 toasts. And then we divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get the number of toasts per friend? That doesn't match.\n\n    Actually, the example says: \"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\".\n\n    What are 6, 80, 100?\n        - 6: from drink (20/3) -> this is the total toasts from drink? But wait, if one toast requires 3 ml, then we can have 20/3 = 6 toasts in total? Then we have 6 toasts for the entire group? Then each friend can make 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n    But wait, what about the other resources?\n        - Limes: 10*8 = 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (since each friend gets one) -> so 80/3 = 26.66 -> 26 toasts in total? Then 26/3 ~ 8.66 -> 8 per friend? \n\n    However, the example uses 80 as the limiting factor? But wait, the example says: \n        \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3\"\n\n    Why 80 and 100?\n\n    Let me recalc using the example's own breakdown:\n\n        Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / (nl * n) = 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 = 2.22 -> 2 toasts total? Then each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        But wait, the example says: \n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\"\n\n    Here, they are dividing by nl (3) and not by (n * nl). So the example considers that one toast requires only nl ml (not n*nl) in total? \n\n    Let me check the problem statement again: \n        \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\"\n\n    This means that for one toast, the entire group (all n friends) will have to consume nl ml per friend, so total drink per toast is n * nl.\n\n    But the example calculation for drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n    Now, if one toast requires n * nl = 3 * 3 = 9 ml, then 20 / 9 = 2 toasts.\n\n    However, the example says: \n        \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\"\n\n    This implies that the example is interpreting one toast as requiring nl ml in total (not per friend). \n\n    Let me compare with the lime and salt:\n\n        Limes: They have 80 slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend? Then one toast requires n = 3 slices. So the total number of toasts from limes is 80 / 3 = 26.66 -> 26.\n\n        Salt: They have 100 grams. Each toast requires np grams per friend? Then one toast requires 3 * 1 = 3 grams. Then 100 / 3 = 33.33 -> 33.\n\n    Then the limiting factor is the drink: 2 toasts (if we use total drink per toast as 9 ml) or 6 toasts (if we use total drink per toast as 3 ml).\n\n    But wait, the example says: \n        \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n    They are dividing by 3 (the number of friends). \n\n    Another interpretation: \n        Let T be the total number of toasts (for the entire group). Then:\n\n        - Total drink needed: T * nl   (because each toast requires nl ml, regardless of the number of friends) \n        - Total lime slices needed: T * n   (each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast)\n        - Total salt needed: T * np   (each toast requires np grams per friend? Or per toast?)\n\n    But wait, the problem says for a toast, each friend needs np grams of salt. So per toast, the salt needed is n * np.\n\n    However, the example input has np=1, so per toast: 3 grams of salt.\n\n    Then the constraints are:\n\n        T * nl <= k * l         => T <= (k * l) / nl\n        T * n <= c * d           => T <= (c * d) / n\n        T * (n * np) <= p        => T <= p / (n * np)\n\n    But wait, the example calculation for salt: \n        They say: \"The salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts\"\n\n    This matches if we take T * (np) <= p? Because 100 / 1 = 100. Then per toast, they are taking np grams (without multiplying by n). \n\n    Now, let's recast the problem statement: \n        \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n    This could be ambiguous. But note: the drink part is said to be for each friend, and the salt part is also said to be for each friend. \n\n    However, the example calculation for salt: \n        They have 100 grams. Each toast requires np grams per friend? Then for T toasts, the salt needed is T * n * np.\n\n    But wait, the example calculation for salt is 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. \n\n    Alternatively, if we consider that the salt requirement is np grams per toast (independent of friends) then we would have T * np <= p.\n\n    And for the drink: if we consider that the drink requirement is nl milliliters per toast (independent of friends) then T * nl <= k * l.\n\n    But then the lime requirement: T * n <= c * d.\n\n    Then the example:\n\n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        Drink: T * 3 <= 4*5 = 20 -> T <= 20/3 = 6.66 -> T_max_drink = 6\n        Lime: T * 3 <= 10*8 = 80 -> T <= 80/3 = 26.66 -> T_max_lime = 26\n        Salt: T * 1 <= 100 -> T <= 100 -> T_max_salt = 100\n\n        Then T_total = min(6, 26, 100) = 6.\n\n        Now, the problem asks: \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\n        Since there are n=3 friends, and the total toasts is 6, then each friend can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts.\n\n    So the interpretation is:\n\n        - Each toast requires:\n            drink: nl milliliters (total for the entire group? or per friend?) \n            But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", meaning that for one toast, each friend gets nl ml. \n            However, the example calculation for drink used T * nl (without multiplying by n) for the total drink.\n\n        But then note: if each friend gets nl ml for one toast, then the total drink for one toast is n * nl. \n\n        Why did the example use T * nl? \n\n        There seems to be two different interpretations. \n\n    Let me try the other way:\n\n        Total drink needed for T toasts: T * (n * nl)   [because each toast requires n * nl ml]\n        Total lime slices: T * n   [each toast requires n slices (one per friend)]\n        Total salt needed: T * (n * np)   [each toast requires n * np grams]\n\n        Then the example:\n\n            Drink: T * (3*3) <= 20 -> T * 9 <= 20 -> T <= 20/9 = 2.22 -> T_max_drink = 2\n            Lime: T * 3 <= 80 -> T <= 80/3 = 26.66 -> T_max_lime = 26\n            Salt: T * (3*1) <= 100 -> T * 3 <= 100 -> T <= 100/3 = 33.33 -> T_max_salt = 33\n\n            Then T_total = 2.\n\n            Then each friend makes 2 / 3 toasts? That doesn't make sense because toasts are whole numbers.\n\n    Wait, but note: the problem says they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n    In the first interpretation (using T * nl, T * n, T * np) we got T_total=6 and then divided by n (3) to get 2 per friend.\n\n    In the second interpretation, we got T_total=2, which is the total toasts for the entire group? Then how many toasts per friend? 2/3? But we cannot have fractional toasts per friend.\n\n    Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that the entire group makes T toasts, and each toast is shared by all friends? \n\n    But the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for a toast. \n\n    After reading the example note again: \n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n    This implies that the drink requirement for one toast is 3 ml (nl) and not 9 ml (n*nl). \n\n    And then the lime requirement: 80 toasts (from the slices) and salt 100 toasts (from the salt) and then take the minimum (6) and divide by the number of friends (3) to get 2.\n\n    So the key is: the problem is considering that one toast requires:\n\n        - Drink: nl ml (in total for the entire group? or per toast, independent of friends) -> but wait, if nl is defined per friend, then why isn't it multiplied by n?\n\n    But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", meaning that for one toast, the drink consumed by the entire group is n * nl. However, the example calculation uses nl without n.\n\n    There's an alternative: maybe the variable nl is defined as the amount per toast per friend, but the entire group toasts together. But the example calculation does not multiply by n.\n\n    Let me check the sample inputs:\n\n        Example 1: Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 -> Output: 2\n\n        Example 2: Input: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 -> Output: 3\n\n        Example 3: Input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 -> Output: 0\n\n    Let me compute the second example with the first interpretation (T * nl, T * n, T * np):\n\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        Drink: T * 4 <= 100*10 = 1000 -> T <= 1000/4 = 250\n        Lime: T * 5 <= 1*19 = 19 -> T <= 19/5 = 3.8 -> T_max_lime = 3\n        Salt: T * 3 <= 90 -> T <= 90/3 = 30\n\n        Then T_total = min(250, 3, 30) = 3\n\n        Then each friend makes 3 / 5 = 0.6 -> but wait, the output is 3. \n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"Print a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\"\n\n        And the example output is 3.\n\n        Now, if we do:\n\n            Total toasts T_total = 3 (from lime constraint)\n\n            Then each friend can make 3 toasts? \n\n        However, note: the lime constraint: T * n = 3 * 5 = 15 slices needed, but we have only 19 slices? Actually, we have 19 slices, and 15 <= 19 -> yes, but wait, the constraint is T * n <= c*d -> 3*5=15 <= 19 -> holds.\n\n        But then why is the answer 3? Because the total toasts is 3, and since there are 5 friends, then each friend makes 3 toasts? \n\n        But wait, the example output is 3. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n        So if the entire group makes 3 toasts, then each friend must have 3 toasts? \n\n        Actually, no. The entire group is making 3 toasts. How are these 3 toasts distributed? \n\n        The problem states: \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n        This means that the entire group will have the same number of toasts per friend. \n\n        Let x be the number of toasts per friend. Then the total number of toasts is n * x? \n\n        But wait, if each friend makes x toasts, then the entire group has n * x toasts? \n\n        However, the resources are used per toast. Each toast (whether made by one friend or the entire group) requires:\n\n            drink: nl * x (per friend's x toasts, but wait, no: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters for a toast\", so for x toasts by one friend, he needs x * nl ml.\n\n        But then the total drink required is n * (x * nl) = x * (n * nl)\n\n        Similarly, lime slices: each friend needs x slices (one per toast), so total slices: n * x\n        Salt: each friend needs x * np grams, so total salt: n * x * np\n\n        However, the example calculation in the first sample was done in terms of total toasts T, and then each friend makes T/n toasts? \n\n        But wait, the first sample: \n            T_total = 6 toasts (total for the entire group) -> then each friend makes 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n        In the second sample: \n            T_total = 3 toasts (total for the entire group) -> then each friend makes 3/5 = 0.6 -> but the output is 3.\n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n    After re‐reading the problem statement: \n\n        \"How many toasts can each friend make?\"\n\n        The problem does not say \"how many toasts in total\" but \"each friend\".\n\n        And the example output for the first sample is 2 (meaning each friend makes 2 toasts) and for the second sample is 3.\n\n    Let me assume that the entire group makes T_total toasts, and each toast is a common toast (so all friends are present at every toast). \n\n        Then, the total drink needed: T_total * (n * nl)   [because each toast requires n * nl ml]\n        Total lime slices: T_total * n   [each toast requires n slices]\n        Total salt: T_total * (n * np)   [each toast requires n * np grams]\n\n        Then, the maximum T_total is the minimum of:\n            (k*l) // (n*nl)   [if we use integer division?] but the problem says \"as many as they can\", so floor division.\n\n        Then, the number of toasts per friend? \n\n        Since each toast is shared by all friends, then each friend is involved in T_total toasts. \n\n        But wait, that would be: each friend makes T_total toasts (because they are present at each toast).\n\n        Then the answer is T_total.\n\n        However, in the first sample: \n            n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3 -> drink: 4*5 = 20; n*nl=9; T_total = min(20//9, (10*8)//3, 100//(3*1)) \n                drink: 20//9 = 2\n                lime: (10*8)//3 = 80//3 = 26\n                salt: 100//3 = 33\n            Then T_total = 2, and then each friend makes 2 toasts? \n\n        But the example output is 2.\n\n        Second sample: \n            n=5, k=100, l=10, nl=4 -> drink: 100*10=1000, n*nl=20, 1000//20=50\n            lime: n=5, c=1, d=19 -> 1*19=19, T_total_drink_component = 19//5=3\n            salt: n=5, np=3 -> n*np=15, p=90 -> 90//15=6\n            Then T_total = min(50, 3, 6) = 3\n            Then each friend makes 3 toasts? -> output 3, which matches.\n\n        Third sample: \n            Input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n            Drink: 1000*1000 = 1000000, n*nl=10*50=500 -> 1000000//500 = 2000\n            Lime: 25*23=575, n=10 -> 575//10 = 57\n            Salt: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 -> 1//10 = 0\n            Then T_total = 0, so each friend makes 0 toasts.\n\n        This matches the third sample.\n\n        But wait, in the first sample, we computed T_total=2, then each friend makes 2 toasts. \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for a toast. \n\n        In this interpretation, the entire group makes T_total toasts, and each toast requires n * nl ml. \n\n        But the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", meaning that for one toast, each friend must have nl ml. \n\n        Then the total drink for one toast is n * nl, which is consistent.\n\n        And then each friend is present at every toast, so they make T_total toasts.\n\n        However, wait: if the entire group makes T_total toasts, and each toast is a common event, then each friend is involved in T_total toasts.\n\n        So the answer is T_total.\n\n        But in the first sample, T_total=2, and the example output is 2.\n\n        And the second sample: T_total=3, output 3.\n\n        And the third sample: 0.\n\n        But wait, the example breakdown in the problem statement was:\n\n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        Here, they were dividing by 3 (nl) and not by (n*nl). \n\n        However, according to our calculation for the first sample:\n\n            Drink: 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ~ 2.22 -> floor to 2.\n\n        But the problem statement example calculation was:\n\n            Drink: 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> floor to 6.\n\n        Why the discrepancy? \n\n        The problem statement example calculation used:\n\n            \"The friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        This implies that they considered one toast requires 3 ml (nl) and not 9 ml (n*nl). \n\n        But then they say: \"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\n        This means that the total toasts (from drink) is 6, but then we divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get the per friend count.\n\n        So the example intended two different things for drink and for the others? \n\n        Actually, the example's drink calculation was incorrect by their own later adjustment. \n\n        They initially calculated the total toasts from drink as 6, but then realized that the same drink is shared by all friends, so they have to divide by the number of friends to get the per friend toasts.\n\n        However, in our second interpretation (with T_total being the total toasts for the entire group, and then each friend makes T_total toasts) we get 2 for the first sample.\n\n        How did they get 6 toasts from drink? \n\n        If we consider that the entire group can make 6 toasts (each toast being a common event) then the drink required per toast is 3 ml (nl) and not 9 ml (n*nl). \n\n        But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", so if there are 3 friends, then one toast requires 3*3=9 ml.\n\n        The example's initial calculation was: 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> 6 toasts (total toasts). Then they divided by 3 to get 2 per friend.\n\n        But then why did they not use 9 ml for the drink? \n\n        There are two possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: The problem statement meant that the drink requirement is nl ml per toast (independent of friends). Then the lime requirement is n slices per toast, and the salt requirement is np grams per toast (independent of friends) or n*np grams per toast? \n\n        But the problem says for a toast, each friend needs nl ml, so the drink requirement should be n*nl.\n\n        Possibility 2: There is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\n        Let me look at the example output: \n            Input: ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n        Our method gives:\n            First: 2, Second: 3, Third: 0.\n\n        The example output is: ['2', '3', '0'].\n\n        So the example outputs match our calculation.\n\n        Therefore, the intended solution is:\n\n            Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of toasts (for the entire group) as the minimum of:\n                T1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [if we use integer division? but note: floor division is okay because we can't do partial toast]\n                T2 = (c * d) // n\n                T3 = p // (n * np)\n\n            But wait, for the lime: the constraint is T * n <= c * d -> T <= (c*d) / n. However, note: the lime slices are used per friend per toast. In our model, one toast requires n slices. \n\n            However, the example calculation for lime was: 80 (slices) / 3 (n) = 26.66 -> 26. But wait, in our model we set T <= (c*d) // n, which is 80//3=26.\n\n            But wait, we have 80 slices. Each toast requires n=3 slices. Then the maximum T is floor(80/3)=26.\n\n            Similarly, for salt: T <= p // (n*np) = 100 // (3*1) = 33.\n\n            And for drink: 20 // (3*3) = 2.\n\n            Then T = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n            Then the answer is 2 (toasts per friend? no, wait: in our model, T is the total toasts for the entire group, and each friend is involved in T toasts, so the answer is T.\n\n            But wait, in the example they did: min(6,80,100)/3 = 2.\n\n            In our calculation, the drink constraint gives 2 (which is the total toasts for the entire group) and then we don't divide by n? \n\n            Actually, in our model, the entire group makes T toasts, and each friend makes T toasts (because they are at every toast). \n\n            But the example's model: \n                They calculated the drink constraint as 6 toasts (total toasts) and then divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2 per friend.\n\n            This implies that the example's model is: \n                Let x be the number of toasts per friend. Then the entire group makes n * x toasts.\n\n            Then the constraints are:\n\n                (n * x) * (nl) <= k * l   -> because drink: each toast (for the entire group) requires nl ml? But wait, no: if each friend makes x toasts, then the drink consumed by one friend is x * nl, and total drink is n * x * nl.\n                Similarly, lime: n * x * 1 <= c * d   [but wait, the lime requirement: each friend needs one slice per toast -> so one friend uses x slices, and n friends use n*x slices]\n                Salt: n * x * np <= p\n\n            Then x is limited by:\n\n                x <= (k * l) / (n * nl)   [from drink] -> same as above, but now x is per friend.\n\n                x <= (c * d) / (n)          [from lime] -> same as above.\n\n                x <= p / (n * np)           [from salt]\n\n            Then x = min( (k * l) / (n * nl), (c * d) / (n), p / (n * np) )\n\n            Then the answer is floor(x)? \n\n            But wait, x must be an integer? The problem says \"as many as they can\", so we take the floor.\n\n            Now, for the first sample:\n\n                x_drink = (4*5) / (3*3) = 20/9 = 2.22 -> floor to 2\n                x_lime = (10*8) / 3 = 80/3 = 26.66 -> floor to 26\n                x_salt = 100 / (3*1) = 33.33 -> floor to 33\n\n                Then x = 2.\n\n            Second sample:\n\n                x_drink = (100*10) / (5*4) = 1000/20 = 50 -> 50\n                x_lime = (1*19) / 5 = 19/5 = 3.8 -> floor to 3\n                x_salt = 90 / (5*3) = 90/15 = 6 -> 6\n\n                Then x = 3.\n\n            Third sample:\n\n                x_drink = (1000*1000) / (10*50) = 1000000/500 = 2000\n                x_lime = (25*23) / 10 = 575/10 = 57.5 -> 57\n                x_salt = 1 / (10*1) = 0.1 -> 0\n\n                Then x = 0.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            But note: the example's initial breakdown for the first sample was:\n\n                Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (total) -> but wait, if we use the per-friend model, the total toasts is 3 * 2 = 6. \n\n                Then they take the minimum of the three resources (interpreted as total toasts) and then divide by the number of friends to get the per friend toasts.\n\n            In fact, the two models are equivalent:\n\n                Model 1 (total toasts T):\n                    T = n * x   [x is toasts per friend]\n                    Constraints:\n                        T * (n * nl) <= k * l   -> n*x * (n*nl) <= k*l -> x <= (k*l) / (n*n*nl)   [This is not matching]\n\n                Actually, let me write the constraints for the total toasts T (entire group) and then relate to x (toasts per friend):\n\n                    In the problem statement, if the entire group makes T toasts, then each friend makes T toasts (if they are present at every toast). \n\n                    Then the drink: T * (n * nl) <= k * l   -> T <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\n                    Then x = T   [because each friend makes T toasts]\n\n                But wait, then the first sample: T <= 20/(3*3)=2, so x=2.\n\n                In the example, they did: \n                    They calculated the drink constraint as 20/3=6 (total toasts) and then divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2 per friend.\n\n                This is inconsistent.\n\n            Let me clarify the two models:\n\n            Model A (total toasts T for the entire group, and each toast is a common event):\n\n                Drink: T * (n * nl) <= k * l\n                Lime: T * n <= c * d\n                Salt: T * (n * np) <= p\n\n                Then T = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n*np) )   [using floor division]\n\n                Then the answer is T (each friend makes T toasts, because they are present at every toast).\n\n            Model B (each friend makes x toasts independently, but the entire",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring that all friends can partake equally in the toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources: drink, limes, and salt. Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend (so total drink per toast is `n * nl`).\n   - One lime slice per friend (so total lime slices per toast is `n`).\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend (so total salt per toast is `n * np`).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of toasts each friend can make is constrained by the most limited resource. We compute the maximum possible toasts for each resource:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters. The maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices. The maximum toasts from limes is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams. The maximum toasts from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n3. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum value among the three constraints calculated above. This ensures that all resources are sufficient for the computed number of toasts per friend.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    drink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    lime_toasts = (c * d) // n\n    salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n    \n    result = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink per toast per friend, and salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Constraint Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters). The maximum toasts from drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total lime slices available is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend). The maximum toasts from limes is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams). The maximum toasts from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n3. **Result Determination**: The answer is the smallest value among the three constraints, ensuring that all resources are fully utilized without exceeding any limit. This value is printed as the result, representing the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.",
