При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` (the received message) and we need to determine if it could be the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s` with an overlapping error.\n\n Conditions for the error:\n - The two original messages are identical (so `t` is formed by two copies of `s` that overlapped at least once).\n - The overlap must be positive and less than the length of `s`.\n - Also, note: if the entire message is just two copies without any proper overlap (i.e., no positive overlap but just the whole thing) then it's not considered an error? Actually, the problem states: \n   \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений.\" \n   But note: the example says if you get \"abcd\" (which is two copies without any overlap? Actually, wait: two copies of \"ab\" would be \"abab\", but note the condition: the overlap must be positive and less than the length. So if we have two copies of \"ab\", then the overlap must be at least 1 and less than 2 -> so only 1. Then the result would be \"aba\" (if we overlap by 1: first \"ab\" and second \"ab\" -> 'ab'+'ab'[1:] = 'ab'+'b' -> 'abb'? Actually, wait the example says:\n\n Example: \n   Two messages \"abrakadabra\" can lead to:\n      \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap of 1)\n      \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap of 4)\n\n How does the merging work?\n   Let s = \"abrakadabra\"\n   Without error: t = s + s = \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\"\n   With error: we take s and then append a suffix of s (with some length k, 0 < k < len(s)) but wait the problem says: the two messages are identical and the error causes the second message to merge with the first by overlapping as long as there are matching characters.\n\n However, note the example: \n   \"abrakadabrakadabra\": \n        s = \"abrakadabra\", then we break it as:\n        s[0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" and then the next part is s[4:16] (if we consider the entire second copy) but wait, the total length is 23. Actually, we have:\n        t = \"abrakadabra\" + (a suffix of s of length 4) -> so the second copy starts at index 12 and goes for 11 characters, but we only use the last 4 of the first copy and the first 12-4=8 of the second copy? \n\n Actually, the problem says: the two messages are identical, so we are assuming that the entire transmission was two copies of s. But the error caused the end of the first and the beginning of the second to merge. The merged string is:\n\n   t = s[0: n] + s[k: ]   where n is the length of s, but actually we break the second copy at an overlap of k, meaning the second copy is only partially transmitted.\n\n However, the example output says for \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (which is 23 characters) and s is \"abrakadabra\" (11 characters). So the first copy is complete (11 chars) and then the second copy starts with the next 12 characters? But wait, the example says the overlap is 1, so the second copy should start from the second character of the first copy? Actually, let me reconstruct:\n\n   Without error: we would have 22 characters: \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\"\n   With error (overlap 1): we have the first copy (11 characters) and then the second copy without the first character. So the total length is 11 + 10 = 21? But the example says 23.\n\n Wait, the example input was: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra'] which is 23 characters.\n\n Let me re-read: \n   \"abrakadabra\" (11) + \"abrakadabra\" (11) = 22, but the example says \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (23). \n\n Actually, the example says: \n   \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap of 1) and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap of 4).\n\n How do we get 23? \n   In the first example: \n        s = \"abrakadabra\"\n        The first copy is \"abrakadabra\", then the second copy starts with the last character of the first copy? Actually, the example says the two messages are \"abrakadabra\" and then again \"abrakadabra\". The merging: they are merged by having the end of the first match with the beginning of the second. \n\n   But note: the example says the merged message is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\". This is:\n\n        First part: \"abrakadabra\" (the first message)\n        Then, the second message starts with \"brakadabra\"? \n\n   Actually, the merging is done by taking the entire first message and then the second message without the prefix that matches the suffix of the first message. However, in the example, the first message ends with \"a\" and the second message starts with \"a\", so we can merge by one character. Then the total string is:\n\n        s + s[1:]   -> \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabbrakadabra\"? \n\n   That doesn't match.\n\n   Alternatively, the merging is: \n        We have two strings s and s. We are allowed to remove a prefix from the second string that matches the suffix of the first string. But note: the example output says \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is:\n\n        \"abrakadabra\" (first copy) and then the second copy is \"brab\" (from the beginning of the second copy) but wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\n   Let me check the example: \n        Input: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        They say: \n          First example: overlap of 1 -> so the second copy is shifted by 1. Then the resulting string is:\n            s[0:11] (the first copy) and then s[1:11] (the second copy without the first character) and then the rest of the second copy? But wait, the total length would be 11 + 10 = 21, but we have 23.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might mean that the entire message t is formed by two copies of s, but with an overlap of k (meaning the last k characters of the first copy are the same as the first k characters of the second copy). Then the total length is (len(s) - k) + (len(s))? Actually, no: because the second copy is still sent entirely, but the overlapping part is merged. So the total length is len(s) + len(s) - k.\n\n   For s = \"abrakadabra\", k=1: total length = 11+11-1 = 21, but the example string has 23.\n\n   Wait, the example input is given as: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" which is 23 characters. And the example output says YES and s=\"abrakadabra\".\n\n   Let me count: \n        \"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters.\n        The example output string: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> \n        a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n        Actually, let me break it down: \n        It seems they broke the second copy at an overlap of 10? Or maybe the example is different.\n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap of 1) and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap of 4).\n\n   For the first example: \n        Original two copies: \"abrakadabra\" and \"abrakadabra\"\n        With overlap of 1: \n            We have the first copy: \"abrakadabra\"\n            Then the second copy: we start from the second character (because the last character of the first copy is 'a', and the second copy's first character is 'a') so we skip the first character of the second copy.\n\n            Then the entire string becomes: \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabbrakadabra\" -> 11 + 10 = 21, but the example input is 23.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might allow the entire second copy to be broken arbitrarily? But the example says the two messages are identical and the error occurs when the two are sent consecutively.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again: \n        \"the two messages ... are identical\" and the error causes them to be merged by overlapping. The example input is 23, so the two copies must have been sent as two full copies, but the overlap was such that the total length is 23? \n\n   Actually, the example input string is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is:\n\n        \"abrakadabra\" (11) + \"brab\" (from the second copy) but then the rest of the second copy? \n\n   Let me try: \n        Let s = \"abrakadabra\"\n        Then the example output is YES with s = \"abrakadabra\", so the two original messages were s and s.\n\n        How did they form \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"?\n\n        Break the string t into two parts: \n          First part: from the beginning to the point where the overlap starts.\n\n        Alternatively, think of the entire string t as being formed by two copies of s, but with an overlap of k (k>0 and k<len(s)), and then the rest of the second copy is appended.\n\n        Actually, the total string t is built as:\n          t = s + (a substring of s starting from index k to the end)   [but wait, that would be s + s[k:], and the length would be len(s) + (len(s)-k) = 2*len(s)-k]\n\n        For s = \"abrakadabra\", k=1: then t = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabbrakadabra\", which is 21.\n\n        But the example input is 23. \n\n   There is a discrepancy.\n\n   Let me check the example provided in the problem statement: \n        Example: \n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n            Output: ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n        So the first example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", and the expected output is \"YES\" and s=\"abrakadabra\".\n\n        Now, let me check the length: \n            \"abrakadabra\" is 11, so two copies without error is 22. \n            The example input is 23.\n\n        How can that be? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might allow the two messages to be merged in a way that the second message is broken at an arbitrary positive overlap (but the entire second message is not necessarily included). \n\n        But note: the problem says \"two identical messages\", so we assume the entire second message is sent, but the error causes an overlap. \n\n        However, the example output string is longer than 2*len(s). \n\n        Let me recount the example input: \n            \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> \n            a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a -> 23 letters.\n\n        How can we get 23 from two copies of \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters each) with an overlap?\n\n        We have to break the second copy at an overlap of k, then the total length is 11 + (11 - k) = 22 - k.\n\n        We want 22 - k = 23? That would require k = -1, which is impossible.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem does not require the entire second message to be sent? \n\n        Rethink: \n          The problem says: \"two identical messages\". So the two messages are each of length n (say). Then without error, we have 2*n.\n\n          With error, we have: the first message is sent completely, then the second message is sent, but the first m characters (m>=1 and m<n) of the second message are merged with the last m characters of the first message. Then the total length is n + (n - m) = 2*n - m.\n\n        So the length of t must be 2*n - m, and m is between 1 and n-1.\n\n        For t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which has length 23, we have 2*n - m = 23.\n\n        And n must be the length of s, which we are trying to find. Also, the first n characters of t must be s, and the last n characters must also be s, but with an overlap of m.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require that the entire second copy is present. Only that the two original messages were s and s.\n\n        But wait, the example output says s is \"abrakadabra\", which is 11. Then 2*11 - m = 22 - m = 23 -> m = -1, which is invalid.\n\n        So what's going on?\n\n        Let me look at the example again: \n            Example says: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        Maybe the example intended to show two copies with an overlap, but the example input string is actually constructed differently.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might allow the error to occur in the middle of the transmission? \n\n        Another possibility: the two messages are sent consecutively, but the error might occur only at the boundary, and the entire second message is sent except for the overlapping part, but the overlapping part is already included in the first message. \n\n        However, the example output for the first example is \"YES\\nabrakadabra\", meaning s is \"abrakadabra\". \n\n        How can we form \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" from two copies of \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap?\n\n        Let me write s = \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters)\n\n        Then, without error: \n            t0 = s + s = \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\" (22 letters)\n\n        With error (overlap of k), we remove the first k letters of the second copy and attach the remaining. But note: the problem says the two messages are identical, so the second copy is still s, but the overlapping part is merged. \n\n        The merging rule: the end of the first message and the beginning of the second message must match. Then we remove the overlapping part from the beginning of the second copy.\n\n        So the resulting string is: \n            s + s[k:]\n\n        Then the length is 11 + (11 - k) = 22 - k.\n\n        We want 22 - k = 23 -> k = -1, which is impossible.\n\n        Therefore, the example input string must be different.\n\n        Let me check the example input string: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        Count the letters: \n            a b r a k a d a b r a -> 11 (first part)\n            b r a k a d a b r a -> 10? \n            Then total 21.\n\n        Actually, let me count again: \n            a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a -> \n            positions: \n            1: a, 2: b, 3: r, 4: a, 5: k, 6: a, 7: d, 8: a, 9: b, 10: r, 11: a, 12: b, 13: r, 14: a, 15: k, 16: a, 17: d, 18: a, 19: b, 20: r, 21: a -> 21 letters.\n\n        I must have miscounted earlier.\n\n        So the example input \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" is 21 letters.\n\n        Then: 2*11 - k = 21 -> k = 1.\n\n        Now, how does the merging work for k=1?\n            t = s + s[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadab\"+\"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabbrakadabra\" -> 11 + 10 = 21, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, the example input is written as \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is:\n\n            \"abrakadabra\" (the first copy) and then \"brab\" (from the second copy) and then \"rakadabra\"? \n\n        Actually, the string is: \n            a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\n        Breaking the second copy at the first character: \n            Second copy: \"abrakadabra\" -> without the first character: \"brakadabra\"\n\n        Then the entire string is \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \n            \"a b r a k a d a b r a\" + \"b r a k a d a b r a\" -> \n            \"a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\"\n\n        Which is exactly the example input.\n\n        So the example input is 21, not 23. \n\n        The example list: \n            ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n        Let me check the others:\n\n        Example 2: 'acacacaca' -> 10 characters.\n\n        What is s? \n            Possibility: s = \"acaca\", then two copies: \"acacacaca\" -> \n            Without error: 10 = 5*2, but with error: \n                If s = \"acaca\", then we can have an error by overlapping 1: \n                    t = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" -> \"acacacaca\" -> 5+4=9, not 10.\n                Overlapping 2: t = \"acaca\" + \"aca\" -> \"acacaaca\" -> 8, not 10.\n                Overlapping 3: t = \"acaca\" + \"ca\" -> \"acacaca\" -> 7, not 10.\n\n            Alternatively, s = \"acac\", then two copies: 8 characters, but we have 10.\n\n            Or s = \"aca\", then two copies: 6, not 10.\n\n            Or s = \"cac\", then two copies: 6, not 10.\n\n            Alternatively, s = \"acacacaca\", then two copies would be 20, too long.\n\n        Wait, the example output says YES and s = \"acaca\".\n\n        How? \n            We have t = \"acacacaca\" (10 characters)\n\n            Let s = \"acaca\" (5 characters). Then the two copies are s and s. The error occurred with an overlap of 2? \n                Then t = s + s[2:] = \"acaca\" + \"aca\" -> \"acacaca\" (7 characters) -> not 10.\n\n            Alternatively, the problem allows multiple overlaps? \n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \n            \"При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно.\"\n\n            This implies that the entire transmission is two copies, and the error happens at the boundary. But the example output for the second example is \"acacacaca\".\n\n        Another possibility: the error might happen multiple times? But the problem says two messages.\n\n        Alternatively, the error might not be a simple one-time overlap, but the entire transmission might be broken into two copies with an arbitrary overlap, but the entire string t is the concatenation of two copies with one overlap.\n\n        However, the example output says s = \"acaca\", so the two original messages are \"acaca\" and \"acaca\".\n\n        How can we form \"acacacaca\" from two copies of \"acaca\"?\n\n        We can break the first copy and the second copy arbitrarily? \n\n        Actually, note: the example output for the second example is \"YES\\nacaca\", meaning that the original message s is \"acaca\". \n\n        How does the merging work for two copies of \"acaca\" to yield \"acacacaca\"?\n\n        Let me break t = \"acacacaca\" (10 characters) into two parts that are both \"acaca\", but with an overlap of 4? \n\n        Condition: the overlap must be positive and less than the length of s (which is 5). So k can be 1,2,3,4.\n\n        If k=4, then the merged string would be:\n            s + s[4:] = \"acaca\" + \"a\" = \"acacaa\", which is 6 characters.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might allow the entire second copy to be broken at the overlap, but then the rest of the second copy is appended. However, that gives 5 + (5-4)=6.\n\n        Another idea: perhaps the error can occur in the first copy as well? Or the two messages are sent and the error occurs only at the boundary, but the entire second message is not necessarily broken only at the beginning? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the two messages are identical. The error causes the end of the first to merge with the beginning of the second. \n\n        So the entire second copy is still present, but the overlapping part is removed from the beginning. \n\n        Then the total length is 5 + (5 - k) = 10 - k.\n\n        We have t of length 10, so 10 - k = 10 -> k=0, which is not allowed (overlap must be positive).\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might allow the first copy to be broken and then the second copy to be broken, and the entire string is the union of the two copies with an overlap? \n\n        But note: the example input is 10, and two copies of \"acaca\" without error is 10. So without error, we have 10. But the problem says: \n            \"Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\"\n\n        So if the entire message is two copies without any overlap (so k=0) then it's not an error. \n\n        But then why is \"acacacaca\" an error? \n\n        Wait, the example output says YES, so there is an error. \n\n        How can \"acacacaca\" be formed by two copies of \"acaca\" with an error? \n\n        Let me try with k=3: \n            Then the merged string is \"acaca\" + \"ca\" = \"acacaca\" (7 characters) -> not 10.\n\n        k=2: \"acaca\" + \"aca\" = \"acacaca\" (7) -> same.\n\n        k=1: \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\" -> 5 + 4 = 9, but our string is 10.\n\n        Wait, 5 + (5-1) = 9, but the string is 10.\n\n        What if the error happens twice? The problem states two messages. \n\n        Another possibility: the problem allows the entire second copy to be broken at the overlap, but the first copy might have been broken as well? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд\" (two identical messages in a row). \n\n        So the entire transmission is two copies. The error happens at the boundary, so the entire second copy is broken at the overlap. \n\n        Then the total length is fixed: n + (n - k) = 2*n - k.\n\n        For n=5, k=1: 2*5-1=9, but we have 10.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might allow the error to occur at multiple boundaries? But there are only two messages.\n\n        Let me consider: maybe the two messages are not the entire s? \n\n        Wait, the example output says s=\"acaca\", so the two messages are \"acaca\" and \"acaca\".\n\n        Then the total length must be 2*5 - k = 10 - k, and we have 10, so k=0 -> not allowed.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me read the example output again: \n            Input: 'acacacaca' -> Output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n        And the example output for the fourth example: \n            Input: 'abababab' -> Output: 'YES\\nababab'\n\n        Let me analyze the fourth example:\n\n        Example 4: 'abababab' (length 8)\n\n        The output says s = \"ababab\" (length 6). Then the two copies: 6*2=12, but the string is 8.\n\n        Alternatively, the output s is \"ababab\", so the two copies are \"ababab\" and \"ababab\". Then the error: \n            Total length = 6 + (6-k) = 12-k = 8 -> k=4.\n\n        Then t = \"ababab\" + \"ab\"[4:] ? -> Actually, s[4:] is \"ab\", so t = \"abababab\", which matches.\n\n        So the example 4 works.\n\n        Now, example 2: 'acacacaca' (10) and s=\"acaca\" (5). Then the total length should be 5 + (5-k) = 10-k. We have 10, so k=0 -> not allowed. But wait, the example output says YES.\n\n        Unless the example 2 is using a different s? \n\n        The problem says: if there are multiple answers, output any.\n\n        What if s is \"aca\"? \n            Then two copies: \"acaaca\" (6) -> not 10.\n\n        s = \"cac\"? -> \"cacacac\" (7) -> not 10.\n\n        s = \"aca\" repeated more than two times? But the problem says two identical messages.\n\n        Another possibility: the entire string t is formed by two copies of s, but the error might have occurred in a way that the overlapping is not at the beginning of the second copy only, but maybe the first copy is broken too? \n\n        But the problem states: the two messages are identical and the error occurs by merging the end of the first and the beginning of the second.\n\n        Alternatively, the example 2 might be broken as:\n\n            Let s = \"acacacaca\" / 2 = \"acacacaca\" (then two copies would be 20). Not.\n\n        Or maybe the two messages are not contiguous? \n\n        Let me think: the problem says the two messages are sent consecutively. \n\n        How about this: the two messages are s and s, but the error occurs only once, and the entire string t is the first message (s) and then the second message without the overlapping prefix. But then the length is 2*n - k.\n\n        For example 2: 2*n - k = 10.\n\n        We know n must be the length of s. And s must be a substring of t? Actually, the first n characters of t must be s, and the last n characters must be s, but with an overlap of k.\n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n            t = A + B, where A is the entire first message (s) and B is a substring of s (from index k to the end) and the length of B is len(s)-k.\n\n        Then the entire t is s + (s without the first k characters). \n\n        Then the total length is n + (n - k) = 2*n - k.\n\n        Also, note that the last n characters of t must be s? Not necessarily, because we only have the last (n-k) characters of s. \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the entire second message to appear. Only that the two original messages were s and s.\n\n        So the condition is: \n            There exists an integer n (length of s) and an integer k (1<=k<n) such that:\n                t = s + s[k:]\n            and the length of t is 2*n - k.\n\n        But note: the first n characters of t are s. Then the next n-k characters are s[k:].\n\n        Additionally, we can also consider that the entire t is built from two copies of s, but the first copy is complete and the second copy is broken at an arbitrary k (as long as the first n-k characters of the second copy match the last n-k characters of the first copy? Actually, no: the problem says the two messages are identical, so the second copy is s, and we break it at k, then the part that is kept is s[k:].\n\n        But wait, the first copy is s, and the second copy is s, so the entire t is s + s[k:]. \n\n        Then we can recover s as the first n characters of t, where n is the length of s. But we don't know n.\n\n        We have: \n            Let n = len(s). Then t must be of length 2*n - k, and k is in [1, n-1].\n\n        Also, the first n characters of t must be s, and the substring t[n: n+(n-k)] = s[k:].\n\n        But note: the entire second part (of length n-k) is s[k:], so we have:\n\n            t[0:n] = s\n            t[n: n+n-k] = s[k:]\n\n        Then, we must have that the substring of t starting at index n of length n-k is equal to s[k:].\n\n        But s = t[0:n], so s[k:] = t[0:n][k:] = t[k:n].\n\n        And we require that t[n: n+n-k] = t[k:n]\n\n        But note: n+n-k = 2*n - k, and the length of the second part is n-k, so the last index is n + (n-k) - 1 = 2*n - k - 1.\n\n        However, the entire t has length L = 2*n - k.\n\n        And we have two conditions:\n            Condition 1: t[0:n] = s\n            Condition 2: t[n: n+n-k] = s[k:] = t[k:n]\n\n        Also, we have n = len(s) and k is in [1, n-1].\n\n        Now, the length of t is L = 2*n - k.\n\n        We can iterate over possible n (the length of s) and k.\n\n        Constraints: \n            n must be at least ceil(L/2)+1? Actually, from L = 2*n - k and k>=1, we have L <= 2*n - 1 -> n >= (L+1)//2.\n\n            Also, k = 2*n - L, and we require 1<=k<=n-1.\n\n        So: \n            n must satisfy: n >= (L+1)//2 and also 2*n - L is between 1 and n-1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over possible n from (L+1)//2 to L-1 (since k>=1 => n>= (L+1)//2 and k<=n-1 => 2*n-L <= n-1 -> n <= L+1, but also n>=ceil(L/2)+something).\n\n        Actually, from L = 2*n - k, we have k = 2*n - L, and 1<=2*n-L<=n-1.\n\n        Solve for n:\n            Lower bound: 2*n-L>=1 -> n>=(L+1)/2.\n            Upper bound: 2*n-L<=n-1 -> n<=L-1.\n\n        So n is in the range [ceil((L+1)/2), L-1].\n\n        Then, for each n in that range, set k = 2*n - L, and then check:\n            Condition 1: the first n characters of t (call this candidate s) must be such that the substring s[k:] (which is s[k:n]) equals the next (n-k) characters of t (i.e., t[n: n+n-k] = t[n: 2*n - L + n] = t[n: 2*n - L + n] = t[n: 3*n - L] ??? \n\n        Wait, let me re-index: \n            The length of the second part is n-k, so the substring we take from t is from index n to index n+(n-k)-1 = 2*n - k - 1.\n\n            But we know the total length L = 2*n - k, so the last index is L-1 = 2*n - k - 1.\n\n            So the second part is t[n: L] (since L = 2*n-k, then from n to 2*n-k-1, which is L-1).\n\n        And we require that t[n:L] == t[k:n] (because s[k:] = t[0:n][k:] = t[k:n])\n\n        Then we have two segments:\n            Segment1: t[0:n] -> candidate s\n            Segment2: t[n:L] -> must equal t[k:n]\n\n        And note: the length of segment2 is n-k, and the length of t[k:n] is n-k (because from index k to n-1, that's n-k characters).\n\n        Steps for a given t and a candidate n (with n in [ceil((L+1)/2), L-1]):\n\n            k = 2*n - L\n            Check if 1<=k<=n-1 (this is ensured by our n range, but we can check anyway)\n\n            Then, check if t[n: n+(n-k)] equals t[k: k+(n-k)] (which is t[k:n])\n\n            But note: n+(n-k) = 2*n - k = L, so we are checking t[n:L] == t[k:n]\n\n        Example 1: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", L=21\n            n must be in [ceil(22/2)=11, 20] and also n<=20 (since L-1=20). So n from 11 to 20.\n\n            k = 2*n - 21, and we require 1<=k<=n-1.\n\n            For n=11: k=2*11-21=1 -> valid (1<=1<=10)\n            Then check: \n                s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\"\n                Then we require t[11:21] == t[1:11]\n                t[11:21] = \"brabrabrakadabra\" (from index11 to 20: 10 characters)\n                t[1:11] = \"brakadabra\" (10 characters)\n\n                Are they equal? \n                    \"brabrabrakadabra\" vs \"brakadabra\"\n\n                No, they are not.\n\n            But wait, the example says YES, so there must be another n?\n\n            Let me check n=10: but n must be at least ceil((21+1)/2)=11, so n=10 is not in the range.\n\n            Let me check n=12: k=2*12-21=3, then check t[0:12] and then t[12:21] (length=9) and t[3:12] (length=9)\n                s = t[0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" (wait, the first 12 characters of \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" is \"abrakadabra\" (11) plus one more? Actually, the first 12 characters: \n                    \"abrakadabra\" is 11, so the 12th is 'b' -> \"abrakadabras\" (if we take 12)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlapping error. The overlap must be a positive number less than the length of `s`, and the entire second copy of `s` should start from the overlap point onwards. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by taking the first `n` characters (which is `s`) followed by the substring starting from the `k`-th character of `s` to the end, where `k` is the overlap length (1 ≤ k < n). The total length of `t` will then be `2*n - k`.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `n` of `s` (from half the length of `t` plus one to the length of `t` minus one), we calculate the overlap `k` as `2*n - len(t)`. We then check if `k` is within the valid range (1 ≤ k < n). If so, we verify that the substring of `t` from position `n` to the end matches the substring of `t` from position `k` to `n`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible lengths `n` of `s` that could satisfy the conditions. For each `n`, compute `k` and check the validity and the substring condition. If any `n` satisfies the conditions, output \"YES\" along with the corresponding `s`; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    L = len(t)\n    found = False\n    for n in range((L + 1) // 2, L):\n        k_val = 2 * n - L\n        if k_val < 1 or k_val >= n:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:n]\n        part1 = t[k_val:k_val + (n - k_val)]\n        part2 = t[n: n + (n - k_val)]\n        if part1 == part2:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            return\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `L` is determined.\n2. **Iteration Over Possible Lengths**: The loop runs from `(L + 1) // 2` to `L - 1` to consider all possible lengths `n` for the original string `s`.\n3. **Overlap Calculation**: For each `n`, the overlap `k_val` is calculated as `2 * n - L`. This `k_val` must be between 1 and `n - 1` to be valid.\n4. **Substring Validation**: The candidate string `s_candidate` is the first `n` characters of `t`. The next part of `t` (from `n` to the end) is compared with the substring of `t` starting at `k_val` and of length `n - k_val`. If they match, it confirms that `t` was formed by two copies of `s` with the specified overlap.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `n` and `k_val` are found, \"YES\" and the candidate `s` are printed. If no such `n` is found after all iterations, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could have been formed by two overlapping copies of some string `s`, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
