She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The cursor starts at `pos` and we need to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r`.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (if there are unclosed tabs in that direction) one step per second.\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (one operation per second).\n\n After closing, the range [a, b] is updated (the remaining tabs). However, note that the problem does not require simulating the closure but rather to plan the minimal seconds.\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n Since we are only concerned with the segment [l, r], we must close:\n   - All tabs with indices < l (to the left)\n   - All tabs with indices > r (to the right)\n\n The cursor starts at `pos`. We have two directions to move: left and right.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the current set of tabs is already only [l, r] (i.e., l == 1 and r == n? Actually, no: initially we have [1, n]. But note: the condition for leaving only [l, r] is that we must close everything outside [l, r]. So if the initial state is [1, n] and we want [l, r], then we must close [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n However, note: the problem states that we leave only the tabs from l to r. So if the current set of tabs is [1, n] and we want [l, r], then we must remove the tabs not in [l, r].\n\n We have two ways to remove:\n   - Close left: removes all tabs from the current leftmost tab (which initially is 1) to the cursor's left (so if we are at a position i, then after closing left we remove [a, i-1] where a is the current leftmost tab). Similarly, closing right removes [i+1, b] where b is the current rightmost tab.\n\n But note: the problem says that the closure operation depends on the current leftmost and rightmost tab (a and b). Initially, a=1 and b=n.\n\n However, after some closures, the leftmost tab might be greater than 1 and the rightmost less than n.\n\n Important: We are allowed to close the left part from the current cursor position and then the leftmost becomes the current cursor (because we close from the leftmost to i-1, so the next leftmost is i). Similarly, closing the right part sets the new rightmost to i.\n\n But note: we don't necessarily have to do all closures from one side first. We can interleave moves and closures.\n\n However, the problem is symmetric and we can think of the process as:\n\n Option 1: \n   - First, we move the cursor to l (if necessary) and then close the left part (if any).\n   - Then, we move the cursor to r (if necessary) and then close the right part (if any).\n\n But wait, we can also close from both sides simultaneously by moving the cursor to the boundaries and then closing in one go.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Case 1: If the entire range [1, n] is already within [l, r] (i.e., l==1 and r==n), then we do nothing -> 0 seconds.\n\n   Otherwise, we have two parts to close: left (if l>1) and right (if r<n).\n\n   We can choose to close the left part first or the right part first, or even do both from the same side (but typically we would move to the boundary and then close).\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let left_to_close = (l > 1)   -> we need to close [1, l-1]\n   Let right_to_close = (r < n)  -> we need to close [r+1, n]\n\n   Now, we have two independent actions (closing left and closing right) but they require the cursor to be at the boundary (l for left closure, r for right closure) respectively.\n\n   However, note: we can do the following:\n\n   Option A: \n      - Move the cursor to l (if it isn't already there) and then close the left part (if needed). Then, if the right part is needed, move the cursor to r (from l) and then close the right part.\n\n   Option B:\n      - Move the cursor to r and then close the right part, then move to l and close the left part.\n\n   But note: we might not need to close one of the sides. For example, if l==1, then we don't need to close the left. Similarly, if r==n, then we don't need to close the right.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves analyzing the initial and target states of the tabs and determining the most efficient sequence of operations to achieve the desired state.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that Luba can either move the cursor left or right one tab per second or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor in one second. The goal is to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking if any tabs need to be closed on the left or right of the segment [l, r]. If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), the answer is 0. Otherwise, we consider two scenarios:\n   - **Left Closure Needed**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, Luba must move the cursor to `l` and then close the left part.\n   - **Right Closure Needed**: If there are tabs to the right of `r`, Luba must move the cursor to `r` and then close the right part.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm calculates the minimum time required by considering the distance the cursor needs to move to reach the boundaries (l or r) and the time taken to close the tabs once the boundaries are reached. The total time is the sum of movement time and closure operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_needed = (l > 1)\n    right_needed = (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_needed and not right_needed:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    time = 0\n    \n    if left_needed:\n        time += abs(pos - l)\n        time += 1  # for closing left\n        \n    if right_needed:\n        time += abs(pos - r)\n        time += 1  # for closing right\n        \n    print(time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs (i.e., l == 1 and r == n), no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Closure Requirements**: Determine if tabs need to be closed on the left (`l > 1`) or right (`r < n`).\n3. **Movement and Closure Time**: For each required closure (left or right), calculate the time taken to move the cursor to the boundary (distance from current position to `l` or `r`) and add one second for the closure operation. Sum these times for both closures if needed.\n4. **Output**: Print the total time calculated, which represents the minimum seconds required to leave only the tabs within [l, r]. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary operations and calculates the minimal time by focusing on the critical movements and closures required to achieve the desired state.",
