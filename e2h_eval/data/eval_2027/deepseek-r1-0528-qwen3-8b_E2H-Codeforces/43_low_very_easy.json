He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string only contains 'a', 'b', 'c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends 'c' so there might be no 'c'? Actually, the problem says C appends some number of 'c'. But note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (or both). However, note that the problem states that A gives a string of only 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's.\n\n But note: the example input \"aabc\" is valid. Let's break down the process:\n\n Steps:\n - The original string from A: consists of some number of 'a's (at least one).\n - Then B appends some number of 'b's (at least one? The problem says \"some number\", but the note says at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist. So after B, we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some number of 'c's (could be zero? but then the condition on C would require that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. If zero, then the condition would require that the number of 'a' is zero or the number of 'b' is zero, which contradicts because we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, C must append at least one 'c'? Actually, the condition says \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\". Since the number of 'a' and 'b' are positive, the appended 'c' must be positive. So the string must contain at least one 'c'? Actually, let me check: \n\n However, note: the problem does not say that the entire string must have at least one 'c'. It says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", meaning non-negative? But then if C appends zero, then the condition requires that 0 = (# of 'a') OR 0 = (# of 'b'), but (# of 'a')>=1 and (# of 'b')>=1, so zero doesn't satisfy. Hence, C must append at least one 'c'. Therefore, the string must end with at least one 'c'.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". Note: the string at the time of C appending is the one after B has appended. So the string that C sees has:\n   count_a = (original a's) \n   count_b = (appended by B)\n\n Then C appends n_c such that n_c = count_a OR n_c = count_b.\n\n However, note: the entire string after C is appended has:\n   total_c = n_c\n\n And the condition is that n_c must be either count_a (from the string before C) or count_b (from the string before C).\n\n But note: the string before C is the one after B. In that string, the counts are:\n   count_a = (number of 'a' in the whole string? Actually, no: the string after B is the same as the original string from A (which is all 'a's) plus the appended 'b's. So the 'a's are the same as in the final string (because C only appends 'c').\n\n Therefore, the entire string must have:\n   count_a = (number of 'a' in S)\n   count_b = (number of 'b' in S)\n   count_c = (number of 'c' in S)\n\n And we must have: count_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b.\n\n Additionally, the order must be correct: \n   All the 'a's must come first (from A), then the 'b's (from B), then the 'c's (from C). \n\n But note: what if there's an 'a' after a 'b'? Then it's invalid. Similarly, an 'b' after a 'c'? Or an 'a' after a 'c'? \n\n Actually, the process is:\n   Start with a string of 'a's -> then append 'b's -> then append 'c's.\n\n Therefore, the string should be in non-decreasing order of the characters? Actually, the characters are only 'a','b','c' and they are distinct. The condition is that the string must be split into three segments: [a's], [b's], [c's] and the entire string must be the concatenation of these three.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b'",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The key insight is that the string must consist of three contiguous segments: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, and finally all 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's appended by C must either match the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Contiguous Segments**: The string must be divided into three parts where the first part consists only of 'a's, the second part only of 'b's, and the third part only of 'c's. Any character out of order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'b' after a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the occurrences of each character ('a', 'b', 'c').\n3. **Validate Appended 'c's**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If both conditions are satisfied, it's still valid since the problem allows for the possibility that both counts could be equal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    if 'b' in s and 'c' in s:\n        pos_b = s.find('b')\n        pos_c = s.find('c')\n        if pos_c < pos_b:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n        if 'a' not in s[:pos_b] or 'b' not in s[pos_b:] or 'c' not in s[pos_c:]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Contiguous Segments Check**: The code first checks if the string contains both 'b' and 'c'. It then verifies that all 'a's come before any 'b's and all 'b's come before any 'c's. This ensures the string is structured as required.\n2. **Character Count Validation**: The code counts the occurrences of each character. If there are no 'c's, the string is immediately deemed invalid because C must append at least one 'c'.\n3. **Condition Check for 'c's**: The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural integrity of the string and the numerical constraints imposed by the problem, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
