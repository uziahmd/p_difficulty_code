Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of files n and a list of file sizes.\n We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) such that there exists a moment during the copying process where both progress bars show the same integer.\n\n The first progress bar (current file) at byte x of file i: floor(100 * x / a_i)\n The second progress bar (overall) after copying x bytes of the current file (and all previous files completely): \n     total_so_far = (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{i-1} + x)\n     overall_progress = floor(100 * total_so_far / total)\n\n However, note that the second progress bar uses the entire sum (a1+...+an). Let total = sum(a_i for i=1..n)\n\n Important: The copying is sequential. We are updating after each byte.\n\n Observation:\n We are only concerned with the values that appear on both progress bars at the same time.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the total size = sum(a_i) and the cumulative sums of the files as we go.\n\n 2. We can simulate the copying process by iterating over each file and then within a file, iterate over the bytes? \n    But note: the problem says that the progress bars update after each byte, and the numbers are integers (floor of 100*x/a_i).\n\n 3. However, note: the total number of bytes to copy is at most 100 * 100 (since n<=100 and each a_i <=1000, so total <= 100000). \n    But 100000 is acceptable for simulation if we do it naively? However, worst-case 100 files of 1000 bytes -> 100000 bytes, and we have to check for each byte the two progress bars.\n\n 4. But note: we are only required to output the distinct integers from 0 to 100 that appear simultaneously.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can think: for a given percentage p (from 0 to 100), we want to know if there exists an index i (file) and a byte count x (0<=x<=a_i) such that:\n      Condition 1: floor(100*x/a_i) = p   =>  p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1   =>  ceil((p * a_i)/100) <= x <= floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)  [But note: floor(100*x/a_i)=p means x must be in [ceil(p * a_i / 100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100)]? Actually, the condition is:\n          p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n        =>  (p * a_i)/100 <= x < ((p+1)*a_i)/100\n\n    However, note: since x is integer, we require:\n          x_min = ceil(p * a_i / 100.0)   but wait: actually, the smallest x such that floor(100*x/a_i) >= p is when x >= ceil((p * a_i)/100) ? Not exactly.\n\n    Actually, the condition for the first bar is:\n        p = floor(100*x/a_i)\n        => x must satisfy: \n            (p * a_i) / 100 <= x < (p+1)*a_i/100\n\n        Since x is integer, we can define:\n            low_bound1 = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   [but note: if (p*a_i) is divisible by 100, then x must be at least (p*a_i)//100, but also note that if (p*a_i)/100 is not integer, then ceil gives the next integer. However, we can use:]\n\n        Actually, the condition is equivalent to:\n            x_min = max(0, ceil((p * a_i) / 100))   but wait, let me reframe:\n\n        We require: 100*x >= p * a_i   and  100*x < (p+1)*a_i\n\n        So x must be in [ceil((p * a_i)/100), floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)]? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [because ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b, but here we are dividing by 100?] Actually, for positive numbers, ceil(q) = (q + denominator - 1) // denominator? Not exactly.\n\n        But note: we have two conditions:\n            x >= (p * a_i + 99) // 100   ? Let's test: if p*a_i is divisible by 100, then (p*a_i+99)//100 = (p*a_i)//100 + (99)//100? No, because if p*a_i = 100*k, then (100*k +99)//100 = k + (99)//100 -> k (if we use integer division). Actually, we can compute:\n\n        Let me define:\n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [this gives the ceiling of (p * a_i)/100]?\n            Example: p=0, a_i=100 -> 0+99//100 = 0; p=1, a_i=100 -> 100+99=199//100=1 -> correct for p=1: minimum x is 1.\n            But wait: for p=0, the condition is x>=0, so we don't need to set a lower bound beyond 0.\n\n        However, note: we can also use real numbers and then convert to integers, but we have to be careful.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n            x_min = (p * a_i) / 100.0\n            Then x_min_int = ceil(x_min) if x_min is not integer, but if x_min is integer then x_min is allowed.\n\n        But note: the condition is 100*x >= p * a_i. So the minimal integer x is ceil((p * a_i) / 100). However, if (p * a_i) is divisible by 100, then x_min = (p * a_i)//100 is enough.\n\n        Actually, the minimal x for the first condition is: x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [because (p*a_i + 99)//100 is the ceiling of (p*a_i)/100]\n\n        Similarly, the maximal x for the first condition is: floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) but note: the condition is 100*x < (p+1)*a_i, so x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)? Actually, we can use:\n\n            x_max = ((p+1) * a_i - 1) // 100   [because we require x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - epsilon) = ((p+1)*a_i - 1)//100 ]\n\n        However, note: if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i/100 is an integer, and the condition requires x < that integer, so x_max = (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        But wait, the condition is strict: 100*x < (p+1)*a_i, so x < (p+1)*a_i/100. Therefore, the maximum x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) which is the same as (p+1)*a_i//100 if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100? Actually, no.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n            x_min = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)\n            x_max = floor((p+1)*a_i / 100 - 1e-10)\n\n        But we are dealing with integers, so we can use integer arithmetic.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100   # but wait, if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then floor((p+1)*a_i/100) is (p+1)*a_i//100, but our condition requires strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100, so the maximum x should be (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        However, note: \n            Condition: 100*x < (p+1)*a_i   <=> x < (p+1)*a_i/100.\n\n        In integer x, the maximum x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i//100 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0? Actually, no: if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i/100 is integer, and the condition requires x <= (p+1)*a_i/100 - 1.\n\n        So we can write:\n            x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0 else (p+1)*a_i // 100\n\n        But wait, if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then (p+1)*a_i//100 is the integer value. Then the condition requires x < (p+1)*a_i//100, so x_max = (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n            x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0 else (p+1)*a_i // 100\n\n        However, there is an easier way: \n            x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0 else (p+1)*a_i // 100\n\n        But note: the condition 100*x < (p+1)*a_i is equivalent to x < (p+1)*a_i/100. The integer x must be strictly less than (p+1)*a_i/100. So:\n\n            x_max = min(a_i, (p+1)*a_i // 100)   ??? Not exactly.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n            x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100   # but then if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0, then x_max would be the value that makes 100*x = (p+1)*a_i, which is not allowed. So we subtract one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the modulus by:\n\n            x_max = (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0 else (p+1)*a_i // 100\n\n        But note: the condition does not require x to be less than a_i? Actually, x cannot exceed a_i. So we must also consider:\n\n            x_min = max(0, (p * a_i + 99) // 100)\n            x_max = min(a_i, (p+1)*a_i // 100 - 1 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0 else (p+1)*a_i // 100)\n\n        However, note that the overall progress bar depends on the entire process. We cannot check per file independently.\n\n 6. Alternate approach:\n\n    Instead of checking for each p (from 0 to 100) and then each file, we can simulate the entire process and record all the pairs (p1, p2) that occur.\n\n    Since the total number of bytes is at most 100000, and 100000 is acceptable for a loop in Python (if we do 100000 iterations, that's acceptable), we can simulate.\n\n    Steps for simulation:\n\n        total = sum(a)\n        # We'll keep a set of all percentages that we've seen for the second progress bar? But note: we are only interested in the moments when both are the same.\n\n        However, we can record for each byte copied, the two progress bars: \n            current_file_index i, and the current byte count in this file x (from 0 to a_i) and the overall byte count = (sum of all previous files) + x.\n\n        Then we compute:\n            p1 = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n            p2 = floor(100 * (prefix_sum[i] + x) / total)   [where prefix_sum[i] = sum(a_0 to a_{i-1})]\n\n        But note: the second progress bar uses the entire total, and we are copying sequentially. The moment we are at is after x bytes of the i-th file.\n\n        We are to collect all p (from 0 to 100) for which there exists some x and i such that p1 == p2 == p.\n\n        However, we must note: the same p might appear multiple times, but we only need to record that it appears at least once.\n\n        How to simulate:\n\n            We have list a = [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}]\n            total = sum(a)\n\n            prefix = [0]\n            for i in range(n):\n                prefix.append(prefix[-1] + a[i])\n\n            Then for i in range(n):   # current file index\n                for x in range(1, a[i]+1):   # x from 1 to a[i] (we start from 0, but at 0 both are 0, so we can include 0 or start from 1? But note: the problem starts at 0. However, at the beginning of the file, x=0: then p1=0, and p2 = floor(100*(prefix[i])/total) which might be non-zero if prefix[i] is positive. But note: the example input: \n                    Input: \"1\\n6\" -> Output: \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\"\n\n                However, note the problem says: \"after each byte\", so we start from 0 and then update after each byte. The initial state is 0. But the problem states: \"В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают 0 процентов.\" So we must include 0.\n\n                But note: the example output includes 0.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Let S be a set of all percentages that we see.\n\n                    We consider the initial state (before any byte) which gives 0 for both.\n\n                    Then for each file i (from 0 to n-1) and for each x from 0 to a_i (including 0) we can compute:\n\n                        p1 = (100 * x) // a_i   [if x=0, then 0, then floor(0)=0]\n\n                        total_bytes = prefix[i] + x\n                        p2 = (100 * total_bytes) // total\n\n                    Then if p1 == p2, then we add p1 (which is p2) to a set.\n\n                However, note: the second progress bar uses the entire total, and the current file is the i-th, so the overall progress is based on (prefix[i] + x) and total.\n\n                But wait: the problem states the second progress bar as: floor( (100 * (a1+a2+...+a_{i-1}+x)) / total )\n                Our prefix[i] is the sum of the first i files (a0 to a_{i-1]), so the current file is the i-th (0-indexed) and we have already copied prefix[i] from previous files and x from the current.\n\n                So the above formula is correct.\n\n            However, the range of x: for the i-th file, we have x from 0 to a_i (inclusive). But note: the problem says \"after each byte\", so we update after each byte. The initial state (x=0) is included.\n\n            But note: the second progress bar at the beginning of the file (x=0) is floor(100 * prefix[i] / total). This is the same as the end of the previous file.\n\n            However, the same percentage might be achieved multiple times, but we only care if it appears at least once.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"exists a moment\", so we don't need to worry about duplicates.\n\n            However, the total number of states is (number_of_files * (max_file_size+1)) <= 100 * 1001 = 100100, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: what about the fact that the second progress bar might jump over the same percentage multiple times? Actually, we are only concerned with the integer value at the moment.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the same percentage might appear in different files and at different overall positions, but we just need to know if it appears at least once.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read n\n            Read list a of n integers.\n\n            total = sum(a)\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            # We'll iterate for each file i from 0 to n-1, and for each x from 0 to a[i] (inclusive)\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                file_size = a[i]\n                # The current file is the i-th (0-indexed) and we have already copied prefix[i] bytes from the previous files.\n                for x in range(0, file_size+1):\n                    # Current file progress\n                    p1 = (100 * x) // file_size\n                    # Overall progress: we have total_bytes = prefix[i] + x\n                    total_bytes = prefix[i] + x\n                    p2 = (100 * total_bytes) // total\n\n                    if p1 == p2:\n                        # We found a moment where the percentage is p1 (or p2)\n                        seen.add(p1)\n\n            # But note: we must consider that the same percentage might be achieved at multiple points, but we are using a set.\n\n            # Now, we need to output all integers from 0 to 100 that are in the set, in increasing order.\n\n            result = sorted(seen)\n\n            However, wait: is it possible that the same percentage is achieved but we missed it? Also, note: the second progress bar might jump over a percentage without hitting it at the same time as the first?\n\n            But note: we are simulating every byte. So we are covering every moment.\n\n            But wait: what about the fact that the second progress bar might change without the first? We are only checking at the exact moments (each byte). That's correct.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"after each byte\", so we are doing the right thing.\n\n            But let's test with the first example: \n                Input: \"1\\n6\"\n\n                n=1, a=[6], total=6, prefix[0]=0, prefix[1]=6.\n\n                We iterate i=0, file_size=6, x from 0 to 6.\n\n                x=0: p1=0, total_bytes=0, p2=0 -> add 0.\n                x=1: p1 = 100*1//6 = 16, total_bytes=1, p2=100//6 = 16 -> add 16.\n                x=2: p1 = 200//6=33, total_bytes=2, p2=200//6=33 -> add 33.\n                x=3: p1=300//6=50, total_bytes=3, p2=300//6=50 -> add 50.\n                x=4: p1=400//6=66, total_bytes=4, p2=400//6=66 -> add 66.\n                x=5: p1=500//6=83, total_bytes=5, p2=500//6=83 -> add 83.\n                x=6: p1=600//6=100, total_bytes=6, p2=600//6=100 -> add 100.\n\n                Then we output: 0,16,33,50,66,83,100 -> matches the example.\n\n            Second example: \"2\\n100 500\"\n                total = 600\n                prefix = [0,100,600]\n\n                First file (100 bytes):\n                    x from 0 to 100:\n                    x=0: p1=0, p2=0 -> add 0.\n                    x=1: p1=1, p2=(100*1)//600=0 -> not equal.\n                    x=2: p1=2, p2=0\n                    ...\n                    x=6: p1=6, p2=1 -> not equal until x=6: p1=6, p2=1 -> not.\n                    Actually, note: p2 = (100 * (0+x))//600. It becomes 1 when x>=6 (since 6/600*100 = 1). But p1= floor(100*x/100)=x. So we get:\n                        x=6: p1=6, p2=1 -> skip.\n                        x=7: p1=7, p2=1 -> skip.\n                        ... until x=60: p1=60, p2= (60*100)//600 = 10 -> skip.\n\n                    Actually, the first file will only match 0 and 100? Because when x=100, p1=100, p2= (100*100)//600 = 16 -> no.\n\n                    Wait, let me recalc: \n                        x=0: (0,0) -> 0\n                        x=100: p1=100, p2= (100*100)//600 = 16 -> not 100.\n\n                    Then we move to the second file.\n\n                    Second file: 500 bytes, starting with prefix[1]=100, so total_bytes=100+x, and total=600.\n\n                    We require: p1 = (100*x)//500, and p2 = (100*(100+x))//600.\n\n                    We need to check for x from 0 to 500.\n\n                    Note: the example output is: 0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100\n\n                    So the expected set: {0,95,96,97,98,99,100}\n\n                    How do we get 95-100?\n\n                    At the very end: x=500, then p1= (100*500)//500=100, p2=(100*(100+500))//600= (60000)//600=100 -> add 100.\n\n                    But how do we get 95,96,...,99?\n\n                    Let me check the last part of the second file:\n\n                    We are in the second file, so x from 0 to 500.\n\n                    We require: (100*x)//500 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n                    Let me denote: \n                        p = (100*x)//500 = (x)//5   [because 100*x//500 = x//5?

Let me compute: 100*x = 2*x * 50, then 2*x *50 /500 = 2*x/10 -> so yes, p1 = (2*x)//10? But wait, integer division: (100*x)//500 = (x*100)//500 = (x*2)//10.\n\n                    But note: (100*x)//500 is the same as (2*x)//10 only when 100*x is divisible by 500? Actually, no, because (100*x)//500 = (2*x)//10 is true because 100*x / 500 = (2*x)/10, and integer floor division.\n\n                    However, we can write: p1 = (100*x)//500 = (2*x)//10\n\n                    Now, the second progress bar: p2 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n                    We require: (2*x)//10 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n                    Let me set k = (2*x)//10, then k is an integer and 0<=k<=100 (for x from 0 to 500, k from 0 to 100).\n\n                    Now, we want k such that there exists an integer x (0<=x<=500) satisfying:\n                        k = (2*x)//10   =>  5*k <= 2*x < 5*k+5   =>  x_min = ceil(5*k/2) and x_max = floor((5*k+4)/2)   [actually, from the definition of floor division: (2*x)//10 = k <=> 10*k <= 2*x < 10*k+10  => 5*k <= x < 5*k+5.\n\n                    And also: k = (100*(100+x))//600   =>  600*k <= 100*(100+x) < 600*k+100\n                    => 6*k <= 100+x < 6*k+1   [divided by 100?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages (from 0 to 100) that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the sequential copying of files. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second progress bar shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves simulating the copying process byte by byte for each file. For each byte copied in a file, we calculate the current file's progress percentage and the overall progress percentage. If these two percentages match at any point, we note that percentage.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each file and each byte within the file, we can compute the two progress percentages at every step. This brute-force approach is feasible because the maximum number of bytes (100 files * 1000 bytes each) is 100,000, which is manageable for modern computing.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Reading the input values (number of files and their sizes).\n   - Calculating the total size of all files.\n   - Using a prefix sum array to keep track of the cumulative size of files processed so far.\n   - Iterating through each file and each byte within the file, computing both progress percentages, and recording any matching percentages.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n * max_file_size) time, where n is the number of files and max_file_size is the largest file size (up to 1000). With n ≤ 100 and max_file_size ≤ 1000, the worst-case scenario involves 100,000 iterations, which is efficient enough for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(a)\n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    seen = set()\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        file_size = a[i]\n        for x in range(0, file_size + 1):\n            p1 = (100 * x) // file_size\n            total_bytes = prefix[i] + x\n            p2 = (100 * total_bytes) // total\n            if p1 == p2:\n                seen.add(p1)\n                \n    result = sorted(seen)\n    print('\\n'.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array is constructed to store cumulative file sizes, facilitating quick calculation of the overall progress percentage.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each file, the code iterates over each byte (from 0 to the file's size). For each byte, it calculates the current file's progress percentage (`p1`) and the overall progress percentage (`p2`). If these percentages match, the value is added to a set to avoid duplicates.\n4. **Output**: The unique percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible points during the copying process where both progress bars might show the same percentage, leveraging straightforward arithmetic and iteration to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
