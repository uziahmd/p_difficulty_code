Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We need to assign each digit in A (from left to right) to either Homer (H) or Marge (M) for exactly n moves each.\n The catch: In the end, the first player (Homer) gets S1 (the number formed by his digits) and the second (Marge) gets S2 (the number formed by her digits). \n But note: the total prize is S1 (dollars) + S2 (dollars). However, the problem says that the first player gets S1 and the second gets S2.\n\n However, note that the game is played by taking the leftmost digit and appending it to their own number. So the entire process is fixed: \n The first move is the first digit, then the second, etc. The numbers S1 and S2 are built by concatenating the digits in the order they are taken, but note: \n Since we are removing the leftmost, the next digit is appended without any reversal. \n\n But wait: if we assign the first digit to H, then S1 becomes that digit, and then the next digit we assign to H will be appended to form a two-digit number, etc.\n\n However, the problem does not require us to compute the actual total prize, but to output a sequence of 2n characters (each either 'H' or 'M') that gives the maximum total prize.\n\n How to think?\n The total prize is the sum of two numbers: one from Homer's digits and one from Marge's digits.\n\n But note: the digits are taken from the left of A in order. However, the assignment of which player takes which digit matters because the digits contribute differently to the final numbers.\n\n Specifically, if we let:\n   Let the entire sequence of moves be represented by a string of length 2n (each char either 'H' or 'M').\n   Then, for the i-th digit (0-indexed) we assign it to a player, say P_i.\n\n Then, the number for Homer (S1) is formed by the digits at positions i where P_i is 'H', in the order of increasing index (i.e., the first time Homer moves, then the second, etc.). Similarly for Marge.\n\n However, note that the entire string A is being broken into two subsequences (each of length n) that are interleaved arbitrarily, but the relative order must be preserved (since we take leftmost first).\n\n But note: the process is deterministic: we remove the leftmost digit at each turn. So the assignment must assign the first digit to someone, then the next, etc.\n\n Therefore, the two numbers are built by taking the digits in the original order and splitting them into two sequences (each of length n) without changing the order.\n\n Now, the total prize is: \n   S1 = d1 * 10^(n-1) + d2 * 10^(n-2) + ... (if Homer has k moves, then the first digit assigned to him will be multiplied by 10^(k-1) and so on)\n   Similarly, S2 is built from the digits assigned to Marge.\n\n However, note: the two players take turns? Actually, no: the problem states that before each turn, they determine who makes the next move. So we can choose arbitrarily who goes first, second, third, etc.\n\n But the entire sequence must have exactly n 'H' and n 'M'.\n\n The challenge: we want to maximize S1 + S2.\n\n How do we compare two assignments?\n\n Consider: the digits are fixed, but the way they are split and the order in which they appear in S1 and S2 depends on the assignment.\n\n Example: n=1, A=\"12\"\n   Option 1: \"HH\" -> invalid (we need exactly one H and one M) -> actually, we must have one H and one M.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: each player should make exactly n moves. So for n=1, we have two moves: one for each.\n\n   Possibilities: \n      \"HM\": \n          H takes '1', M takes '2'\n          S1 = 1, S2 = 2, total = 3.\n\n      \"MH\":\n          H takes '2', M takes '1'\n          S1 = 2, S2 = 1, total = 3.\n\n   So both are same.\n\n   Another example: n=2, A=\"9911\"\n\n   Possibilities:\n      Option 1: HHMM\n        Then: \n          First two digits to H: so H gets \"99\", M gets \"11\". \n          S1 = 99, S2 = 11, total = 110.\n\n      Option 2: HMHM\n        Then: \n          H takes first: '9', then M takes '9', then H takes '1', then M takes '1'.\n          S1 = 91, S2 = 91, total = 182.\n\n      Option 3: HM HM: same as above.\n\n      Option 4: Hmm... actually, we must have two H and two M. So the other possibilities are:\n          HMMH: \n            H: first and last -> digits at pos0 and pos3: '9' and '1' -> 91\n            M: pos1 and pos2: '9' and '1' -> 91, same as above.\n\n      But wait, what if we break it as:\n          H: first and third: '9','1' -> 91\n          M: second and fourth: '9','1' -> 91\n\n      So all interleavings that assign the two non-overlapping pairs to the two players arbitrarily? Actually, note that the assignment must be in the order of the digits.\n\n      However, note: the example input says for A='9911' the output is 'HMHM'. \n\n      Why is the example output 'HMHM'? Because it is one of the solutions that maximizes the total prize.\n\n      But wait, our calculation for 'HHMM' gives 99+11 = 110, and for 'HMHM' gives 91+91=182, which is larger.\n\n      So we want the assignment that maximizes the total.\n\n How do we solve this?\n\n We have 2n digits. We need to assign each to either H or M, with n for each.\n\n The total prize is:\n   Let the assignment be represented by an array X[0..2n-1] of characters.\n\n   Then, the number for H is built from the digits at positions i where X[i]=='H', in increasing order of i.\n   Similarly for M.\n\n   The value of the number for H is: \n        d_{i1} * 10^(n-1) + d_{i2} * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_{ik} * 10^(n-k)\n\n   But note: the exponents depend on the position of the digit in Homer's own sequence. The first digit he takes becomes the most significant, then the next, etc.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n   The entire assignment splits the digits (from left to right) into two sequences (H-seq and M-seq) of length n.\n\n   Then, the value for H is: \n        S1 = d_{j1} * 10^(n-1) + d_{j2} * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_{jn} * 10^0\n\n   Similarly for M.\n\n   Therefore, the total prize is: \n        S1 + S2 = [d_{j1}*10^(n-1) + d_{j2}*10^(n-2) + ... + d_{jn}*10^0] + [d_{k1}*10^(n-1) + d_{k2}*10^(n-2) + ... + d_{kn}*10^0]\n\n   We can also write this as:\n        = (d_{j1} + d_{k1}) * 10^(n-1) + (d_{j2} + d_{k2}) * 10^(n-2) + ... + (d_{jn} + d_{kn}) * 10^0\n\n   But note: the indices j and k are the indices in the original string, and the two sequences are interleaved arbitrarily.\n\n   However, observe: the two sequences are built from the same set of digits, but in the order of appearance. The digit at the very beginning (first digit) is the most significant for whichever player took it.\n\n   This means that the digit at position 0 (the first digit) must be assigned to a player, and if assigned to H, then it will be multiplied by 10^(n-1) in S1, and similarly if assigned to M, then 10^(n-1) in S2.\n\n   But note: the second digit is the next most significant? Actually, no: the second digit is the next one in the sequence, but if a player takes two consecutive digits, then the first one is more significant than the second.\n\n   However, consider: the entire number for H is built from the digits that H takes, and they are placed in the order of the original string. Similarly for M.\n\n   But here's the catch: the assignment must be such that the two players take turns? Actually, no: the problem says that before each turn they determine who goes next. So we can assign arbitrarily, but the digits are taken from left to right.\n\n   How to maximize the total?\n\n   We have 2n digits. We need to assign each to H or M, and we have to use each exactly n times.\n\n   We can think of the problem as: we are going to assign each digit to one of the two players, and the digit at position i will be multiplied by 10^(n - (the rank of i in the sequence of the same player)).\n\n   However, the rank of a digit for a player is determined by the order of the digits they take: the first digit they take is the most significant (exponent n-1), the second is n-2, etc.\n\n   But note: the entire assignment must be done in the order of the digits. We cannot change the order.\n\n   We can use dynamic programming? But 2n up to 36, and n up to 18, so 2n=36. The state space is (position, count_H_so_far, count_M_so_far) but that is 2n * (n+1) * (n+1) which is 36*19*19 ~ 12600 states, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we don't just want the maximum total, we want the sequence of moves (a string of length 2n of 'H' and 'M') that achieves the maximum.\n\n   But note: the total prize is the sum of two numbers. Each number is built from the digits assigned to that player, and the digits are taken in the original order.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the total prize is independent of the assignment order? Actually, no: the same digit might be used in different places (as more significant or less significant) depending on when it is taken.\n\n   However, note: the assignment must assign the digits in the given order (left to right). And the significance of a digit for a player depends on how many digits that player has already taken. \n\n   Specifically, if a player has taken k digits so far, then the next digit they take will be the (k+1)-th digit, so it will be multiplied by 10^(n - (k+1)).\n\n   But note: the entire assignment must use exactly n moves per player.\n\n   We can use DP that tracks:\n     pos: the current index (from 0 to 2n)\n     h_count: the number of moves made by H so far (0 to n)\n     m_count: the number of moves made by M so far (0 to n)\n\n   Then the state is (pos, h_count, m_count). The value we want to maximize is the total prize.\n\n   How do we calculate the contribution of a digit?\n   If at state (pos, h_count, m_count) we assign the current digit (at pos) to H, then:\n     The current digit will be the (h_count+1)-th digit for H. So its weight is 10^(n - (h_count))? \n\n   But wait, the total number of digits assigned to H is going to be n. The first digit assigned to H is the most significant (multiplied by 10^(n-1)), the second by 10^(n-2)), ..., the last by 10^0.\n\n   So if we assign the current digit to H, then we have already assigned h_count digits to H, so this digit will be the (h_count)-th digit (if we count from 0) and will be multiplied by 10^(n - h_count - 1) ? \n\n   Actually, the exponent decreases by one for each subsequent digit. The first digit assigned to H (when h_count=0) is multiplied by 10^(n-1). The second (h_count=1) by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n   Therefore, the digit d at position pos, if assigned to H, will contribute: d * (10^(n - h_count - 1))\n\n   Similarly, if assigned to M, then it contributes: d * (10^(n - m_count - 1))\n\n   Then, we can design a DP:\n\n   dp[pos][h_count][m_count] = the maximum total prize (S1+S2) we can achieve from the remaining part (from pos to the end) given that H has made h_count moves and M has made m_count moves.\n\n   Then, we have two options at each step (if we haven't exceeded n for either):\n\n   Option 1: Assign to H\n        If h_count < n:\n            contribution = int(A[pos]) * (10 ** (n - h_count - 1))\n            new_state = dp[pos+1][h_count+1][m_count] + contribution\n\n   Option 2: Assign to M\n        If m_count < n:\n            contribution = int(A[pos]) * (10 ** (n - m_count - 1))\n            new_state = dp[pos+1][h_count][m_count+1] + contribution\n\n   But wait, is that correct?\n\n   Let me test with n=1, A=\"12\":\n\n   Start: pos=0, h_count=0, m_count=0.\n\n   Option1: assign '1' to H -> contribution = 1 * (10 ** (1-0-1)) = 1 * (10**0)=1.\n        Then we go to state (1,1,0): then at pos=1, we must assign to M (because we need one M and we have none).\n        Then for M: contribution = 2 * (10**(1-0-1)) = 2 * 1 = 2.\n        Total = 1+2 = 3.\n\n   Option2: assign '1' to M -> contribution = 1 * 1 = 1.\n        Then state (1,0,1): then assign to H: 2 * (10**(1-0-1)) = 2 * 1 = 2, total=3.\n\n   So the DP would work.\n\n   However, the base case: when pos==2n, then we have assigned all digits, and we require that h_count==n and m_count==n, otherwise the state is invalid? Actually, we can only reach the base case when h_count==n and m_count==n.\n\n   But note: the total moves must be 2n, and we have exactly n for each. So the base state is (2n, n, n) and then we return 0.\n\n   However, the state (2n, h_count, m_count) must have h_count+n+m_count=2n? Actually, we are tracking h_count and m_count separately, and the total moves is h_count+m_count. We start at 0 and go to 2n. We require that at the base state, h_count==n and m_count==n.\n\n   We can set: \n        if pos == 2*n: \n            if h_count == n and m_count == n: return 0\n            else: return -infinity (or a very small number) to indicate invalid.\n\n   But note: we are building the entire assignment, so we must use all digits.\n\n   However, there is a problem: the exponent for a digit depends on the count at the moment of assignment, but note that the same digit might be assigned later and then the exponent changes? \n\n   Actually, no: the exponent for a digit is determined by the count of moves the player has made at the time of assignment. For example, if H has already taken k digits, then the next digit for H will be the (k+1)-th, so its place value is 10^(n - (k+1)).\n\n   But wait, the same digit cannot be assigned twice. And the entire sequence is fixed.\n\n   However, the above DP formulation is correct, but the exponent is computed as if the entire sequence is known. But note: we are processing from left to right, and the remaining digits are not yet processed. \n\n   The issue: the DP state does not know about the future, but the exponent we use is based on the current count. That is correct because the assignment of a digit to a player at this step will fix its place value: it will be the (count+1)-th digit for that player, and the rest of the digits for that player will be assigned in the remaining part and will have lower exponents.\n\n   But note: the same digit is being assigned now, and the rest of the digits for that player will be assigned later. However, the total number of digits for that player is fixed (n). Therefore, the first digit assigned to H (at the first occurrence) must be multiplied by 10^(n-1) regardless of what happens later? \n\n   Actually, no: if we assign a digit now to H, then it is the first digit for H only if no H has been assigned so far. But if we assign two digits to H consecutively, then the second one is the second digit for H and gets 10^(n-2). \n\n   The above DP correctly uses the current count to determine the exponent.\n\n   However, the problem: the total number of digits is 2n, and we are assigning all. The exponent for a digit assigned to H at the k-th move is 10^(n - k). But note: the k-th move for H (the k-th digit) is the one that will be placed at the (k-1)-th power (so the first digit is the most significant). \n\n   But wait: the total number of digits for H is n, so the first digit (k=0) is multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second (k=1) by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, the state space: \n        pos: 0 to 36 (2n, n<=18, so 2n<=36)\n        h_count: 0 to 18, m_count: 0 to 18.\n\n   The state space is 37 * 19 * 19 = 37 * 361 = 13357 states. And each state we do two operations (if valid). This is acceptable.\n\n   But we also need to recover the actual sequence. So we can store the choice (either 'H' or 'M') that led to the maximum value at each state.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Parse input: n and the string A (which is 2n digits)\n\n   2. Use DP with memoization (or iterative DP) to fill the table.\n\n   3. Then backtrack from state (0,0,0) to reconstruct the sequence.\n\n   However, note: the exponent calculation might be heavy because we are using powers of 10. But n is at most 18, so the exponents go up to 10^17, which is a big number, but we are storing integers and the total prize is an integer. The maximum total prize is at most 2 * (10^n - 1) * (10^n) but actually, the maximum digit is 9, and the maximum number for one player is 99...9 (n digits) so the maximum total is 2 * (10^n - 1) * (10^n) ??? Actually, no: the two numbers are added together. The maximum total is 2 * (10^n - 1) * (10^n) / 9? Not exactly, but we don't care about the magnitude for correctness, just the DP.\n\n   But note: the exponent for a digit at a given state is 10^(n - count - 1). The exponent can be as large as 10^(n-1) (for the first digit) and as small as 1 (for the last digit). We are dealing with numbers that have up to n digits (n<=18) so the total prize is at most 2 * (10^n - 1) * (10^n) / 9? Actually, the maximum number with n digits is 10^n - 1, so the maximum total is 2*(10^n - 1) (if we had two separate numbers, each being 10^n-1). But wait, that's not the case because the digits are split arbitrarily. The total prize is the sum of two numbers, each with n digits, so maximum 2*(10^n-1). \n\n   However, we are storing the total prize as an integer. The maximum total is about 2e18, which is within the range of Python integers (though we are doing exponentiation, which is also acceptable for n=18, the exponent is 10^17 which is a 18-digit number, but we are only storing two integers per state, and we have 13357 states, so memory is not an issue).\n\n   But wait: the DP state transition:\n\n        dp[pos][h_count][m_count] = max(\n            (if we can assign to H) { int(A[pos]) * (10**(n - h_count - 1)) + dp[pos+1][h_count+1][m_count] },\n            (if we can assign to M) { int(A[pos]) * (10**(n - m_count - 1)) + dp[pos+1][h_count][m_count+1] }\n        )\n\n   However, note: the exponent for a digit assigned to H at this state is 10^(n - h_count - 1). But wait: when we assign the next digit to H, the count increases by one, so the next digit (if any) will have exponent 10^(n - (h_count+1) - 1) = 10^(n - h_count - 2). \n\n   But the above formula uses the current count to determine the exponent for the current digit. That is correct.\n\n   However, there is a problem: the same digit might be considered multiple times? No, because we are processing the digits in order.\n\n   But note: the exponent is computed independently for each digit. This is correct.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n   We'll use memoization (top-down DP) to avoid recalculating.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let N = 2 * n.\n\n   Define a function dp(pos, hc, mc) that returns (best_total, move_sequence) from the current state.\n\n   But wait, we need to reconstruct the sequence, so we can store the choice (and the path) in the DP. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        dp_table[pos][hc][mc] = the maximum total prize from this state to the end.\n\n        And we store a parent pointer: what was the choice (and the next state) that led to this state.\n\n   However, since we are doing recursion, we can store:\n\n        dp_table[pos][hc][mc] = maximum total prize from this state.\n\n        And we store an array (or dictionary) that says: \n            from (pos, hc, mc) we came from which choice and which next state.\n\n   But note: we have two choices. We want to remember which one we took.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        dp_table[pos][hc][mc] = (max_value, choice) \n\n        where choice is None if this is not a valid state, or either 'H' or 'M' if we came from that choice.\n\n   Then, we backtrack.\n\n   Steps for recursion:\n\n        if pos == N:\n            if hc == n and mc == n:\n                return 0, \"\"   # empty string\n            else:\n                return -10**30, None   # invalid state\n\n        Otherwise, we consider:\n\n        option1 = None\n        option2 = None\n\n        if hc < n:\n            # assign to H\n            exp = 10**(n - hc - 1)\n            value1 = int(A[pos]) * exp + dp_table[pos+1][hc+1][mc][0]\n            # But wait, we are storing the dp_table as a memo, so we need to compute recursively.\n\n        Similarly for M.\n\n        Then, we choose the maximum between the two.\n\n        However, we need to store the entire sequence. Alternatively, we can store the dp_table and then backtrack.\n\n   But note: the problem says if there are several solutions, output any.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        dp_table = {}  # dictionary: key = (pos, hc, mc), value = (max_value, next_choice, prev_state)\n\n   However, we can use memoization and then reconstruct the sequence.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use iterative DP and store the decision at each state.\n\n   Since the state space is 37*19*19, we can iterate over pos from N down to 0, and for each hc from 0 to n, mc from 0 to n.\n\n   Steps for iterative DP:\n\n        dp = a 3D array of dimensions [N+1][n+1][n+1] (all zeros initially)\n\n        We'll set dp[N][n][n] = 0, and for states that are not (n,n) at pos=N, we set to -inf.\n\n        Then, for pos from N-1 down to 0, for hc from 0 to n, for mc from 0 to n:\n            if hc + mc != pos+1: skip? Actually, we are at pos, so we have processed pos+1 digits. But we are storing state (pos, hc, mc) meaning we have processed the first (pos) digits? Actually, we have processed from 0 to pos-1, so at state (pos, hc, mc) we are about to process the digit at pos.\n\n        Actually, we defined the state as (pos, hc, mc) meaning we have processed the first `pos` digits (so the current digit is at index pos). Then, the condition is that hc+mc == pos.\n\n        Then, we update:\n\n            dp[pos][hc][mc] = max(\n                (if hc < n) { int(A[pos]) * (10**(n-hc-1)) + dp[pos+1][hc+1][mc] },\n                (if mc < n) { int(A[pos]) * (10**(n-mc-1)) + dp[pos+1][hc][mc+1] }\n            )\n\n        But note: the exponent for the current digit (at pos) is determined by the current counts.\n\n        However, we must consider that the state (pos+1, hc+1, mc) might not have been computed? We are iterating backwards.\n\n        We need to iterate pos from high to low, and for each pos, we iterate hc from 0 to n, mc from 0 to n, but we require that hc+mc == pos (if we are storing the state after processing pos digits). \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the state as having processed the first `pos` digits, so the current digit is the pos-th (0-indexed, so the next digit to process is at index pos). Then, the counts hc and mc must satisfy hc+mc == pos.\n\n        Then, we can iterate:\n\n            for pos from N down to 0:\n                for hc from 0 to n:\n                    for mc from 0 to n:\n                        if hc+mc != pos: continue\n                        if pos == N:\n                            if hc == n and mc == n: dp[N][hc][mc] = 0\n                            else: dp[N][hc][mc] = -10**30   (invalid)\n                        else:\n                            ways = []\n                            if hc < n:\n                                exp = 10**(n - hc - 1)\n                                candidate = int(A[pos]) * exp + dp[pos+1][hc+1][mc]\n                                ways.append(candidate)\n                            if mc < n:\n                                exp = 10**(n - mc - 1)\n                                candidate = int(A[pos]) * exp + dp[pos+1][hc][mc+1]\n                                ways.append(candidate)\n                            if ways:\n                                dp[pos][hc][mc] = max(ways)\n                            else:\n                                dp[pos][hc][mc] = -10**30   (invalid)\n\n        Then, we backtrack from (0,0,0) to reconstruct the sequence.\n\n        But note: the state (0,0,0) is the initial state: we haven't processed any digit, and we have 0 for both counts.\n\n        Then, we look at the transitions:\n\n            If dp[0][0][0] was achieved by assigning the first digit to H, then the first move is 'H'. Then we go to state (1,1,0) and so on.\n\n        However, the above iterative DP requires that we store the entire 3D array for all pos from 0 to N, and for hc from 0 to n and mc from 0 to n. The memory is about 37 * 19 * 19 * (size of integer) which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the exponents 10**(n-hc-1) might be computed repeatedly. We can precompute the exponents.\n\n        Let power[i] = 10**i for i from 0 to n (but note: we need exponents from 0 to n-1).\n\n        Actually, for a given hc (from 0 to n-1) the exponent for the next H move is 10**(n-hc-1). So we can precompute:\n\n            exp_H[hc] = 10**(n - hc - 1)   for hc from 0 to n-1, and for hc>=n, we don't use.\n\n        Similarly for M.\n\n        However, note: the exponent for a digit assigned to H at a state with hc moves so far is 10**(n-hc-1). This is independent of the position. \n\n        But wait: the same digit assigned to H at a state with hc=0 will get 10^(n-1), and if we assign a digit at a later state (with the same hc) then the exponent is the same? \n\n        Actually, no: the state hc is the count of moves for H so far, and we are at a particular position. However, the exponent only depends on the count of moves for H so far, not the position. \n\n        But note: the same hc might occur at different positions, and that is okay.\n\n        However, we must note: the entire assignment must use the digits in order, and the exponent for a digit is determined by the order in which the player picks the digits. The first digit the player picks is always the most significant, the second the next, etc. So even if the player picks two digits that are separated by other digits, the order of the digits in the player's number is the order of appearance, and the exponents are fixed by the count (the k-th digit for the player is multiplied by 10^(n-k)).\n\n        Therefore, the above DP is correct.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the digit we are processing now is the (hc+mc)-th digit overall, but the exponent for the player's next digit only depends on the player's count.\n\n   But note: the two players are building two separate numbers. The entire assignment is fixed by the order of the digits, and the exponent for a digit is determined solely by the player's own count at the time of assignment.\n\n   Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Precomputation:\n            N = 2*n\n            Precompute a list `exp_table` for exponents: \n                exp_table[i] = 10**i   for i from 0 to n (we need exponents from 0 to n-1, but we can compute on the fly or precompute)\n\n            Actually, we need exponents for the next move for H and M: \n                For H: at state with hc, the exponent is exp_table[n - hc - 1] (if hc < n)\n\n        Then, set up a 3D DP array of dimensions (N+1) x (n+1) x (n+1). We can use nested loops.\n\n        Initialize:\n            dp[N][n][n] = 0\n            For all other states at pos=N, set to -10**30 (a very small number)\n\n        Then, for pos from N-1 down to 0:\n            for hc from 0 to n:\n                for mc from 0 to n:\n                    if hc + mc != pos: continue   # because we have processed `pos` digits, so hc+mc must equal pos.\n\n                    candidates = []\n                    if hc < n:\n                        exponent = 10**(n - hc - 1)   # or use precomputed exp_table[n-hc-1]\n                        value1 = int(A[pos]) * exponent + dp[pos+1][hc+1][mc]\n                        candidates.append(value1)\n                    if mc < n:\n                        exponent = 10**(n - mc - 1)\n                        value2 = int(A[pos]) * exponent + dp[pos+1][hc][mc+1]\n                        candidates.append(value2)\n\n                    if candidates:\n                        dp[pos][hc][mc] = max(candidates)\n                    else:\n                        dp[pos][hc][mc] = -10**30\n\n        Then, we backtrack from (0,0,0) to (N, n, n) to build the sequence.\n\n        How to backtrack:\n\n            current_pos = 0, current_hc = 0, current_mc = 0\n            seq = []\n\n            while current_pos < N:\n                if dp[current_pos][current_hc][current_mc] was achieved by assigning the current digit to H (if the value came from the H branch) then:\n                    seq.append('H')\n                    current_pos += 1\n                    current_hc += 1\n                elif dp[current_pos][current_hc][current_mc] was achieved by assigning to M:\n                    seq.append('M')\n                    current_pos += 1\n                    current_mc += 1\n\n            But wait: we didn't store which branch was taken. We can store a separate 3D array (or dictionary) that records the choice.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do the DP with memoization and then store the choice.\n\n        Since the state space is small, we can store:\n\n            dp_table = {} # key: (pos, hc, mc) -> (value, choice) where choice is None, 'H', or 'M'\n\n        Then, the recurrence:\n\n            dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)] = best_value, and we record whether we came from H or M.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            dp_table = {}\n            def rec(pos, hc, mc):\n                if (pos, hc, mc) in dp_table:\n                    return dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)]\n\n                if pos == N:\n                    if hc == n and mc == n:\n                        dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)] = (0, None)\n                        return (0, None)\n                    else:\n                        dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)] = (-10**30, None)\n                        return (-10**30, None)\n\n                res1 = -10**30\n                res2 = -10**30\n                if hc < n:\n                    exp1 = 10**(n-hc-1)\n                    value1 = int(A[pos]) * exp1 + rec(pos+1, hc+1, mc)[0]\n                    res1 = value1\n                if mc < n:\n                    exp2 = 10**(n-mc-1)\n                    value2 = int(A[pos]) * exp2 + rec(pos+1, hc, mc+1)[0]\n                    res2 = value2\n\n                best_val = max(res1, res2) if res1 > -10**30 and res2 > -10**30 else (res1 if res1 > -10**30 else res2)\n\n                if best_val == -10**30:\n                    # no valid move\n                    dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)] = (-10**30, None)\n                    return (-10**30, None)\n\n                if best_val == res1:\n                    dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)] = (best_val, 'H')\n                else:\n                    dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)] = (best_val, 'M')\n\n                return (best_val, 'H' if best_val == res1 else 'M')\n\n        Then, we call rec(0,0,0) and then backtrack.\n\n        But note: if both",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns selecting digits from a given number A. The players each make exactly n moves, and the goal is to determine the sequence of moves that maximizes the sum of the numbers formed by each player's selected digits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing a string of 2n digits, where each digit must be assigned to either Homer (H) or Marge (M) exactly n times. The key insight is that the value of each digit in a player's number depends on its position in their sequence. The first digit a player picks contributes the most (highest place value), and subsequent digits contribute less.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state is defined by the current position in the string, the number of moves each player has made so far. For each state, we consider assigning the current digit to either player, updating the state accordingly, and computing the maximum possible total prize from that state onward.\n3. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the initial state (0, 0, 0) to reconstruct the sequence of moves that achieves the maximum prize. At each step, we choose the move (H or M) that led to the optimal solution based on the DP values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n_line = data[0].strip()\n    n_val = int(n_line)\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    N = 2 * n_val\n    NEG_INF = -10**30\n    \n    dp_table = {}\n    \n    def rec(pos, hc, mc):\n        if pos == N:\n            if hc == n_val and mc == n_val:\n                return (0, None)\n            else:\n                return (NEG_INF, None)\n                \n        key = (pos, hc, mc)\n        if key in dp_table:\n            return dp_table[key]\n            \n        res1 = NEG_INF\n        res2 = NEG_INF\n        \n        if hc < n_val:\n            exp1 = 10**(n_val - hc - 1)\n            next_val, _ = rec(pos+1, hc+1, mc)\n            if next_val != NEG_INF:\n                candidate1 = int(A_str[pos]) * exp1 + next_val\n                res1 = candidate1\n                \n        if mc < n_val:\n            exp2 = 10**(n_val - mc - 1)\n            next_val, _ = rec(pos+1, hc, mc+1)\n            if next_val != NEG_INF:\n                candidate2 = int(A_str[pos]) * exp2 + next_val\n                res2 = candidate2\n                \n        best_val = NEG_INF\n        choice = None\n        \n        if res1 > NEG_INF and res2 > NEG_INF:\n            best_val = max(res1, res2)\n            choice = 'H' if res1 >= res2 else 'M'\n        elif res1 > NEG_INF:\n            best_val = res1\n            choice = 'H'\n        elif res2 > NEG_INF:\n            best_val = res2\n            choice = 'M'\n        else:\n            best_val = NEG_INF\n            choice = None\n            \n        dp_table[key] = (best_val, choice)\n        return (best_val, choice)\n        \n    _, first_choice = rec(0, 0, 0)\n    seq = []\n    pos, hc, mc = 0, 0, 0\n    while pos < N:\n        if dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)][1] == 'H':\n            seq.append('H')\n            pos += 1\n            hc += 1\n        elif dp_table[(pos, hc, mc)][1] == 'M':\n            seq.append('M')\n            pos += 1\n            mc += 1\n            \n    result_str = ''.join(seq)\n    print(result_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer n and a string A of 2n digits. The code reads these values from standard input.\n2. **DP Table Initialization**: A dictionary `dp_table` is used to store intermediate results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n3. **Recursive DP Function**: The function `rec` computes the maximum prize achievable from a given state (current position, moves by Homer, moves by Marge). It checks if the current state can be improved by assigning the current digit to either player and recursively computes the result for the next state.\n4. **Backtracking**: After computing the optimal solution from the initial state (0, 0, 0), the code backtracks through the DP table to construct the sequence of moves (H or M) that leads to the maximum total prize.\n5. **Output**: The constructed sequence of moves is printed as a string of 'H' and 'M' characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible move sequences using dynamic programming and backtracking to find the optimal solution without resorting to brute-force methods, which would be computationally infeasible for larger inputs.",
