Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$)Â â€” the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S (in Morse code). \n\n Important: The Morse code strings for letters are of length 1 to 4, and the invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So there are 26 valid letters, and the total valid strings (substrings) must be considered.\n\n However, note that a substring of S might represent multiple letters? Actually, each letter is represented by one fixed string. But the problem is: we are allowed to take any contiguous substring of S and interpret it as a sequence of Morse code strings (each of which must be one of the 26 valid letters). However, note:\n\n - A substring of S is a string of '0's and '1's. We are allowed to break it into consecutive valid Morse code strings (each of length 1,2,3, or 4) and the entire substring must be broken into complete letters.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\"\n\n This means: we consider every contiguous substring of S, and then we try to parse it as a concatenation of valid Morse code strings (each being one of the 26 letters). However, note that the same substring might be parsed in multiple ways? Actually, the problem counts distinct sequences (i.e., the actual letters, not the substrings). But note: the example does not count distinct substrings but distinct sequences of letters.\n\n However, the example: \n   After S = \"111\", the sequences are: \n      \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n But note: \n   \"TT\" is two T's -> \"11\" (which is the same as M) but wait, the example says:\n        \"TT\" (translates into \"11\") -> which is M. However, the example lists \"TT\" as a distinct sequence from \"T\" and \"M\", but actually the Morse code for T is \"1\", so \"TT\" is two T's, and that is a valid sequence (two T's). Similarly, \"TM\" is a sequence of T followed by M.\n\n However, note that the substring \"11\" (which is the entire S after the first two appends) can be broken as:\n        [1,1] -> [T, T] -> \"TT\"\n        [11]   -> [M]    -> \"M\"\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\"\n\n And the substring \"11\" is present and can be broken in two ways. However, the example output counts both \"TT\" and \"M\" separately.\n\n But note: the example also includes \"TTT\" (three T's) which is breaking \"111\" as [1,1,1].\n\n However, the problem does not require that the entire substring is used? Actually, the problem says \"some substring\", meaning we can take any contiguous substring and then break that substring (starting from the beginning) into valid Morse code strings (each of length 1,2,3,4) without gaps, and then the sequence of letters we get is counted.\n\n But note: the same sequence of letters might be obtained from different substrings? For example, the sequence \"TT\" can be obtained from the substring \"11\", and also from the substring \"111\" (if we break the first two ones as T and T, and ignore the last one) but wait, no: the substring must be contiguous and we cannot skip the last one if we are taking the entire substring. Actually, we are only considering contiguous substrings, and we break them from left to right.\n\n However, the problem is asking for distinct sequences (i.e., the actual letter sequences) that appear in at least one substring. But note: the example output does not say distinct by substring but distinct by sequence.\n\n But wait, look at the example: \n   Input: 3 modifications, all '1'\n   Output: 1, 3, 7\n\n Let me break down for m=3 (S=\"111\"):\n\n   After 1st: S=\"1\"\n        Substrings: \"1\" -> valid? yes, corresponds to T.\n        So sequences: [T] -> count=1.\n\n   After 2nd: S=\"11\"\n        Substrings: \n          \"1\" -> T\n          \"11\" -> M, and also the two single \"1\"s (which are T) but note: we consider contiguous substring and then break the substring arbitrarily? Actually, the problem says \"some substring\" and then breaks that substring into a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a given string S, where S is built incrementally by appending '0's (dots) or '1's (dashes). Each sequence must be formed by breaking down contiguous substrings of S into valid Morse code strings (each of length 1 to 4) that correspond to English letters. The solution involves efficiently tracking valid sequences as S grows with each modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each valid Morse code string corresponds to an English letter, and there are 26 such valid strings (excluding four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"). The challenge is to count all distinct sequences of these letters that can be formed by any contiguous substring of S, broken down into valid Morse code strings.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to form valid sequences ending at position `i` in S. This helps in efficiently updating the count as S grows.\n\n3. **Tracking Valid Sequences**: For each new character added to S, we check all possible valid Morse code strings (lengths 1 to 4) ending at the current position. If a substring matches a valid Morse code string, we update the DP array and accumulate the count of new sequences.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the counts can be very large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm processes each character in O(m) time per character, leading to an overall O(m^2) complexity, which is feasible given the constraint \\(m \\leq 3000\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    ans = []\n    total_sequences = 0\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        char = s_list[i - 1]\n        new_char_added = char\n        \n        if new_char_added == '0':\n            binary_str = '0'\n        else:\n            binary_str = '1'\n            \n        new_sequences = 0\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and len(binary_str) <= 4:\n            start_index = j - len(binary_str) + 1\n            if start_index < 0:\n                break\n            substr = ''.join(s_list[k] for k in range(start_index + 1, j + 1))\n            full_substr = substr + binary_str\n            if full_substr in [\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"]:\n                pass\n            else:\n                if start_index == 0:\n                    new_sequences = (new_sequences + 1) % MOD\n                else:\n                    prev_count = dp[start_index]\n                    new_sequences = (new_sequences + prev_count) % MOD\n            j -= 1\n        \n        dp[i] = new_sequences\n        total_sequences = (total_sequences + new_sequences) % MOD\n        ans.append(total_sequences)\n    \n    for a in ans:\n        print(a)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values and initializes necessary variables, including a dynamic programming array `dp` to keep track of valid sequences ending at each position in S.\n\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each new character added to S, the code checks all possible valid Morse code strings (lengths 1 to 4) ending at the current position. If a substring matches a valid Morse code string, it updates the count of new sequences.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: The DP array is updated based on the validity of the substring. If the substring starts at position 0, it directly contributes to the total sequences. Otherwise, it uses the count from the previous valid starting position.\n\n4. **Output**: After processing each character, the total number of distinct sequences is printed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
