And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and k, and then a list of n integers.\n We have to consider all contiguous weeks of length k (there are n-k+1 weeks).\n We are to compute the average sleep time over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n   Weeks: [3,4] -> (3+4)/2 = 3.5, [4,7] -> (4+7)/2 = 5.5\n   Then we have two weeks. The average is (3.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Wait, let's re-read the example: \n   \"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\n Actually, the example says: \n   \"the result is\" without specifying, but the provided output for that example is \"9.0000000000\".\n\n Let me check the problem statement again: \n   \"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\n But note: the example output is 9.0000000000, which is the total sum of the sleep times in the two weeks divided by the number of days? \n   Actually, wait: the two weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. The total sleep time is 3+4+4+7 = 18. Then we have two weeks, so average per week is 18/2 = 9.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"average sleeping time over all weeks\". This can be interpreted as:\n   (sum of all sleep times in all weeks) / (number of weeks)\n\n But wait, each week is k consecutive days, so the total sleep time is the sum of the entire array? Not exactly: \n   Each week is k consecutive days, and we have n-k+1 weeks. However, note that the same day might appear in multiple weeks? \n\n Actually, no: the first week is days 0 to k-1, the second is days 1 to k, etc. So the total sleep time is the sum of the array from index0 to indexk-1, then from index1 to indexk, etc.\n\n We can precompute the prefix sum to quickly get the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire set of weeks' total sleep time is:\n\n   Week 0: a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}\n   Week 1: a1 + a2 + ... + a_k\n   ...\n\n   The total sum over all weeks is: (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{k-1}) + (a1 + ... + a_k) + ... + (a_{n-k} + ... + a_{n-1})\n\n   We can also write this as: \n        = a0 + 2*a1 + 2*a2 + ... + 2*a_{k-1} + ... + (some coefficients)\n\n   Actually, the coefficient for a_i is the number of weeks that include day i.\n\n   For day i (0-indexed), it will appear in weeks starting from max(0, i - k + 1) to the week ending at min(n-k, i)? \n\n   Alternatively, note that the first occurrence of a_i is when the week starts at s such that s <= i and s+k-1 >= i, so s from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) ? \n\n   Actually, the week must be within [0, n-k] (weeks are indexed from 0 to n-k). The condition for a_i to be included in week j (which covers days j to j+k-1) is j <= i <= j+k-1, i.e., j <= i and j >= i-k+1. Since j must be between 0 and n-k (inclusive), then the number of weeks that include a_i is: \n        count_i = min(i+1, k, n-i, n-k+1-i) ? \n\n   Actually, there is a simpler way: \n        The first week that includes a_i is when j = i - k + 1 (if i-k+1 >=0) and the last week is when j = i (if i < n-k). But wait, the week j ends at j+k-1, so the condition is j <= i and j+k-1 >= i -> j <= i and j >= i-k+1. And j must be in [0, n-k].\n\n   Therefore, the smallest j is max(0, i-k+1) and the largest j is min(i, n-k). Then the count is: min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1.\n\n   However, note: the example [3,4,7] with k=2, n=3:\n        i=0: count0 = min(0, 3-2) - max(0,0-2+1) + 1 = min(0,1) - max(0,-1)+1 = 0 - (-1) ??? That doesn't make sense because negative index.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that the total sum of all weeks is the sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] * (number of weeks containing a_i).\n\n   How many weeks contain a_i?\n        The week must start at a day s such that s <= i <= s+k-1.\n        => s <= i and s >= i - k + 1.\n\n        s must be an integer in [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)].\n\n        Then the count is: L = max(0, i-k+1) and R = min(i, n-k). Then if L <= R, the count is R - L + 1, else 0.\n\n   Example for i=0: \n        L = max(0, 0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0, R = min(0, 3-2)=min(0,1)=0 -> count0 = 1.\n\n   Example for i=1:\n        L = max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0, R = min(1,1)=1 -> count1 = 2.\n\n   Example for i=2:\n        L = max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1, R = min(2,1)=1 -> count2 = 1.\n\n   Then the total sum = 3*1 + 4*2 + 7*1 = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18.\n\n   Then the average over all weeks (which are 2 in number) is 18 / 2 = 9.0.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   So we can do:\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sleep = 0\n        For i in range(n):\n            count_i = max(0, min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1)\n            Then total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   But note: the problem says there are n-k+1 weeks, so we divide by (n-k+1).\n\n   However, the above method works, but we must be cautious because the range for i is from 0 to n-1.\n\n   But note: n and k can be up to 200,000, so we are doing a loop of n, which is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a sliding window to compute the sum for each week and then combine, but then we would have to do n-k+1 windows, which is O(n) anyway.\n\n   But the above method is O(n) and straightforward.\n\n   However, there is an alternative: using a prefix sum and then computing the total_sleep by considering each week and then subtracting overlaps? \n\n   Actually, we can also compute the total_sleep by:\n\n        total_sleep = (a0) * 1 + (a1)*2 + (a2)*1   [for the example]\n\n   But wait, the counts for each index i are independent. We can compute the count for each i without using the entire range.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a two-pointer or a difference array to mark the ranges of weeks that each element is included.\n\n   However, the direct formula for the count for element i is:\n\n        left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        right_bound = min(i, n - k)   # because the week must end by n-1, and the week j runs from 0 to n-k, so j<=n-k, and the last day of week j is j+k-1 <= n-1 -> j<=n-k.\n\n        Then count_i = max(0, right_bound - left_bound + 1)\n\n   But note: we defined left_bound as the first week index that includes i, and right_bound as the last week index that includes i.\n\n   However, we can also note that the count for element i is:\n\n        If i < k-1: then it appears only in the first (i+1) weeks? Actually, no: \n            The first week that includes i is week0 (because i>=0 and 0<=i<k) and the last week is week i (if i <= n-k). \n            But if i >= k, then the first week is week i-k+1 and the last week is week i (if i<=n-k) or week n-k (if i>n-k).\n\n        Actually, the formula above is correct.\n\n   Let's test with i=0 and k=2, n=3: \n        left_bound = max(0,0-2+1)=0, right_bound=min(0,3-2)=0 -> count=1.\n\n   i=1: left_bound=0, right_bound=min(1,1)=1 -> count=2.\n\n   i=2: left_bound=max(0,2-2+1)=1, right_bound=min(2,1)=1 -> count=1.\n\n   Now, what if n=4, k=2, and array [1,2,3,4]?\n        total_weeks = 3.\n        i=0: left_bound=0, right_bound=min(0,4-2)=min(0,2)=0 -> count=1.\n        i=1: left_bound=0, right_bound=min(1,2)=1 -> count=2.\n        i=2: left_bound=max(0,2-2+1)=1, right_bound=min(2,2)=2 -> count=2.\n        i=3: left_bound=max(0,3-2+1)=2, right_bound=min(3,2)=2 -> count=1.\n\n        Total_sleep = 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*2 + 4*1 = 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15.\n        Average = 15/3 = 5.0.\n\n        Let's verify by listing the weeks:\n            Week0: [1,2] -> sum=3\n            Week1: [2,3] -> sum=5\n            Week2: [3,4] -> sum=7\n            Total = 3+5+7 = 15, average per week = 15/3 = 5.\n\n   So the formula is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above method uses a loop over n and does simple arithmetic for each index. This is O(n) and should be efficient.\n\n   But wait, the constraints say n up to 200,000. This is acceptable.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Steps:\n        Read n, k and the list a.\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total_sleep = 0.0\n\n        For i in range(n):\n            left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            right_bound = min(i, n - k)   # because the week index j must be <= n-k, and the last day of week j is j+k-1 <= n-1 -> j<=n-k.\n\n            # But note: if left_bound > right_bound, then count=0.\n            if left_bound <= right_bound:\n                count_i = right_bound - left_bound + 1\n            else:\n                count_i = 0\n\n            total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        Format the average to have at least 6 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" -> n=1, k=1, total_weeks=1, and the array [10].\n        i=0: left_bound = max(0,0-1+1)=max(0,0)=0, right_bound = min(0,1-1)=min(0,0)=0 -> count_i=1.\n        total_sleep = 10 * 1 = 10.\n        average = 10.0\n\n   Another example: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\" -> n=8, k=2, so total_weeks=7.\n\n        We need to compute the total_sleep by the above method.\n\n   However, note: the example output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n   Let's compute manually for the third example:\n\n        Array: [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n        n=8, k=2, so total_weeks=7.\n\n        i0: left_bound=0, right_bound=min(0,6)=0 -> count=1 -> 1*1\n        i1: left_bound=0, right_bound=min(1,6)=1 -> count=2 -> 2*2\n        i2: left_bound= max(0,2-2+1)=1, right_bound=min(2,6)=2 -> count=2 -> 4*2\n        i3: left_bound= max(0,3-2+1)=2, right_bound=min(3,6)=3 -> count=2 -> 100000*2\n        i4: left_bound= max(0,4-2+1)=3, right_bound=min(4,6)=4 -> count=2 -> 123*2\n        i5: left_bound= max(0,5-2+1)=4, right_bound=min(5,6)=5 -> count=2 -> 456*2\n        i6: left_bound= max(0,6-2+1)=5, right_bound=min(6,6)=6 -> count=2 -> 789*2\n        i7: left_bound= max(0,7-2+1)=6, right_bound=min(7,6)=6 -> count=1 -> 1*1\n\n        total_sleep = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n        Let's break down:\n          1 + 4 = 5\n          5 + 8 = 13\n          13 + 200000 = 200013\n          200013 + 246 = 200259\n          200259 + 912 = 201171\n          201171 + 1578 = 202749\n          202749 + 1 = 202750\n\n        Then average = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches.\n\n   Therefore, the code below implements this.\n\n   However, note: the above formula for right_bound: we used `min(i, n-k)`.\n\n   Why is that? Because the week j must satisfy j<=i (since the week j ends at j+k-1, and we require j+k-1>=i, so j>=i-k+1, but also j<=i) and also j<=n-k (because the week j must end by n-1, so j+k-1<=n-1 -> j<=n-k). So the upper bound for j is the minimum of i and n-k.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   But note: we must be cautious because the problem says the array has n elements, and we are using 0-indexed.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   However, note: there is a possibility of integer overflow? The numbers are up to 10^5 and n up to 200000, so the maximum total_sleep could be about 10^5 * 200000 * (at most k, which is <=200000) but wait: the count for an element is at most k (when i is in the middle) and k can be up to 200000, and a[i] up to 10^5, so maximum term is 200000 * 10^5 = 2e10, and we have 200000 terms, so worst-case total_sleep could be 2e10 * 200000 = 4e15, which is too big for a float? But wait, actually the count for each element is not multiplied by every element, but the same element is multiplied by its count. The maximum count for an element is k (if the element is in the middle) and k is at most 200000. So the maximum value for one element is 200000 * 10^5 = 20e9, and we have 200000 elements, so worst-case total_sleep is 20e9 * 200000 = 4e15, which is 4000000000000000, which is beyond the range of integers? Actually, Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we are going to do floating point division. However, we are storing total_sleep as a float? Or as integer? \n\n   But note: the problem says the numbers are integers, but the average might not be. We can use float for total_sleep, but the numbers are very large. Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic until the division.\n\n   However, the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, and we are dividing by an integer (total_weeks) which is at most 200000.\n\n   But 4e15 is within the range of Python floats (which have about 15-17 significant digits) but the problem is that the numbers are integers and we want to avoid floating point inaccuracies? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use integer arithmetic for the total_sleep and then convert to float for division, but note that the total_sleep might be huge (like 4e15) and then we do float(total_sleep) / total_weeks. But 4e15 is a float that can be represented exactly? \n\n   Actually, the maximum total_sleep is 200000 * (max_count) * (max_value) = 200000 * (k) * (10^5) = 200000 * 200000 * 100000 = 4e15, which is 4 followed by 15 zeros. This is a 16-digit number. Python floats have about 15-16 decimal digits of precision, so we might lose precision.\n\n   Therefore, we should use integer arithmetic for the total_sleep and then convert to float only for the division? Or use Decimal? But the problem allows an absolute or relative error of 1e-6, and the total_sleep is an integer, so we can do:\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks   # but if total_sleep is huge, then total_weeks is at most 200000, so we are dividing a number that is up to 4e15 by 200000, which gives 2e10, which is still within the range of exact representation for floats? \n\n   But wait, 4e15 / 200000 = 20000000000000.0, which is 2e12, and that is representable exactly in float? \n\n   However, the issue is that the total_sleep is an integer, and we are dividing by an integer (total_weeks). We can use:\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   But note: in Python, if we use integers, then for very large numbers the division of two integers might be a float, but we have to be cautious because the integer division in Python 3 is floor division if we use / for integers, but wait: in Python 3, if we use / with integers, it returns a float. But if the numbers are too big for float, we might lose precision.\n\n   Alternative: use integer division and then format the float, but we have to be cautious.\n\n   But note: the problem says the answer must have at least 6 decimal places.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        total_sleep is an integer (or we can keep it as integer) and total_weeks is an integer.\n\n        Then we can compute: \n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n        But if total_sleep is too big for float, we can use:\n\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks   # in Python, this will try to convert to float, but if total_sleep is too big, we might get an OverflowError? \n\n        Actually, in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, but when converting to float, we get rounding. However, the problem says the numbers are up to 200000 and the values up to 10^5, so the maximum total_sleep is 4e15, which is less than 2**63 (about 9e18) so it's an exact integer. But when we do float(total_sleep) we might lose precision.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            from decimal import Decimal\n            average = Decimal(total_sleep) / Decimal(total_weeks)\n\n        But the problem doesn't require high precision beyond 1e-6, and the numbers are integers, so we can use:\n\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks   # in Python 3, if both are integers, this returns a float.\n\n        However, 4e15 is about 2^51 (since 2^50 is ~1e15, so 4e15 is 2^52) and the mantissa of a float in Python (IEEE double) has 53 bits, so 52 bits for the fractional part. Therefore, 4e15 is exactly representable. Similarly, total_weeks is at most 200000, which is 18 bits. The division of two numbers that are exactly representable in float may not be exact, but the problem allows an error of 1e-6.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            average = total_sleep / total_weeks   # as float\n\n        and then format to have 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, the example outputs have 10 decimal places.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n   But note: the formatting will round the number to 10 decimal places.\n\n   But there is a catch: if the average is an integer, we want to output without extra zeros? The example outputs use 10 zeros.\n\n   The formatting {:.10f} will output with 10 digits after the decimal.\n\n   Example: \n        average = 9.0 -> \"9.0000000000\"\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6\", so we don't need more than 6 correct digits, but we output 10.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(total_sleep / total_weeks))\n\n   But wait: is it safe to do the division as float? The total_sleep is an integer, total_weeks is an integer. The division of two integers in Python 3 returns a float. The maximum total_sleep is 4e15, which is within the range of float (which goes up to about 1e308). The division will be a float.\n\n   However, we must worry about precision. The total_sleep is an integer, and total_weeks is an integer. The quotient might not be representable exactly as a float. But the problem allows an error of 1e-6, and the quotient is a rational number. The float has about 15-16 decimal digits of precision, so for numbers as large as 4e15, the representation of the quotient might have an error in the 10th decimal place? \n\n   But note: the absolute error in representing the quotient as a float is less than 1e-15 * (4e15) = 4e-0, which is 4, but wait, the relative error is about 1e-15. \n\n   However, the absolute error in the quotient is |exact_value - float_value| <= (relative_error * float_value) = (1e-15) * (total_sleep/total_weeks). \n\n   But note: total_sleep/total_weeks is about 4e15/200000 = 2e10, so the absolute error in the quotient would be about 2e10 * 1e-15 = 2e-5. \n\n   But wait, 2e-5 is 0.00002, which is less than 0.0001, so the error is acceptable for 6 decimal places? \n\n   However, the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6. \n\n   The absolute error we computed is 2e-5, which is greater than 1e-6. \n\n   So we must be cautious. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the integer division and then format the string with more control? \n\n   We can use:\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   But to avoid float precision issues, we can use:\n\n        average = total_sleep / total_weeks\n\n   and then format the float to 10 decimal places. The problem requires 10 decimal places, but the float might not have that many accurate digits.\n\n   However, note that the total_sleep and total_weeks are integers, and we are dividing two integers. The result is a rational number. We can use:\n\n        from fractions import Fraction\n\n   But Fraction might be slower and the numbers are too big.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use decimal for the division, but we are dealing with integers.\n\n   Another idea: since the total_sleep and total_weeks are integers, we can do:\n\n        integer_part = total_sleep // total_weeks\n        remainder = total_sleep % total_weeks\n\n        Then we want to output the average as a float with 10 decimal places.\n\n        But we can do:\n\n            average_str = str(total_sleep / total_weeks)\n\n        But that might not give 10 decimal places.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(total_sleep / total_weeks))\n\n   and hope that the float representation is good enough for 6 decimal places. The absolute error in the quotient is 2e-5, which affects the 5th decimal place (since 0.00002 is 2e-5). \n\n   But the problem requires absolute error <= 1e-6, which is 0.000001. Our absolute error is 0.00002, which is bigger than 0.000001. \n\n   Therefore, we cannot rely on float.\n\n   We must use integer arithmetic to compute the average with at least 6 decimal digits.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        We want to compute total_sleep / total_weeks with high precision.\n\n        We know that total_sleep and total_weeks are integers. We can perform the division as a decimal with 12 digits (to be safe) and then round to 10.\n\n        But note: the quotient is total_sleep / total_weeks, and we can use:\n\n            quotient = total_sleep / total_weeks   # float, but we want more precision.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            from decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n            getcontext().prec = 20   # set precision to 20\n            avg_dec = Decimal(total_sleep) / Decimal(total_weeks)\n            print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg_dec))\n\n        But the problem constraints: total_sleep can be up to 4e15, which is 16 digits, and total_weeks up to 200000 (6-7 digits). The division will have at most 16+7 = 23 digits in the integer part? Actually, no: 4e15 / 1 = 4e15, which is 16 digits. The quotient is a number with up to 16 digits in the integer part and then fractional part.\n\n        However, the Decimal division with 20 digits of precision should be sufficient.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            import decimal\n            d1 = decimal.Decimal(total_sleep)\n            d2 = decimal.Decimal(total_weeks)\n            result = d1 / d2\n            # Format the result to have 10 decimal places.\n\n        But note: the problem says the input integers are up to 200000, so total_sleep is an integer that we calculated. We can use Decimal for that.\n\n        Example: \n            total_sleep = 202750, total_weeks=7 -> Decimal(202750)/Decimal(7) = 28964.285714285714...\n\n        Then formatting to 10 decimal places: \n            \"{:.10f}\".format(28964.285714285714) -> '28964.2857142857'\n\n        This is the same as the example.\n\n        However, we must be cautious because the numbers are very large (total_sleep up to 4e15). The Decimal module can handle that.\n\n        But note: the problem input n and k are integers, and the list a is integers. We are calculating total_sleep as an integer.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            import decimal\n\n            total_weeks_int = n - k + 1\n            total_sleep_int = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n                right_bound = min(i, n - k)\n                if left_bound <= right_bound:\n                    count_i = right_bound - left_bound + 1\n                else:\n                    count_i = 0\n                total_sleep_int += a[i] * count_i\n\n            # Then use Decimal for total_sleep_int and total_weeks_int\n            d1 = decimal.Decimal(total_sleep_int)\n            d2 = decimal.Decimal(total_weeks_int)\n            result = d1 / d2\n\n            # Format the result to have 10 decimal places.\n            # Note: formatting Decimal objects with '{:.10f}' might work, but we can also use:\n            #   format_spec = '.10f'\n            print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\n        But note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" -> total_sleep_int=10, total_weeks_int=1 -> 10.0000000000\n\n        However, the problem says the numbers are integers, but the average might not be.\n\n        This method should be exact because we are using integers and then doing decimal division.\n\n        But the total_sleep_int can be as large as 4e15, and Decimal can handle that.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints say n,k up to 200000, and a[i] up to 10^5, so total_sleep_int is at most 4e15, which is within the range of Decimal.\n\n   However, the problem does not require extremely high precision, but we must meet the 1e-6 error. Using Decimal with sufficient precision (say 20) should be safe.\n\n   But note: the context precision is set by getcontext().prec. We are not setting it, and by default it's 28. We can use the default.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do without Decimal by using integer division and then formatting the fractional part, but that would be more complex.\n\n   Given the constraints, and that the problem is not extremely performance critical (n=200000, which is acceptable for a single pass), we choose the Decimal method.\n\n   But wait, the problem says competitive programming, and we must be efficient. The Decimal division is O(n) in the number of digits, but our numbers have at most around 16 digits (for total_sleep_int) and 6 digits for total_weeks_int, so the division is fast.\n\n   However, to avoid the overhead of Decimal, we can use:\n\n        # We can compute the integer part and then the fractional part.\n\n        integer_part = total_sleep_int // total_weeks_int\n        remainder = total_sleep_int % total_weeks_int\n\n        Then we want to compute the fractional part to 10 decimal places.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            fractional = []\n            r = remainder * 10   # to start the fractional part\n            for _ in range(10):   # we want 10 decimal digits\n                fractional.append(str(r // total_weeks_int))\n                r = (r % total_weeks_int) * 10\n\n            fractional_str = ''.join(fractional)\n\n            Then the average string is str(integer_part) + '.' + fractional_str\n\n        However, if the fractional part has leading zeros, that's okay.\n\n        But note: if the integer part is 0, we must output the integer part.\n\n        Example: total_sleep_int=1, total_weeks_int=7 -> \n            integer_part=0, remainder=1\n            fractional: \n                r=10 -> 10//7=1, remainder=3 -> fractional digit '1'\n                then r=30 -> 30//7=4, remainder=2 -> '4'\n                then r=20 -> 20//7=2, remainder=6 -> '2'\n                then r=60 -> 60//7=8, remainder=4 -> '8'\n                then r=40 -> 40//7=5, remainder=5 -> '5'\n                then r=50 -> 50//7=7, remainder=1 -> '7'\n                then r=10 -> 10//7=1, remainder=3 -> '1'\n                then r=30 -> 4 -> '4'\n                then r=20 -> 2 -> '2'\n\n            So we get \"0.1428571428\", but the exact value is 0.142857142857... so we got 10 digits.\n\n        However, the example output for 1/7 is not provided, but the problem requires 10 digits.\n\n        This method is exact? It is long division. But note: the remainder repeats, so we might get a repeating decimal. But we only output 10 digits.\n\n        But the problem does not specify that the decimal must be exact. We just output 10 digits.\n\n        However, we must consider that the total_sleep_int and total_weeks_int are integers, so the fractional part is periodic or terminating.\n\n        But the problem requires absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, and we are outputting 10 digits, so the error is at most 5e-11 (if we rounded the 10th digit) which is much better than 1e-6.\n\n        This method is faster than Decimal.\n\n   Considering the constraints and that we are already doing a loop of n, the long division is just 10 steps after the main loop.\n\n   Steps for long division:\n\n        integer_part = total_sleep_int // total_weeks_int\n        remainder = total_sleep_int % total_weeks_int\n\n        fractional_digits = []\n        r = remainder\n        for _ in range(10):\n            r *= 10\n            fractional_digits.append(str(r // total_weeks_int))\n            r = r % total_weeks_int\n            # If we get remainder 0, we break early? But the problem requires 10 digits, so even trailing zeros are okay.\n\n        fractional_str = ''.join(fractional_digits)\n\n        Then we format the integer part and fractional part.\n\n        But note: if total_sleep_int is 0, then integer_part=0, remainder=0, then fractional part is zeros.\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. Each week is defined as `k` consecutive days, and there are `n - k + 1` such weeks in total. The challenge is to compute the average sleep time across all these weeks efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all possible contiguous weeks of length `k` in a sequence of `n` days. The key observation is that each day's sleep time contributes to multiple weeks, specifically, the number of weeks that include that day depends on its position in the sequence.\n\n2. **Insight**: For each day `i` in the sequence, the number of weeks that include it can be determined by the formula:\n   - The first week that includes day `i` starts at `max(0, i - k + 1)`.\n   - The last week that includes day `i` ends at `min(i, n - k)`.\n   - The count of weeks including day `i` is `right_bound - left_bound + 1`, provided `left_bound <= right_bound`; otherwise, it's zero.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each day in the sequence, compute the number of weeks that include it, and accumulate the total sleep time multiplied by this count. The average is then the total accumulated sleep time divided by the number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each day exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n5. **Precision Handling**: To ensure the result meets the required precision (absolute or relative error ≤ 1e-6), we use integer arithmetic for exact computation and then format the result to 10 decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    total_sleep_int = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        left_bound = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        right_bound = min(i, n - k)\n        if left_bound <= right_bound:\n            count_i = right_bound - left_bound + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n        total_sleep_int += a[i] * count_i\n        \n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    integer_part = total_sleep_int // total_weeks\n    remainder = total_sleep_int % total_weeks\n    r = remainder\n    fractional_digits = []\n    for _ in range(10):\n        r *= 10\n        digit = r // total_weeks\n        fractional_digits.append(str(digit))\n        r = r % total_weeks\n        \n    fractional_str = ''.join(fractional_digits)\n    print(f\"{integer_part}.{fractional_str}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of each week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing daily sleep times.\n\n2. **Total Weeks Calculation**: The total number of weeks is computed as `n - k + 1`.\n\n3. **Accumulating Total Sleep Time**: For each day, the algorithm calculates how many weeks include that day using the bounds derived from its position. The sleep time of the day is multiplied by this count and added to a running total.\n\n4. **Handling Division**: The total sleep time is divided into the number of weeks to get the average. To handle precision, the division is performed using integer arithmetic to compute both the integer part and the fractional part (up to 10 decimal places) via long division.\n\n5. **Output**: The result is formatted to display the integer part followed by exactly 10 decimal digits, ensuring the required precision is met.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average while adhering to the problem constraints and precision requirements.",
