Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads divide the plane into regions (blocks). The movement is allowed only across entire road segments (nonzero common border). Importantly, two adjacent blocks (sharing a segment of a road) can be crossed in one step. However, if two blocks only meet at an intersection (a point) then they are not considered adjacent for a step.\n\n But note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". So we are essentially crossing a full road segment.\n\n However, note that the entire plane is divided by n lines. We can think of each road as a line that separates two half-planes. Each block is defined by being on a particular side of each road.\n\n Actually, the problem is equivalent to: we start in a region (block) and want to get to the university's block. Each time we cross a road (line) we change the side for that road. But note: we are allowed to cross multiple roads at once? Actually, no: the step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent one (sharing a border). However, note that two blocks are adjacent if they share a road segment (so they differ in exactly one road's side).\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: we have two points (home and university) and each road divides the plane. For each road, we can determine on which side of the road the home is and on which side the university is.\n\n Then, the minimum number of steps required is the number of roads that separate the two points. Why?\n\n Explanation: \n   - Initially, the home is in a block. The university is in a block.\n   - The two points lie in two blocks. The blocks are separated by some roads. Each road that separates the two points must be crossed an odd number of times (if we consider that crossing a road flips the side). But note: we are allowed to cross entire road segments (so we can cross one road at a time). \n\n However, note that the roads might not necessarily separate the two points independently. Actually, the entire set of roads defines a arrangement. The minimal steps to go from home to university is the number of roads that separate the two points (i.e., the roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides).\n\n But wait: what if we cross two roads that are parallel? Then we would cross two roads and flip two sides. However, the problem does not require that we cross roads one by one arbitrarily. The movement is defined by adjacent blocks. The minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points because:\n\n   - Each road that separates the two points must be crossed at least once.\n   - And you cannot cross two roads without stepping through the intermediate region? Actually, note: we are allowed to cross one road at a time (because we can only move between blocks that share a border, i.e., one road). \n\n But consider: if two points are separated by k roads, then we must cross k roads. However, the steps: each step crosses one road. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is k.\n\n However, wait: what if the two points are separated by two roads that are parallel and the same half-plane for the other roads? Then we have to cross both, but we can do it in two steps (each step crosses one road). \n\n But note: the problem does not require that we cross the roads in a linear fashion. However, the minimal number of crossings is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, there's a catch: sometimes, if two roads are the same, we wouldn't have to cross them twice? But the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.\"\n\n So, for each road i, we check:\n   - Compute the sign for the home: s1 = sign(a*x1 + b*y1 + c)\n   - Compute the sign for the university: s2 = sign(a*x2 + b*y2 + c)\n\n But note: the equation is aix + biy + ci = 0. The sign function should take into account the possibility of zero? However, the problem guarantees that the points are not on any road, so we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n However, note: the sign function: if we use the same convention for the entire calculation, we must be consistent. But note: the equation can be multiplied by -1 and still represent the same line. So the sign of the expression (a*x+b*y+c) could be positive or negative arbitrarily.\n\n But for comparing the two points, we only care if they are on the same side or opposite sides. So we can compare the signs:\n\n   If (a*x",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block (containing your home) to a target block (containing the university) in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road (line) that divides the plane into regions. The key insight is that each road that separates the home and university must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The roads in Crazy Town are infinite lines that divide the plane into connected regions (blocks). The home and university are located in two different blocks. The movement between adjacent blocks is allowed only if they share a common border (a segment of a road). The minimal steps required to reach the university from home is determined by the number of roads that separate the two points.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. If they lie on opposite sides, crossing that road is necessary. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, increment a counter. The final value of the counter is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    roads = []\n    index = 5\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road defined by \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\), compute the value of the expression for both home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Sides**: If the computed values for the home and university have opposite signs, it means the two points lie on opposite sides of the road, necessitating a crossing of this road.\n4. **Counting Roads**: The total number of roads that separate the home and university gives the minimal steps required to reach the university, as each such road must be crossed exactly once.\n5. **Output Result**: The final count is printed, representing the minimal steps needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road's contribution to separating the two points and leverages the fact that each separation requires one step, leading to an optimal solution.",
