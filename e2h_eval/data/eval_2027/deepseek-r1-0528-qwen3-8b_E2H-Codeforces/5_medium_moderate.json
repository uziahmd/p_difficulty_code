Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and two strings l and r (each of length n) containing lowercase Latin letters or '?'.\n\n We have to form as many pairs as possible. Each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors.\n Compatible means:\n   - If both are specific letters, they must be the same.\n   - If one is '?' and the other is a letter, that's okay (compatible).\n   - If both are '?', that's also okay.\n\n However, note: a boot can be used only once.\n\n Approach:\n\n We cannot try all possibilities because n can be up to 150000.\n\n Let us break down the problem:\n\n There are two types of boots: those with fixed color and those with '?'.\n\n We need to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can consider matching fixed boots first, then use '?' to match the leftovers.\n\n However, note that sometimes we might have to use a '?' as a bridge to free up some fixed boots for better matching? \n Actually, we cannot use a '?' in two pairs. But note: the problem does not require that we use the '?' to match only when no fixed matches are available.\n\n However, observe: \n   - A fixed letter can only match with the same fixed letter or a '?'.\n   - Similarly, a '?' can match with any.\n\n So, we can think:\n\n   We want to form pairs. The total pairs we can form is limited by the total boots (n) but also by the color constraints.\n\n How about:\n\n   Step 1: Count the fixed letters and the positions of '?' in both left and right.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use a '?' in left to match a fixed letter in right, or vice versa, and also to match a '?' in the other side.\n\n   However, we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   We can try to form as many pairs as possible by:\n\n   - First, matching the fixed boots that have a matching fixed counterpart OR a '?' on the opposite side.\n\n   But note: the matching condition is symmetric. \n\n   We can do:\n\n     For each color (letter from 'a' to 'z'), count the fixed left boots of that color and fixed right boots of that color.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the '?' complicates things.\n\n   Another idea:\n\n   We can try to match without using '?' first, then use the remaining '?' to form pairs.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a left boot with '?' and a right boot with a fixed letter? Then we can match them. Similarly, a left fixed letter can match a right '?'.\n\n   However, sometimes we might have a situation:\n\n        Left: ['a', '?'] \n        Right: ['a', '?']\n\n   Without using the '?' for the other '?' we could form two pairs: (a,a) and (?,?) but also we could form (?,a) and (a,?) which is the same.\n\n   Actually, the maximum pairs we can form is n, but we are constrained by the colors.\n\n   We can use a greedy matching? But we have two independent sequences.\n\n   Alternatively, we can model this as a bipartite graph where:\n\n        Left nodes: indices 0 to n-1 (left boots)\n        Right nodes: indices 0 to n-1 (right boots)\n\n        Edge exists between left i and right j if:\n            l[i] == r[j] OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') OR (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?') OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?')\n\n        But note: the condition is actually:\n\n            compatible if (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?') OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j] is any) OR (r[j]=='?' and l[i] is any) ?\n\n        Actually, the condition is:\n\n            if l[i] == r[j]: compatible.\n            else if l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?': compatible.\n\n        But note: the example includes ('?', 'z') and ('a','?'). So yes.\n\n        So edge exists if:\n            (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?') or (r[j]=='?')\n\n        However, wait: what if l[i] is 'a' and r[j] is 'b'? Then it's not compatible. So the condition is:\n\n            if (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j] != '?') or (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?') or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?')?\n\n        Actually, we can simplify: the condition is that either the two are the same (and both are letters) OR at least one is '?'.\n\n        But note: if one is '?' and the other is a letter, that's allowed. And if both are letters and different, not allowed. And if both are '?', allowed.\n\n        So the condition is: \n            (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?')\n\n        However, wait: if l[i] is a letter and r[j] is a letter and they are different, then we don't have a match. If at least one is '?', then we have a match.\n\n        Actually, that is correct because the condition says: \n            An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.\n\n        So the edge condition is: if (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?').\n\n        But wait, what if we have l[i]='a' and r[j]='a'? -> matches.\n        What if l[i]='a' and r[j]='?'? -> matches.\n        What if l[i]='?' and r[j]='a'? -> matches.\n        What if l[i]='?' and r[j]='?'? -> matches.\n\n        What if l[i]='a' and r[j]='b'? -> doesn't match.\n\n        So the condition is: if (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?').\n\n        However, note that this condition is equivalent to: \n            (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and True) or (r[j]=='?' and True) -> but wait, that would be: (l[i]==r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?').\n\n        So we can write: if (l[i] == '?' or r[j]=='?') or (l[i]==r[j] and l[i]!='?'): \n            But wait, if both are letters and equal, then we don't require one to be '?'. \n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n            if (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?').\n\n        However, note: if l[i]=='?' and r[j] is a letter, then we get a match. Similarly, if r[j]=='?' and l[i] is a letter, then we get a match.\n\n        So the graph has an edge from left i to right j if and only if (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') is not necessary? Actually, no: the condition is OR (any of the three cases). \n\n        But wait: the condition is: \n            compatible if (same) OR (at least one is '?').\n\n        However, note: same requires both to be the same letter, and if one is '?' then even if the other is a letter, it's okay. So we cannot simply say \"at least one is '?'\" because if both are letters and same, then no '?' is needed.\n\n        Actually, the condition is:\n\n            (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?') OR (r[j]=='?')\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   Now, we have a bipartite graph with up to 150000 nodes on each side. We want the maximum matching.\n\n   But note: the graph is very large (n=150000) and the edges are many (each node has up to n edges, so total edges n*n = 2.25e10, which is too many).\n\n   We need a more efficient way.\n\n   Alternative Insight:\n\n   We note that the graph is defined by two strings. We can try to match without building the entire graph.\n\n   Let's denote:\n\n        Let L = list of left boots, R = list of right boots.\n\n   We can break the boots into two sets: fixed and variable (with '?').\n\n   However, note: the '?' can match anything. Therefore, we can use the '?' to fill in the gaps.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. First, we try to match the fixed boots (non '?') with the same fixed boots or with '?' on the opposite side.\n\n      But wait, a fixed boot can be matched with:\n\n          - A fixed boot of the same color (on the opposite side) that is not used.\n          - A '?' on the opposite side.\n\n      Similarly, a '?' can be matched with any boot (fixed or not) that is not used.\n\n   2. However, we are allowed to use a '?' in the left to match a fixed boot on the right, and vice versa.\n\n   How to maximize the number of pairs?\n\n   We can consider:\n\n        Let F be the set of fixed colors (letters) that appear in the left and right.\n\n        We can match two fixed boots of the same color if we have a pair (l_i, r_j) such that l_i==r_j and both are the same letter.\n\n        But note: we can also use a '?' to match a fixed boot. However, we must be cautious because the same '?' might be used for multiple matches? No, each boot only once.\n\n   We can use a greedy matching:\n\n        Step 1: Match the fixed boots that have a matching fixed boot of the same color. But note: we can also use a '?' to match a fixed boot, so maybe we should reserve the '?' for the fixed boots that don't have a matching fixed boot.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of two phases:\n\n        Phase 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots (same color). But note: we can also use '?' to match fixed boots, and the '?' can be used arbitrarily.\n\n        However, the problem is: we want maximum pairs.\n\n        Total pairs we can form is at most n.\n\n        The maximum pairs we can form is:\n\n            Let X = set of fixed left boots (excluding '?')\n            Let Y = set of fixed right boots (excluding '?')\n\n            But also, we have the possibility to use the '?' to match any.\n\n        We can also consider: \n\n            Let A = number of fixed left boots (without '?')\n            Let B = number of fixed right boots (without '?')\n\n            But note: the matching condition for fixed boots: two fixed boots (left and right) must be of the same color.\n\n            However, the '?' boots can be used to match any, so we can use them to match the fixed boots that don't have a matching fixed boot.\n\n        Another idea:\n\n            We can use a two-step matching:\n\n            Step 1: Match the fixed boots that are the same. But note: we have to assign the same color fixed boots in left and right.\n\n            Step 2: Use the '?' to match the remaining boots.\n\n        But wait, we can also use a fixed boot to match a '?' and then use that '?' to match another fixed boot? Actually, no: because the '?' is a boot, and we have two separate lists. \n\n        Actually, we have two separate lists: left and right.\n\n        The '?' in left and right are distinct.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let L_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if l[i]!='?']\n            Let R_fixed = [i for i in range(n) if r[i]!='?']\n\n            Then, we can form pairs between fixed boots of the same color. But note: we can also use a '?' to match a fixed boot.\n\n        However, the problem is: we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n        The maximum pairs is n, but we are constrained by the fact that two boots must be compatible.\n\n        We can also use a flow network? But n=150000, and we cannot build a graph with 150000*150000 edges.\n\n   We need to use the structure of the problem.\n\n   Observation:\n\n        The compatibility condition is very permissive. In fact, the graph is a union of cliques for each color (but note: the '?' complicates because it matches every color).\n\n        Actually, we can split the graph:\n\n            For a non '?' color c, we have a complete bipartite graph between left boots with color c and right boots with color c.\n\n            Additionally, the left boots with '?' can connect to every right boot (including those with '?' and fixed) and similarly for the right boots with '?'.\n\n        But note: the condition is: \n            (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?' OR r[j]=='?')\n\n        So the graph has:\n\n            For a left boot with color c (c not '?'): \n                It connects to right boots with color c and to all right boots that are '?'.\n\n            For a left boot with '?':\n                It connects to all right boots.\n\n            Similarly for the right side.\n\n        This is a very dense graph.\n\n   We need a more combinatorial approach.\n\n   Let:\n\n        Let L0 = indices of left boots that are '?'\n        Let R0 = indices of right boots that are '?'\n\n        Let L1 = indices of left boots that are fixed (non '?')\n        Let R1 = indices of right boots that are fixed (non '?')\n\n        Then, we can form:\n\n            Type 1: Pairs between L1 and R1: only if the fixed colors are the same.\n\n            Type 2: Pairs between L1 and R0: always (since R0 is '?')\n\n            Type 3: Pairs between L0 and R1: always\n\n            Type 4: Pairs between L0 and R0: always\n\n        However, we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n        We wish to maximize the total pairs.\n\n        The total pairs we can form is limited by the total boots, but also we cannot exceed the available boots.\n\n        Note: The fixed boots (L1 and R1) can be matched in two ways: either with a fixed boot of the same color, or with a '?' boot.\n\n        How to maximize?\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n            Step 1: Match as many fixed boots as possible via fixed boots (i.e., same color). For each color c, let:\n\n                left_count[c] = count of left fixed boots with color c (from L1)\n                right_count[c] = count of right fixed boots with color c (from R1)\n\n            Then, we can match min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs for color c.\n\n            But note: we can also use the '?' boots to match the leftover fixed boots. However, we must not overuse the '?' boots.\n\n        However, we are not forced to use the fixed boots only with fixed boots. We can use a fixed boot with a '?' boot.\n\n        Actually, the goal is to maximize the total pairs. The total pairs is the sum of:\n\n            - The pairs formed by fixed boots (same color) [Type 1]\n            - The pairs formed by fixed boots with '?' boots [Types 2 and 3]\n            - The pairs formed by '?' boots [Type 4]\n\n        But note: the '?' boots can be used to match both fixed and non-fixed (other '?') boots.\n\n        The total number of pairs we can form is:\n\n            Let x = number of pairs formed by fixed boots (same color) [Type 1]\n\n            Then, the remaining fixed boots (from left and right) are:\n\n                left_fixed_remaining = |L1| - x\n                right_fixed_remaining = |R1| - x\n\n            Now, we can use the '?' boots to cover these remaining fixed boots. But note: we can also use the '?' boots to match among themselves.\n\n            However, we have a total of |L0| + |R0| '?' boots, and we can form up to min(|L0|+|R0|, n) pairs from the '?'? Actually, no: because the fixed boots and the '?' boots together.\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n                Total left boots: n\n                Total right boots: n\n\n            We have already used x pairs (from fixed boots). Now, we have:\n\n                Left boots used: x (from fixed boots) + (some from fixed boots and some from '?')\n                Right boots used: x (from fixed boots) + (some from fixed boots and some from '?')\n\n            But note: the fixed boots that are not matched (left_fixed_remaining and right_fixed_remaining) must be matched with '?' boots.\n\n            Also, the '?' boots can be used to match:\n\n                - The remaining fixed boots (both sides)\n                - The unmatched '?' boots (if any)\n\n            The maximum pairs we can form is n, so the remaining pairs we can form is n - x.\n\n            However, we are constrained by the availability of '?' boots.\n\n            Specifically, the total pairs we can form is:\n\n                x (from fixed) + y (from the rest)\n\n            And the rest must come from:\n\n                The remaining fixed boots (left_fixed_remaining and right_fixed_remaining) and the '?' boots.\n\n            The remaining fixed boots (left_fixed_remaining and right_fixed_remaining) must be matched with the '?' boots. But note: a '?' boot can only be used once.\n\n            Moreover, we can form pairs between:\n\n                - Left fixed remaining and right '?' boots: we can use at most left_fixed_remaining of these, but we are limited by the available right '?' boots (which are |R0|, but some of these R0 might be used to match left fixed remaining, and then the rest to match left '?' remaining).\n\n            Actually, we can model the rest as:\n\n                We have:\n\n                    Left: \n                        Fixed remaining: left_fixed_remaining\n                        Question marks: |L0|\n\n                    Right:\n                        Fixed remaining: right_fixed_remaining\n                        Question marks: |R0|\n\n                We can form:\n\n                    - Between left fixed remaining and right fixed remaining: not allowed (because they are fixed and different, unless we haven't matched them by the same color? Actually, we did the same color matching first, so they are of different colors. But wait, we did the same color matching for fixed boots. So the remaining fixed boots are of colors that do not have a matching fixed boot on the opposite side? Or we might have done partial matching? \n\n            Actually, we did:\n\n                x = for each color c: min(left_count[c], right_count[c])\n\n                Then, the remaining fixed boots (both left and right) are of colors that either:\n\n                    - On the left: colors c for which left_count[c] > right_count[c] (then we have left_count[c]-right_count[c] left over) OR colors that are not present on the opposite side? \n\n                But note: we did not consider that a fixed left boot of color c might be matched with a fixed right boot of color d if c==d? Actually, we did: we matched only same color.\n\n            Now, we cannot match two fixed boots of different colors. So the remaining fixed boots (both left and right) are of colors that do not have enough counterparts.\n\n            Now, the remaining fixed boots (left_fixed_remaining) must be matched with '?' boots (either from left or right? Actually, no: \n\n                The remaining left_fixed_remaining must be matched with right boots (which can be either fixed or '?') but note: we cannot use fixed right boots because we already matched the fixed boots that are same and then we don't have any fixed right boots of the same color (because we subtracted the minimum). \n\n            However, wait: the fixed right boots that are not matched are of colors that are not the same as the left fixed ones (so they are fixed and we cannot match them with the left fixed remaining). But we can use the '?' boots to match the remaining fixed boots.\n\n            Specifically, the remaining left_fixed_remaining (say L_rem) must be matched with right boots that are either '?' or fixed but of the same color? But we already matched the fixed boots of the same color, so the fixed ones remaining are of colors that are not matched. Therefore, we cannot use fixed right boots for these left_fixed_remaining. Similarly, we cannot use the remaining fixed right boots (which are of colors not matched) to match the left_fixed_remaining? Actually, no: because the condition requires same color for fixed boots. \n\n            Therefore, the remaining fixed boots (both left and right) cannot be matched with each other (unless we change the order, but we are trying to maximize the total pairs). \n\n            So the remaining fixed boots must be matched with the '?' boots.\n\n            Similarly, the '?' boots can be used to match the remaining fixed boots and also the remaining '?' boots.\n\n            Now, the total pairs we can form beyond x is:\n\n                Let T = n - x   (the maximum pairs we can form is n, so we are going to form x plus at most T)\n\n            However, the constraint is:\n\n                We have L_rem (remaining fixed left) and R_rem (remaining fixed right) and L0 (left '?') and R0 (right '?').\n\n            The remaining fixed left boots must be matched with the right side, and the remaining fixed right boots must be matched with the left side.\n\n            But note: we can use the same '?' boot to match a fixed boot on the left and a fixed boot on the right? No, one boot per pair.\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n                We can form pairs between:\n\n                    - The remaining fixed left boots and the right '?' boots (we have |R0| available) but also the remaining fixed right boots can be matched with the left '?' boots.\n\n                However, we have to avoid double counting: the '?' boots are two separate sets.\n\n            We can use a greedy for the remaining:\n\n                Step 1: Use the right '?' boots to match the remaining fixed left boots. But note: we have |R0| right '?' boots, and we can use each to match one left boot (either fixed or '?').\n\n                Similarly, we can use the left '?' boots to match the remaining fixed right boots.\n\n                But wait: we have to form pairs and we cannot use the same boot twice.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider the entire set of remaining boots (both fixed and '?') and form pairs arbitrarily.\n\n            The remaining boots (both sides) are:\n\n                Left: \n                    Fixed: L_rem (size = A)\n                    ?: L0 (size = B)\n\n                Right:\n                    Fixed: R_rem (size = C)\n                    ?: R0 (size = D)\n\n            Now, we can form pairs by:\n\n                - Matching a fixed left boot (from L_rem) with a right boot (either fixed or '?')? But wait, the fixed right boots (R_rem) are fixed and of a color that we don't have a matching fixed left boot (because we already matched by same color). So we cannot use fixed right boots for fixed left boots of a different color. Therefore, the fixed left boots must be matched with right '?' boots.\n\n                Similarly, the fixed right boots must be matched with left '?' boots.\n\n                Then, the remaining '?' boots (after matching the fixed boots) can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n            So:\n\n                Step 1: We can match at most min(A, D) of the fixed left boots with the right '?' boots.\n\n                Step 2: We can match at most min(C, B) of the fixed right boots with the left '?' boots.\n\n                But note: the '?' boots are shared. The left '?' boots (B) are used for matching the fixed right boots (step 2) and the right '?' boots (D) are used for matching the fixed left boots (step 1). Then, the remaining '?' boots (if any) can be matched together.\n\n            However, the matching of fixed left boots uses up right '?' boots, and matching fixed right boots uses up left '?' boots.\n\n            Then, the total pairs we can form beyond x is:\n\n                Let m1 = min(A, D)   [matching fixed left with right '?']\n                Then, the remaining right '?' boots are D1 = D - m1.\n\n                Let m2 = min(C, B)   [matching fixed right with left '?'] but wait: we have used some left '?' boots for matching fixed right? Actually, no: we haven't. The two steps are independent? \n\n            Actually, we must consider that the same '?' boot cannot be used twice. But note: the left '?' boots and right '?' boots are distinct. So:\n\n                We have two independent sets: left '?' and right '?'.\n\n            Therefore, we can use:\n\n                Step 1: Use right '?' boots (D) to match the fixed left boots (A). We can use at most min(A, D) of these.\n\n                Step 2: Use left '?' boots (B) to match the fixed right boots (C). We can use at most min(C, B) of these.\n\n            Then, the remaining '?' boots (from left: B - min(C, B) and from right: D - min(A, D)) can be matched together: we can form up to min(remaining_left_question_marks, remaining_right_question_marks) pairs.\n\n            So total pairs from the second phase is: m1 + m2 + min( (B - m2), (D - m1) )?\n\n            But wait, we have:\n\n                After step1: \n                    Fixed left remaining: A' = A - m1\n                    Right '?' remaining: D' = D - m1\n\n                After step2:\n                    Fixed right remaining: C' = C - m2\n                    Left '?' remaining: B' = B - m2\n\n                Then, we can form min(B', D') pairs from matching left '?' and right '?'.\n\n            Then, the total pairs is:\n\n                x + m1 + m2 + min(B - m2, D - m1)\n\n            But wait, is that correct? \n\n            However, note: we might have used the same '?' boot for two purposes? No, because we have two independent sets.\n\n            But let me check:\n\n                We have:\n\n                    Left: \n                        Fixed: A, Question: B\n                    Right:\n                        Fixed: C, Question: D\n\n                Step1: Match min(A, D) fixed left with right question -> uses D1 = min(A, D) of right question, so right question becomes D1' = D - min(A,D)\n                Step2: Match min(C, B) fixed right with left question -> uses B1 = min(C, B) of left question, so left question becomes B1' = B - min(C, B)\n\n                Then, we can match the remaining left question (B1') and right question (D1') arbitrarily. The number is min(B1', D1').\n\n                Then, the total pairs is x + min(A, D) + min(C, B) + min(B - min(C,B), D - min(A,D))\n\n            However, wait: the initial fixed matching x was for same color. The fixed boots that remain are:\n\n                Left fixed remaining: A = (original fixed left) - x_used_in_phase1?\n                Actually, no: in our breakdown, we separated the fixed boots (L1 and R1) and then we computed x as the matching between fixed boots (same color). Then we defined:\n\n                    A = |L1| - (number of fixed left boots used in x) = |L1| - (for each color c, min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))\n\n                Similarly, C = |R1| - (for each color c, min(left_count[c], right_count[c]))\n\n            So we must compute:\n\n                Let fixed_left = [index for index, char in enumerate(l) if char != '?']\n                Let fixed_right = [index for index, char in enumerate(r) if char != '?']\n\n                Then, we count for each color c:\n\n                    lc = count of c in fixed_left\n                    rc = count of c in fixed_right\n\n                Then, x = sum(min(lc, rc) for all colors c)\n\n                Then, the remaining fixed left boots: A = len(fixed_left) - x\n                Then, the remaining fixed right boots: C = len(fixed_right) - x\n\n            Then, the number of '?' boots:\n\n                B = n - len(fixed_left)\n                D = n - len(fixed_right)\n\n            Then, the additional pairs:\n\n                m1 = min(A, D)\n                m2 = min(C, B)\n\n            Then, the matching of the remaining '?' boots:\n\n                After using D1 = m1 of right '?' for fixed left, the remaining right '?' is D - m1.\n                After using B1 = m2 of left '?' for fixed right, the remaining left '?' is B - m2.\n\n            Then, the pairs from the remaining '?' is min(B - m2, D - m1)\n\n            So total pairs = x + m1 + m2 + min(B - m2, D - m1)\n\n            But note: the total pairs we can form is at most n, and we are using:\n\n                x (from fixed) + m1 (fixed left with right ?) + m2 (fixed right with left ?) + min(B-m2, D-m1) (from ? with ?) \n\n            And note: the total number of boots used is:\n\n                Left: x (from fixed) + m1 (fixed left with ?) + m2 (not, because m2 is fixed right with left ?) + min(B-m2, D-m1) [which uses some left '?' and right '?'] \n\n                Actually, the left side: \n                    We use x (fixed left used in same color) + (m1 from fixed left with right ?) + (min(B-m2, D-m1) from left ?)\n\n                Right side:\n                    We use x (fixed right used in same color) + (m2 from fixed right with left ?) + (min(B-m2, D-m1) from right ?)\n\n            And the total pairs is the sum.\n\n            But wait: is this the maximum? \n\n            Example: n=1, l=\"a\", r=\"?\" -> \n                x=0, A=1, C=0, B=0, D=1\n                m1 = min(1,1)=1, m2=0, then min(B-m2, D-m1)=min(0,0)=0 -> total pairs=1, which is correct.\n\n            Example: n=1, l=\"a\", r=\"b\" -> \n                x=0, A=1, C=1, B=0, D=0\n                m1=min(1,0)=0, m2=min(1,0)=0, then min(0,0)=0 -> total pairs=0.\n\n            Example: n=2, l=\"a?\", r=\"?b\"\n                fixed_left: ['a'] -> lc: {'a':1}\n                fixed_right: ['b'] -> rc: {'b':1}\n                x = min(0,0) for 'a' and 'b' -> 0? Actually, for 'a': min(1,0)=0; for 'b': min(0,1)=0 -> x=0.\n                A = 1, C=1, B=1 (left has one '?'), D=1 (right has one '?')\n                m1 = min(1,1)=1\n                m2 = min(1,1)=1\n                Then, the remaining '?' boots: left: 1-1=0, right:1-1=0 -> min(0,0)=0\n                total pairs=0+1+1+0=2.\n\n            But wait, we have two boots on each side. We can form two pairs: (left0, right0) and (left1, right1)? \n                left0='a', right0='?' -> compatible -> pair1\n                left1='?', right1='b' -> compatible -> pair2.\n\n            So 2 pairs. Correct.\n\n            However, note: we cannot form two pairs because the two pairs use the two boots on the left and two boots on the right. \n\n            But wait, the example input says: \n                n=2, l=\"a?\" and r=\"?b\"\n\n            Our breakdown: \n                fixed_left: ['a'] -> so left0 is fixed, left1 is '?' -> so B=1\n                fixed_right: ['b'] -> so right0 is '?' and right1 is fixed -> so D=1\n\n            Then, m1 = min(A, D) = min(1,1)=1 -> so we use the right0 '?' to match left0 'a'. Then, the right0 is used. Then, for m2: we use the left1 '?' to match right1 'b'. Then, no remaining '?'.\n\n            So the pairs are (0,0) and (1,1). But wait, the indices: \n                left0: index0, right0: index0 -> pair (0,0)\n                left1: index1, right1: index1 -> pair (1,1)\n\n            But note: the input indexing: the problem says the i-th boot (0-indexed in code, but the output expects 1-indexed indices? Actually, the problem says: \n                \"The j-th of these lines should contain the index a_j of the left boot in the j-th pair and index b_j of the right boot in the j-th pair.\"\n\n            And the example input: \n                Input: \n                    10\n                    codeforces\n                    dodivthree\n\n            The example output: \n                5\n                7 8\n                4 9\n                2 2\n                9 10\n                3 1\n\n            The indices are 1-indexed.\n\n            But note: the problem states: \"the i-th character\" meaning the first character is index1? Actually, the problem says: \"the i-th left boot\", so we assume the input string is 0-indexed.\n\n            However, the output must be 1-indexed indices.\n\n            So in our example, we have:\n\n                left0: index0 -> output left index 1\n                left1: index1 -> output left index 2\n\n                right0: index0 -> output right index 1\n                right1: index1 -> output right index 2\n\n            So the pairs: (1,1) and (2,2)\n\n            But wait, the example output for the sample input does not use consecutive indices. \n\n            However, the example input provided in the problem is:\n\n                Input:\n                    10\n                    codeforces\n                    dodivthree\n\n                Output:\n                    5\n                    7 8\n                    4 9\n                    2 2\n                    9 10\n                    3 1\n\n            This means the pairs are:\n\n                (7,8), (4,9), (2,2), (9,10), (3,1)\n\n            So the indices in the output are 1-indexed and refer to the boot positions.\n\n            We must output the indices (the position in the input, starting at 1).\n\n            Therefore, we must remember the original indices.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Read n, then l and r.\n\n        2. Separate the boots by type (fixed or '?') and record the indices.\n\n        3. For fixed boots, count the frequency for left and right for each letter.\n\n        4. Compute x = sum_{c in letters} min(count_left_fixed(c), count_right_fixed(c))\n\n        5. Then, \n            A = total_fixed_left - x   [remaining fixed left]\n            C = total_fixed_right - x   [remaining fixed right]\n            B = n - total_fixed_left    [left '?']\n            D = n - total_fixed_right    [right '?']\n\n        6. Then, m1 = min(A, D)   [fixed left matched with right '?']\n           m2 = min(C, B)          [fixed right matched with left '?']\n\n        7. Then, rem_left_q = B - m2\n           rem_right_q = D - m1\n\n        8. Then, m3 = min(rem_left_q, rem_right_q)\n\n        9. Total pairs = x + m1 + m2 + m3\n\n        But wait: is that the maximum? \n\n        However, note: the above procedure gives the total pairs. But the problem asks to output the pairs.\n\n        We must output the pairs.\n\n        How to output the pairs?\n\n        We have to know which boots form the pairs.\n\n        We broke the problem into four parts:\n\n            Part 1: x pairs from fixed boots of the same color.\n\n            Part 2: m1 pairs: fixed left boots (that were not matched in part1) with right '?' boots.\n\n            Part 3: m2 pairs: fixed right boots (not matched in part1) with left '?' boots.\n\n            Part 4: m3 pairs: between left '?' boots and right '?' boots.\n\n        However, note: the same boot cannot be used twice.\n\n        We must assign:\n\n            For part1: we need to know which fixed boots of the same color were matched. We can do:\n\n                For each color c, we have lc = count_left_fixed(c), rc = count_right_fixed(c)\n                Then, we can match min(lc,rc) pairs for color c.\n\n            We can store the indices for fixed boots of each color.\n\n        Steps for output:\n\n            We need to output k = x + m1 + m2 + m3 pairs, each pair is (left_index, right_index) in 1-indexed.\n\n            We must not use the same boot twice.\n\n        Plan:\n\n            Step 1: For part1 (x pairs):\n\n                For each color c, let left_list[c] = sorted list of indices (in increasing order) for left fixed boots of color c.\n                For each color c, let right_list[c] = sorted list of indices for right fixed boots of color c.\n\n                Then, for each color c:\n                    take the first min(lc,rc) from left_list[c] and right",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is defined based on their colors: two specific colors are compatible if they are the same, while an indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves matching left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The key observation is that '?' can match any color, which simplifies the matching process. The solution involves categorizing boots into fixed colors and '?' and then strategically matching them to maximize the number of pairs.\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Fixed Boots Matching**: First, match boots with fixed colors (non '?') that have the same color. This is done by counting occurrences of each color in both left and right boots and matching them in pairs.\n   - **Handling Remaining Boots**: After matching fixed boots, the remaining fixed boots must be matched with '?' boots from the opposite side. Additionally, any leftover '?' boots can be paired among themselves.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Frequency Counting**: For each color, count how many times it appears in left and right boots.\n   - **Greedy Matching**: Use a greedy approach to match fixed boots first, then use '?' boots to match the remaining fixed boots, and finally pair leftover '?' boots.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently processes the input by leveraging frequency counts and sorting, resulting in a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting operations, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total_fixed_left = 0\n    total_fixed_right = 0\n    fixed_left_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    fixed_right_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    q_left_indices = []\n    q_right_indices = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            q_left_indices.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            total_fixed_left += 1\n            fixed_left_dict[char].append(i+1)\n            \n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            q_right_indices.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            total_fixed_right += 1\n            fixed_right_dict[char].append(i+1)\n            \n    q_left_count = len(q_left_indices)\n    q_right_count = len(q_right_indices)\n    \n    fixed_left_list = []\n    for char in fixed_left_dict:\n        fixed_left_list.extend(fixed_left_dict[char])\n    fixed_left_list.sort()\n    \n    fixed_right_list = []\n    for char in fixed_right_dict:\n        fixed_right_list.extend(fixed_right_dict[char])\n    fixed_right_list.sort()\n    \n    freq_left = defaultdict(int)\n    for char in fixed_left_list:\n        freq_left[char] += 1\n        \n    freq_right = defaultdict(int)\n    for char in fixed_right_list:\n        freq_right[char] += 1\n        \n    x = 0\n    for char in set(fixed_left_list) | set(fixed_right_list):\n        lc = freq_left.get(char, 0)\n        rc = freq_right.get(char, 0)\n        x += min(lc, rc)\n        \n    A = total_fixed_left -

Indices of fixed boots are stored with their respective colors, while indices of '?' boots are stored separately.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: For each color, the counts of left and right fixed boots are recorded.\n4. **Matching Fixed Boots**: The algorithm matches fixed boots of the same color by comparing counts and pairing them in sorted order.\n5. **Handling Remaining Boots**: The remaining fixed boots are matched with '?' boots from the opposite side. Leftover '?' boots are then paired among themselves.\n6. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, showing the maximum number of pairs and the pairs themselves, ensuring no boot is used more than once.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging sorting and greedy matching, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
