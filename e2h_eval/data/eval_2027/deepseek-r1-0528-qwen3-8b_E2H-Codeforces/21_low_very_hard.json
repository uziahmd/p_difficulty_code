The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes with even numbers (E_c) and odd numbers (O_c)\n   Keys with even numbers (E_k) and odd numbers (O_k)\n\n Conditions:\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key (because even + odd = odd).\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key (because odd + even = odd).\n\n So, we have two independent bipartite matching problems? Actually, note that the matching is constrained by the condition above.\n\n But note: we cannot use one key twice, and one chest once.\n\n The problem becomes: \n   We want to match as many chests as possible. The matching is between:\n     Chestes (even and odd) and Keys (even and odd) with the rule:\n        even chest -> odd key\n        odd chest -> even key\n\n However, we are not forced to use the same parity for matching in the same way? Actually, the condition is fixed.\n\n Steps:\n   1. Separate the chests and keys by parity.\n\n   Let:\n      E_c = number of even chests\n      O_c = number of odd chests\n\n      E_k = number of even keys\n      O_k = number of odd keys\n\n   Then, the even chests can only be matched with odd keys, and odd chests can only be matched with even keys.\n\n   The maximum matching we can get from even chests is limited by the available odd keys, and vice versa.\n\n   However, note: we are not forced to use all keys. We are trying to maximize the total chests.\n\n   We can open at most min(E_c, O_k) chests from the even chests (using odd keys) and at most min(O_c, E_k) chests from the odd chests (using even keys). \n\n   But wait, is that really independent? Actually, yes because the sets of keys used for even chests (odd keys) and for odd chests (even keys) are disjoint.\n\n   Therefore, the total maximum chests we can open is:\n        min(E_c, O_k) + min(O_c, E_k)\n\n   Let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd, 14->even, 6->even, 2->even, 11->odd\n        E_c = 3, O_c = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8->even, 4->even, 7->odd, 20->even\n        E_k = 3, O_k = 1\n\n   Then, from even chests (3): we can use at most min(3, O_k)=min(3,1)=1\n          from odd chests (2): we can use at most min(2, E_k)=min(2,3)=2\n          total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E_c=5, O_c=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> O_k=1, E_k=0\n\n   Then, from even chests: min(5,1)=1\n         from odd chests: min(0,0)=0\n         total=1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even -> E_c=1, O_c=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0\n\n   Then, from even chests: min(1,0)=0\n         from odd chests: 0\n         total=0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Read n, m.\n   Read list of n integers for chests.\n   Read list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Count:\n        even_chest = count of even numbers in chest list\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = count of even numbers in key list\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   Then, answer = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n   Print the answer.\n\n However, let me think: is there any constraint that we cannot use more",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys, given that a key can only open a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. This means one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that a chest with an even number can only be opened by a key with an odd number, and vice versa. Therefore, we can categorize the chests and keys into two groups based on their parity (even or odd).\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting how many chests and keys are even and odd. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys (since even chests require odd keys).\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys (since odd chests require even keys).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves simple counting and arithmetic operations. We count the number of even and odd chests and keys, then apply the above logic to compute the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once, leading to a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: We count how many chests and keys have even numbers. The remaining chests and keys are implicitly odd.\n3. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by adding the minimum of even chests and odd keys (since even chests need odd keys) and the minimum of odd chests and even keys (since odd chests need even keys). This gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened under the given constraints.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
