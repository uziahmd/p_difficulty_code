In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'.\n We have three tiles initially.\n\n We can draw any number of extra tiles (each draw adds one tile) and we want the minimum number of draws to form at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if she already has a mentsu (0 draws).\n    - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same digit and same suit). \n        Example: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> valid.\n    - Shuntsu: three sequential digits (with consecutive numbers) and same suit. \n        Example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> valid. Note: [5m,6m,7m] is valid, but [9m,1m,2m] is not because it's not consecutive and same suit.\n\n 2. If not, then consider drawing 1 tile. Then we will have 4 tiles. We need to check if there exists a way to form a mentsu by drawing one tile.\n\n    However, note that sometimes drawing one tile might form a mentsu even if we don't have any initially. But we start with 3, so we can consider:\n\n    Possibilities for 1 draw:\n        - We can form a koutsu: if we have two of the same tile, then drawing one more would complete a triplet.\n          Example: [1m,1m,?] -> drawing 1m completes the triplet.\n\n        - We can form a shuntsu: \n          Consider each distinct tile (by suit) and look for sequences.\n\n          For example, if we have [1m,2m,?] then drawing 3m completes the sequence.\n\n          Also, we might have two tiles that can be part of two different sequences? But note: we are only concerned with forming one mentsu.\n\n    But note: we can also draw any tile, so we are allowed to choose which one to draw.\n\n 3. If not, then check for 2 draws: \n    - With two draws, we have 5 tiles. We can form a mentsu if we can get a triplet or a sequence.\n\n    However, note that with two draws we might complete a triplet if we have one tile missing from a triplet (i.e., two of the same and one more needed) OR if we have one tile and we draw two more of the same, but wait: actually, two draws could also complete two different pairs? But we only need one mentsu.\n\n    Alternatively, we might form a sequence by having two tiles that are adjacent and then drawing the third.\n\n    Actually, we have to consider: what are the minimal cases?\n\n    Let's break down:\n\n    Case 0: Already a mentsu -> 0\n\n    Case 1: After drawing 0, no mentsu. Then check for possibility of 1 draw.\n\n        Possibility 1: Koutsu: if we have two of the same tile, then we can complete a triplet by drawing one more. But note: if we have three same, then we already have a mentsu (case 0). So for case 1, we require exactly two same.\n\n        Possibility 2: Shuntsu: \n            For each suit, group the tiles by suit and then by number.\n\n            In a given suit, we have some numbers. We need three consecutive numbers.\n\n            How many tiles do we have in a suit? It can be 1, 2, or 3 (but if 3 and they are consecutive then we have a shuntsu, else not).\n\n            But note: we can have multiple suits.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','3p']: \n                In manzu: [1,2] -> we need 3 to complete the sequence. So one draw (3m) would complete.\n\n            However, we might have two non-consecutive numbers and then we can complete by drawing the middle one? Actually, for a sequence we need three consecutive.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> we have two possibilities: \n                We can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3m, or [2,3,4] by drawing 3m. But note: we can only draw one tile. However, we can only draw one tile so we cannot complete both. But we only need one mentsu.\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to choose the tile arbitrarily. So we can fix the tile to be drawn.\n\n            But wait: we are not forced to use all four tiles. We just need one mentsu. So with four tiles, we can ignore one. \n\n            However, the problem says: after drawing, we have a set of tiles, and we must have at least one mentsu. The mentsu can be formed by any three tiles.\n\n            So in the hand of four tiles, we can form a mentsu if there is a triplet or a sequence.\n\n            But note: the triplet requires three identical. The sequence requires three consecutive in the same suit.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m','3m'] -> now we have four manzu. But we don't need to use all. We can use [1m,2m,3m] as a sequence.\n\n            However, we are drawing one tile and then we have four. But we don't know which tile we draw. We can choose optimally.\n\n            Therefore, for one draw we can complete a shuntsu if:\n\n                There exists a suit and a set of two or three numbers such that by adding one number (the missing one in a consecutive triplet) we can form a consecutive triplet.\n\n            However, note: we might have two identical tiles and then we can complete a triplet (koutsu) by drawing one, or we might have two adjacent numbers and then the third one is missing.\n\n            But note: we might also have two different suits. We can complete a shuntsu in one suit only.\n\n            So for one draw, we can complete:\n\n                Option 1: koutsu: if we have at least two of the same tile.\n\n                Option 2: shuntsu: if for some suit, we have two consecutive numbers and the next or previous number is missing, but note: we can also have three numbers that are not consecutive, but we are missing one in the middle.\n\n            Actually, let me restructure:\n\n            We have three tiles. We can draw one. Then we have four.\n\n            We want to know: is there a way to draw one tile such that the hand contains at least one mentsu?\n\n            Conditions:\n\n            - Triplet: if we have two of a tile, then drawing one more of that tile gives a triplet.\n\n            - Sequence: if we have two tiles of the same suit and they form two consecutive numbers (like 1 and 2) then drawing the 3 (if the suit is the same) would complete [1,2,3]. Similarly, if we have [2,3] we can draw 1 or 4? Actually, [2,3,4] is consecutive. But note: the numbers are from 1 to 9.\n\n            However, note: the sequence must be three consecutive numbers. So:\n\n                [n-1, n, n+1] is a sequence? Actually, no: the sequence is [n, n+1, n+2] or [n-2, n-1, n]? \n\n            Actually, the definition: three sequential numbered tiles. So [5s,6s,7s] is valid. But [5s,7s,6s] is also valid because order doesn't matter.\n\n            So we need three consecutive numbers: meaning the set {a, a+1, a+2}.\n\n            Now, with two tiles (say we have two tiles of the same suit, and they are x and y), then the missing tile for the sequence must be either x-1 or x+1 (if x and x+1 are present) or similarly for y.\n\n            Actually, if we have two tiles of the same suit, say [x, y] (with x != y), then we can try to form a sequence if the two tiles are consecutive or not.\n\n            But note: we might have two tiles that are two apart: e.g., [1,3] in the same suit. Then we can draw 2 to form [1,2,3].\n\n            So the condition for a shuntsu with one draw is:\n\n                There exists a suit and three numbers (a, a+1, a+2) such that we have two of these three and the third is missing. And the two we have are in the same suit.\n\n            However, note: we can also have three tiles of the same suit, but they are not consecutive. Then we can complete a sequence by drawing the one in the middle? Actually, no: the sequence requires three consecutive. \n\n            But wait: if we have [1m, 2m, 4m] then we don't have a consecutive triplet. But we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (ignoring 4m) OR we can draw 3m to form [2m,3m,4m] (ignoring 1m). So we have two ways.\n\n            However, note: the problem does not require using all tiles. So we can form one mentsu and ignore the rest.\n\n            Therefore, for shuntsu with one draw: we need to have two tiles (same suit) and they are two consecutive numbers, or two numbers that are one apart (so we can complete the gap). Actually, the condition is that the two numbers must be part of a consecutive triplet (three consecutive) and the third is missing.\n\n            How to check for a given suit?\n\n                Let the suit be S, and the numbers in that suit be a list L (of length 1,2, or 3). \n\n                If we have two or three tiles in suit S, then we can check for every consecutive triplet (from 1 to 7: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], ... [7,8,9]) if the hand (in suit S) has two of the three and we are missing one.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to draw one tile, so we can only complete one triplet per suit.\n\n            However, we can consider all suits.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider: \n\n                Count the frequency of each tile.\n\n                Then, for koutsu: if any tile appears at least two times, then one draw can complete.\n\n                For shuntsu: for each suit, we can collect the distinct numbers. Then, for each consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) in the range 1-9, check if the set of numbers in that suit contains two of the three. Then one draw (adding the missing one) will complete.\n\n            But wait: what if we have two different suits? We can only draw one tile, so we can only complete one mentsu. Therefore, we must check all suits independently.\n\n            However, note: the hand has three tiles. We might have two tiles in one suit and one in another. Then we can complete the mentsu in the suit that has two tiles.\n\n            So algorithm for one draw:\n\n                Option 1: Check for koutsu: if there exists a tile that appears at least two times, then we can complete a triplet by drawing one more of that tile.\n\n                Option 2: Check for shuntsu: for each suit, consider the distinct numbers in that suit. Then, for each consecutive triplet (from 1 to 7) in that suit, if the hand has two of the three numbers, then we can complete by drawing the third.\n\n                But note: what if the hand has two tiles in a suit and they are the same? Then we cannot form a shuntsu (because we need three distinct consecutive numbers). So we must consider only the distinct numbers? Actually, no: we can have duplicates, but a shuntsu requires three distinct consecutive numbers. \n\n                Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> we have two 1m and one 2m. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m? But note: we have two 1m. The definition of shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles. The numbers must be distinct. So [1m,1m,2m] is not a shuntsu because we have two 1m. But we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (using one 1m, one 2m, and one 3m) and we have an extra 1m. That is acceptable because the mentsu only requires three tiles.\n\n            Therefore, when checking for shuntsu, we should consider the counts: but actually, we don't care about duplicates beyond one because we only need one of each. So we can use a set of distinct numbers per suit? Not exactly: because we might have two 1m and then we can use one 1m and then we have another 1m that we can ignore. \n\n            However, we are allowed to ignore the rest. So for shuntsu, we require three consecutive numbers, each at least one. So even if we have duplicates, we can use one occurrence.\n\n            So for shuntsu, we can consider the multiset of numbers per suit. We need three consecutive numbers, and we can use at most one copy of each.\n\n            Therefore, we can reduce the hand per suit to the set of distinct numbers? \n\n            Actually, no: because we might have two copies of a number and then we can use that number in two different sequences? But note: we are only concerned with forming one mentsu.\n\n            However, for the purpose of forming a shuntsu, we only need one copy of each consecutive number. So we can represent the hand per suit by the set of numbers present (at least one copy).\n\n            But wait: what if we have two copies of a number and we are trying to form two different sequences? Actually, we don't care because we are only forming one. \n\n            So for shuntsu: we can consider the set of numbers (ignoring duplicates) for each suit.\n\n            However, note: what if we have two copies of the same number? Then we still only need one to form a sequence. So we can use the set.\n\n            But wait: what if we have two copies of the same number and two different numbers that are consecutive? Then we have three consecutive numbers? Actually, no: we need three consecutive. \n\n            Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> set is {1,2}. Then we are missing 3. So we can complete by drawing 3m.\n\n            So the condition for shuntsu with one draw is: there exists a suit S and a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that the set of numbers in S contains at least two of these three.\n\n            Why two? Because we are missing one. Then we draw the missing one.\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to draw one tile. So we can complete one gap.\n\n            But note: we might have two gaps? But we are only drawing one tile.\n\n            Example: [1m, 3m, 4m] -> set is {1,3,4}. We are missing 2 for the triplet [1,2,3] and we are missing nothing for [3,4,5] (we have 3,4, so we need 5). But wait, we have 3 and 4, so we can form [3,4,5] by drawing 5m. So we can complete [3,4,5] with one draw.\n\n            Therefore, we need to check for every consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) in the same suit: if the hand has at least two of the three numbers.\n\n            However, note: the hand might have two different triplets in the same suit? Then we can complete one of them.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m,4m] (but wait, we only have three tiles initially). Actually, we have three tiles: [1m,3m,4m] (as above) and we can complete [3,4,5] by drawing 5m.\n\n            But also, we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 2m. So we have two possibilities.\n\n            So the condition is: for a given suit S, if there exists a consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) such that the hand has at least two of the three numbers, then one draw (adding the missing one) will complete that triplet.\n\n            But note: we might have multiple triplets in the same suit. We only need one.\n\n            However, we must consider that we are drawing one tile and we can choose which one to draw. So if at least one consecutive triplet (anywhere) is missing one tile (and we have the other two) then one draw is sufficient.\n\n            But note: we might have two triplets that are overlapping. Example: [2m,3m,4m] (three distinct numbers). Then we have two consecutive triplets: [1,2,3] is missing 1, [2,3,4] is complete, [3,4,5] is missing 5. But wait, [2,3,4] is complete? Yes, so we already have a mentsu (shuntsu) in this case. But we are in the case where we have three tiles and no mentsu initially.\n\n            Actually, we are checking for one draw: so we are assuming that initially there is no mentsu. So in the hand [2m,3m,4m] we have a shuntsu, so we wouldn't be in the one-draw case.\n\n            Therefore, for one draw, we require that initially we don't have a mentsu.\n\n            So the plan:\n\n            Step 0: Parse the input.\n\n            Step 1: Check if we have a mentsu already (0 draws). Then output 0.\n\n            Step 2: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile (output 1).\n\n            Step 3: Otherwise, check if we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles (output 2).\n\n            But note: is it possible that we need more than two draws? \n\n            Consider: we have three tiles, and we can draw two. Then we have five tiles.\n\n            What are the possibilities?\n\n            - Triplet: if we have one tile repeated once, then drawing two more of that tile gives a triplet (then total three of that tile). But if we have two distinct tiles, say two of A and one of B, then we can draw two more of A to get a triplet.\n\n            - Shuntsu: we might have two tiles in the same suit, and they are two apart (like 1 and 3). Then we need to draw the 2. But that's one draw. \n\n            But wait, we are already checking for one draw. \n\n            Alternatively, we might have two tiles that are not consecutive and we need two draws to complete the sequence? \n\n            Actually, we can consider:\n\n                Triplet: if we have one tile (only one copy), then we need to draw two copies of that tile to form a triplet.\n\n                Shuntsu: if we have one tile in a suit, then we need to draw two consecutive ones? \n\n            Example: hand = [1m, 1m, 1m] -> already a triplet (0 draws).\n\n            hand = [1m, 1m, 2m] -> triplet can be completed by drawing one more 1m. So one draw.\n\n            hand = [1m, 1m, 4m] -> \n                Triplet: we have two 1m, so we can complete by drawing one more 1m (then we have three 1m) -> one draw.\n\n                But wait, is that the minimal? Actually, yes.\n\n            However, consider: hand = [1m, 4m, 7m] (three tiles, all same suit and not consecutive). \n\n            We can complete a triplet by drawing two more 1m (then we have three 1m) -> two draws.\n\n            Or complete a sequence: we have three separate numbers. We can complete a sequence by drawing the two missing ones for one of the sequences? \n\n            Actually, we can form a sequence with two draws: \n\n                We can form [1,2,3] by drawing 2m and 3m? But wait, we are allowed to choose arbitrarily. Actually, we can draw two tiles and then we have five. We can form a sequence by having three consecutive numbers. \n\n                Example: [1m, 4m, 7m] and we draw 2m and 3m: then we have [1m,2m,3m] (sequence) and [4m,7m] (ignored). So two draws.\n\n            But note: we can also form a triplet: draw two 1m's to make [1m,1m,1m,4m,7m] -> then we have a triplet.\n\n            So two draws is sufficient.\n\n            However, is there a way to form a mentsu with one draw? \n\n                Triplet: we have one 1m -> we need two more 1m to make triplet? Actually, no: we have two 1m? In our example we have one 1m. \n\n                Actually, the example [1m,4m,7m]: \n                    Each tile appears once.\n\n                So for triplet: we need to draw two more of the same tile (for example, two 1m) to make a triplet.\n\n                For shuntsu: we can complete a sequence if we have two consecutive numbers. We don't. \n\n                So one draw is not enough.\n\n            Therefore, the answer for [1m,4m,7m] is 2.\n\n            But wait, what if we draw two different tiles? \n\n            Example: draw 2m and 3m: then we have [1m,2m,3m,4m,7m] -> then we have a sequence [1m,2m,3m].\n\n            So two draws.\n\n            Now, what is the general approach?\n\n            We can consider:\n\n            Let the hand be represented as a multiset (or counts) of tiles.\n\n            We are going to consider two types: koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n            For koutsu: \n                We can count the frequency of each distinct tile.\n\n                Then, for a tile with frequency f, the number of additional tiles needed is (3 - f) if f < 3, and 0 if f==3.\n\n                But we are allowed to draw any tile, so we can choose to draw the same tile again.\n\n            However, we are not limited to making a triplet of the existing tile. We can also draw a new tile and then make a triplet of that? But note: we need three identical. So if we draw two of a new tile, then we have a triplet of that new tile. But wait, we are only drawing two tiles, so we can draw two of the same new tile.\n\n            But note: we can also mix: we might have two tiles that are the same, then we draw one more to complete the triplet.\n\n            Actually, we are free to draw any tiles. So the minimal draws for a triplet is:\n\n                Let f_max = maximum frequency of any tile.\n\n                Then, we can complete a triplet by drawing (3 - f_max) tiles (all of that tile).\n\n            However, we can also consider: we might have multiple tiles that are the same, but we can choose which one to complete.\n\n            But note: we are only required to have one mentsu. So we can focus on the tile that requires the least draws.\n\n            However, wait: we might complete a triplet by drawing a new tile (not present) and then we don't need to consider the existing ones. \n\n            Example: if we have [1m,2m,3m] (no triplet initially) then we can draw two 4m and then we have a triplet of 4m. But that requires two draws.\n\n            So the minimal draws for a triplet is min_{tile} (3 - count(tile)) if we are completing an existing tile, but we can also create a new triplet by drawing three of a new tile? \n\n            Actually, we can draw three of a new tile (if we haven't drawn any) to form a triplet. But that requires three draws.\n\n            However, we are trying to minimize the draws. So if we have two of a tile, we can complete by drawing one. If we have one, we can complete by drawing two. If we have none, we can complete by drawing three.\n\n            But note: we might complete a triplet by drawing two of a tile that is not present and then one more? Actually, no: we need three. \n\n            So the minimal draws for a triplet is:\n\n                Let f_i be the frequency of tile i.\n\n                Then, the minimal draws for a triplet is the minimum over:\n\n                  Option A: for each tile i, if f_i >= 1, then we can complete by drawing (3 - f_i) tiles (all of tile i). But note: we can also complete a triplet of a tile that we haven't seen? Then we draw 3 tiles.\n\n                So the minimal draws for a triplet is the minimum value of (3 - max_frequency) and (3) if we choose a new tile.\n\n                Actually, we can choose any tile to complete. So we can consider:\n\n                  candidate_triplet = min( (3 - max_freq) , 3 )   ??? \n\n                But wait, if we have one tile, then 3-1=2, and if we don't have that tile, then we need 3. But we are allowed to draw any, so we can always complete a triplet by drawing three of a new tile.\n\n                However, we can also use an existing tile: if we have at least one copy of a tile, then we need 2 more. If we have two, then 1 more.\n\n                Therefore, the minimal draws for a triplet is (3 - max_frequency) if max_frequency>=1, but if we don't have any tile repeated, then we can use a new tile and it would take 3 draws.\n\n                Actually, if we have no tile repeated, then the maximum frequency is 1, so 3-1=2, but wait: we can complete a triplet by drawing three of a new tile (which takes 3) or by drawing two of an existing tile (which takes 2). \n\n                However, note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So we can choose to draw two of an existing tile (which gives a triplet of that existing tile) or three of a new tile. The minimal is 2.\n\n                But wait: if we have three distinct tiles, then we can complete a triplet by drawing two of one of them (the one we have one copy of). Then we have four tiles: the original three plus two more, so total five. But we only need one mentsu.\n\n            So for triplet, the minimal draws is:\n\n                Let f_max = max frequency of any tile (each tile is identified by (digit,suit))\n\n                Then, if f_max >= 1, we can complete a triplet by drawing (3 - f_max) tiles (of that tile).\n\n                But if we have multiple tiles with frequency 1, we can choose the one that minimizes the draws. Actually, we can choose the tile with the highest frequency (which minimizes the draws).\n\n                However, we can also consider drawing a new tile (not present in the hand) and then we need 3 draws.\n\n                So the minimal draws for triplet is min( (3 - f_max), 3 )? \n\n                But wait: if we have one copy of a tile, then (3-1)=2, and 2 < 3, so we choose 2.\n\n                But if we have no tile repeated (f_max=1 for all, but actually we have three distinct tiles) then we can complete by drawing two of one of them (2 draws) or three of a new one (3 draws). So minimal is 2.\n\n                However, note: we have three distinct tiles. Then the maximum frequency is 1. Then 3-1=2, so that matches.\n\n                But what if we have two distinct tiles, one with two copies and the other with one? Then max_freq=2, so 3-2=1.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal draws for a triplet is (3 - max_freq) if we use an existing tile, but if we don't have any tile with frequency>=1 (which is impossible because we have three tiles, so at least one tile must appear at least once) then we use 3. But note: we can use an existing tile as long as there's at least one tile. \n\n            Actually, the formula for triplet is: \n                Let f_max = max frequency (over all tiles) in the hand.\n                Then, the minimal draws for a triplet is (3 - f_max) if we use an existing tile, but we can also use a new tile which would require 3 draws. So the minimal is min( (3 - f_max), 3 )? \n\n            Wait, no: if we have a tile with frequency 2, then (3-2)=1, which is less than 3. If we have a tile with frequency 1, then (3-1)=2, which is less than 3. So we don't need to consider the new tile separately because using an existing tile is always better or equal.\n\n            But wait: if we have a tile with frequency 3, then 3-3=0, so 0 draws.\n\n            So the minimal draws for a triplet is (3 - max_freq) if max_freq >= 1, and if max_freq==0 (which cannot happen because we have three tiles) then 3. But we have three tiles so max_freq>=1.\n\n            Actually, we have three tiles, so max_freq is at least 1.\n\n            Therefore, for triplet, minimal draws is (3 - max_freq) if we use an existing tile.\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to draw any tile. We are not forced to complete an existing tile. But why would we complete a new tile? Because if we complete a new tile, we need 3 draws, but if we complete an existing tile, we need (3 - max_freq) which is <= 2 (if max_freq>=1). So indeed, we would always prefer to complete an existing tile.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal draws for a triplet is (3 - max_freq).\n\n            But wait: what if we have two different tiles with high frequency? \n\n            Example: [1m,1m,1m] -> max_freq=3, draws=0.\n\n            Example: [1m,1m,2p] -> max_freq=2, draws=1.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> max_freq=1, draws=2.\n\n            But wait, [1m,2m,3m] is three distinct tiles. Then we can complete a triplet by drawing two of one of them (for example, two 1m) and then we have [1m,1m,1m,2m,3m] -> that's two draws.\n\n            So the triplet option for [1m,2m,3m] requires 2 draws.\n\n            However, is there a shuntsu option that requires fewer draws?\n\n            For [1m,2m,3m]: we already have a shuntsu (0 draws). So we don't consider this in the triplet part.\n\n            Now, for shuntsu:\n\n            We need to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n            We can consider: for each suit, we have a multiset of numbers.\n\n            Then, for each consecutive triplet (a, a+1, a+2) (for a from 1 to 7), we can check:\n\n                Let the hand have in suit S: a set of numbers (with multiplicities, but we only need one copy per number).\n\n                Then, the number of draws needed to complete the triplet [a, a+1, a+2] in suit S is (3 - (number of distinct numbers in S that are in {a, a+1, a+2})).\n\n            But note: we are allowed to draw any tile, so we can choose to complete this particular sequence.\n\n            Then, the minimal draws for shuntsu is the minimum over all suits and all consecutive triplets of (3 - count) where count is the number of distinct numbers in the hand (in that suit) that are in the triplet.\n\n            However, we must note: we can also complete a sequence by drawing tiles that are not necessarily from the hand. We can draw any tile.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m] already has the sequence, so 0 draws.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] (suit m): \n                We have two numbers: 1 and 2 and 4. \n                Check triplet [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2, missing 3 -> 1 draw.\n                Check triplet [2,3,4]: we have 2 and 4, missing 3 -> 1 draw.\n\n            Example: [1m,3m,4m] (suit m):\n                Check [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 3, missing 2 -> 1 draw.\n                Check [2,3,4]: we have 3 and 4, missing 2 -> 1 draw.\n\n            Example: [1m,4m,7m] (suit m):\n                Check [1,2,3]: we have 1, missing 2,3 -> 2 draws.\n                Check [2,3,4]: we have 4, missing 2,3 -> 2 draws.\n                Check [3,4,5]: we have 4, missing 3,5 -> 2 draws.\n                Check [4,5,6]: we have 4, missing 5,6 -> 2 draws.\n                ... until [7,8,9]: we have 7, missing 8,9 -> 2 draws.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal draws for shuntsu is the minimum over all suits and all consecutive triplets of (3 - (number of distinct numbers in the hand (in that suit) that are in the triplet)).\n\n            But note: we can complete a sequence by drawing multiple tiles, but we are allowed to draw any tile. And we are counting the minimal draws.\n\n            Then, the overall minimal draws is the minimum between the triplet draws and the shuntsu draws.\n\n            However, note: we might have multiple mentsu (triplet and/or shuntsu) and we are allowed to choose the best one.\n\n            So the answer is the minimum between:\n\n                triplet_draws = (3 - max_freq)   [if we use an existing tile, but note: we are considering the entire hand, and we can choose any tile to complete, so we are using the existing tile with the highest frequency]\n\n                Actually, wait: we are not limited to one suit for triplet. Triplet must be same tile (same digit and same suit). So we are already considering the entire hand.\n\n            But wait: the above triplet_draws is computed from the entire hand (considering all tiles). However, we must note that the triplet must be of a single tile (same suit and same digit). So we are correct.\n\n            However, the shuntsu_draws: we are considering per suit.\n\n            Therefore, the overall minimal draws is:\n\n                ans = min( triplet_draws, shuntsu_draws )\n\n            But wait: is it possible that we can form a triplet and a shuntsu simultaneously with the same draws? Then we take the minimal.\n\n            However, note: the problem is asking the minimum number of draws to have at least one mentsu.\n\n            But there is a catch: we are drawing tiles and the hand grows. The draws for triplet and shuntsu are independent. We can choose which mentsu to form.\n\n            However, we must consider that the same draw can help both? Actually, we are counting separately.\n\n            Example: [1m,1m,2m] \n\n                Triplet: we have two 1m, so we can complete by drawing one 1m -> 1 draw.\n\n                Shuntsu: in manzu, we have [1,2]. We can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3m (1 draw). \n\n                So the minimal is 1.\n\n            But note: the above formula for shuntsu_draws for [1m,1m,2m] in manzu:\n\n                For the consecutive triplet [0,1,2] (actually starts at 1): \n                    [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 2 -> missing 3: 1 draw.\n\n                So the minimal draws is 1.\n\n            However, our triplet_draws was 1 (because max_freq=2, 3-2=1) and shuntsu_draws was 1, so min is 1.\n\n            But wait: is the shuntsu_draws calculation correct? \n\n                For [1m,1m,2m]: \n                    In manzu: distinct numbers {1,2}\n                    For [1,2,3]: we have two numbers, so missing 1 -> 3-2=1.\n\n            So yes.\n\n            However, what if we have two different suits?\n\n            Example: [1m,1m,2p]\n\n                Triplet: max_freq=2 (for 1m) -> 1 draw.\n\n                Shuntsu: \n                    In manzu: {1} -> no consecutive triplet (we need three consecutive)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu (0 draws). If not, we then check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu (1 draw). If still not possible, we check if drawing two tiles can form a mentsu (2 draws). The solution involves evaluating both types of mentsu: koutsu (three identical tiles) and shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Koutsu Check**: For koutsu, count the frequency of each tile. The minimal draws needed to form a triplet is `3 - max_frequency` (if using an existing tile) or 3 (if using a new tile). Since using an existing tile is always better or equal, we use `3 - max_frequency`.\n   - **Shuntsu Check**: For shuntsu, for each suit, check all possible consecutive triplets (from 1-2-3 up to 7-8-9). For each triplet, count how many numbers are present in the hand. The minimal draws needed is `3 - count` for the best triplet across all suits.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Parsing the input tiles.\n   - Checking for existing mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu) in the initial three tiles.\n   - Calculating the minimal draws required for koutsu and shuntsu if no mentsu exists initially.\n   - The answer is the minimum of the draws required for koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each tile once and checks all possible consecutive triplets (7 per suit). Given the small input size (3 tiles), the complexity is constant time O(1), making it efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = [t.strip() for t in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing koutsu or shuntsu in the initial three tiles.\n    has_koutsu = False\n    has_shuntsu = False\n    \n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_tile = defaultdict(int)\n    suit_tiles = defaultdict(set)\n    \n    for t in tiles:\n        num = t[0]\n        suit = t[1]\n        count_tile[t] += 1\n        suit_tiles[suit].add(num)\n        \n    for t in tiles:\n        if count_tile[t] >= 3:\n            has_koutsu = True\n            break\n            \n    for suit, nums in suit_tiles.items():\n        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n        n = len(sorted_nums)\n        if n >= 3:\n            for i in range(n-2):\n                if sorted_nums[i]+1 == sorted_nums[i+1] and sorted_nums[i+1]+1 == sorted_nums[i+2]:\n                    has_shuntsu = True\n                    break\n            if has_shuntsu:\n                break\n        else:\n            for a in range(1, 8):\n                if all(num in nums for num in [str(a), str(a+1), str(a+2)]):\n                    has_shuntsu = True\n                    break\n                    \n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Calculate minimal draws for koutsu\n    max_freq = max(count_tile.values())\n    triplet_draws = 3 - max_freq\n    \n    # Calculate minimal draws for shuntsu\n    min_shuntsu_draws = float('inf')\n    for suit, nums in suit_tiles.items():\n        for a in range(1, 8):\n            triplet = {str(a), str(a+1), str(a+2)}\n            present = len(triplet.intersection(nums))\n            needed = 3 - present\n            if needed < 0:\n                needed = 0\n            if needed < min_shuntsu_draws:\n                min_shuntsu_draws = needed\n                \n    ans = min(triplet_draws, min_shuntsu_draws)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is split into individual tiles, each represented as a string combining a digit and a suit character.\n2. **Initial Checks**: The code checks if the initial three tiles already form a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). If found, it prints 0.\n3. **Frequency and Suit Analysis**: The code counts the frequency of each tile and tracks the distinct numbers per suit to evaluate potential shuntsu.\n4. **Triplet Calculation**: The minimal draws for forming a koutsu is calculated as `3 - max_frequency` of any tile.\n5. **Shuntsu Calculation**: For each suit, the code checks all possible consecutive triplets (1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9). The minimal draws needed to complete any such triplet is `3 - count` of existing numbers in the triplet.\n6. **Result**: The answer is the minimum between the draws required for koutsu and shuntsu, printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu with minimal draws, leveraging simple counting and set operations for clarity and correctness.",
