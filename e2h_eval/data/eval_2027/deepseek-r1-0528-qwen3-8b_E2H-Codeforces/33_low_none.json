You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to use each element in s at most once, and we can choose arbitrary positions to replace.\n Since we want the maximum value, we should try to replace digits from left to right (because a digit in a more significant position has higher impact).\n However, note: we cannot introduce leading zeros. But since the original number doesn't have leading zeros, and we are replacing from left to right, if we replace the first digit and the replacement is '0', then we must avoid that.\n\n Approach:\n 1. We are going to consider the digits of `a` from left to right.\n 2. We have a multiset (or sorted list) of available digits from `s`. But note: we can use each at most once, and we are allowed to skip some.\n\n However, we cannot use the same digit twice. So we need to choose the best digit for each position (if any) without exceeding the available ones.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the integer `a` as a string (since it can be up to 10^5 digits, so we don't want to convert to int).\n - Read the sequence `s` as a string.\n\n We want to maximize the number. The idea is to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit for the current position, but we also have to consider that we might not want to use a digit that is too large if we can save it for a later position? Actually, no: because we are processing from left to right, and the leftmost digit has the highest place value. Therefore, we want to make the leftmost digit as large as possible.\n\n However, what if we have two possibilities: \n   Option 1: Use a digit that is just above the current one (say, we have multiple same digits) and save the larger ones for later.\n   Option 2: But note: we are allowed to use at most one operation per element, and each element only once.\n\n But note: we can use at most one replacement per position (we can choose to replace or not). And we can use each element only once.\n\n Alternate approach:\n We are allowed to do at most m replacements, but we can choose which ones. We want to assign the best available digits to the positions.\n\n However, we cannot assign arbitrarily: we must assign in a way that the resulting number is maximized.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We will collect the available digits in `s` and sort them in descending order? But we have to consider that we might not want to use all.\n\n But note: we are only concerned with making the number as large as possible. So:\n\n For the first digit (leftmost), we want to replace it with the largest digit available that is greater than the current digit. But wait: what if there's no digit greater than the current one? Then we leave it. But what if we have a digit that is equal? Then we can use an equal digit and then use the rest for the next positions? Actually, using an equal digit doesn't harm, but we might want to save a larger digit for a subsequent position? However, consider: if we have two digits and we can replace the first with a digit that is not greater but equal, then we might use a larger digit for the second? But if we leave the first as is, then we can use the larger digit for the second. But if we replace the first with an equal digit, then we still have the same number for the first, and we can use the larger digit for the second. However, if we have a choice between two equal digits, we can use one for the first and one for the second, but the first is already the same so it doesn't matter.\n\n However, the problem is: we are allowed to do at most one replacement per position, but we are allowed to skip. So we can also do multiple replacements? Actually, the problem says: \"each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation\", meaning we can use each digit at most once, but we can replace multiple digits (each replacement uses one element from s). But note: we are allowed to use not all.\n\n So we can replace multiple digits. However, we cannot replace the same digit twice.\n\n Now, the strategy:\n\n We want to assign the best available digits (from s) to the positions. But the catch: we can only replace a digit once.\n\n We can think greedily:\n\n We are going to traverse the digits of `a` from left to right. At each digit, we try to see if we can replace it with a digit from `s` that is greater than the current one. But we want to use the smallest replacement that is greater? Or the largest? Actually, we want to reserve the larger digits for later if they are not needed for the current position.\n\n However, note: we are trying to maximize the entire number. The leftmost digit is the most significant. So we want to assign the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing its digits with digits from a provided sequence, using each digit in the sequence at most once. The key insight is that the leftmost digits have the highest place value, so we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits first with the largest possible digits from the sequence that are greater than the current digit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to replace digits in the original number such that the resulting number is maximized. Each digit in the replacement sequence can be used only once. The solution involves processing the digits from left to right (most significant to least significant) and replacing each digit with the largest available digit from the sequence that is greater than the current digit, if such a digit exists.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By processing digits from left to right, we ensure that the most significant digits are maximized first. This greedy approach ensures that we use the best available digits for the highest place values, leading to the maximum possible number.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: The replacement digits are sorted in descending order to facilitate quick access to the largest available digit.\n   - **Greedy Replacement**: For each digit in the original number, starting from the left, we check if there is a digit in the sorted list that is larger than the current digit. If found, we replace the current digit with this digit and remove it from the list to ensure it isn't reused.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: Sorting the replacement digits takes O(m log m) time, where m is the length of the replacement sequence. Processing each digit in the original number (n digits) involves O(n) operations, each potentially requiring an O(m) search if not optimized. However, by maintaining a sorted list and using binary search, we can reduce the search time to O(log m) per digit, leading to an overall complexity of O(n log m + m log m).\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space required is O(m) to store the sorted list of replacement digits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    s_list = sorted([int(d) for d in s_str], reverse=True)\n    \n    n = len(a_str)\n    m = len(s_list)\n    \n    replacements = []\n    index = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_digit = int(a_str[i])\n        while index < m and s_list[index] > current_digit:\n            candidate = s_list[index]\n            if candidate > current_digit:\n                replacements.append(candidate)\n                index += 1\n                break\n            else:\n                index += 1\n                \n    result_digits = []\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_digit = int(a_str[i])\n        if j < len(replacements) and replacements[j] > current_digit:\n            result_digits.append(str(replacements[j]))\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            result_digits.append(a_str[i])\n            \n    print(''.join(result_digits))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The original number and the replacement sequence are read as strings to handle large numbers efficiently.\n2. **Sorting Replacement Digits**: The replacement digits are converted to integers, sorted in descending order, and stored in a list. This allows easy access to the largest available digit during processing.\n3. **Processing Digits**: For each digit in the original number (from left to right), the algorithm checks if there is a larger digit available in the sorted list. If found, it replaces the current digit with this larger digit and moves to the next position.\n4. **Constructing Result**: The result is constructed by combining the original digits and the replaced digits (if any) in order, ensuring the most significant digits are maximized first.\n5. **Output**: The final result is printed as a string, which represents the maximum possible number after all replacements.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number by leveraging sorting and greedy replacement, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
