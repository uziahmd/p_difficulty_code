Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, and then a list of n integers (the found cards) in the second line.\n\n The problem: We have infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x. We found n cards (with numbers that are in the range [-x, x]). We want to find the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum of all the cards becomes zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the sum of the found n cards.\n 2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so the additional cards must sum to -S.\n\n 3. We can use any card from the set {-x, -x+1, ..., x-1, x}. We are allowed to use as many as we want (each card is available infinitely).\n\n 4. We are to find the minimum number of cards needed to make up the deficit (or surplus) of -S.\n\n Observation:\n  - We are allowed to use any integers in the range [-x, x]. The best way to minimize the number of cards is to use the largest absolute value cards because they cover more ground.\n\n 5. However, note that the deficit (or surplus) is an integer. Since the available card values are symmetric, we can think of the problem as: \n    We need to represent the integer T = -S as a linear combination (with nonnegative integer coefficients) of integers from the set { -x, -x+1, ..., x } but note that we can also use positive and negative numbers arbitrarily.\n\n 6. But note: we are not forced to use only one sign. However, the minimal number of cards to represent a target T is at least ceil(|T| / x). Why? Because each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). However, we can mix and match.\n\n 7. Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n    Let k be the minimum number of cards. Then we need to check if there exists a set of k cards (each between -x and x) such that their sum is T.\n\n    Conditions for k cards:\n        - The maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k * x.\n        - The maximum negative sum we can get with k cards is -k * x.\n\n    So, we require that T is in the interval [-k*x, k*x].\n\n    Moreover, we must be able to form T with k cards. But note: we have all integers in between. Actually, with k cards, we can form any integer T such that |T| <= k*x and T ≡ s (mod 1) [but since our numbers are integers, T must be an integer] and note that we can adjust by 1's. However, the key is that the set of achievable sums with k cards is symmetric and consecutive? Not exactly: we can form every integer between -k*x and k*x? \n\n    Actually, no: with k=1, we can form every integer from -x to x. With k=2, we can form every integer from -2*x to 2*x, except possibly some gaps? But note: we can use two cards. For example, with x=2 and k=2, can we form every integer from -4 to 4? \n        -4: (-2, -2)\n        -3: (-2, -1) -> yes\n        -2: (-2, 0) or (-1,-1) etc.\n        ... but wait, actually the set of two cards can form any integer between -4 and 4 because we can choose any two integers in the range [-2,2]. The sum of two integers from [-2,2] can be any integer from -4 to 4.\n\n    However, let me test with x=3 and k=1: we can form [-3,3]. With k=2: we can form from -6 to 6. But is every integer in between achievable?\n        Example: T=1 with x=3 and k=2: \n            We can do (1,0) -> but 0 is available? Yes, because 0 is between -3 and 3. So yes.\n        Example: T=4 with x=3 and k=2: maximum is 6, but 4: (3,1) -> yes.\n\n    Actually, note: we have all integers from -x to x. Then with k cards, we can form any integer between -k*x and k*x, because the step is 1 (since we have consecutive integers). Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that |T| <= k*x.\n\n 8. So the minimal k must satisfy: k >= ceil(|T| / x) because if we take k = floor(|T|/x) then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. The initial set of found cards has a certain sum, and the additional cards must compensate for this sum using the largest possible absolute values to minimize the number of cards required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Total Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the initially found cards. This sum, `S`, is the deficit or surplus that needs to be balanced out by the additional cards.\n2. **Determine the Target**: The target sum for the additional cards should be `-S` to make the total sum zero.\n3. **Minimum Number of Cards**: The key insight is that each additional card can contribute at most `x` (in absolute value) towards balancing the sum. Therefore, the minimum number of cards needed is the smallest integer `k` such that `k * x >= abs(S)`. This is derived from the fact that with `k` cards, the maximum absolute sum achievable is `k * x`.\n4. **Edge Cases**: If the initial sum `S` is already zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, the solution involves finding the ceiling of the absolute value of `S` divided by `x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    deficit = abs(total)\n    k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards `n`, the maximum absolute value `x` for any card, and the list of numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, the answer is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Deficit Calculation**: The absolute value of the total sum is taken to determine the deficit that needs to be covered by additional cards.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: The minimum number of cards required is calculated by dividing the deficit by `x` and rounding up. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations, ensuring efficiency and correctness.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimum number of additional cards needed to balance the sum to zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages mathematical insights to minimize the number of operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
