Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 500000) and we need to compute the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees.\n\n Conditions for a good tree:\n   - Each edge weight is either 1 or -1.\n   - For each vertex i, the product of the edge weights on the edges incident to i (i.e., the edges having i as one endpoint) is -1.\n\n However, note that the condition for each vertex i is stated as: \"the product of the edge weights of all edges having i as one endpoint is -1\". But note: in a tree, the edges incident to i form a star. However, observe that the condition must hold for every vertex.\n\n But note: the problem says \"for each vertex i\", so the condition applies to every vertex.\n\n Let's think about what this implies.\n\n Consider the entire tree. The product condition at a vertex i: \n   Let the edges incident to i have weights w1, w2, ..., wk (k = degree(i)). Then we require w1 * w2 * ... * wk = -1.\n\n Now, note that the entire tree has n-1 edges. The condition must hold for all vertices.\n\n However, consider the entire product over all vertices? Actually, note that each edge is counted twice (once at each endpoint). \n\n But wait: the condition for each vertex i multiplies the incident edges. If we take the product of the conditions for all vertices, then each edge is included twice (at both ends). Therefore, the product of the conditions is:\n\n   (product_{vertex i} (product_{edges e incident to i} w_e)) = (product_{edge e} w_e^2)\n\n Since each edge appears in two conditions (at its two endpoints).\n\n And the condition requires that each vertex condition is -1, so the product of all conditions is (-1)^n.\n\n On the other hand, the product of the conditions is (product_{e} w_e^2) = 1 for every edge (because w_e^2 is either 1 or 1, since w_e is ±1). So we get 1 = (-1)^n.\n\n This implies that n must be even. Therefore, if n is odd, there is no such tree? But wait, the problem states that there are n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1} distinct trees (without the condition) but the condition might restrict the set.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 2 -> Output: 998244352 (which is -1 mod 998244353)\n\n For n=1: There are no edges. The condition for the single vertex: product of edges incident to it is 1 (since there are none) which should be -1 -> fails. So n=1: no good tree? But the problem says n>=1. In the example, they provided input '2' and output is non-zero, but input '1' is not provided.\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"You are given a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5)\".\n\n But note: the example input includes '2', '1', '4', etc. In the example output, the second test case is n=1? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n   ['2', '1', '4', '10', '43434']\n\n and the output is:\n\n   ['998244352', '0', '998244343', '948359297', '86232114']\n\n So the first output corresponds to n=2, the second to n=1, the third to n=4, etc.\n\n For n=1: \n   Condition: the product of edges incident to vertex 1 is 1 (empty product) which should be -1 -> fails. So there are 0 good trees.\n\n But wait, the total number of trees with 1 vertex is 1 (with no edges) and the condition fails. Hence, the answer for n=1 is 0.\n\n Similarly, for n=2: \n   We have one edge. The condition for vertex 1: the product of edges incident to 1 is the weight of the edge -> must be -1.\n   Similarly, for vertex 2: the product of edges incident to 2 is the same weight -> must be -1.\n\n   So the edge must be -1.\n\n   Then d(1,2) = -1.\n\n   How many good trees? There is exactly 1 tree (since there's only one way to connect two vertices) and the edge must be -1.\n\n   So the answer is -1 mod 998244353 = 998244352.\n\n Now, for n=4: the example output is 998244343.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Observation: The conditions for all vertices are equivalent to saying that the product of the weights of the edges incident to a vertex is -1.\n\n This is a system of linear equations modulo 2? Actually, we are working with multiplicative conditions and ±1, but note that the product condition is multiplicative. Alternatively, we can map the problem to linear algebra by taking logarithms? But note: we are in {1,-1} and the product is -1. This is similar to GF(2) but with signs.\n\n However, note: the condition at each vertex is multiplicative. Let x_i be the weight of an edge (but we have multiple edges). Instead, we can assign a variable to each edge.\n\n But note: the condition for vertex i is the product of the edges incident to i being -1. This is a system of n equations in (n-1) variables (edges). \n\n Since the graph is a tree, the system might be dependent.\n\n Actually, the product of the conditions for all vertices is (product_{edges} w_e^2) = 1, and the product of the right-hand sides is (-1)^n. Therefore, the system is consistent only when n is even? \n\n Let me check for n=2: \n   Equations: \n      v1: w1 = -1\n      v2: w1 = -1\n\n   So two equations for one variable: consistent.\n\n   For n=3: \n      Edges: e1 (between 1-2), e2 (between 1-3), e3 (between 2-3) -> wait, but a tree on 3 vertices has two edges. Actually, the example says the total distinct trees without condition is 3^(1) * 2^2 = 12, but wait the number of labeled trees on 3 vertices is 3^(3-2)=3, and then 2^(2) so 3*4=12.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"There are n^{n-2} · 2^{n-1} distinct edge-weighted trees\", so for n=3, 3^1 * 2^2 = 12.\n\n   Now, the condition: \n        Vertex1: e1 * e2 = -1\n        Vertex2: e1 * e3 = -1\n        Vertex3: e2 * e3 = -1\n\n   Multiply all three: (e1*e2*e1*e3*e2*e3) = (-1)^3  => (e1^2 * e2^2 * e3^2) = -1 => 1 = -1 (modulus doesn't apply here, but in real numbers) -> contradiction. So indeed, n must be even.\n\n   Therefore, if n is odd, there are no good trees, so the answer is 0.\n\n   For n even, we have a system of n equations in n-1 variables (edges). The system is:\n\n        For each vertex i, let E_i be the set of edges incident to i. Then ∏_{e ∈ E_i} w_e = -1.\n\n   We can take the natural logarithm? But note: we are in multiplicative group of {±1}. We can map to additive group modulo 2: let w_e = (-1)^(x_e) where x_e in {0,1}. Then the condition for vertex i becomes: the sum (mod2) of the x_e for edges in E_i is 1 (because log(-1) is 1 mod2, and log(1)=0).\n\n   Then the system is: \n        For each vertex i, the sum (mod2) of the x_e for edges incident to i is 1.\n\n   Now, note that the sum of the equations for all vertices is the sum over all edges of (degree(e)*x_e) mod2, because each edge is incident to two vertices. The degree(e) is 2 (each edge connects two vertices) so 2*x_e ≡ 0 mod2. Then the left side is 0, and the right side is n mod2. But n is even, so n mod2=0. So the system is consistent.\n\n   The system is a linear system over GF(2) with n equations and n-1 variables. The rank of the system? The incidence matrix of the tree (which is a connected graph with n-1 edges) is known to have rank n-1, but wait: we have n equations and n-1 variables. However, the system is consistent and the graph is a tree (so the graph is connected and acyclic). The system has full rank? Actually, the system is consistent and the solution space is an affine space.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the condition for a tree: the product conditions are not independent. Specifically, if we fix the values for n-2 edges arbitrarily, then the last edge is determined by the conditions from the leaves? But note: the condition at each vertex is multiplicative.\n\n   However, there is a well-known result: the number of ways to assign ±1 to the edges such that the product condition holds for all vertices is 2^(n-1 - (n-1))? Wait, let me reexamine.\n\n   Actually, we have n equations and n-1 variables. The system is consistent, but what is the dimension of the solution space?\n\n   The system is: A * x = b, where A is the incidence matrix (each row for a vertex, each column for an edge, and an entry 1 if the edge is incident to the vertex, else 0) over GF(2). The vector b is the all-ones vector.\n\n   The rank of A for a connected graph is n-1. So the nullity is (n-1) - (n-1) = 0? But wait, we have n equations and n-1 variables. The rank is n-1, so the system has a unique solution? Then there would be exactly 1 solution for the edge variables.\n\n   But wait: the system is consistent and the graph is a tree (connected). However, note that the system is homogeneous? No, it's inhomogeneous (b is all ones). \n\n   Actually, the system is:\n\n        A * x = 1   (the vector of ones)\n\n   The matrix A for a tree is known to have rank n-1, so the system has a solution if and only if 1 is in the column space. We already know that the system is consistent (from the earlier product argument). Moreover, the solution space is an affine space of dimension equal to the nullity of A. The nullity is (number of columns) - rank(A) = (n-1) - (n-1) = 0. So there is exactly one solution.\n\n   Therefore, for a fixed tree structure, there is exactly one assignment of ±1 to the edges that satisfies the condition.\n\n   Then the total number of good trees is the number of trees (which is n^(n-2)) multiplied by the number of assignments? But wait, we just said that the assignment is forced to be unique for a fixed tree. So the total number of good trees is n^(n-2) (because for each tree structure we have one assignment). \n\n   However, wait: the problem states that the total distinct trees (without condition) is n^(n-2) * 2^(n-1). But now we are saying that the condition forces the assignment to be unique, so the good trees are exactly n^(n-2) (one assignment per tree).\n\n   But wait, let's check n=2: \n        Number of trees: 1 (by Cayley, 2^(0)=1)\n        Assignment: forced to be -1 -> so one good tree. Matches.\n\n   n=4: the total distinct trees (without condition) is 4^(2) * 2^3 = 16 * 8 = 128. But our reasoning says there are 4^(2) = 16 good trees? Because the assignment is forced for each tree. \n\n   However, the example says: \"In the third test case, there are 16 distinct good trees.\" \n\n   So the example says there are 16 good trees. But wait, the example input is n=4 and the output is 998244343.\n\n   Therefore, we must have 16 good trees for n=4.\n\n   How did we get 16? The number of trees (labeled trees) on 4 vertices is 4^(4-2)=16. And the condition forces a unique assignment per tree. So total good trees is 16.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"There are n^{n-2} · 2^{n-1} distinct edge-weighted trees\" without condition. And with the condition, we are saying that the assignment is forced, so the good trees are the trees (without weights) but with the forced assignment. So the count is n^(n-2).\n\n   However, the example input n=4 gives 16, which is 4^2.\n\n   So the total number of good trees is n^(n-2) (the number of trees) and the assignment is uniquely determined.\n\n   Then the problem reduces to: for each labeled tree on n vertices, there is exactly one assignment of edge weights (each ±1) such that the product condition holds. Then we need to compute the sum of d(1, n) over all these trees.\n\n   Now, how to compute the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees?\n\n   Note: d(1, n) is the sum of the edge weights along the unique path from 1 to n.\n\n   Since the assignment of weights is forced, we cannot choose arbitrarily. \n\n   Let the tree T be a labeled tree. We need to assign edge weights such that for each vertex i, the product of the incident edges is -1. Then, what is the weight of the edge between two adjacent vertices? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use linearity and try to compute the contribution of each edge to d(1, n). But note: the path from 1 to n is fixed in a tree. However, the assignment of the entire tree is forced, so we cannot assign independently.\n\n   Another idea: use generating functions or combinatorial identities.\n\n   However, note: the condition is multiplicative. Let us denote the edge weights by w_e. The condition is for each vertex i: the product of the incident edges is -1.\n\n   We can also note that the condition is equivalent to: the product of the weights of all edges is 1 (because the product of the conditions is the square of the product of all edges) and the system of equations is consistent.\n\n   But we already know that the assignment is unique for each tree.\n\n   Let F(T) be the forced assignment for the tree T. Then d(1, n) for tree T is the product of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n? Actually, no: the definition says the sum of the weights.\n\n   Wait, the problem says: d(u,v) is the sum of the weight of all edges on the unique simple path from u to v.\n\n   So we are summing the weights, not multiplying.\n\n   Example n=2: the path from 1 to 2 is one edge, so d(1,2)=w_edge. And the condition forces w_edge=-1.\n\n   Example n=4: the example says the sum over the 16 good trees is -10.\n\n   How to compute the sum over all trees?\n\n   We can use the fact that the assignment is forced and express d(1,n) in terms of the conditions.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break down the problem:\n\n   Let P be the path from 1 to n (which depends on the tree). The length of P is the distance (number of edges) from 1 to n.\n\n   Then d(1,n) = w_1 + w_2 + ... + w_k, where k is the number of edges on the path.\n\n   But note: the assignment of the entire tree is forced. We need to consider all possible trees.\n\n   However, the condition at each vertex is global. We cannot assign the edges independently.\n\n   Another observation: the condition at a vertex i is the product of the incident edges being -1. The incident edges include edges not necessarily on the path from 1 to n.\n\n   How to relate the forced assignment to the edges? \n\n   We can use the concept of arborescence or spanning trees, but note we are dealing with labeled trees.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the Matrix Tree Theorem? Or Kirchhoff's theorem? But we are summing over all trees.\n\n   There is a known technique: use Prüfer code to enumerate labeled trees. The number of labeled trees is n^(n-2). The Prüfer code is a sequence of n-2 numbers from 1 to n.\n\n   But the forced assignment complicates things.\n\n   Let's try to characterize the forced assignment.\n\n   Consider the system of equations in GF(2): \n        For each vertex i: the sum of the edges incident to i (as 0/1) is 1.\n\n   The solution is unique. How to compute the assignment for a given tree?\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Let x_e be the variable for edge e.\n\n        Then the system is: \n            For each vertex i: sum_{e incident to i} x_e = 1 (mod2)\n\n        We can write this as: A*x = 1 (mod2), and the solution is unique.\n\n   Now, note: the path from 1 to n is fixed in the tree. The value of an edge weight is then determined by the entire system.\n\n   Then, d(1, n) = sum_{e in path(1,n)} (-1)^(x_e)  [since we mapped x_e=0 to 1 and x_e=1 to -1]?\n\n   Actually, we defined: w_e = (-1)^(x_e). Then the sum is the sum of (-1)^(x_e) for e in the path.\n\n   But note: the condition is multiplicative: the product of the incident edges is (-1)^(sum_{e incident to i} x_e) = (-1)^1 = -1, so it matches.\n\n   Then the problem reduces to: for each labeled tree, we have a unique solution x (a vector in {0,1}^(n-1)), and then d(1,n) is the sum of (-1)^(x_e) for the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\n   We need to compute the sum over all labeled trees (there are n^(n-2) trees) of d(1,n) for the forced assignment.\n\n   How to compute this sum?\n\n   We can use linearity in the edges? But note: the forced assignment is not independent of the tree structure.\n\n   Another idea: change the order of summation. Instead of iterating over trees, we can iterate over edges and count the contribution of each edge to d(1,n) when the edge is present and lies on the path from 1 to n.\n\n   However, the edge is part of the tree and the path from 1 to n is determined by the tree.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use generating functions and the fact that the assignment is linear in the edges? \n\n   But note: the assignment is forced by the entire system, so the value of x_e (and hence w_e) is determined by the entire tree.\n\n   We need to find the expected value of d(1,n) over all good trees? But the problem asks for the sum.\n\n   Let F(n) = sum_{T} d(1,n) for T a good tree.\n\n   We can try to use the following: \n\n        d(1,n) = w_1 + w_2 + ... + w_k   (where k is the length of the path, and the w_i are the forced edge weights)\n\n        = sum_{e in path(1,n)} (-1)^{x_e}\n\n   Now, note that the assignment x is forced by the system. But the system is linear. However, the edges are not independent.\n\n   We can use inclusion of edges: for a fixed edge e, we want to know the sum over all trees that contain edge e and for which e is on the path from 1 to n, of (-1)^{x_e}. Then we can sum over all edges.\n\n   However, the condition for the system is global and the tree structure matters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the concept of electric networks? \n\n   There is a known result: in a tree, the condition that the product of incident edges is -1 for every vertex is equivalent to assigning spins (like in the Ising model) with a constraint. \n\n   Another idea: use the fact that the system of equations is linear and the solution is unique, so we can express x_e in terms of the edges. \n\n   However, we need to compute the sum over all trees (all spanning trees of the complete graph on n vertices? Actually, we are considering labeled trees, which are spanning trees of the complete graph) of the function f(T) = sum_{e in path(1,n)} (-1)^{x_e}.\n\n   Since the assignment is forced, we can also say: the value of x_e is determined by the entire tree.\n\n   How is x_e determined? \n\n        We have the system: A*x = 1 (mod2). The solution is unique. We can write x_e as a linear combination of the rows of the system? \n\n   But note: the system is overdetermined, but the solution is unique.\n\n   We can also note: the assignment is determined by the following: \n\n        Let T be a tree. We can arbitrarily assign x_e for all edges except one, but then the last edge is determined. However, the system is consistent and the solution is unique.\n\n   But wait, the system has n equations and n-1 variables. We can choose n-1 variables arbitrarily? Not quite, because the system is consistent and the rank is n-1, so we have one free variable? Actually, no: the system has n equations and n-1 variables, and the equations are linearly dependent (since the product of the equations gives a relation that holds). So the solution space is an affine space of dimension 0 (if consistent) or 1 (if not)? But we know it is consistent and the solution is unique.\n\n   Actually, the system is consistent and the matrix A has full rank (n-1) so the solution is unique.\n\n   How to compute the forced assignment for a given tree? \n\n        We can use a spanning tree algorithm? \n\n   But we have to do it for all trees, which is too expensive.\n\n   Alternative Insight:\n\n   Consider the following: the condition at each vertex is that the product of incident edges is -1. This is equivalent to: the product of the edges incident to a vertex is -1.\n\n   Now, note that the entire product of all edge weights (considered multiplicatively) is the product of all edges. But each edge appears in two conditions, so the product of all conditions is (∏_{e} w_e)^2 = (-1)^n. For even n, (-1)^n = 1, so (∏_{e} w_e)^2 = 1, so ∏_{e} w_e = ±1. But we don't know the sign.\n\n   However, we can use the following: \n\n        Let the forced assignment be w_e. Then, the product of the edge weights is determined. \n\n   But note: the system is linear in GF(2) and the solution is unique.\n\n   Now, we wish to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all trees.\n\n   Let F(n) = sum_{T} d(1,n) for T good.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        F(n) = sum_{T} [ sum_{e in path_T(1,n)} w_e ]\n\n        = sum_{e} w_e * (number of trees T that contain edge e and for which e is on the path from 1 to n)\n\n   But wait, the edge e must be on the path from 1 to n. In a tree, the path from 1 to n is fixed once the tree is chosen. The edge e is on the path from 1 to n if and only if the removal of e disconnects the tree into two components, one containing 1 and the other containing n.\n\n   Therefore, for an edge e connecting u and v, the condition for e being on the path from 1 to n is that 1 and n are in different components after removing e.\n\n   The number of trees containing e and having 1 and n in different components when e is removed is:\n\n        We fix an edge e = (u, v). The condition that 1 and n are separated by e means that one of u or v is closer to 1 and the other to n? Actually, we can split the tree: the edge e divides the tree into two parts. Then 1 must be in one part and n in the other.\n\n   How to count the trees that contain e and separate 1 and n?\n\n        The total number of trees that contain a fixed edge e is n^(n-3) [by Cayley's formula: fix the edge, then the remaining n-2 vertices must form a tree on n-1 vertices? Actually, no: if we fix an edge, then we have a graph with two connected components (each being a tree) and the two parts must be connected by that edge. The number of ways is: \n            Let the two parts have sizes a and b (a+b=n, a>=1, b>=1). Then the number of trees on the two parts is (a)^(a-2) * (b)^(b-2) [if a>=2 and b>=2, but if a=1 then the component is just a vertex so 1 way]. Then we must sum over all splits.\n\n        Actually, the number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge is: \n            (n-2) * n^(n-3)   [by a standard result: the total number of spanning trees is n^(n-2). The probability that a fixed edge is included is (number of spanning trees containing e) / n^(n-2) = ?]\n\n        Standard result: the number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge is n^(n-2) * (deg(u) in the complete graph? Actually, no, in the complete graph the spanning trees are all trees. The result is: the number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge (u,v) is n^(n-3) * (n-1) ??? \n\n        Actually, we can use the following: \n\n            Total spanning trees: n^(n-2)\n            The number of spanning trees containing a fixed edge (u,v) is: \n                We contract the edge (u,v) to a new node w, then the number of spanning trees of the contracted graph (which has n-1 nodes) is (n-1)^(n-3). Then, in the original graph, the edge (u,v) is included. So the count is (n-1)^(n-3) * (n-1) ??? \n\n        Actually, contraction: the number of spanning trees of the original graph that contain (u,v) is equal to the number of spanning trees of the graph with edge (u,v) contracted, which is (n-1)^(n-3) (by Cayley's formula for the contracted graph) and then multiplied by 1 (because the edge is fixed). \n\n        But Cayley's formula for a graph with n-1 nodes (after contraction) is (n-1)^( (n-1)-2 ) = (n-1)^(n-3). \n\n        So the total number of trees containing edge (u,v) is (n-1)^(n-3).\n\n        However, wait: the original graph is complete, so contracting an edge gives a complete graph on n-1 nodes? Then the number of spanning trees of the contracted graph is (n-1)^(n-3). \n\n        Then the total number of trees containing edge (u,v) is (n-1)^(n-3).\n\n        But wait, we must ensure that the two endpoints of the edge are distinct and the graph is complete. \n\n        However, we have n^(n-2) total trees. The proportion of trees containing a fixed edge is (n-1)^(n-3) / n^(n-2) = (n-1)^(n-3) / n^(n-3) * 1/n = ( (n-1)/n )^(n-3) * 1/n.\n\n        Example: n=2: (2-1)^(0)=1, and total trees is 1, so 1. Correct.\n\n        Now, for the edge to be on the path from 1 to n, we require that 1 and n are separated by the edge. In the tree, if we remove the edge (u,v), then the tree breaks into two components. We require that 1 is in one component and n is in the other.\n\n        The number of trees containing edge (u,v) and separating 1 and n is:\n\n            We fix the edge (u,v). We need to assign the remaining n-2 vertices (excluding u and v) to the two sides (one side containing 1 and the other containing n) such that 1 and n are separated. \n\n            Actually, we can assign the remaining vertices arbitrarily to the two sides, but the edge (u,v) must connect the two sides. However, the entire tree must be connected.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                - The edge (u,v) is fixed. We require that 1 is in one side and n is in the other.\n\n                - We must assign the remaining n-2 vertices (excluding u and v) to the two sides. But note: u and v must be assigned to the two sides arbitrarily? Actually, no: the sides are determined by the edge. We can assign the remaining n-2 vertices arbitrarily to the two sides (each vertex independently). Then, the number of ways to split the remaining n-2 vertices is 2^(n-2). However, this counts the ways to assign the vertices to the two sides.\n\n                But then, for each side, we must form a tree on the set of vertices assigned to that side (including the endpoint of the edge). \n\n                For the side containing u (and some subset S1 of the remaining vertices) and the other side containing v (and the complement S2), the number of ways to form a tree on S1 ∪ {u} is (|S1|+1)^(|S1|+1-2) = (|S1|+1)^(|S1|-1) if |S1|>=1, and if |S1|=0 then 1. Similarly for the other side.\n\n            However, we have the condition that 1 is in one side and n is in the other. \n\n            Without loss of generality, assume u is assigned to the side containing 1 and v to the side containing n. But actually, we can fix: one side contains 1 and the other contains n. Then, the assignment of the remaining n-2 vertices (excluding u and v) is independent: each vertex can go to either side.\n\n            Then, the number of ways is:\n\n                Sum_{k=0}^{n-2} [ C(n-2, k) * (k+1)^(k-1) * (n-2-k+1)^(n-2-k-1) ]   [if k>=1 and n-2-k>=1, and we must consider the cases when k=0 or n-2-k=0 separately]\n\n            But note: the two sides must include the fixed vertices u and v. And the fixed vertices u and v are already assigned: u goes to the side of 1, v goes to the side of n.\n\n            Then, the set for the side of 1 is {u} ∪ A, and the set for the side of n is {v} ∪ B, where A and B are disjoint and A ∪ B = V \\ {u,v}, and A is arbitrary subset.\n\n            Then, the number of trees on the side of 1 is t(|A|+1) = (|A|+1)^(|A|+1-2) = (|A|+1)^(|A|-1) (if |A|>=1, and if |A|=0 then 1). Similarly for the side of n: (|B|+1)^(|B|-1) (if |B|>=1, and if |B|=0 then 1).\n\n            Then, the total number of trees containing edge (u,v) and separating 1 and n is:\n\n                Sum_{A ⊆ V \\ {u,v}} [ (size(A)+1)^(size(A)-1) * (size(V\\{u,v} \\ A)+1)^(size(V\\{u,v} \\ A)-1) ]\n\n            But note: if the subset A is empty, then the side of 1 has only u, which is valid (tree on one vertex). Similarly for B.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the exponent for a set of size s is defined as s^(s-2) for the entire tree on s vertices? Actually, by Cayley, the number of trees on s labeled vertices is s^(s-2). But here, the vertices in a side are labeled (the labels are fixed) and we are counting the number of spanning trees for the complete graph on the set of s vertices. So yes, it's s^(s-2).\n\n            But wait: the side of 1 is the set {u} ∪ A, and the side of n is {v} ∪ B. The trees on each side are independent. Then the entire tree is formed by connecting u and v with the fixed edge, and the two trees on the sides.\n\n            So the count is:\n\n                T(n, edge (u,v)) = sum_{k=0}^{n-2} [ C(n-2, k) * (k+1)^(k-1) * (n-1-k)^(n-3-k) ]   [if we let k = |A|, then the side of 1 has k+1 vertices, and the side of n has (n-2-k)+1 = n-1-k vertices. Then the number of trees for the side of 1 is (k+1)^(k+1-2) = (k+1)^(k-1), and for the side of n is (n-1-k)^(n-1-k-2) = (n-1-k)^(n-3-k).]\n\n            However, note: if k=0, then (0+1)^(-1) is not defined. But wait, the formula for the number of trees on a set of s vertices is s^(s-2). For s=1: 1^(-1) is not defined. Actually, the formula s^(s-2) is for s>=1, but for s=1: 1^(1-2)=1^(-1) is not defined. But we know that the number of trees on 1 vertex is 1.\n\n            We can define: \n                Let f(s) = s^(s-2) for s>=2, and f(1)=1.\n\n            Then, T(n, edge (u,v)) = sum_{k=0}^{n-2} C(n-2, k) * f(k+1) * f(n-1-k)\n\n            But note: the side of 1 has k+1 vertices, and the side of n has n-1-k vertices.\n\n            Then, the total number of trees containing edge (u,v) and separating 1 and n is T(n, edge (u,v)).\n\n            Then, the contribution of edge (u,v) to the sum is:\n\n                w_{u,v} * T(n, edge (u,v))\n\n            But wait, w_{u,v} is forced by the system. How to compute w_{u,v} for a fixed tree? \n\n            However, note: we are summing over all trees, and the assignment is forced. We cannot separate the edge weight from the tree structure easily.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the linearity and the fact that the assignment is linear in the system. \n\n   But note: the assignment is determined by the entire tree. However, we can use the following: \n\n        In the system, the value of x_e (which determines w_e = (-1)^{x_e}) is determined by the entire tree. \n\n        But the system is linear and the solution is unique. \n\n        We can write the solution as: \n\n            x_e = b_e + (some linear combination of the other edges)\n\n        However, it is complicated.\n\n   Another idea: use the concept of fundamental cycles? But we are in a tree.\n\n   After more thought, note: the system of equations is:\n\n        For each vertex i: sum_{e incident to i} x_e = 1 (mod2)\n\n   This is a system of n equations in n-1 variables",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the distances from vertex 1 to vertex n over all \"good\" trees. A good tree is defined as an edge-weighted tree where each edge weight is either 1 or -1, and for each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Good Tree Conditions**: The tree must satisfy two conditions: each edge weight is ±1, and for every vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1.\n   - **Key Insight**: For a tree to be good, the number of vertices \\( n \\) must be even. If \\( n \\) is odd, no such tree exists, and the answer is 0.\n   - **Edge Contribution**: For even \\( n \\), each edge's contribution to the distance \\( d(1, n) \\) depends on its position in the path from vertex 1 to vertex \\( n \\). The weight of each edge is determined by the system of equations derived from the product conditions.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Linear Algebra Insight**: The system of equations for the edge weights is linear over GF(2). The solution is unique for any given tree structure.\n   - **Combinatorial Counting**: For each edge, count how many trees include it in the path from vertex 1 to vertex \\( n \\) and compute its contribution based on the forced edge weight.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution involves iterating over all edges and using combinatorial mathematics to count valid trees, which is feasible due to the constraints \\( n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5 \\).
