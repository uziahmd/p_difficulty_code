He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (Roman numeral system) or both integers.\n The next line is a string representing the number c in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R': then we need to convert the given base a number to an integer (in base 10), then convert that integer to a Roman numeral string.\n    Note: The input number c is non-negative, and for Roman numerals it's guaranteed to be at least 1 and up to 300010 (but note: the example inputs are small).\n\n 2. Otherwise, if b is an integer, then we convert the base a string to an integer (base 10), then convert that integer to base b.\n\n However, note: the input number c is given as a string in base a. We have to consider that the base a might be greater than 10, so the digits can be from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' onward (but note the example: base 12 with digit 'A' meaning 10). But the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\"\n\n Important: The input string for base a might contain leading zeros.\n\n Also note: the number c is non-negative and its length doesn't exceed 1000 (so we can handle up to 1000 digits). However, if the base is large (like 16) and the number is very long, converting to an integer via base 10 might be problematic because the number could be astronomically huge (as noted: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — wait, actually the note says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\"? Let me check: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\". Actually, the example input includes '12 13\\nA' which is base 12, and the string is 'A' (which is 10 in base 12). \n\n Actually, reading the problem again: \n   \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n Wait, 101510 is 10^15^10? No, I think it was a typo. Actually, the problem says: \n   \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\"\n\n But wait, that is only 101510, which is a relatively small number (around 10^5). However, note that the example input has a base conversion that might be large, but the note says \"the number\" (meaning the value in base 10) is not greater than 101510 when b is not R, and when R is used, the number is <= 300010.\n\n However, note the example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base 12, so A is 10, then base 13: 10 in base 13 is 'A'. So no problem.\n\n But wait: what if the base a is 10, and the number is 10^15? Then the note says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\", so we don't have to handle numbers beyond 101510 in base 10 when b is an integer? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n So, if b is an integer, then the value (in base 10) of the given string (which is in base a) is at most 101510. And if b is R, then the value is at most 300010.\n\n However, note: the input string is given in base a. We cannot directly compare the base-a string to 101510 because the base a might be large and the string long. But the problem guarantees that the value (when interpreted in base 10) is bounded.\n\n Approach:\n\n Step 1: Read the first line. Split into tokens. There are two tokens: first is a, second is b.\n\n Step 2: Read the next line: the string s.\n\n Step 3: Convert s from base a to base 10 (an integer). But note: the base a is given as an integer (if not 'R') and the digits in s can be from '0' to ... up to the base-1.\n\n However, the problem says: \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So the digits in s are either digits (0-9) or letters (from 'A' onward). But note: the base a is between 2 and 25 (inclusive). So the maximum digit we will see is represented by the letter that corresponds to (a-1). Since a<=25, the maximum digit is 24, which is represented by 'X' (since 24 is beyond 'Z'? Actually, we don't need to worry about the representation of the base a itself, but the digits in the input string.\n\n But note: the input string uses digits and letters. For base a, the digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. The problem says the input is a valid base a number.\n\n How to convert the string s from base a to base 10?\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base 10, base 2, string \"1\" -> 1 in base 10 is 1, then base 2: \"1\"\n   Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base 16, string \"5\", then convert to base 10: 5, then to Roman: \"V\"\n\n But wait: the example \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> base 2, base 2, so we just output the same string without leading zeros? Actually, the problem says: \"You must omit leading zeros.\" But note: the input string might have leading zeros. In base 2, the string \"1111001\" is given, and we output \"1111001\". However, if we convert to base 10 and then to base 2, we have to be cautious because the conversion to base 10 for base 2 with 7 digits is 121 (decimal) and then converting 121 to base 2 gives 1111001. But note: the input string is already in base 2, so we don't want to do an unnecessary conversion? \n\n However, the problem says: the first part is an integer a, the second part is either an integer b or 'R', then the third part is an integer c in base a.\n\n So we must convert from base a to base b (if b is integer) or to Roman (if b is R).\n\n But note: the input string is given in base a. We can convert it to base 10, then to base b (if integer) or to Roman (if R). But the problem says that the base a and base b are between 2 and 25 (for integer) and for R we use the Roman system.\n\n However, if the base a is 2 and the string is \"1111001\", then converting to base 10 gives 121, then converting 121 to base 2 gives \"1111001\". This is correct.\n\n But what if the base a is 16 and the string is \"A\"? Then base 10 value is 10, then base b (say 13) would be: 10 in base 13 is represented by 'A'.\n\n However, note: the example input \"12 13\\nA\": base a=12, string \"A\" -> 10 in base 12, then base 13: 10 in base 13 is 'A'.\n\n But wait: how do we represent base 13? The digits go from 0 to 12. So 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', 12 is 'C', then 13 would be '10' (but note: 13 is beyond the single digit). However, the example input is only one digit, so we output 'A'.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Parse the first line: tokens = line.split()\n    tokens[0] is a (integer)\n    tokens[1] is either an integer (then we convert to int) or 'R'\n\n 2. Read the next line: s\n\n 3. Convert s from base a to base 10 (integer)\n\n    How to convert?\n        Let n = 0\n        For each char in s (from left to right, but note: the string is given in base a, so the first character is the most significant? Yes, standard positional numeral system.)\n\n        Actually, the string is given in base a, so we can do:\n\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            # Map char to digit: if char is between '0' and '9', then d = int(char)\n            # Otherwise, if char is between 'A' and ... then d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            # But note: the base a might be 11, then we can have digits up to 10 (which is 'A'). But if the base is 11, then the digit 'A' is allowed, but if base is 10, then 'A' is not allowed.\n\n        However, the problem states: the input is a valid base a number.\n\n        But wait: the input string might have digits beyond the base? No, because it's valid.\n\n        Steps for conversion from base a to base 10:\n\n        Let digits = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n\n        But note: the base a is at most 25, so we don't need beyond base 25. However, the input string might use digits up to base-1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n            # Check if d >= a: but the input is valid, so we assume d < a.\n\n            num = num * a + d\n\n        However, there's a catch: the input might have leading zeros. The above method naturally handles that because leading zeros don't change the value.\n\n 4. Now, if the second token is 'R':\n\n        Convert the base10 integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\n        We know the integer is between 1 and 300010.\n\n        We can define a function to convert an integer to Roman numerals.\n\n        Standard Roman numerals:\n\n        M: 1000, CM: 900, D: 500, CD: 400, C: 100, XC: 90, L: 50, XL: 40, X: 10, IX: 9, V: 5, IV: 4, I: 1.\n\n        We can use a list of tuples for the values and their corresponding symbols.\n\n        Example: \n          roman_numerals = [\n              (1000, \"M\"),\n              (900, \"CM\"),\n              (500, \"D\"),\n              (400, \"CD\"),\n              (100, \"C\"),\n              (90, \"XC\"),\n              (50, \"L\"),\n              (40, \"XL\"),\n              (10, \"X\"),\n              (9, \"IX\"),\n              (5, \"V\"),\n              (4, \"IV\"),\n              (1, \"I\")\n          ]\n\n        Then, we can do:\n\n        def to_roman(n):\n            res = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res += symbol\n                    n -= value\n            return res\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number is at least 1 and up to 300010.\n\n 5. Else (b is integer):\n\n        We have the base10 integer, say n.\n\n        Then we convert n to base b.\n\n        But note: the base b is between 2 and 25.\n\n        We have to represent the digits: if the base b is <= 10, then we use digits 0 to b-1. If base b is greater than 10, then we use digits '0' to '9' and then 'A' to ... (until base-1, so maximum base is 25, so we need up to base 25 -> 15 is 'F', 16 is '10'? Actually, no: we use a single character for each digit from 0 to 24.\n\n        However, note: the example base 13: 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', 12 is 'C', 13 is 'D'? Actually, no: the example input \"12 13\\nA\" -> base 12, string \"A\" (which is 10 in base 12) converted to base 13: 10 in base 13 is represented as the digit for 10, which is 'A'. \n\n        How to convert n to base b?\n\n        We can do:\n\n        if n == 0:\n            return \"0\"\n\n        digits = []\n        while n:\n            r = n % b\n            n = n // b\n            digits.append(r)\n\n        Then reverse the digits and map each digit to a character.\n\n        But note: the problem says to omit leading zeros. The above method naturally produces no leading zeros.\n\n        However, we must map the remainder to the appropriate character.\n\n        We can use:\n\n        mapping = []\n        for i in range(b):\n            if i < 10:\n                mapping.append(str(i))\n            else:\n                mapping.append(chr(ord('A') + i - 10))\n\n        Then the result is ''.join(mapping[d] for d in reversed(digits))\n\n        But note: if n is 0, then we output \"0\".\n\n 6. However, there's a caveat: the base a conversion: the input string might be very long (up to 1000 digits). But the base a is at most 25, and the base10 integer value is bounded by the problem (at most 101510 for non-Roman, and 300010 for Roman). \n\n    But wait: what if the base a is 2 and the string is 1000 digits long? Then the base10 integer would be 2^1000, which is a very big number (more than 10^300). However, the problem says: \n        \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\"\n\n    So if b is an integer, then the value (in base 10) is <= 101510. Therefore, even if the base a is 2 and the string is 1000 digits long, the value must be <= 101510. That means the input string might have many zeros and ones, but the actual value is small.\n\n    Similarly, for Roman: the value is at most 300010.\n\n    So we can safely convert the entire string to base10, because the resulting integer is bounded (either <=101510 or <=300010). \n\n    But wait: the base a conversion: we are doing:\n\n        num = 0\n        for char in s:\n            d = ... # as above\n            num = num * a + d\n\n    This is a loop of up to 1000 iterations, and a is at most 25, and d is at most 24. Then the maximum value we can get is (if all digits are 24) then the number is (a^len(s)) which for base 25 and 1000 digits is 25^1000, which is huge. \n\n    However, the problem states that the value is bounded (<=101510 for non-Roman, and <=300010 for Roman). So the input string must represent a small number (in base10) even though it has many digits. This means the base a must be small and the digits mostly zeros? Or perhaps the string has many leading zeros. But the problem says: \"the number c in base a\" — so the entire string is the representation.\n\n    Therefore, we must rely on the guarantee that the base10 value is bounded. But the way we are converting from base a to base10 might break if the base10 value is too big? Actually, the problem says the value is bounded by 101510 (or 300010). So the maximum value we compute is 300010, which is a small integer.\n\n    However, if the base a is 2 and the string has 1000 digits, then the value could be 2^1000, which is way beyond 300010. But the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n    This guarantee applies to the value of the number, not the length of the string. So if the base a is 2 and the string is 1000 digits, then the value must be <= 101510 (if b is integer) or <=300010 (if b is R). \n\n    Therefore, we can safely convert the entire string to base10, because the base10 integer we compute will be at most 300010 (or 101510) and that is within the range of Python integers.\n\n    However, note: the base10 integer might be negative? No, non-negative.\n\n    But wait: what if the base a is 10 and the string is \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of converting to Roman numerals. The solution involves reading input values, converting the number from its original base to base 10, and then converting it to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to get the base `a` and the target base `b`, which could be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The next line contains the number string `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the input string `c` from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves processing each character of the string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value by considering the base `a`.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to symbols.\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, convert the decimal number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. The remainders are then mapped to their respective digits (using letters for values greater than 9).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except Exception:\n        a = a_str\n        \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n        ]\n        \n        def to_roman(n):\n            res = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res += symbol\n                    n -= value\n            return res\n        \n        num_base10 = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            num_base10 = num_base10 * a + d\n        \n        result = to_roman(num_base10)\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        num_base10 = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            num_base10 = num_base10 * a + d\n        \n        if num_base10 == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        digits_map = []\n        for i in range(b):\n            if i < 10:\n                digits_map.append(str(i))\n            else:\n                digits_map.append(chr(ord('A') + i - 10))\n                \n        digits = []\n        n = num_base10\n        while n:\n            r = n % b\n            n = n // b\n            digits.append(r)\n            \n        digits.reverse()\n        res_str = ''.join(digits_map[d] for d in digits)\n        print(res_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two lines from standard input. The first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number string `s` in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The string `s` is processed character by character. Each character is converted to its numerical value (0-9 or A-Z), and the total value is computed by iteratively multiplying the current value by the base `a` and adding the digit's value.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals by subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding Roman symbols until the number is reduced to zero.\n4. **Integer Base Conversion**: For an integer target base, the decimal number is divided by the base repeatedly, and the remainders are collected. These remainders are mapped to their respective digits (0-9 or A-Z for values 10 and above) and concatenated in reverse order to form the output string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both base conversion and Roman numeral conversion, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
