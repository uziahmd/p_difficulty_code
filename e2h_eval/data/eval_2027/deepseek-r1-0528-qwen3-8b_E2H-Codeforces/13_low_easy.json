For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n Since the musical scale is cyclic, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute the distances in semitones.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map the note names to numbers (0 to 11). Let's define a list of notes in order.\n    Note: The problem states that the notes are repeated cyclically and the sequence starts with C and goes up to H (which is the last).\n    The list of notes: ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n 2. However, note that the example input includes \"C# B F\", and the example ordering is \"B C# F\". This means we have to consider that the chord is an unordered set.\n\n 3. We need to check for two patterns (for major and minor) in the cyclic order. Since the chord is unordered, we can try all permutations (6) and also account for the circularity.\n\n 4. But note: the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, and the scale is cyclic. However, the definition of the chord requires that we can order the three notes so that the distances are 4 and 3 (major) or 3 and 4 (minor). \n\n 5. Important: The entire circle has 12 semitones, so when computing the distance from a note to another, we can go two ways. However, the problem says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" (which is the long way around). But for the chord definition, they are considering the forward direction (lowest to highest) without wrapping? Actually, note the example: \n    - The chord \"C E G\": \n        C to E: 4 semitones (because E is 4 steps after C: C(0), C#(1), D(2), D#(3), E(4))\n        E to G: 3 semitones (from E(4) to G(7): 7-4=3)\n\n    But what if we consider the chord in a different starting point? For example, if we start at G?\n        G to C: In the cyclic order, from G to C: \n            G(7) -> G#(8), A(9), B(10), H(11), C(0) -> but wait, the distance from G to C in the forward direction (without wrapping) would be 0 - 7 + 12 = 5? However, the example doesn't use wrapping for the same chord.\n\n 6. Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n    So, when we have three distinct notes, we can arrange them in increasing order (considering the circle, we might break the circle at one point). But note: the example says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (if we don't wrap, but if we consider the circle, the direct distance from E to C is min(|7-0|, 12-|7-0|) = min(7,5)=5? That contradicts.\n\n    However, the example says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" — this is because they are going from E to C in the forward direction (wrapping around the circle). But wait, the example says: \"between E and C is 8 semitones\" and then says \"between C and E is 4 semitones\". \n\n    Clarification: The problem states that the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. So for E and C, if we consider the entire circle, we must determine which is lower and which is higher. But in the example, they are comparing two different chords.\n\n    Actually, the chord definition does not require the entire circle. It requires an ordering of the three notes. The chord \"C E G\" is ordered as C, E, G. The distances are computed in the forward direction (without wrapping) because the notes are consecutive in the circle? \n\n    However, the chord \"C# B F\": they order as \"B C# F\". Now, in the circle: \n        B is at 10, C# is at 1, F is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking the semitone distances between the notes in all possible cyclic orders to identify the chord type.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number (0 to 11) based on its position in the musical scale starting from C (0) to B/H (11). This allows us to compute semitone distances easily.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: For the three input notes, generate all permutations (6 in total) to consider every possible order of the notes.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, compute the semitone distances between consecutive notes (considering the circular nature of the musical scale). A major chord requires distances of 4 and 3 semitones in sequence, while a minor chord requires distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation matches the major or minor chord condition, output the corresponding result. If none match, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        note1, note2, note3 = data\n    except:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in [note1, note2, note3]]\n    \n    def get_distance(a, b):\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (a - b) % 12\n        return min(d1, d2)\n        \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        dist_ab = get_distance(a, b)\n        dist_bc = get_distance(b, c)\n        dist_ca = get_distance(c, a)\n        if dist_ab == 4 and dist_bc == 3 and dist_ca == 7:\n            found_major = True\n        if dist_ab == 3 and dist_bc == 4 and dist_ca == 7:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by mapping each note to a unique index (0-11) based on their positions in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes. The code checks if exactly three notes are provided; otherwise, it outputs \"strange\".\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function computes the smallest distance between two notes considering the circular nature of the musical scale (12 semitones per octave).\n4. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all permutations of the three input notes to check every possible order. For each permutation, it calculates the distances between consecutive notes and checks if they match the patterns required for a major or minor chord.\n5. **Result Output**: Based on the checks, the code outputs \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" if no valid pattern is found. The solution efficiently handles all edge cases by leveraging permutations and circular distance calculations.",
