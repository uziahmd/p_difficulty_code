Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) with integer sides such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition: x + y > z, and also note that the sides must satisfy the usual non-degeneracy (which for positive integers is equivalent to x+y>z, and similarly for the other two, but note our constraints: x<=y<=z. So the strictest condition is x+y>z.\n\nBut note: we have fixed ranges for x, y, z. The total number of triples without the triangle condition is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1). However, many will not form a triangle.\n\nWe can think: For fixed x and y, we need z in [max(y, C), D] (since z>=C and also z>=y because y<=z) and also z < x+y.\n\nBut note: the condition requires x<=B, y>=B and y<=C, z>=C and z<=D, and also x<=y<=z.\n\nActually, the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\nSo x from [A, B], y from [B, C], z from [C, D]. And we require x+y>z.\n\nWe can also note that because x<=y<=z, the triangle inequality reduces to x+y>z.\n\nHow to count?\n\nLet's denote:\n   Let L1 = [A, B] for x, L2 = [B, C] for y, L3 = [C, D] for z.\n\nWe need to count the number of triples (x,y,z) such that:\n   x in L1, y in L2, z in L3, and x+y>z.\n\nSince the ranges can be up to 500000, we cannot iterate over all x, y, z.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can fix x and y, then z must be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)] and also z >= y (but note our constraint already has z>=C and C>=y because y<=C, so the lower bound is max(C, y) but actually since y<=C, then the lower bound for z is C (because we have y<=C<=z). However, note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, so z < x+y. So for fixed x and y, the valid z are from [C, min(D, x+y-1)] provided that min(D, x+y-1) >= C.\n\nBut if we do this by iterating over x and y, that would be about (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) which can be up to 500000*500000 = 250e9, too slow.\n\nWe need to use a more efficient method.\n\nIdea: Instead, we can precompute the boundaries for z and then use prefix sums or two pointers.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix y and then consider the constraints on x and z.\n\nAnother idea: Count the total number of triples (without the triangle condition) and subtract the ones that do not satisfy x+y>z? But the condition is only one: x+y>z, and note that the other conditions (like the sides being in the given ranges) are independent.\n\nBut note: the triple (x,y,z) must satisfy x<=B, y>=B and y<=C, z>=C and z<=D. Also, we have the triangle condition x+y>z.\n\nBut wait: the entire set of triples (x,y,z) is defined by three independent intervals. Without the triangle condition, the count is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1). Then we subtract the triples that do not form a triangle. However, the condition for degenerate triangle is x+y<=z. But note: we have x<=y<=z, so the other conditions (x+z>y and y+z>x) are automatically satisfied (because x+z>=x+y>=y+y>=y+z? Actually, no: because x<=y<=z, then x+z>=x+x=2x, and y>=x so 2x>=x+y? Not necessarily. Actually, the triangle condition for non-degeneracy is only x+y>z (the largest side must be less than the sum of the other two). So the only condition we need to check is x+y>z.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: count the triples (x,y,z) with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D] and x+y>z.\n\nTotal triples: T = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1)\nThen subtract the triples with x+y<=z.\n\nBut note: the condition x+y<=z is easier to handle? However, the ranges are large.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix z and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z, and then subtract that from the total.\n\nBut note: we have constraints on x and y: x in [A,B], y in [B,C]. And z in [C,D].\n\nSo the plan:\n\nStep 1: Precompute the total number of triples: total = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\nStep 2: Count the number of triples (x,y,z) such that x+y<=z, and then subtract from total.\n\nBut note: we cannot iterate over z from C to D and then over x and y (which would be too slow).\n\nInstead, for each z, we want to count the number of pairs (x,y) with x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x+y<=z.\n\nThen the invalid triples = sum_{z=C}^{D} count(z), where count(z) is the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z, x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\nNow, how to compute count(z) quickly?\n\nWe can precompute the pairs (x,y) and then use a two-dimensional prefix sum? But note the ranges: A to B (up to 500000) and B to C (up to 500000). The grid would be too big.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix x and then y must be in [B, min(C, z-x)].\n\nSo for fixed z, the condition is x+y<=z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C].\n\nWe can do:\n\nFor each x from A to B:\n   Let y_min = B\n   Let y_max = min(C, z-x)\n\nThen for each x, the y values are from B to y_max (if y_max>=B).\n\nBut then we have to do that for each z from C to D, and the range of x is (B-A+1) which can be up to 500000, and z from C to D (which is up to 500000). Then the total operations would be (B-A+1)*(D-C+1) which is 500000*500000 = 250e9, too slow.\n\nWe need to reverse the order: Precompute for all possible s = x+y (from A+B to B+C) the number of pairs (x,y) that achieve that sum, then use a prefix sum for these sums.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let F(s) = number of pairs (x,y) such that x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x+y=s.\n   Then, for a fixed z, the condition x+y<=z is the sum_{s=A+B}^{z} F(s).\n\n2. Precompute an array F for s from low = A+B to high = B+C.\n\n   How to compute F(s)?\n      For a fixed s, x can range from max(A, s-C) to min(B, s-B). Then the number of x is: \n        x_min = max(A, s-C)\n        x_max = min(B, s-B)\n        Then if x_min <= x_max, then F(s) = (x_max - x_min + 1) for the x part, but note y = s-x must be in [B,C]. Alternatively, we can iterate s from A+B to B+C.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use two pointers or cumulative distribution.\n\n   But note: the range of s is from A+B to B+C, which is about (B+C - (A+B)) = C-A, and that can be up to 500000, so we can iterate s from A+B to B+C and for each s, we can compute the number of x such that x in [A,B] and y=s-x in [B,C].\n\n   Conditions: \n        x >= A, x <= B\n        y = s-x >= B  => x <= s-B\n        y = s-x <= C  => x >= s-C\n\n   So x in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)]\n\n   Then F(s) = max(0, min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1)   [if the interval is valid]\n\n3. Then build a prefix sum array P for s from A+B to B+C (and beyond, but we only need up to D, and D>=C>=B>=A, so maximum s we care about is B+C, but note z goes up to D, and we need to consider s from A+B to min(B+C, D)? Actually, for z from C to D, we need to consider s from A+B to z. But note: the maximum s we need is D (since z<=D, and we are counting s<=z, so we need s from A+B to D). However, the pairs (x,y) only produce s from A+B to B+C. So for s greater than B+C, F(s)=0.\n\n4. Then for each z from C to D:\n        invalid_z = P[z]   # P[z] = sum_{s=A+B}^{min(z, B+C)} F(s)\n        Then the invalid triples for this z is invalid_z.\n\n   But note: the same pair (x,y) might appear for multiple z? Actually, we are counting for each z the pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z.\n\n5. Then total_invalid = sum_{z=C}^{D} P[z]   [where P[z] = prefix sum from s=A+B to s=z of F(s)]\n\nBut note: the same pair (x,y) is counted for every z from x+y to D. Alternatively, we can change the order: for each pair (x,y) with sum s, it is invalid for all z from s to D (provided z>=C). But wait, we are counting for each z the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\nHowever, we can also compute the invalid triples by:\n\n   invalid = 0\n   for each z from C to D:\n        invalid += number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z\n\nBut we can also use the F array and a running prefix.\n\nBut note: the range of s is from A+B to B+C, and we are building a prefix array for s from A+B to D (with zeros beyond B+C). \n\nSteps:\n\n   Let min_s = A+B\n   Let max_s = B+C   (the maximum sum we can get from (x,y))\n\n   Create an array F of zeros for indices from min_s to D (we'll index from min_s to D). But D can be as large as 500000, and min_s can be as large as 1+1=2, so the range is from 2 to 500000, which is 499999, which is acceptable.\n\n   Then, for s from min_s to max_s:\n        low_x = max(A, s-C)\n        high_x = min(B, s-B)\n        if low_x <= high_x:\n            F[s] = high_x - low_x + 1\n        else:\n            F[s] = 0\n\n   Then, build a prefix array P, where P[i] = F[i] + F[i-1] + ... for i from min_s to D.\n\n   But note: we need to map the s value to an index. We can create an array `freq` for s from 0 to maybe D (or up to D) and then do a prefix sum.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        Let P[0] = 0\n        For i from min_s to D:\n            P[i] = P[i-1] + F[i]   [if i>=min_s, else 0]\n\n   But note: we only computed F for s from min_s to max_s, and for s>max_s, F[s]=0. So we can set F[s] = 0 for s from min_s to D, then update the range [min_s, max_s] with the above.\n\n   Then for a given z (from C to D), the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z is P[z] (if we define P[z] as the prefix sum from 0 to z, but note: our F starts at min_s). Actually, we should define:\n\n        Let F_arr = [0]*(D+1)   # index from 0 to D\n        for s in range(min_s, max_s+1):\n            # compute F_arr[s] as above\n\n        Then build prefix P_arr[0..D]:\n            P_arr[0] = 0\n            for i from 1 to D:\n                P_arr[i] = P_arr[i-1] + F_arr[i]\n\n        Then for a given z, the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z is P_arr[z] (if z>=min_s) but note: our F_arr is nonzero only from min_s to max_s, and for s<min_s, F_arr[s]=0. So P_arr[z] = sum_{s=0}^{z} F_arr[s] = sum_{s=min_s}^{min(z, max_s)} F_arr[s].\n\n   Then invalid_count = 0\n        for z from C to D:\n            invalid_count += P_arr[z]\n\n   Then answer = total_triples - invalid_count\n\nBut wait: is that correct?\n\nExample: Input \"1 2 3 4\"\n\ntotal_triples = (2-1+1)*(3-2+1)*(4-3+1) = (2)*(2)*(2)=8.\n\nNow, invalid triples: pairs (x,y) and then z from 3 to 4.\n\nPairs (x,y): \n   x in [1,2], y in [2,3]\n   pairs: (1,2): s=3, (1,3):s=4, (2,2):s=4, (2,3):s=5.\n\nNow, invalid for z=3: \n   condition: x+y<=3 -> pairs (1,2):3<=3 -> yes, (1,3):4<=3 -> no, (2,2):4<=3 -> no, (2,3):5<=3 -> no. So invalid for z=3: 1 triple (only (1,2) and then z=3).\n\nBut note: the triple (1,2,3) is invalid? Actually, 1+2=3, so degenerate (collinear). So we count that.\n\nFor z=4: \n   condition: x+y<=4 -> (1,2):3<=4 -> yes, (1,3):4<=4 -> yes, (2,2):4<=4 -> yes, (2,3):5<=4 -> no.\n   So invalid for z=4: 3 triples.\n\nTotal invalid: 1 (for z=3) + 3 (for z=4) = 4.\n\nThen answer = 8 - 4 = 4.\n\nBut the example output is 4. So it matches.\n\nHowever, wait: the example lists the triangles as (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). So indeed 4 triangles.\n\nBut note: the example input \"1 2 2 5\" yields 3.\n\nLet's check with our method:\n\nInput: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ntotal_triples = (2-1+1)*(2-2+1)*(5-2+1) = (2)*(1)*(4)=8.\n\nNow, pairs (x,y): x in [1,2], y in [2,2] -> only (1,2) and (2,2).\n\nPairs: \n   (1,2): s=3\n   (2,2): s=4\n\nInvalid for z from 2 to 5 (note: z from C=2 to D=5):\n\nz=2: condition x+y<=2 -> none (since minimum s is 3) -> 0\nz=3: condition x+y<=3 -> (1,2):3<=3 -> yes, (2,2):4<=3 -> no -> 1\nz=4: condition x+y<=4 -> (1,2):3<=4 -> yes, (2,2):4<=4 -> yes -> 2\nz=5: condition x+y<=5 -> both: 3<=5 and 4<=5 -> 2\n\nTotal invalid = 0+1+2+2 = 5.\n\nThen answer = 8-5=3, which matches.\n\nBut wait: the example says output is 3.\n\nSo the method works.\n\nHowever, note the constraints: A, B, C, D up to 500000. The total range for s is from A+B (at least 2) to B+C (at most 1000000). But our D is up to 500000, so we only need to build the prefix for s from 0 to D (which is 500000). But note: the pairs (x,y) can have s up to B+C, which might be up to 1000000, but we are only interested in s from A+B to min(B+C, D) because for s>D, they are not included in the condition for any z (since z<=D). However, when building the prefix array for z from C to D, we only need the prefix up to D.\n\nBut note: we defined F_arr for s from 0 to D (with zeros for s < min_s and s>min(B+C, D)). Actually, we can set:\n\n   Let max_needed = D   (since z goes only up to D)\n\n   Then we need to compute F_arr for s from min_s to max(B+C, D). But if B+C > D, then we don't need to compute F_arr for s from D+1 to B+C, because our prefix for z=D only requires s from min_s to D.\n\nSo we can set:\n\n   min_s = A+B\n   max_s = min(B+C, D)   [because for s>B+C, there are no pairs, and for s>D, we don't use them]\n\nBut wait, what if D < B+C? Then the maximum s we need is D.\n\nBut note: the condition for a pair (x,y) is that y<=C, so the maximum s is B+C. But if D < B+C, then for z from C to D, we are only counting pairs (x,y) with s<=D, which is less than B+C. So we can set:\n\n   max_s = min(B+C, D)\n\nBut then we are missing the pairs (x,y) with s from D+1 to B+C? Actually, no, because we are only considering z from C to D, and for a given z, we require s<=z (so s<=D). So we don't need the pairs with s>D.\n\nTherefore, we can set:\n\n   Let min_s = A+B\n   Let max_s = min(B+C, D)\n\nBut wait, what if D < B+C? Then we only need to consider s from A+B to D. But note: the pairs (x,y) that have s>D are not included in the invalid count (because they don't contribute for any z, since z<=D). So we can set max_s = min(B+C, D) and then the rest (from max_s+1 to B+C) we don't need.\n\nBut note: the condition for the pairs (x,y) is independent of D. We need to count all pairs (x,y) that have s<=D (for the invalid count) and the pairs that have s>D are not included. However, the pairs (x,y) are fixed (they are all pairs in [A,B]x[B,C]). We are only concerned with the condition x+y<=z, and z is at most D.\n\nSo we can compute F_arr for s from min_s to D (if D < B+C, then we don't need to compute the entire B+C). But note: the maximum s we need is D, so we can set:\n\n   max_s = D\n\nBut wait, the pairs (x,y) can have s up to B+C, which might exceed D. So we want to avoid computing s beyond D. Therefore, we can set:\n\n   max_s = D   (because we only need s from min_s to D)\n\nBut then, for s from D+1 to B+C, we don't compute, but that's okay because we only use s from min_s to D.\n\nHowever, note: the pairs (x,y) are defined by x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]. The maximum s is B+C, but we are only using s up to D. So we can set:\n\n   Let F_arr = [0]*(D+1)   # indices 0 to D\n   min_s = A+B\n   if min_s > D:\n        Then there are no pairs (x,y) because the smallest sum is A+B which is greater than D, so F_arr remains all zeros.\n\n   Then for s from max(min_s, 0) to min(B+C, D):\n        Compute F_arr[s] as described.\n\nBut note: we are building an array of length D+1, and D can be 500000, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, the range from min_s to min(B+C, D) can be very large (about 500000 steps) and for each s, we do a constant-time calculation (two comparisons and a subtraction). So that's O(D) which is 500000, which is acceptable.\n\nThen we build the prefix sum for indices 0 to D.\n\nBut note: the prefix sum P_arr[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i} F_arr[j]. We can do:\n\n   P_arr[0] = 0\n   for i from 1 to D:\n        P_arr[i] = P_arr[i-1] + F_arr[i]\n\nThen, for each z from C to D, the invalid count for that z is P_arr[z] (because P_arr[z] = sum_{s=0}^{z} F_arr[s] = sum_{s=min_s}^{min(z, D)} F_arr[s] and since we only have s from min_s to D, and z<=D, then it's just the sum from min_s to z).\n\nThen total_invalid = sum_{z=C}^{D} P_arr[z]   [for each z from C to D, we add P_arr[z]]\n\nBut wait, is that correct? \n\nIn our example \"1 2 3 4\", D=4, so we build P_arr for 0 to 4.\n\nF_arr:\n   s=3: F_arr[3] = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y=3: \n        x in [1,2], y in [2,3]: \n          x=1, y=2 -> valid, so F_arr[3]=1.\n        But wait, we defined for s=3: \n          x_min = max(A, 3-C) = max(1,3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n          x_max = min(B, 3-B)=min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n          Then F_arr[3]=1.\n\n   s=4: \n        x_min = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n        x_max = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n        Then F_arr[4]= (2-1+1)=2.\n\n   s=5: but D=4, so we don't compute s=5.\n\n   Then F_arr[0..4] = [0,0,0,1,2] (for indices 0 to 4)\n\n   Then P_arr[0]=0\n        P_arr[1]=0+0=0\n        P_arr[2]=0+0=0\n        P_arr[3]=0+1=1\n        P_arr[4]=1+2=3\n\n   Then for z from C=3 to D=4:\n        z=3: P_arr[3]=1\n        z=4: P_arr[4]=3\n        total_invalid = 1+3=4.\n\n   Then total_triples=8, answer=8-4=4.\n\nBut wait, we have a problem: the example input \"1 2 3 4\" is correct.\n\nBut note: the example input \"1 2 2 5\": \n   A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n   total_triples = (2-1+1)*(2-2+1)*(5-2+1)=2*1*4=8.\n\n   Now, build F_arr for s from 0 to 5 (min_s=1+2=3, max_s=min(2+2,5)=4).\n   s=3: \n        x_min = max(1, 3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n        x_max = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> F_arr[3]=1\n   s=4:\n        x_min = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n        x_max = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> F_arr[4]=1\n   s=5: not needed because max_s=4.\n\n   Then F_arr[0..5] = [0,0,0,1,1,0] (we only built for indices 0..5, but we only use up to 5)\n\n   Then P_arr[0]=0\n        P_arr[1]=0\n        P_arr[2]=0\n        P_arr[3]=1\n        P_arr[4]=1+1=2\n        P_arr[5]=2\n\n   Then for z from C=2 to D=5 (note: C=2, so z from 2 to 5):\n        z=2: P_arr[2]=0\n        z=3: P_arr[3]=1\n        z=4: P_arr[4]=2\n        z=5: P_arr[5]=2\n\n   Then total_invalid = 0+1+2+2 = 5.\n\n   Then answer=8-5=3.\n\nBut wait, why did we consider z from 2 to 5? The problem states: z in [C, D] i.e., [2,5]. And the condition is x+y<=z.\n\nBut note: our F_arr was built for s from 3 to 4. However, for z=2, we are including pairs (x,y) with x+y<=2. There are none, so that's correct.\n\nBut the problem: the input constraints say that y is from [B, C] i.e., [2,2] (so y=2) and x from [1,2]. So the pairs (x,y) are (1,2) and (2,2). \n\nNow, for z=2: condition x+y<=2 -> (1,2):3<=2 -> false, (2,2):4<=2 -> false. So 0 is correct.\n\nBut note: the example input \"1 2 2 5\" has z from 2 to 5, and we are counting the invalid triples for each z. However, the definition of the problem does not require that the triangle condition fails for the same z? Actually, we are counting the entire set of triples (x,y,z) that are invalid (i.e., x+y<=z). \n\nBut note: the problem requires the triangle to have sides x,y,z with x<=B<=y<=C<=z. In this example, y is fixed to 2 (since B=C=2). And z is from 2 to 5. \n\nBut wait: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z. However, note that the side z must be at least C (which is 2) and at most D (which is 5). \n\nSo the invalid triples are those with x+y<=z. \n\nBut note: the example lists the triangles as (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3). So the invalid ones are the ones that don't form a triangle. \n\nOur method counts the invalid ones as 5. Then subtracted from 8 gives 3.\n\nBut wait, how many invalid triples are there?\n\nList all triples (x,y,z) with x in [1,2], y=2, z in [2,5]:\n   (1,2,2): 1+2<=2? 3<=2 -> no, so valid? Actually, 1+2>2 -> 3>2 -> valid. But wait, the condition is non-degenerate: 1+2>2 -> yes, so it is valid.\n\n   (1,2,3): 1+2<=3 -> 3<=3 -> invalid (degenerate)\n   (1,2,4): 1+2<=4 -> 3<=4 -> invalid\n   (1,2,5): 1+2<=5 -> 3<=5 -> invalid\n\n   (2,2,2): 2+2>2 -> 4>2 -> valid\n   (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 -> valid\n   (2,2,4): 2+2>4 -> 4>4 -> no, invalid (degenerate)\n   (2,2,5): 2+2>5 -> 4>5 -> no, invalid.\n\nSo invalid triples: (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,2,5), (2,2,4), (2,2,5) -> 5 invalid.\n\nValid: (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3) -> 3.\n\nBut wait, (1,2,2) is valid. \n\nSo the example output is 3.\n\nBut note: the example input \"1 2 2 5\" is given as ['1 2 2 5'] and output is '3'. \n\nSo our method is correct.\n\nHowever, note that the example input \"1 2 2 5\" includes z from 2 to 5, and the condition for the triple (1,2,2) is satisfied.\n\nBut in our method, we considered the entire set of triples (without the triangle condition) as (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1)=8, and then subtracted the invalid ones (which are the ones that do NOT form a triangle, i.e., x+y<=z). \n\nBut note: the problem says the triple must satisfy A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. In our example, the triple (1,2,2) satisfies: \n   x=1 (in [1,2]), y=2 (in [2,2]), z=2 (in [2,5]) and the triangle condition: 1+2>2 -> 3>2 holds.\n\nSo (1,2,2) is valid.\n\nBut wait: the example output says 3, and we have 3 valid.\n\nNow, the issue: our method for counting the entire set of triples is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1). In the example, that is 2*1*4=8, which is correct.\n\nBut in the example \"1 2 3 4\", we had 8 triples, and we subtracted 4 invalid ones to get 4 valid.\n\nNow, let's list the 8 triples for \"1 2 3 4\":\n\nx in [1,2], y in [2,3], z in [3,4]:\n\n(1,2,3): 1+2<=3 -> invalid\n(1,2,4): 1+2<=4 -> invalid\n(1,3,3): 1+3>3 -> valid\n(1,3,4): 1+3>4 -> 4>4 -> invalid? Actually, 1+3=4, so 1+3<=4 -> invalid (by our definition, we subtract those with x+y<=z). But note: the triangle condition is strict: non-degenerate requires x+y>z. So (1,3,4) is invalid.\n\nWait, then we have:\n\n(1,2,3): invalid\n(1,2,4): invalid\n(1,3,3): valid (1+3>3 -> 4>3)\n(1,3,4): invalid (1+3<=4)\n\n(2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> valid\n(2,2,4): 2+2<=4 -> invalid\n(2,3,3): 2+3>3 -> valid\n(2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> valid\n\nSo valid: (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4) -> 4.\n\nBut wait, (2,3,4): 2+3=5>4 -> valid.\n\nSo the invalid ones are: (1,2,3), (1,2,4), (1,3,4), (2,2,4) -> 4, so 8-4=4.\n\nBut in our method, we counted the invalid ones as 4. \n\nBut note: the example input \"1 2 3 4\" says the triangles are (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). \n\nSo the code:\n\nSteps:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   total = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n   If total==0, then answer=0.\n\n   Then, set:\n        min_s = A+B\n        max_s = min(B+C, D)   # because we only need s from min_s to D, and we don't need s beyond D (since z<=D)\n\n   But wait: we must consider that the pairs (x,y) can have s up to B+C, but we only need s from min_s to D.\n\n   However, note: the pairs (x,y) are defined independently. We need to count the pairs (x,y) for each s from min_s to D.\n\n   But note: if D < min_s, then there are no pairs (because the smallest s is min_s and min_s>D, so no s<=D). Then invalid_count=0, and answer=total.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        low = min_s\n        high = min(B+C, D)\n\n        F_arr = [0]*(D+1)   # indices 0 to D\n\n        # If min_s > D, then we skip the loop and F_arr remains zeros.\n\n        for s in range(low, high+1):\n            x_min = max(A, s-C)\n            x_max = min(B, s-B)\n            if x_min <= x_max:\n                F_arr[s] = x_max - x_min + 1\n            else:\n                F_arr[s] = 0\n\n        Then build prefix array P_arr of length D+1 (index 0 to D):\n            P_arr[0] = 0\n            for i in range(1, D+1):\n                P_arr[i] = P_arr[i-1] + F_arr[i]\n\n        Then, invalid_count = 0\n        for z in range(C, D+1):\n            # Note: the condition for invalid is that the triple (x,y,z) has x+y<=z, and we count for each z the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z (which is P_arr[z])\n            invalid_count += P_arr[z]\n\n        Then answer = total - invalid_count\n\nBut wait, the above for-loop for z from C to D: we are adding P_arr[z] for each z. But note: P_arr[z] is the total number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z. However, the same pair (x,y) may be used for multiple z? Actually, no: we are counting for each z separately, and that is correct because each triple (x,y,z) is uniquely determined by x,y,z.\n\nBut note: the entire set of triples is (x,y,z) with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D].

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is strictly greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we must efficiently compute the valid triples without resorting to brute-force methods, which would be computationally infeasible for large ranges.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the strict triangle inequality must hold. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the most restrictive condition is \\(x + y > z\\). The problem reduces to counting all triples \\((x, y, z)\\) within the specified ranges where \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of checking each triple individually, we can leverage mathematical insights. First, calculate the total number of possible triples without considering the triangle inequality. Then, subtract the number of invalid triples (those that do not satisfy \\(x + y > z\\)).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Total Triples Calculation**: The total number of triples is straightforward: \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1) \\times (D - C + 1)\\).\n   - **Invalid Triples Calculation**: For each possible \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\), count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) in \\([A, B] \\times [B, C]\\) such that \\(x + y \\leq z\\). This count is derived by:\n     - Precomputing an array \\(F\\) where \\(F[s]\\) is the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) that sum to \\(s\\).\n     - Using a prefix sum array to quickly compute the cumulative count of pairs with sums up to any given \\(z\\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Building the \\(F\\) array: \\(O(D)\\) operations.\n   - Building the prefix sum array: \\(O(D)\\) operations.\n   - Summing invalid triples: \\(O(D)\\) operations.\n   The overall complexity is \\(O(D)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(D \\leq 5 \\times 10^5\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total_triples = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n    \n    if total_triples == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    min_s = A + B\n    max_s_val = B + C\n    max_needed = D\n    \n    F_arr = [0] * (max_needed + 1)\n    \n    low_bound = min_s\n    high_bound = min(max_s_val, max_needed)\n    \n    if low_bound <= max_needed:\n        for s in range(low_bound, high_bound + 1):\n            x_min = max(A, s - C)\n            x_max = min(B, s - B)\n            if x_min <= x_max:\n                F_arr[s] = x_max - x_min + 1\n            else:\n                F_arr[s] = 0\n                \n    P_arr = [0] * (max_needed + 1)\n    if max_needed >= 1:\n        P_arr[0] = F_arr[0]\n        for i in range(1, max_needed + 1):\n            P_arr[i] = P_arr[i - 1] + F_arr[i]\n    else:\n        P_arr[0] = 0\n        \n    invalid_count = 0\n    start_z = C\n    end_z = D\n    if start_z <= end_z:\n        for z_val in range(start_z, end_z + 1):\n            if z_val <= max_needed:\n                invalid_count += P_arr[z_val]\n            else:\n                break\n                \n    result = total_triples - invalid_count\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Total Triples Calculation**: The total number of triples \\((x, y, z)\\) is computed as the product of the sizes of the ranges \\([A, B]\\), \\([B, C]\\), and \\([C, D]\\).\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If there are no possible triples (e.g., when any range is empty), the result is immediately 0.\n4. **Precomputing Valid Sums**: For each possible sum \\(s\\) (from \\(A + B\\) to \\(min(B + C, D)\\)), count how many pairs \\((x, y)\\) sum to \\(s\\).
