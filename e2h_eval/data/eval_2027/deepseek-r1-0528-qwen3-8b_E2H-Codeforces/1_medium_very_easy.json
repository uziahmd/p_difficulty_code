    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n Conditions: \n   The plate is w x h.\n   We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge (outermost ring). The second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, etc.\n\n Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle size is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n However, note that the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. But wait: the first ring is the outer border of the entire w x h.\n\n But note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate. The second one 2 cells away, etc.\n\n How many cells in a ring?\n Consider a rectangle of size n x m (n and m being the dimensions of the current inner rectangle for which we are drawing the ring).\n The ring is the border. So the number of cells in the border is:\n   top and bottom: each row has m cells, so 2 * m\n   left and right: but the corners are counted twice, so we subtract 4 (the four corners) and then add the sides without corners? Alternatively, we can compute as:\n   total = 2*(n + m)   [but wait, that would be for the outer border of an n x m rectangle?] Actually, no.\n\n Actually, for a rectangle of size n x m (meaning n rows and m columns), the border has:\n   top row: m cells\n   bottom row: m cells\n   the two middle rows (if any) for the sides: (n-2) * 2 (for the left and right sides without the top and bottom)\n\n But wait, that gives: m (top) + m (bottom) + (n-2)*2 (left and right without top and bottom) = 2*m + 2*(n-2) = 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n However, let's verify with a 3x3: \n   n=3, m=3 -> 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n But note: the problem states that the first ring is the outer ring of the original w x h. Then the next ring is 2 cells away, meaning the next inner rectangle is (w-4) x (h-4) because we remove one ring from each side (so 2 on each side: top and bottom, left and right).\n\n However, the problem says: \"the i-th ring should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\".\n\n But note: the example input '7 9 2' gives output 40.\n\n Let me break down:\n   First ring (k=1): \n        n0 = w, m0 = h -> 7x9\n        border of 7x9: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 30? but expected for k=1 is 28 for input \"7 9 1\", and 40 for k=2.\n\n Wait, the example input '7 9 1' gives 28, and '7 9 2' gives 40.\n\n Let's recalc for 7x9:\n   First ring: \n        It's the border of a 7x9 rectangle: 2*(7+9) - 4 = 2*16 - 4 = 32-4 = 28. Correct.\n\n   Second ring: \n        We consider the inner rectangle of size (7-4*1) x (9-4*1) = 3x5.\n        Then the border of 3x5: 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 16-4=12.\n        Then total cells for two rings: 28 + 12 = 40.\n\n So the formula for the i-th ring (with i starting at 1) is:\n        Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        If either n_i <= 0 or m_i <= 0, then we cannot have that ring. But the problem states k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we are guaranteed that for i from 1 to k, both n_i and m_i are positive.\n\n        The number of cells in the i-th ring is: 2*(n_i + m_i) - 4.\n\n However, note: the ring must exist only if the inner rectangle has at least 3x3? Actually, the smallest rectangle is 1x1? But our calculation for 1x1: 2*(1+1)-4 = 0. That doesn't make sense. \n\n But note the condition: k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). So for example, if w=3, h=3, then min=3 -> floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1. Then k=1: \n        n1=3, m1=3 -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n But if we try k=2 for w=3, h=3: \n        n2 = 3 - 4*(2-1) = 3-4 = -1 -> invalid. But the constraint says k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). So we are safe.\n\n Therefore, we can simply iterate from i=1 to k and sum the border sizes.\n\n Steps:\n   Read w, h, k from stdin.\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        n = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m = h - 4*(i-1)\n        # If the current rectangle is too small (like 0 or negative) then we break, but k is bounded so we don't need to check?\n        # Since k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), then the last i=k will have at least a 1x1? Actually, the condition ensures we don't get negative or zero until after k rings.\n\n        if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n            # According to the problem, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen, but just to be safe, we break.\n            break\n        total += 2*(n + m) - 4\n\n   Print total.\n\n Let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n   i=1: n=3, m=3 -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n   i=1: n=7, m=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 32-4=28 -> correct.\n\n Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n   i=1: 28\n   i=2: n=7-4=3, m=9-4=5 -> 2*(3+5)-4 = 16-4=12; total=28+12=40 -> correct.\n\n Another example: \"5 5 2\"\n   First ring: 5x5 -> 2*(5+5)-4 = 20-4=16.\n   Second ring: 5-4=1, so 1x1 -> 2*(1+1)-4 = 4-4=0. \n   But wait: the constraint says k is at most floor((min(5,5)+1)/4)=floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1. So k=2 is not allowed? Actually, the problem says: \n        k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n   So for 5x5, k can be at most 1. Therefore, we are not required to handle k=2 for 5x5.\n\n   However, note the constraint: \"1 ≤ k ≤ floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\"\n\n   So the input will not give k=2 for 5x5. But what if the input gives k=1 for 5x5? Then we output 16.\n\n   Now, if we have a 10x10 and k=2:\n        First ring: 10x10 -> 2*(10+10)-4 = 40-4=36.\n        Second ring: 10-4=6 -> 6x6 -> 2*(6+6)-4=24-4=20 -> total=56.\n\n   Let me verify 10x10: \n        Outer ring: 10x10 -> the border: 10*4 - 4 = 40-4=36? Actually, the formula is 2*(n+m)-4, which is 2*(10+10)-4=36. Correct.\n\n   Second ring: inner rectangle 6x6. The border of 6x6: 2*(6+6)-4=24-4=20. Correct.\n\n   Then total 56.\n\n   But wait, what is the actual gilding for 10x10? \n        The first ring: all cells that are on the edge (first and last row and column) -> 10*4 - 4 (because the four corners are shared) = 36.\n        The second ring: then we skip the outer ring, so the next ring is the next border. The inner grid is 8x8? No, wait: we remove 2 cells from each side? Actually, the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. So we remove 2 layers? Actually, the description says: the second one 2 cells away from the edge. And each ring has width 1 cell.\n\n        The first ring takes the outermost layer (which is 1 cell wide). Then the second ring is the next layer, which is 1 cell away from the outer ring, so it's 2 cells from the edge (because the edge is the outer, then the first ring is adjacent to the edge, so the second ring is two steps in). \n\n        The entire grid is 10x10. After removing the outer ring (which is 1 cell wide), the remaining grid is 8x8. Then the next ring is the border of the 8x8 grid, which is 8x8's border: 2*(8+8)-4 = 32-4=28? But wait, no.\n\n        Actually, the second ring is defined as the border of the inner rectangle of size (10-4*(2-1)) x (10-4*(2-1)) = (10-4) x (10-4)=6x6. So the second ring is the border of a 6x6 grid, which is 6x6's border: 2*(6+6)-4=20.\n\n        Why 6x6? Because we are stepping in 2 cells from the edge (each ring takes 2 cells from each side? Actually, no: each ring takes 1 cell from the edge, and then the next ring takes another 1 cell from the new edge. So from the original edge, the second ring is 2 cells away. \n\n        In terms of the grid, the first ring uses the outermost 1 cell, then the second ring uses the next 1 cell. So we remove 2 cells from each side (because two rings, one on each side). Thus, the inner rectangle for the second ring is (10-2*2) x (10-2*2)? But wait, the problem states: the i-th ring uses the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)). So for i=2, subtract 4*(1)=4, so 10-4=6. \n\n        This matches: 4*(i-1) because each ring takes 2 cells from the left and right and 2 from top and bottom (so 4 cells per ring in each dimension).\n\n        Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\n Code:\n\n   We read the input, split the integers, then apply the above.\n\n Example: \"3 3 1\" -> [3,3,1] -> output 8.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate. The first ring is the outermost border of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the number of cells in each concentric ring around a rectangular plate. The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of these inner rectangles decrease by 4 cells (2 cells from each side) for each subsequent ring.\n2. **Intuition**: For each ring, the number of cells in its border can be computed using the formula \\(2 \\times (n + m) - 4\\), where \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are the length and width of the current inner rectangle. This formula accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply add the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate from the first to the k-th ring, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, and sum the cells in each ring's border.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\(O(k)\\) time, where \\(k\\) is the number of rings. Since \\(k\\) is bounded by the floor of \\((min(w, h) + 1)/4\\), the solution efficiently handles the constraints without any performance issues.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        n = w - 4 * (i-1)\n        m = h - 4 * (i-1)\n        if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n            break\n        total += 2 * (n + m) - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`:\n   - Compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) from both width and height (since each ring reduces the dimensions by 2 cells on each side).\n   - If the dimensions become non-positive, break the loop as further rings are not possible.\n   - Calculate the number of cells in the current ring's border using the formula \\(2 \\times (n + m) - 4\\) and add it to `total`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and a loop to handle each ring individually, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
