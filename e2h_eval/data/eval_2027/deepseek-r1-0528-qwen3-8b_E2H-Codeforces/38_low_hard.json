    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000) and we need to output two integers: \n   n = minimum number of nodes required to have exactly p pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability.\n   m = maximum number of unidirectional pairs (over all edges in the graph) in such a graph with n nodes.\n\n Note: The condition for p-reachable is that the graph must contain exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) (with u < v) such that u and v are mutually reachable.\n\n Observation:\n In a directed graph, mutual reachability forms equivalence classes (strongly connected components). However, note that the problem counts only pairs (u, v) with u < v.\n\n Let the graph have k strongly connected components (SCCs). Then, within each SCC, every pair (u, v) with u != v is mutually reachable. So the number of mutual pairs inside one SCC of size s is C(s,2) = s*(s-1)//2.\n\n But note: the problem says \"exactly p\" ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability.\n\n Also, there might be edges between different SCCs? However, if we have a DAG of SCCs, then there are no mutual reachabilities across different SCCs (by definition). Therefore, the total mutual pairs is the sum over each SCC of C(s_i,2).\n\n Moreover, we can arrange the graph as a DAG of the SCCs. We want exactly p mutual pairs.\n\n So we are to represent p as the sum of combinations (i.e., the triangular numbers) from some partition of nodes into k SCCs (each component being non-empty). \n\n But note: we are allowed to have any graph? Actually, we can form the graph by first partitioning the n nodes into k SCCs (so n = s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_k) and then connect the SCCs in a way that the entire graph is a DAG (no cycles between SCCs) and then we can have as many edges as we want (but we are concerned about the unidirectional pairs).\n\n However, the problem does not require us to minimize edges or anything else, but to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n What is a unidirectional pair?\n   (u, v) is unidirectional if there is a path from u to v but not from v to u.\n\n Note: In our graph, we have SCCs and a DAG between them. Within an SCC, every node is mutually reachable, so there is no unidirectional edge within an SCC? Actually, the definition requires that there is a path from u to v and no path from v to u. But if u and v are in the same SCC, then both directions exist, so they don't count. \n\n Now, consider edges between different SCCs. Since the graph is a DAG, if there is an edge from an SCC A to an SCC B, then there is no edge (or no path) from B to A (if we design the DAG appropriately). But note: the problem doesn't specify the structure beyond the mutual reachability. However, to achieve the maximum unidirectional pairs, we would like to have as many edges as possible (without creating cycles) and also we must avoid adding edges that would merge two SCCs (because then they would become one SCC and change the count of mutual pairs).\n\n Therefore, we must break the graph into exactly k SCCs (so that the total mutual pairs is the sum of C(s_i,2) for i=1..k). Then, the edges we can add are from a node in one SCC to a node in another SCC only if the target SCC is topologically after the source (to avoid cycles). \n\n Now, note: the problem asks for the minimum number of nodes n (so we want the smallest n such that there exists a partition of n into k parts (for some k) such that the sum of C(s_i,2) equals p.\n\n How to compute n and the maximum unidirectional pairs?\n\n Step 1: Represent p as a sum of triangular numbers (each triangular number being T(s) = s*(s-1)//2). We want to minimize n (the total number of nodes) which is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs.\n\n However, note: the triangular numbers are fixed for a given size. We are allowed to use multiple SCCs of the same size? Yes.\n\n We need to find a set of positive integers {a1, a2, ..., ak} such that:\n      sum_{i=1}^{k} [a_i*(a_i-1)//2] = p\n and we want to minimize n = a1+a2+...+ak.\n\n Then, we must also compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n How to compute the maximum unidirectional pairs",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, meaning it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) where u < v and u and v are mutually reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (pairs where there is a path from u to v but not from v to u).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that mutual reachability between nodes forms strongly connected components (SCCs). The total number of mutual pairs in a graph is the sum of combinations of nodes within each SCC. For an SCC of size `s`, the number of mutual pairs is `s*(s-1)/2`.\n\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The problem reduces to partitioning the total number of nodes into SCCs such that the sum of their triangular numbers (combinations) equals `p`, and the total number of nodes is minimized. This involves finding a set of integers (sizes of SCCs) whose combination sums to `p` with the smallest possible sum.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum number of nodes is determined, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated by considering all possible edges between different SCCs in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. Each edge between two different SCCs contributes to unidirectional pairs if it does not create a cycle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    p = int(data[0])\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = 1\n    total_tri = 0\n    while total_tri < p:\n        tri_n = n * (n - 1) // 2\n        if total_tri + tri_n <= p:\n            total_tri += tri_n\n        else:\n            break\n        n += 1\n        \n    s = []\n    cur = p\n    i = 1\n    while cur > 0:\n        tri_i = i * (i - 1) // 2\n        if cur >= tri_i:\n            cur -= tri_i\n            s.append(i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    total_nodes = sum(s)\n    k = len(s)\n    \n    max_unidirectional = 0\n    for size in s:\n        max_unidirectional += size * (total_nodes - size)\n        \n    print(f\"{total_nodes} {max_unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer `p`, which is the required number of mutual pairs.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If `p` is 0, the solution is trivially 0 nodes with 0 unidirectional pairs.\n3. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: The code calculates the minimum number of nodes by summing triangular numbers until the sum reaches or exceeds `p`. Each triangular number corresponds to the number of mutual pairs in an SCC of a given size.\n4. **Partitioning Nodes**: The remaining value after subtracting the largest possible triangular numbers from `p` determines the sizes of the remaining SCCs.\n5. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**: The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is derived by considering all possible edges between nodes in different SCCs in a DAG structure, which is computed as the sum of each SCC's size multiplied by the total number of nodes outside it.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the solution by leveraging mathematical properties of triangular numbers and combinatorial partitioning, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `p`.",
