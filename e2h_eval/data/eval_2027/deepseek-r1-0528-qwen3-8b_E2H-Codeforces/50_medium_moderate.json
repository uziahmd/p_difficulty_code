Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ Two trees are considered to be distinct if either:   there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in one of the trees, and not in the other.  there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in both trees but the weight of the edge between them in one tree is different from the one in the other tree. Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the sum of d(1, n) over all good edge-weighted trees on n labeled vertices.\n\n Conditions for a good tree:\n  - Each edge weight is either 1 or -1.\n  - For each vertex i, the product of the edge weights along any fundamental cycle (if we consider the condition for each vertex) is not directly given. However, note that the condition says: \"for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges having i as one endpoint is -1\".\n\n But note: In a tree, each edge is incident to two vertices. The condition applies to every vertex. However, if we look at the entire tree, the product condition for each vertex i must hold. This condition is actually very strong.\n\n Let T be the tree and let the edges incident to vertex i have weights w1, w2, ..., w_deg(i). Then the condition is: w1 * w2 * ... * w_deg(i) = -1.\n\n However, note that in the entire tree, each edge is shared by two vertices. Also, if we consider the entire set of conditions, we can multiply all the conditions together:\n\n For each vertex i, we have a product of the incident edges. Then the product over all i of (product_{e incident to i} w_e) = (-1)^n.\n\n But note: each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So the total product is (product_{all edges e} w_e^(deg(i)))? Actually, no: each edge appears exactly twice (once for each endpoint). Therefore, the product of all vertex conditions is:\n\n   ∏_{i=1}^{n} (∏_{e incident to i} w_e) = (∏_{e} w_e^2)   [since each edge e appears twice, once for each endpoint]\n\n However, note that the condition requires the product for each vertex to be -1, so the entire product is (-1)^n.\n\n But then: (∏_{e} w_e^2) = (-1)^n.\n\n However, note that squaring each edge weight: since the weight is either 1 or -1, then w_e^2 = 1. Therefore, we get 1 = (-1)^n.\n\n This implies that n must be even. Otherwise, if n is odd, there is no solution.\n\n So first observation: \n   If n is odd, the answer is 0 because the conditions cannot be satisfied.\n\n Now, what about even n?\n\n But wait: the example input includes n=2 (even) and n=4 (even) and n=1? \n   For n=1: There are no edges. The condition for the single vertex: the product of edges having it as an endpoint is the empty product which is 1. But the condition requires -1. So n=1 fails. However, the example input has n=2,4,... and also n=1,43434 (which is even). \n\n However, note the problem states: \"There are n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}\" distinct trees. But the condition of being good is stronger. For n=1, the tree has 0 edges, so the product condition for the only vertex is 1 (empty product) but we require -1 -> no good tree. So the answer for n=1 should be 0.\n\n But the example input does not include n=1? The example input says: \n   Input: ['2', '1', '4', '10', '43434']\n\n And output: \n   ['998244352', '0', '998244343', '948359297', '86232114']\n\n So for n=1: output 0.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If n==1: output 0.\n 2. If n is odd (and n>=3): output 0.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"for each vertex i\", so for n=2: two vertices, one edge. The condition for vertex 1: the product of its incident edges is -1 -> the edge must be -1. Similarly for vertex 2: the same edge must be -1. So the only good tree for n=2 has edge weight -1. Then d(1,2) = -1. And modulo 998244353: -1 mod 998244353 = 998244352.\n\n Now, for even n>=2, we need to count the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\n Note: d(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights on the unique path from 1 to n.\n\n How to approach?\n\n We are to consider all trees with n labeled vertices (so the structure matters) and with edge weights being ±1, and satisfying the condition that for each vertex i, the product of the incident edge weights is -1.\n\n Since the condition forces the entire product of all edge weights (each squared) to be 1 and we require (-1)^n, which is 1 when n is even, so the condition is consistent.\n\n However, note that the condition is a system of n equations. There are n-1 edges, so we have one degree of freedom? Actually, the system is:\n\n   For each vertex i: ∏_{e incident to i} w_e = -1.\n\n But note: if we fix the weights for n-2 edges arbitrarily, then the last edge's weight is determined by the conditions for the two vertices it connects? However, the conditions for all vertices might be dependent.\n\n Alternatively, note that the condition for the entire graph is equivalent to: the product of all edge weights (with multiplicity by the number of times an edge is used in the conditions) is 1 (from the product of squares) and also (-1)^n, which is 1 for even n. But we have n equations and n-1 variables. The system must be consistent.\n\n Another way: Consider the condition for each vertex i. Let x_i be the product of the incident edges. Then we require x_i = -1.\n\n However, note that the product of the x_i is (∏_e w_e^2) = 1, and we require (-1)^n. This is consistent only for even n.\n\n Now, how many solutions are there for the edge weights? We have n-1 edges and n equations. The equations are linear in the log(w_e) (but that is not linear). Alternatively, we can use linear algebra over GF(2) if we take the signs? But note: the product condition is multiplicative.\n\n Actually, we can assign the edges arbitrarily except for one relation. The system of equations is:\n\n   ∏_{e incident to i} w_e = -1, for each i.\n\n This is equivalent to: for each i, the product of the edges incident to i is fixed.\n\n Now, note that the graph is a tree, so the condition for the leaves (vertices of degree 1) is simple: if a leaf has one incident edge, then that edge must be -1. So all edges incident to leaves must be -1.\n\n But wait: what if we have two leaves connected by an edge? Then both leaves have one incident edge, so the edge must be -1 for both. Then we move to the next level.\n\n However, consider a vertex of degree d. The condition is the product of the incident edges is -1.\n\n But note: the edges are shared. We can try to assign the edges in a DFS/BFS order.\n\n Alternatively, note that the condition for each vertex i is independent of the others except for the global consistency.\n\n Actually, we can show that the system has a unique solution up to flipping the sign of the entire set of edges? Not exactly.\n\n Let me consider a small even n, say n=2: one edge. Then the condition for both vertices forces the edge to be -1. So one solution.\n\n For n=4: \n   We have a tree with 4 vertices. There are 3 edges. The conditions for each vertex must be -1.\n\n   Label the vertices 1,2,3,4. Suppose we fix the edges: (1-2), (2-3), (3-4). Then:\n\n     Vertex 1: edge (1-2) must be -1.\n     Vertex 2: edges (1-2) and (2-3) must have product -1. Since (1-2) is -1, then (2-3) must be 1? Because (-1)*x = -1 => x=1.\n     Vertex 3: edges (2-3) and (3-4) must have product -1. (2-3)=1, so (3-4) must be -1.\n     Vertex 4: edge (3-4) must be -1 -> which is already set.\n\n   Alternatively, if we consider a different tree structure, say a star: center vertex 2, with edges (1-2), (2-3), (2-4).\n\n     Vertex 1: (1-2) = -1.\n     Vertex 2: (1-2)*(2-3)*(2-4) = -1 => (-1)*x*y = -1 => x*y = 1.\n     Vertex 3: (2-3)=x -> must be -1? No, the condition for vertex 3 is just (2-3)=x must be -1? But wait, vertex 3 has only one edge, so x=-1. Similarly, vertex 4: (2-4)=y must be -1.\n\n   Then for vertex 2: (-1)*(-1)*(-1) = -1, which satisfies. But wait, the condition for vertex 2: (-1)*(-1)*(-1) = -1, yes. However, the conditions for the leaves force the edges to be -1, so the center edge product is (-1)*(-1)*(-1) = -1, which is correct.\n\n   But wait, in the chain structure we got one solution and in the star structure we got another? Actually, no: the star structure forces all edges to be -1. Then the condition for the center is (-1)*(-1)*(-1) = -1, and the leaves are -1. \n\n   However, note that the chain structure and the star structure are different trees (different sets of edges). So we are considering all labeled trees.\n\n But note: the condition forces the edges incident to leaves to be -1. Then for non-leaf vertices, the product of the incident edges must be -1. So the assignment is forced for the entire tree? \n\n Actually, we can assign the edges as follows:\n\n   - All leaves must have their incident edge as -1.\n   - Then, for a vertex i that is not a leaf, the product of the incident edges must be -1. But note: the edges incident to i are determined by the conditions of the leaves? Not exactly.\n\n However, we can use the following: \n\n   Let T be the tree. We can root the tree arbitrarily. Then, the condition for a leaf is fixed. Then, for an internal node, we can traverse from the leaves upward.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the condition for each vertex is independent, but they are linked by the edges. However, we have one degree of freedom: the product of the edge weights around the entire tree? Actually, we have n equations and n-1 variables. The system is:\n\n        ∏_{e incident to i} w_e = -1, for each i.\n\n   This is equivalent to:\n\n        ∏_{e} w_e^{d(i)} = (-1)   [where d(i) is the degree of i?] \n\n   But wait, no: the condition is multiplicative and each edge appears in two conditions. \n\n   Actually, we can write:\n\n        Let A be the incidence matrix (each row for a vertex, each column for an edge) and then the condition is: A * w = -1 (over the multiplicative group {1,-1}).\n\n   This is a system of linear equations in the exponents modulo 2 (if we take logarithm base -1, but note: the multiplicative group {1,-1} is isomorphic to Z/2Z, but with the operation being multiplication). However, we can map:\n        w_e = 1  ->  0 mod 2\n        w_e = -1 ->  1 mod 2\n\n   Then the condition for vertex i: sum_{e incident to i} w_e (mod2) = 1 (because the product is -1, and the logarithm base -1 maps -1 to 1, and 1 to 0; then the product becomes the sum mod2).\n\n   Now, the system becomes:\n\n        M * w = b   (mod2)\n\n   where M is the incidence matrix (each row i has 1s for edges incident to i, and 0 elsewhere) and b is the vector of ones (because each condition requires the sum mod2 to be 1).\n\n   However, note: the system is over GF(2). The incidence matrix of a connected graph (tree) has rank n-1. So the system has a solution if and only if the vector b is in the column space of M.\n\n   The condition for solvability: the sum of the entries of b must be 0 mod2? Actually, the sum of the rows of M (each edge appears twice) is 0. Then the system is consistent if and only if the sum of b_i is 0 mod2. \n\n        Sum_i b_i = n * 1 = n mod2.\n\n   But we know that n is even (from earlier, otherwise no solution). So the system is consistent.\n\n   The solution space is an affine space of dimension 1 (since the nullity of M is 1, because rank(M)=n-1 and there are n-1 edges). \n\n   Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^(n-1) / 2^(rank) ??? Actually, the solution space for the linear system M*w = b has size 2^(n-1 - (n-1)) = 2^0 = 1? Wait, no: the nullity is 1, so the solution space has dimension 1 (if consistent) meaning 2^1 = 2 solutions? \n\n   Actually, the homogeneous system M*w = 0 has solutions: the cycle space. But note: the incidence matrix of a tree has nullity 1 (the one-dimensional cycle space of the tree is trivial? Actually, the cycle space of a connected graph has dimension m-n+1, but here m=n-1, so dimension 0. Wait, no: the incidence matrix of a connected graph has rank n-1 (over reals) but over GF(2) the rank is n-1 as well for a tree? Actually, for a tree, the incidence matrix over GF(2) has rank n-1 (same as over reals) and the nullity is (number of edges) - (n-1) = 0. \n\n   Correction: the incidence matrix M has n rows and m columns (m=n-1). The rank of M over GF(2) for a connected graph is n-1 (same as over reals). Then the solution space for the inhomogeneous system M*w = b has dimension (number of edges) - (n-1) = 0? Then the system has either 0 or 1 solution? \n\n   But wait, we just said the system is consistent (because n is even) and the rank is n-1, so the solution space has dimension (n-1) - (n-1) = 0. Then there is exactly one solution.\n\n   However, wait: the system M*w = b (over GF(2)) is a system of n equations and n-1 variables. The rank is n-1, so we have one equation that is redundant. But the consistency condition is that the sum of the rows (which is 0) must equal the sum of the b_i (which is 0 mod2 because n is even). So the system has a unique solution.\n\n   Therefore, for even n, there is exactly one assignment of edge weights (each ±1) that satisfies the condition for every vertex.\n\n   But wait: in our example for n=2: \n        Condition: one equation for vertex1: w1 = 1 (in GF(2)) -> but wait, we mapped: \n          w_e = 1 -> 0, w_e = -1 -> 1.\n\n        The condition: for vertex1: the equation is w1 = 1 (mod2) -> w1 must be -1.\n\n        Similarly for vertex2: w1 = 1 (mod2) -> w1 must be -1.\n\n        So the solution is unique.\n\n   For n=4 (chain): \n        Vertices: 1,2,3,4. Edges: e12, e23, e34.\n\n        Conditions:\n          v1: e12 = 1 (mod2) -> w12 = -1.\n          v2: e12 + e23 = 1 (mod2) -> 1 + e23 = 1 -> e23 = 0 -> w23 = 1.\n          v3: e23 + e34 = 1 (mod2) -> 0 + e34 = 1 -> e34 = 1 -> w34 = -1.\n          v4: e34 = 1 (mod2) -> w34 = -1.\n\n        So the solution is unique: [-1, 1, -1].\n\n   For n=4 (star): \n        Vertices: 1,2,3,4. Edges: e12, e23, e24. (But wait, the star centered at 2: edges from 2 to 1, 2 to 3, 2 to 4)\n\n        Conditions:\n          v1: e12 = 1 -> w12 = -1.\n          v2: e12 + e23 + e24 = 1 -> 1 + e23 + e24 = 1 -> e23+e24=0 -> so e23 = e24 (both 0 or both 1).\n          v3: e23 = 1 -> w23 = -1 -> so e23=1.\n          v4: e24 = 1 -> w24 = -1 -> so e24=1.\n\n        Then the condition for v2: 1+1+1 = 1 mod2 -> 1+1+1 = 3 mod2 = 1, which matches.\n\n        So the solution is: w12=-1, w23=-1, w24=-1.\n\n        But wait, this is the same as the chain? No, the chain was [-1,1,-1] and the star is [-1,-1,-1]. \n\n        However, note: the condition for the star: \n            v1: -1 -> ok.\n            v2: (-1)*(-1)*(-1) = -1 -> ok (because the product is -1, and in GF(2) we did the additive: 1+1+1=1 mod2, which is the same as the product being -1).\n            v3: -1 -> ok.\n            v4: -1 -> ok.\n\n        But wait, the chain and the star are two different trees (different structures). So the assignment of weights is independent of the structure? \n\n        Actually, no: the system of equations depends on the structure (the incidence matrix). \n\n        So the conclusion: for a fixed tree structure (fixed edges and fixed incidences) the condition gives a unique assignment of edge weights (if n is even). \n\n   Therefore, the total number of good trees is equal to the number of labeled trees (on n vertices) multiplied by the number of assignments that satisfy the condition? But wait, we just saw that for each tree structure there is exactly one assignment of edge weights that satisfies the condition (if n is even). \n\n   However, wait: the system we set up is for a fixed set of edges (the fixed tree structure). The condition for the system is that the incidence matrix (which depends on the tree structure) must be such that the system has a solution (which it does because n is even) and then the solution is unique.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of good trees is the number of labeled trees (which is n^(n-2)) times 1 (for the unique assignment per tree)? \n\n   But wait: the problem states that the total number of distinct edge-weighted trees (without the good condition) is n^(n-2) * 2^(n-1). And now we are imposing the good condition. \n\n   However, note: the good condition is a system of n equations and n-1 variables (edge weights) and the system is consistent and has a unique solution for each tree structure. Therefore, the number of good trees is the number of labeled trees (which is n^(n-2)) because for each labeled tree structure there is exactly one assignment of edge weights that makes it good.\n\n   But wait: the example says for n=4: 16 distinct trees without condition. With condition, how many? According to our reasoning, 4^(2)=16, and then we assign weights: normally 2^(3)=8, but now we have one solution per tree? Then the number of good trees would be 16? \n\n   However, the example says: \"In the third test case, there are 16 distinct good trees\". \n\n   So the example says there are 16 good trees for n=4. \n\n   Therefore, the total number of good trees is the same as the number of labeled trees (without considering weights) because the condition forces the weights uniquely for each labeled tree.\n\n   So the number of good trees is n^(n-2).\n\n   Now, we are to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\n   Since each good tree has a unique weight assignment (as above), we can think:\n\n   We need to compute:\n        Sum_{T: all labeled trees on n vertices} [ d(1,n)_T ]\n\n   where d(1,n)_T is the sum of the edge weights on the path from 1 to n in tree T, and the edge weights are assigned according to the condition (which is fixed for T).\n\n   How to compute this?\n\n   We can use linearity of summation? Or break down the problem.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use generating functions or combinatorial identities.\n\n   Note: d(1,n) = sum_{edges e on the path from 1 to n} w_e.\n\n   And we know that the weight of an edge e is determined by the entire tree structure (via the system of equations). However, the system of equations is defined per tree.\n\n   Another idea: consider that the condition for each vertex is independent of the labeling? \n\n   But note: the condition for the entire graph is multiplicative and the assignment is unique for a given tree.\n\n   We can try to use the fact that the condition is linear in GF(2) and then use inclusion-exclusion or generating functions.\n\n   However, note that the value of an edge weight is determined by the conditions. We can express the weight of an edge in terms of the conditions at the endpoints? \n\n   Actually, consider an edge e=(u,v). In the system, the condition for u and v involve e. But the system is:\n\n        For vertex i: ∏_{e' incident to i} w_{e'} = -1.\n\n   We can solve for w_e:\n\n        Let P(u) be the set of edges incident to u excluding e. Then the condition for u is: (∏_{e' in P(u)} w_{e'}) * w_e = -1.\n\n        Similarly, for v: (∏_{e' in P(v)} w_{e'}) * w_e = -1.\n\n        Therefore, (∏_{e' in P(u)} w_{e'}) = (∏_{e' in P(v)} w_{e'}) = -1 / w_e.\n\n        But note: the product condition for u and v are independent? Actually, the entire system is consistent and we can express w_e in terms of other edges.\n\n   However, we can also note: the entire assignment is unique. Therefore, the weight of an edge is a function of the tree structure.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Since the system is linear in GF(2) and the solution is unique, we can write the weight of an edge e as a linear combination (over GF(2)) of the conditions? But note: the conditions are the same for all vertices (each must be -1). \n\n   Actually, we can write:\n\n        w_e = (-1)^(some linear combination of the conditions) ?\n\n   But the conditions are fixed (each vertex condition is -1). \n\n   However, note: the conditions are not independent. \n\n   Another approach: use the fact that the product of the conditions for all vertices is 1 (because each edge appears twice) and the condition is (-1)^n, so for even n, the conditions are consistent.\n\n   How to compute the sum over all trees?\n\n   We can use the concept of Prüfer code. The number of labeled trees is n^(n-2). And the Prüfer code assigns degrees to the vertices. The degree of vertex i is d_i, then the number of trees with given degrees is (n-2)! / (∏_{i}(d_i-1)!)) and the sum over trees can be broken down by degrees.\n\n   But note: the condition on the edge weights is determined by the entire tree and the system of equations.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use generating functions and the linearity of the sum.\n\n   Let F(n) = sum_{T} d(1,n)_T.\n\n   Since d(1,n) = sum_{e in the path from 1 to n} w_e, then:\n\n        F(n) = sum_{T} sum_{e in path(1,n) in T} w_e(T)\n\n        = sum_{e} sum_{T: e is on the path from 1 to n} w_e(T)\n\n   Now, we can fix an edge e and count the number of trees in which e is on the path from 1 to n, and then multiply by w_e(T) (which depends on T and the edge e).\n\n   However, note: the weight w_e(T) is determined by the entire tree T (by the system of equations). \n\n   This seems difficult.\n\n   Another idea: since the weight assignment is unique for each tree, we can express the weight of an edge e in terms of the degrees and the structure of the tree? \n\n   But note: the system is defined by the incidence. The condition for each vertex i: the product of the incident edges is -1.\n\n   We can write the weight of an edge e = (u,v) as:\n\n        w_e = ∏_{cycle containing e?} ... \n\n   Actually, we can use the following: \n\n        The condition for vertex u: ∏_{f incident to u} w_f = -1.\n\n        The condition for vertex v: ∏_{g incident to v} w_g = -1.\n\n        And the edge e is common.\n\n        Then, w_e = (∏_{f incident to u, f≠e} w_f) * (-1)   [from u]\n        and w_e = (∏_{g incident to v, g≠e} w_g) * (-1)   [from v]\n\n        But then the two expressions must be equal.\n\n   However, we don't have an explicit formula.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the entire assignment is the unique solution to the system. We can also consider the dual: the effect of an edge on the entire system.\n\n   After careful thought, note that the condition for each vertex is independent of the tree structure? Actually, no.\n\n   Another known fact: the system of equations for the tree is the same as saying that the product of the edge weights around the entire tree (if we had cycles) would be 1, but we don't have cycles. \n\n   But we can use the following: \n\n        In a tree, the product of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n is d(1,n).\n\n        And we have a unique assignment for the entire tree.\n\n   However, we can break the path from 1 to n into edges. Each edge on the path will have a weight that is determined by the entire tree.\n\n   But note: the condition for the entire tree is that the product of the incident edges for each vertex is -1.\n\n   We can use the following: \n\n        Consider the entire tree and the path from 1 to n. The condition for each vertex is fixed.\n\n        The weight of an edge e is determined by the conditions of its two endpoints and the rest of the edges. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n        Since the system is linear in GF(2), the weight of an edge e can be expressed as the XOR (or the parity) of the conditions of the vertices. \n\n        Specifically, if we let x_i be the condition (in GF(2)) for vertex i (which is 1 for each vertex, since we map -1 to 1 and 1 to 0, and the condition is 1 mod2), then:\n\n        The system is: M * w = x, where x_i = 1 for all i.\n\n        Then, by Cramer's rule or by solving the system, we can express w_e as a linear combination of the x_i's. But note the system is:\n\n            ∑_{e' incident to i} w_{e'} = 1 (mod2) for each i.\n\n        The solution is unique. We can write w_e = c_e + ... (linear combination) but the x_i are all ones.\n\n        Then, w_e = a_e * (sum_i x_i) + ... ? Actually, the system is consistent and the solution is unique.\n\n   But note: the system is M*w = x, and M is the incidence matrix. The solution is:\n\n        w_e = (cofactor of e) * (M^{-1} * x)   [but M is singular? Actually, the incidence matrix of a tree has rank n-1, so we can use the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse? Or we can use the fact that the solution is the unique vector w such that M*w = x.\n\n   However, we can use the following: the system is:\n\n        For each vertex i, the sum of w_e over edges incident to i is 1 mod2.\n\n        This is the same as: the edge e has w_e = the parity of the edges incident to the two endpoints and the rest? \n\n   Actually, we can use the following: \n\n        Consider the spanning tree and the fundamental cuts. But I recall that the incidence matrix of a tree has the property that the solution is given by:\n\n            w_e = (the sum of the x_i for i in one side) minus ... ?\n\n   Another idea: use the fact that the tree is acyclic. The assignment is essentially a potential assignment.\n\n   We can assign potentials to the vertices. Let p_i be the potential at vertex i. Then the edge weight w_{ij} = p_i + p_j (mod2) doesn't work because then the product condition is multiplicative.\n\n   Given the complexity, perhaps we can use generating functions and the linearity of the sum.\n\n   We can also note that d(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights on the path from 1 to n. And the edge weights are ±1. \n\n   The expected value of d(1,n) over all good trees might be zero? But we are summing, not averaging.\n\n   However, note: the good trees are not uniformly random in edge weights? The edge weights are fixed by the tree structure.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n        Let F(n) = sum_{T} d(1,n) for good trees.\n\n        We can write F(n) = sum_{T} [ sum_{e in path(1,n) in T} w_e(T) ]\n\n        = sum_{e} [ w_e(T) * (number of trees T that contain e in the path from 1 to n) ]\n\n        But wait, w_e(T) depends on T.\n\n        However, for a fixed edge e, the weight w_e(T) is determined by T. But note: the system of equations for T defines w_e(T). \n\n        We can try to compute for a fixed edge e, the value of w_e(T) over all trees T that have e in the path from 1 to n.\n\n        But the condition for the system depends on the entire tree, not just the presence of e.\n\n   This seems too complex.\n\n   Alternative Insight:\n\n   Since the system of equations is linear in GF(2) and the solution is unique, we can write the weight of an edge e as a function of the tree structure. \n\n   However, note that the system is defined by the entire tree (the incidence). But there is a combinatorial invariant: the weight of an edge e might depend on the degrees or the positions of the vertices.\n\n   But observe: the condition for each vertex i is that the product of its incident edges is -1. This means that the number of edges incident to i with weight -1 must be odd.\n\n   Therefore, for each vertex i, the degree d_i must be at least 1, and the number of -1 edges incident to i is odd.\n\n   Now, consider the entire tree: the sum of the edge weights (with multiplicity) is not defined, but the product condition holds.\n\n   Now, how to compute d(1,n) for a fixed tree T? \n\n        d(1,n) = sum_{e on the path} w_e.\n\n        And w_e is either 1 or -1.\n\n   Now, we want to sum this over all T.\n\n   We can use the following: \n\n        Let X_T be the indicator variable for an edge e being present and being on the path from 1 to n, but then we also need the weight.\n\n   However, note: the weight is determined by the tree and the system.\n\n   After reading the example outputs:\n\n        n=2: answer = 998244352 = -1 mod 998244353.\n        n=1: answer = 0.\n        n=4: answer = 998244343 = -10 mod 998244353.\n\n   How to get -10 for n=4?\n\n        There are 16 good trees. We computed that there are 16 good trees.\n\n        The example says: \n            d(1,4) is: \n                -2 for 2 trees;\n                -1 for 8 trees;\n                0 for 4 trees;\n                1 for 2 trees.\n\n        Sum = 2*(-2) + 8*(-1) + 4*0 + 2*(1) = -4 -8 + 2 = -10.\n\n   Now, note that the tree for n=4 has 3 edges. The path from 1 to 4 has 3 edges? Actually, no: the path from 1 to 4 in a tree with 4 vertices has 3 edges? Actually, the distance is the number of edges, so the path has 3 edges if the tree is a chain. But if the tree is a star, then the path from 1 to 4 goes through the center, so 2 edges.\n\n   So the length of the path from 1 to 4 varies.\n\n   Therefore, we must account for the length of the path.\n\n   Let L(T) be the length of the path from 1 to n in tree T (number of edges). Then d(1,n)(T) = sum_{i=1}^{L(T)} w_{e_i}.\n\n   But the edge weights are ±1, so the sum can range from -L(T) to L(T).\n\n   We are summing over all T.\n\n   Now, the challenge is to compute this sum.\n\n   We can try to use the following:\n\n        F(n) = sum_{T} d(1,n)(T)\n\n        = sum_{T} [ sum_{e in the path(1,n)} w_e ]\n\n        = sum_{e} sum_{T: e in path(1,n)} w_e(T)\n\n   Now, we can fix an edge e and consider the set of trees T that have e on the path from 1 to n.\n\n   But note: the path from 1 to n in a tree is unique. The edge e is on the path if and only if e is in the unique simple path from 1 to n.\n\n   To have e on the path from 1 to n, we must have that e lies between 1 and n. This means that e must connect two parts: one containing 1 and the other containing n.\n\n   So, we can split the tree by removing e, and then 1 and n must lie in different components.\n\n   Let the two sides of the edge e be a component A (containing 1) and B (containing n). Then the number of trees that have e and for which e is on the path from 1 to n is the number of trees on the complete graph with the condition that e is present and the removal of e separates 1 and n.\n\n   However, the total number of labeled trees is n^(n-2). The number of trees containing a fixed edge e is (n-2)^(n-2) [by contracting the edge e, then the tree is a tree on n-1 vertices, but with the two endpoints of e merged, so the number of trees on n-1 vertices is (n-1)^(n-3), and then we must account for the fixed edge? Actually, Cayley's formula: the number of trees containing a fixed edge is (n-2)^(n-2) [",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the distances from vertex 1 to vertex n in all good edge-weighted trees. A good tree is defined as one where each edge weight is either 1 or -1, and for every vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - **Good Tree Conditions**: The tree must satisfy two conditions: each edge weight is ±1, and for each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1.\n   - **Key Insight**: The system of equations derived from the product conditions for each vertex is consistent only if the number of vertices \\( n \\) is even. For odd \\( n \\), no such tree exists, so the answer is 0.\n   - **Unique Assignment**: For even \\( n \\), each labeled tree structure has exactly one assignment of edge weights that satisfies the product conditions. Thus, the total number of good trees is \\( n^{n-2} \\).\n\n2. **Sum Calculation**:\n   - **Distance Sum**: The distance \\( d(1, n) \\) for a tree is the sum of the weights along the unique path from vertex 1 to vertex \\( n \\).
