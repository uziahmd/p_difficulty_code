Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation is that the roads divide the plane into regions (blocks). The movement is allowed only across entire road segments (nonzero common border). Importantly, two adjacent blocks (sharing a segment of a road) can be crossed in one step.\n\n However, note that the problem states that an intersection is a point where at least two roads meet. But the movement condition is that we can cross from one block to another if they share a nonzero boundary segment.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Since the roads are linear and the problem is about crossing from one region to another, we can think of each road as a barrier. The minimal steps required to get from home to university is the number of roads that separate them? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, consider that we start in a block and we want to reach the block containing the university. We can cross a road only when we are adjacent to it and we cross the entire road segment (so we are effectively flipping from one side to the other).\n\n But note: the problem says that we can move from one block to another in one step if they share a nonzero border. This means that crossing one road takes one step, but if multiple roads separate the two points then we have to cross each one?\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n   Output: 2\n\n In this example, there are two roads: \n   Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0  => y = 0\n   Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0  => x = 0\n\n The home (1,1) is above and to the right of both roads, and the university (-1,-1) is below and to the left. So to get from home to university, we must cross both roads. But note: we cannot cross two roads at once because the roads are infinite and the regions are defined by all roads.\n\n However, the problem does not require crossing the entire set of roads that separate the two points? Actually, the answer is 2.\n\n Another example:\n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n   Output: 2\n\n Here, the third road is x+y-3=0. The two points (1,1) and (-1,-1) are on the same side of the third road (since 1+1-3=-1<0 and -1-1-3=-5<0). So we only need to cross the first two roads.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the number of roads that separate the two points (i.e., the two points lie on opposite sides of the road). Because to go from one block to another, you must cross every road that separates them.\n\n However, wait: what if a road does not separate the two points? Then we don't need to cross it. And for each road that separates them, we must cross it at least once.\n\n But note: the movement is defined by steps that cross entire road segments. Since the roads are linear, crossing one road is independent of the others. However, sometimes we might cross multiple roads at an intersection? \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This implies that if two adjacent blocks share a part of a road, then we can cross that road in one step. But if we are to cross two roads, we must do so in two steps? Or can we cross two roads at an intersection in one step?\n\n The problem says: \"if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step\".\n\n This implies that to cross two roads, we must step over two separate road segments (so two steps). \n\n Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides.\n\n However, let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n   Home (1,1): \n      Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = y = 0 -> 1 > 0 -> positive side.\n      Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = x = 0 -> 1 > 0 -> positive side.\n\n   University (-1,-1):\n      Road1: y = -1 -> negative side.\n      Road2: x = -1 -> negative side.\n\n   So both roads separate the two points? Then we would output 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Home (1,1):\n      Road1: x=0 -> 1>0 -> positive\n      Road2: y=0 -> 1>0 -> positive\n      Road3: x+y-3=0 -> 1+1-3=-1 <0 -> negative side.\n\n   University (-1,-1):\n      Road1: -1 <0 -> negative\n      Road2: -1 <0 -> negative\n      Road3: -1-1-3=-5 <0 -> negative.\n\n   How many roads separate the two points?\n      Road1: home positive, university negative -> separates -> count=1\n      Road2: home positive, university negative -> separates -> count=2\n      Road3: both negative -> doesn't separate.\n\n   Then the answer is 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads for which the two points yield opposite signs.\n\n But note: the sign function. For a line equation: a*x + b*y + c = 0, we can evaluate:\n   value1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   value2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n If value1 and value2 have opposite signs (one positive, one negative) then the road separates the two points.\n\n However, what if the value is zero? The problem states that neither home nor university lies on the road, so we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n 2. Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n 3. Read n\n 4. For each of the n lines, read (a, b, c)\n    - Compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    - Compute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    - Check if f1 * f2 < 0 (then they are on opposite sides)\n\n 5. Count the number of roads for which f1 * f2 < 0.\n\n But wait: what if the road equation is normalized differently? Note that the sign of the equation depends on the coefficients. However, the condition for being on the same side or opposite side is independent of the scaling of the equation (as long as we use the same equation). \n\n However, note: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the signs of f1 and f2 flip. But then f1*f2 remains the same (because negative times negative becomes positive, and positive times negative becomes negative). So the product's sign is invariant under scaling.\n\n Therefore, we can simply count the roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, let me test with a different representation:\n\n Example: Road: x+y-3=0, we could also write -x-y+3=0. Then for (1,1): \n   Original: 1+1-3 = -1\n   New: -1-1+3 = 1 -> opposite sign? But wait, the product: (-1)*1 = -1 -> still negative? Actually, the product of the two evaluations (with the original and the new equation) is the same? \n\n Actually, we are using the same equation for both points. So we must use the equation as given.\n\n But note: the product f1*f2 is negative if and only if the two points are on opposite sides. This is true regardless of the equation's normalization.\n\n However, one caveat: the equation defines a line, and the sign of the expression (a*x+b*y+c) determines which side the point is on. The side is defined by the equation. Changing the sign of the entire equation flips the side, but the separation condition (opposite sides) is symmetric.\n\n Therefore, the plan is:\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n But note: if the values are very large, then the product might be too big and cause overflow? However, the coordinates are up to 10^6 and the coefficients are up to 10^6, so the maximum absolute value for f1 and f2 is about (10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + ...) but wait: \n\n        |f1| = |a*x1 + b*y1 + c| <= |a|*|x1| + |b|*|y1| + |c| <= 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2e12, and the product is up to 4e24, which is beyond the range of Python integers? \n\n Actually, in Python integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. However, we are doing comparisons, and the product might be huge. But we don't care about the magnitude, just the sign. We can avoid the product by checking the signs separately.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the product by:\n\n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 >= 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 <= 0):\n            count += 1\n\n But note: we are guaranteed that the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n However, the problem says: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so f1 != 0 and f2 != 0.\n\n Therefore, we can safely use either the product or the sign check.\n\n Let's choose the product for clarity.\n\n But wait: what if the product is negative zero? That's not a concern because the numbers are integers and the product of two non-zero integers is non-zero and either positive or negative.\n\n However, the problem constraints say that the coefficients and coordinates are integers, so no floating point issues.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        a, b, c = map(int, data)\n        # Calculate the two values\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), n=2, roads: [ (0,1,0), (1,0,0) ]\n\n   Road1: (0,1,0): \n        f1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1\n        f2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1\n        1 * (-1) = -1 <0 -> count=1\n\n   Road2: (1,0,0):\n        f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1\n        f2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1\n        1 * (-1) = -1 <0 -> count=2\n\n   Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), n=3, roads: [(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,1,-3)]\n\n   Road1: (1,0,0): same as above -> separates, count=1\n   Road2: (0,1,0): same as above -> separates, count=2\n   Road3: (1,1,-3):\n        f1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 1+1-3 = -1\n        f2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5\n        (-1)*(-5)=5>0 -> not separating.\n\n   Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n However, wait: what if the line equation is defined with negative coefficients? The product still works because the condition is about opposite signs.\n\n But note: the product being negative is the same as having opposite signs.\n\n So we are confident.\n\n Let's run through one more example: two roads, but one of them does not separate.\n\n Example: \n   Home: (0,0), University: (2,0), roads: \n        Road1: x=0 -> a=1, b=0, c=0\n        Road2: x=1 -> a=1, b=0, c=-1\n\n   Road1: \n        f1 = 1*0+0*0+0 = 0 -> but wait, the problem states that the home is not on the road, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Let's pick two points that are not on the roads.\n\n   Example: Home (0,1), University (2,1) and roads: \n        Road1: x=0 -> a=1, b=0, c=0\n        Road2: x=1 -> a=1, b=0, c=-1\n\n   For Road1:\n        f1 = 1*0 + 0*1 + 0 = 0 -> wait, but (0,1) is on x=0? Actually, x=0, so (0,1) is on the road? \n\n   We must choose points not on the road.\n\n   Let Home: (1,1), University: (2,1) for Road1 and Road2.\n\n   Road1: x=0\n        f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1\n        f2 = 1*2 + 0*1 + 0 = 2 -> same side, so not separated.\n\n   Road2: x=1\n        f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 -1 = 1-1=0 -> again, (1,1) is on the road? \n\n   We must avoid that. Let's take Home: (0,0) and University: (2,0) but then Road1: x=0 and Road2: x=1.\n\n   Now, Road1: x=0\n        f1 = 1*0 + 0*0 + 0 = 0 -> but wait, (0,0) is on the road? \n\n   The problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\".\n\n   So we cannot use (0,0) for the home if there is a road x=0.\n\n   Let's use Home: (0,1) and University: (2,1) and roads: \n        Road1: x=0 -> a=1, b=0, c=0\n        Road2: x=1 -> a=1, b=0, c=-1\n\n   Now, for Road1:\n        f1 = 1*0 + 0*1 + 0 = 0 -> again, (0,1) is on the road? \n\n   Actually, the road equation for x=0 is 1*x + 0*y + 0 =0 -> x=0. (0,1) has x=0, so it is on the road.\n\n   We must choose points not on the road.\n\n   Let Home: (0,1) is invalid for Road1. Instead, use Home: (0,2) and University: (2,2) for the same roads.\n\n   Road1: x=0\n        f1 = 1*0 + 0*2 + 0 = 0 -> still on the road.\n\n   Why? Because (0,2) is on the line x=0.\n\n   We must pick a point not on any road. \n\n   For example, for Home: (0,2) is on x=0, so we cannot use that. Use Home: (1,2) and University: (3,2) for the roads [x=0, x=1].\n\n   Road1: x=0\n        f1 = 1*1 + 0*2 + 0 = 1 -> positive\n        f2 = 1*3 + 0*2 + 0 = 3 -> positive -> same side.\n\n   Road2: x=1\n        f1 = 1*1 + 0*2 -1 = 0 -> wait, (1,2) is on x=1.\n\n   So we must pick a point not on any road.\n\n   How about Home: (0.5, 2) and University: (1.5,2)? But the input requires integers.\n\n   Since the inputs are integers, we can only use integer coordinates.\n\n   Let's take Home: (0,1) is not allowed because of Road1 (x=0). Then try (1,1) is not allowed because of Road2 (x=1). Then (2,1) is allowed for both.\n\n   So for Home: (0,1) is invalid, so let's use Home: (0,1) is not allowed, so we have to pick a different example.\n\n   Alternatively, use a vertical road and a horizontal road, but then the points must avoid both.\n\n   Example: Home (1,1), University (2,2), and two roads: \n        Road1: x=0 -> a=1, b=0, c=0\n        Road2: y=0 -> a=0, b=1, c=0\n\n   Then:\n        Road1: \n            f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 (positive)\n            f2 = 1*2 + 0*2 + 0 = 2 (positive) -> same side.\n\n        Road2:\n            f1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 (positive)\n            f2 = 0*2 + 1*2 + 0 = 2 (positive) -> same side.\n\n   Then the count is 0.\n\n   Now, if we move from (1,1) to (2,2) without crossing any road, that is correct.\n\n   Another example: Home (1,1), University (-1,1), and Road: x=0 (vertical line). Then:\n\n        Road1: x=0\n            f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1\n            f2 = 1*(-1) + 0*1 + 0 = -1 -> opposite, so count=1.\n\n   So the minimal steps is 1.\n\n   This makes sense: you have to cross the vertical road.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let's submit.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says the roads are given in the third line as n, then n lines. We are reading n, then reading n lines.\n\n However, the example input format:\n\n   Input: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n   Our code reads:\n        First line: '1 1' -> x1, y1 = 1,1\n        Second line: '-1 -1' -> x2,y2 = -1,-1\n        Third line: '2' -> n=2\n        Then two lines: '0 1 0' and '1 0 0'\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But note: the second example input is given as a string: \n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   Our code will read accordingly.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: the input may have negative numbers, but our splitting and mapping to int handles that.\n\n   One more corner: if n=0, then no roads. Then the two points are in the same block, so we should output 0.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"0 0\\n0 0\\n0\" -> but n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   According to the problem: n>=1.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300)\".\n\n   So n is at least 1.\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'] -> output 2.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'] -> output 2.\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings. In the problem, the input is from stdin. We are reading from stdin.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   Actually, the example input for the second test case is missing one road? \n\n   Let me check: the second example input string: \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   But the example output is given as a list: ['2','2'].\n\n   Our code for the second example: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), n=3, then three roads.\n\n   But the example input string in the example was written as: \n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   However, the example output says 2.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But wait, the example input string in the example was written as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   There is a typo in the second example input: the third road is written as \"1 1 -3\", but in the explanation above we used \"1 1 -3\" (which is the same). \n\n   Actually, the example input string for the second example is given as \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\", so that's correct.\n\n   However, in the example input list, the second string is written as '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 1 -3' (without the second road). \n\n   But the problem example input is:\n\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          0 1 0\n          1 0 0\n\n        and\n\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n   So we are reading correctly.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n   However, note: the product method might be subject to integer overflow in other languages, but in Python it's fine.\n\n   But let me consider: what if the product is too large? Actually, the product is negative only if the signs are opposite, and the absolute value doesn't matter. However, in some cases the product might be negative even if the signs are opposite, and positive otherwise.\n\n   We are safe.\n\n   Let me run the code on the sample inputs.\n\n   Sample 1: \n        Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          0 1 0\n          1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Sample 2:\n        Input:\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0\n          0 1 0\n          1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   It matches.\n\n   However, wait: the example input string for the second sample was given as:\n\n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   But note: the last road is \"1 1 -3\", which is the same as above.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code.\n\n   But note: the problem statement says the roads are defined by aix + bi*y + ci = 0. Our calculation uses the given coefficients.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road that separates the two blocks. The key observation is that each road acts as a barrier, and the minimal steps required are equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads (infinite lines) lie between the home and university blocks. Each road is defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The solution hinges on determining for each road whether the home and university lie on opposite sides of it.\n2. **Intuition**: If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to reach the destination. The minimal steps required are simply the count of such roads.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads exactly once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. Hence, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first four values are the coordinates of the home and university. The next value is the number of roads, followed by the coefficients of each road's equation.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code checks if the home and university lie on opposite sides by evaluating the line equation at both points. The product of these evaluations determines if they are on opposite sides (negative product).\n3. **Counting Roads**: The count of roads that separate the home and university is incremented each time the product of the evaluations is negative.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to reach the university from home, as each separating road requires one step to cross.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages geometric properties of lines and points to solve the problem with optimal performance.",
