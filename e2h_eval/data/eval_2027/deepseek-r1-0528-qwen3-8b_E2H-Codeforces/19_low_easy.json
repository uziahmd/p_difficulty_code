The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an undirected tree with n nodes (districts) and n-1 edges. The fan count for a contestant from district i is 2^i.\n The president wants to remove k contestants (so we keep n - k districts). The remaining districts must form a connected component (since there's exactly one path between every two, so the graph is a tree; we need the remaining set to be connected).\n Also, we want to maximize the total number of fans, which is the sum of 2^i for the kept districts.\n\n Note: Since 2^i grows exponentially, higher-numbered districts have more fans. Therefore, we would prefer to keep higher-numbered districts as much as possible.\n\n Observation:\n In a tree, if we are to leave a connected set, then the kept districts must form a subtree? Actually, in a tree, the connected subgraph induced by a set of nodes is just the minimal subtree that covers these nodes. But note: the problem does not require the entire subtree, just connectivity.\n\n However, note: the condition is that the remaining districts must be reachable from one another. In a tree, this means they form a connected subgraph.\n\n Since the fan counts are exponential and increasing with the district number, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\n But note: if we keep a high-numbered district, we might have to also keep some lower-numbered districts to connect it to the rest? Actually, we can choose any connected set. We are allowed to remove k nodes, so we are keeping n-k.\n\n How to think:\n\n The total number of fans is maximized by including the largest possible set of high-numbered districts. However, we must ensure that the set is connected.\n\n Another observation: In a tree, the connected set with maximum total fan count (with weights being 2^i) is the set of all nodes that are in the \"highest\" part. But note: we are forced to remove k nodes.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: what are the candidates? We want to keep the highest k+1 nodes? Not necessarily, because connectivity might require including some lower ones.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the removal of k districts (so keeping n-k). We are to output the k districts to remove, in increasing order.\n\n Important: The fan count for a district i is 2^i. So higher i is better. Therefore, we want to remove the smallest set of districts such that the remaining n-k districts form a connected component and the total fan count is maximized.\n\n But note: the problem says the president wishes to maximize the total number of fans. So we want to keep the highest-value districts. However, sometimes we might have to remove a high-value one to avoid removing too many low-value ones? Actually, no: because the connectivity constraint might force us to include some low-value ones. But note: the exponential growth: 2^i is so large that if we can keep a high-value node without having to remove too many, we do so.\n\n However, let's compare: \n Keeping a high-value node (say 6) requires that we keep the entire path from 6 to the other kept nodes? But note: we are allowed to remove k nodes arbitrarily as long as the remaining set is connected.\n\n Alternate approach: We know that the entire nation is a tree. We wish to remove k nodes, and the remaining n-k must form a connected subgraph.\n\n This problem is equivalent to: Find a connected subgraph (which is a tree) of n-k nodes that has the maximum total weight (where weight of node i is 2^i). Then, the removed nodes are the complement.\n\n But note: the total weight is fixed as the sum of 2^i for the kept nodes. And we want to maximize that. Since the weights are positive and increasing, we would prefer to keep the largest (by index) nodes.\n\n However, we cannot arbitrarily choose the largest n-k nodes because they must form a connected subgraph.\n\n What is the connected subgraph of n-k nodes that contains the largest indices?\n\n Let's think about the entire set of nodes: we have nodes 1 to n. We want to remove k nodes. The kept nodes must be connected.\n\n How to find the connected subgraph of size n-k that has the largest possible set of high-indexed nodes?\n\n Insight: The connected subgraph that includes the highest-indexed nodes must include a contiguous set of edges that forms a \"chain\" or a \"subtree\" that connects the high-indexed nodes. However, in a tree, the minimal connected set containing a set of nodes is the union of all the simple paths between them.\n\n But note: the exponential weights: the value of a node is independent and very large. So we want to keep the highest-indexed nodes and as few low-indexed nodes as necessary to connect them.\n\n However, we are constrained by the fact that the entire set must be",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which k districts should be removed from a tree-structured network such that the remaining n-k districts form a connected component and the total fan count (sum of 2^i for each kept district) is maximized. The key observation here is that higher-numbered districts contribute more to the total fan count due to exponential growth, so we prioritize keeping them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves a tree structure where each node (district) has a weight (2^i). We need to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree and the sum of their weights is maximized. Since the weights grow exponentially, higher-numbered nodes should be kept whenever possible.\n2. **Insight**: The optimal solution involves keeping the highest-numbered nodes and connecting them with the minimal necessary lower-numbered nodes. Specifically, we can keep all nodes from (n - k + 1) to n, but we must ensure these nodes are connected. If they are not, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to bridge the gaps.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Step 1**: Identify the highest-numbered nodes (from n down to n - k + 1) that can form a connected component. \n   - **Step 2**: For nodes that are not directly connected, find the minimal set of lower-numbered nodes required to connect them. This involves checking the connectivity between the highest-numbered nodes and including necessary intermediate nodes if they are not already included.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each node once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), suitable for large inputs (n up to 10^6).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it))\n    k = int(next(it))\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a = int(next(it))\n        b = int(next(it))\n        edges.append((a, b))\n    \n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for a, b in edges:\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    order = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n    parent = [-1] * (n+1)\n    depth = [-1] * (n+1)\n    children = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    stack = [1]\n    depth[1] = 0\n    parent[1] = 0\n    \n    while stack:\n        node = stack.pop()\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor == parent[node]:\n                continue\n            parent[neighbor] = node\n            depth[neighbor] = depth[node] + 1\n            children[node].append(neighbor)\n            stack.append(neighbor)\n            \n    kept_nodes = set(range(n - k + 1, n + 1))\n    removed_nodes = set(range(1, n - k + 1))\n    \n    if len(kept_nodes) == n - k:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, sorted(removed_nodes))))\n        return\n        \n    q = deque([node for node in kept_nodes if depth[node] == 1 and parent[node] != 0])\n    while q:\n        node = q.popleft()\n        if node not in kept_nodes:\n            kept_nodes.add(node)\n            removed_nodes.remove(node)\n        else:\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor not in kept_nodes and depth[neighbor] > depth[node]:\n                    q.append(neighbor)\n                    \n    result = sorted(removed_nodes)\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts (n) and the number of removals (k). The edges of the tree are then read and stored in an adjacency list.\n2. **Tree Construction**: The tree is traversed using a depth-first search (DFS) to compute parent-child relationships and node depths, which helps in identifying the highest-numbered nodes.\n3. **Initial Setup**: The initial set of kept nodes is determined as the highest-numbered nodes (from n down to n - k + 1). The removed nodes are initially the lower-numbered nodes.\n4. **Connectivity Check**: Using a breadth-first search (BFS), we check if the kept nodes are connected. If not, we include necessary intermediate nodes (lower-numbered) to ensure connectivity.\n5. **Output**: The removed nodes are sorted and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining nodes form a connected component while maximizing the total fan count by prioritizing higher-numbered districts.",
