The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers.\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) and we start at house 1, we can move only clockwise.\n\n Observation:\n The tasks must be done in the order given. We start at house 1.\n\n However, note that because it's a ring, sometimes it is shorter to go from a high-numbered house to a lower-numbered house by going around the ring.\n\n But note: the ringroad has n houses, so from house i, moving clockwise, the next house is i+1 (if i < n) or 1 (if i == n).\n\n We can break down the journey into segments between consecutive tasks.\n\n Let the current position be `curr` (initially 1). For each task location `a_i`, we need to move from `curr` to `a_i`.\n\n How to compute the distance from `curr` to `a_i` in a clockwise ring?\n There are two ways to think about the ring? Actually, since we can only move clockwise, we have to consider:\n\n Option 1: Go directly without wrapping: \n   If `curr <= a_i`: then the direct distance is `a_i - curr`.\n   If `curr > a_i`: then we have to go from `curr` to the end (n) and then from 1 to `a_i`. So the distance is `(n - curr + 1) + (a_i - 1)`? \n   But wait: actually, we can also think of the ring as having total length n, and the clockwise distance from x to y is:\n      d = (y - x) % n, but if negative we add n and then take modulo? But note: we don't wrap arbitrarily.\n\n Alternatively, we can define the distance from x to y (clockwise) as:\n   d(x, y) = (y - x) % n   but if (y-x) is negative, then we add n and then mod n, but note: we don't want modulo, we want the actual steps.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n   If we are at x and want to go to y, then the clockwise distance is:\n        if y >= x: y - x\n        else: n - x + y\n\n But wait, let's check with example: n=4, from 3 to 2: \n        using the above: 2 < 3 -> n - 3 + 2 = 4-3+2 = 3. That matches the example: 3->4->1->2: 3 steps.\n\n However, note the example: from 3 to 3: 0 steps. From 3 to 1: 2 steps? Because 3->4->1: 2 steps. But our formula for 3 to 1: \n        1 < 3 -> n-3+1 = 4-3+1 = 2. Correct.\n\n But wait, what if we are at 4 and want to go to 2? Then 2 < 4 -> n-4+2 = 4-4+2 = 2. And indeed: 4->1->2: 2 steps.\n\n However, note that the problem says: initially at house 1, and the first example input: \"3 2 3\".\n\n Steps for the first example (n=4, m=3, tasks [3,2,3]):\n   Start at 1.\n   First task at 3: \n        3>=1 -> distance = 3-1 = 2. Then we are at 3.\n   Second task at 2:\n        2<3 -> distance = 4-3+2 = 3. Then we are at 2.\n   Third task at 3:\n        3>=2 -> distance = 3-2 = 1.\n\n   Total distance = 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n But wait, the example output is 6.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house\", so we must account for the fact that we might be at a house and the next task is the same house.\n\n But the above calculation seems correct.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require us to return to the starting point, just to complete the tasks in order.\n\n Implementation:\n\n We can simulate:\n   time = 0\n   current = 1\n   for each task in the list of tasks:\n        if task >= current:\n            distance = task - current\n        else:\n            distance = n - current + task\n        time += distance\n        current = task\n\n But wait, let's test with the second example: Input \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n   Start at 1.\n   First task: 2 -> 2>=1 -> distance",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks, given that she starts at house 1 and moves only clockwise along a ring of houses numbered from 1 to n. The key insight is to calculate the shortest path between consecutive tasks by considering the circular nature of the ring road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the order they are given. Each task requires her to be at a specific house. Movement is restricted to clockwise direction, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n2. **Insight**: The shortest path between two houses in a clockwise ring can be calculated by comparing their positions. If the target house is ahead of the current position, the distance is simply the difference between them. If the target house is behind (i.e., a lower number), the distance is calculated by moving from the current position to the end of the ring and then from the start to the target house.\n3. **Algorithm**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house using the above logic. Sum these distances to get the total time required. Update the current position to the task's house after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    time = 0\n    current = 1\n    for task in tasks:\n        if task >= current:\n            time += task - current\n        else:\n            time += n - current + task\n        current = task\n        \n    print(time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by a list of `m` integers representing the houses where tasks need to be performed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start with `time` set to 0 and `current` position set to house 1.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task, determine the distance from the current position to the task's house:\n   - If the task's house number is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is the difference between them.\n   - If the task's house number is less than the current position, the distance is calculated by moving from the current position to the end of the ring (house `n`) and then from the start (house 1) to the task's house.\n4. **Updating Position**: After calculating the distance for a task, update the current position to the task's house.\n5. **Output**: Print the total time taken to complete all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal travel time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring road, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
