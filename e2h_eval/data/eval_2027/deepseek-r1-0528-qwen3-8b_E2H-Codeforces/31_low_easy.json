Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers.\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer between -x and x (inclusive) to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n Then we need to find a set of k cards (each card's absolute value <= x) such that the sum of these k cards is -S.\n\n We want the minimum k (nonnegative integer) for which there exists k numbers (each in [-x, x]) that add up to -S.\n\n Note: The problem allows infinitely many cards of each integer from -x to x.\n\n Observation:\n 1. If S == 0, then we don't need any additional cards -> answer 0.\n 2. Otherwise, we are allowed to choose k cards. The maximum absolute value of a card is x, so the maximum positive sum we can get from k cards is k*x, and similarly the maximum negative is -k*x.\n\n Conditions for k:\n   We require that | -S | <= k*x, i.e., |S| <= k*x.\n\n But note: sometimes we might not need to cover the entire deficit because we can use a combination of positive and negative numbers? However, note that we are allowed to use any numbers from -x to x.\n\n Actually, the problem is: find the minimum k such that there exists a sequence of k integers (each between -x and x) that sums to -S.\n\n However, note that we can also use zeros. So we are looking for the smallest k for which:\n\n   -k*x <= -S <= k*x\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? \n\n Consider: We need to form the target T = -S.\n\n Since each card can be any integer in [-x, x], we can think of it as:\n\n   T must be between -k*x and k*x.\n\n However, there's more: what if T is positive? Then we need at least ceil(|T| / x) if we were only using positive? But we can use negative too, but negative would make the total less than T.\n\n Actually, we can use a mix. However, note that we are allowed to use both positive and negative. But the key is: we can achieve any integer value between -k*x and k*x, provided that k is sufficiently large? \n\n However, note: we are allowed to use any integers in the range. But there is a catch: sometimes we might not be able to form every integer in that range. \n\n Example: \n   k=1: then we can form any integer from -x to x.\n   k=2: then we can form any integer from -2x to 2x? Not exactly: with two cards, the possible sums are from -2x to 2x, but we can form every integer in between? \n        Actually, no: with two cards, we can form every integer between -2x and 2x? \n        Let the two cards be a and b. Then a+b can be any integer between -2x and 2x? \n        But note: a and b are integers. The set of sums is symmetric. However, consider: \n          We can get 2x (by x+x), 2x-1 (by x+(x-1)), ... until 0, then negative. So yes, we can get every integer in [-2x, 2x] with two cards? \n\n But wait: if x=1, then two cards: \n        [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] -> all integers from -2 to 2.\n\n Similarly, for k cards, we can form every integer between -k*x and k*x? \n\n Actually, that is true by the following: \n   The set of k-card sums is the set of all integers T such that |T| <= k*x and T has the same parity as k (if we were restricted to integers)? No, wait: we are using integers from -x to x. \n\n However, note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. Then the set of k-card sums is the set of all integers from -k*x to k*x. \n\n Why?\n   We can use the following greedy: \n     We can represent T as long as |T| <= k*x, and T is an integer. \n\n But wait: we are not restricted by the modulus condition because we have all integers from -x to x. \n\n Example: k=3, x=2, can we form 5? \n   Maximum is 6. But 5 = 2+2+1 -> yes. \n   Can we form 1? Yes, e.g., 2+(-1)+(-0) but wait we can use 0? Yes, but 1 = 2 + (-1) + 0.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. Each additional card must have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Check**: Calculate the sum of the already found cards. If this sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n2. **Target Sum**: The sum of the additional cards must be the negative of the initial sum (i.e., -S).\n3. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For each possible number of additional cards (k starting from 1), check if the target sum can be achieved. The key observation here is that with k cards, the maximum absolute value of the sum achievable is k*x. Therefore, the smallest k for which the absolute value of the target sum is less than or equal to k*x is our answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(arr)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    abs_total = abs(total)\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        if abs_total <= k * x:\n            print(k)\n            return\n        k += 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by a list of n integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the found cards. If this sum is zero, immediately return 0 since no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Finding Minimum k**: For each subsequent integer k (starting from 1), check if the absolute value of the initial sum can be covered by k cards, each with a maximum absolute value of x. The condition `abs_total <= k * x` ensures that the target sum can be achieved with k cards. The smallest such k is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the minimal number of cards required by leveraging the observation that the sum of k cards can range from -k*x to k*x, thus ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
