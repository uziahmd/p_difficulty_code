Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are going to process up to 10^5 queries and the initial string can be up to 10^5 in length.\n The idea: We cannot do naive string replacement (which would be too slow) because each query could replace many digits and the replacements might chain.\n\n However, note that there are only 10 digits (0-9). We can precompute for each digit what transformation it goes through in the entire sequence of queries.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in order. So a digit might be replaced by a string containing other digits, and then those digits are subject to subsequent queries.\n\n We can think of processing the queries backwards (from last to first) and building a transformation for each digit.\n\n Let's define:\n   For each digit d (0-9), we want to know the final string that results from applying all the queries to d.\n\n However, the problem: the same digit might appear multiple times and the transformation is done repeatedly until no more queries? Actually, the queries are given in order and we apply them sequentially.\n\n Important: Each query says \"replace all occurrences of di with ti\", and then the next query operates on the updated string.\n\n But note: the total length of all ti's is <= 10^5, so we can consider processing the transformations for each digit independently.\n\n However, if we try to simulate the entire process for each digit, we have to account for the fact that the same digit might be transformed multiple times (by different queries) and also the replacement string might contain digits that are transformed by subsequent queries.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since the queries are applied in order, we can process the queries from last to first and for each digit, we store the current transformation (as a string) but then we notice that we don't need the exact string for every intermediate step, but we need the final number modulo 10^9+7.\n\n But the problem: the resulting string is very long (could be up to 10^5 * (max expansion factor) but note the total length of replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, but the expansion factor might be high if we do multiple replacements.\n\n However, we cannot build the entire string because it might be too long (like 10^5 * 10^5).\n\n We need to compute the number modulo 10^9+7 without building the entire string.\n\n Observation: The number is built from the digits in the final string. We can use dynamic programming or state machine for the entire process?\n\n Another idea: process the queries backwards and for each digit, we represent its transformation as a function that maps a digit to a value (the numeric contribution) and also the length of the string that would result from that digit.\n\n But note: the transformation for a digit d in a query is to replace d with string t. Then, in the subsequent queries (if we are processing backwards) we have to transform each digit in t.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let f(d) be the final string that the digit d becomes after all queries.\n\n   Then, we can process the queries from last to first. For each query (d_i -> t_i), we update the transformation for d_i.\n\n   How to update? When processing a query (d_i -> t_i) at step j (from last query to first), then for each occurrence of d_i, we are going to replace it by t_i, but then we have to apply the transformations that come after this query (which we have already computed when processing backwards). \n\n   However, we are processing backwards, so we have already processed the later queries and stored the transformation for each digit. Now, for the current query, we want to set:\n\n      f_old(d_i) = transform(t_i)   [where transform(t_i) is the concatenation of the transformations for each digit in t_i]\n\n   But note: the transformation for a digit is the entire process from that digit through all subsequent queries.\n\n   We can represent the transformation for a digit by two things:\n        value[digit] = the number formed by the final string of that digit, modulo MOD\n        length[digit] = the length of the final string for that digit\n\n   Then, when we have a replacement string t_i for digit d_i, we can compute:\n\n        value_new(d_i) = 0\n        For each character c in t_i:\n            value_new(d_i) = (value_new(d_i) * pow(10, length[c], MOD) + value[c]) % MOD\n\n        But wait: actually, the replacement string t_i is transformed by the subsequent queries. So we need to use the current known transformations for the digits in t_i.\n\n        Similarly, the length_new(d_i) = sum(length[c] for each c in t_i)\n\n   However, note: the transformation for a digit d is defined as the entire process from that digit through all queries that occur after the current",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing all occurrences of specific digits with other strings of digits. The goal is to compute the final number represented by the transformed string modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) efficiently, without explicitly constructing the potentially very large intermediate strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Backward Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order and naively replacing digits (which would be too slow for large inputs), we process the queries in reverse order. This allows us to handle each digit's transformations efficiently.\n2. **Tracking Transformations**: For each digit (0-9), we maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the final string obtained after all transformations, modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n   - **Length**: The length of this final string.\n3. **Updating Transformations**: For each query processed backward, we update the transformation of the digit being replaced. The new transformation is derived by combining the transformations of each digit in the replacement string, considering their lengths and values.\n4. **Modulo Handling**: Since the numbers can be extremely large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to prevent overflow and ensure results fit within standard integer limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    val = [0] * 10\n    length_arr = [0] * 10\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        q = input().strip()\n        queries.append(q)\n        \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        parts = queries[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_char = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip()\n        d = int(d_char)\n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        \n        for c in t_str:\n            c_digit = ord(c) - ord('0')\n            power = pow(10, length_arr[c_digit], MOD)\n            new_val = (new_val * power + val[c_digit]) % MOD\n            new_len += length_arr[c_digit]\n            \n        val[d] = new_val\n        length_arr[d] = new_len\n        \n    result = 0\n    total_len = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d = int(char)\n        power = pow(10, length_arr[d], MOD)\n        result = (result * power + val[d]) % MOD\n        total_len += length_arr[d]\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from input. Arrays `val` and `length_arr` are initialized to store the numeric value and length of the final transformed string for each digit (0-9).\n2. **Query Processing**: Queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the digit to be replaced and its replacement string are extracted.\n3. **Transformation Update**: For each digit in the replacement string, the current digit's transformation is updated using the known transformations of the digits in the replacement string. The new value is computed by combining the values of the replacement digits, scaled appropriately by powers of 10 based on their lengths.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all queries, the initial string is transformed by replacing each digit with its final transformed value. The result is computed by combining these values using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.\n5. **Output**: The final result, which is the number represented by the transformed string modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\), is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations without explicitly constructing large intermediate strings, leveraging modular arithmetic to manage large numbers and reverse processing to optimize performance.",
