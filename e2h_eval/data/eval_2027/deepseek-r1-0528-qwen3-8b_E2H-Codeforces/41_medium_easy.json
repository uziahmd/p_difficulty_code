There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given: n, h, m and then m lines of [l, r, x]\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming or iterate over possibilities, but note that the restrictions might overlap.\n\n Idea:\n We have to assign a height for each spot from 0 to h, such that for every restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i), \n the maximum height in the interval [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\n The profit is the sum of squares of the heights.\n\n We can think of constraints. However, note that the restrictions are independent and the same house may be covered by multiple restrictions.\n\n Alternate approach: \n Since n, m are at most 50, we can try to use DP with state as (position, last k constraints) but that might be too heavy.\n\n Another idea: \n The problem is similar to \"assigning\" a value for each house and ensuring that the constraints (which are max conditions on intervals) are satisfied.\n\n Observation: \n The constraints can be thought of as: for each restriction i, no house in [l_i, r_i] can exceed x_i.\n\n We can also note: the overall constraint for a house j is the minimum x_i such that j is in the interval [l_i, r_i] (and also not exceeding h). But note: if a house is not covered by any restriction, then we can use up to h.\n\n However, the restrictions might not cover all houses, so for house j, the maximum allowed height is min( h, (min_{for all restrictions that cover j} x_i) )?\n\n But wait: is that correct? Actually, yes: because if a house is in multiple restrictions, then it must satisfy all of them. So the effective constraint for house j is the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include j, but note: if there are no restrictions covering j, then we can use up to h.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the tallest house from spots l_i to r_i must be at most x_i\". So if house j is in a restriction with x_i, then house j cannot exceed x_i. But if house j is not in any restriction, then the only constraint is that it cannot exceed h (given in the input).\n\n Therefore, we can precompute for each house j (from 1 to n) the maximum allowed height, say A[j] = min( h, (minimum x_i for which j is in [l_i, r_i]) )? But wait: if there are multiple restrictions, the house must satisfy all. So indeed, the constraint for house j is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover j. However, note: if there is no restriction covering j, then the minimum x_i over an empty set is infinity? Then we take h.\n\n But note: the problem says the maximum height per spot is h. So we can define:\n   Let base_constraint[j] = h   (if no restriction covers j, then we are free to choose up to h)\n   Otherwise, base_constraint[j] = min( {x_i | the restriction i covers j} )   and then if that min is greater than h, then we use h? Actually, if we find a restriction with x_i > h, then that restriction doesn't force a lower maximum than h. So we can do:\n\n   base_constraint[j] = min( h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i )\n\n However, wait: if we have two restrictions: one that says [1,3] <= 10 and another that says [1,3] <= 5, then the effective constraint is 5. But if we have a restriction with x_i=10 and then one with x_i=5, then the house must be <=5.\n\n But note: the problem says the tallest house in the entire interval must be <= x_i. So if we have two restrictions, then the house must be <= min(x_i's). And if that min is above h, then we can still use h? Actually, no: because the maximum allowed by the problem is h. So if we have a restriction with x_i=10 and h=5, then we can only use 5 (because h is the absolute maximum). But wait, the input says \"in each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h\", and the restrictions say \"at most x_i\". So if x_i is more than h, then the constraint is effectively h (since we cannot exceed h anyway). Therefore, the effective constraint for a house j is:\n\n   constraint[j] = min(h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i)\n\n However, note: the restriction x_i must be considered even if it is larger than h? Actually, no: because if x_i > h, then the condition \"house height <= x_i\" is automatically satisfied if the house is at most h. So we can ignore x_i values above h. But wait: what if there is a restriction that says [1, n] <= h+1? Then the constraint for each house is the minimum of h and (min_{i} x_i) but since h+1 is above h, then we take h.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute for each house j:\n\n   candidate = h   # if no restriction, we use h.\n   For each restriction i that covers j, we consider x_i. Then the constraint for j is the minimum x_i (but if we get a number below h, then we use that; but if we don't, we use h). Actually, the constraint is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i (because if we have a restriction with x_i < h, then we must use that, but if all restrictions have x_i >= h, then we can use h).\n\n Therefore, we can compute for each j:\n\n   constraints_j = [x_i for each restriction i such that l_i <= j <= r_i]\n\n   if constraints_j is empty:\n        max_allowed[j] = h\n   else:\n        max_allowed[j] = min(constraints_j)   # but then we must not exceed h, so:\n        if max_allowed[j] > h:\n            max_allowed[j] = h\n\n However, wait: what if we have a restriction with x_i = 100 and h=10? Then we take min(100,10)=10. So we can simply do:\n\n   max_allowed[j] = min( h, min([x_i for each restriction i covering j] + [h]) )\n\n But note: if we do [x_i for ...] and then take min, we can do:\n\n   base = h\n   for each restriction i that covers j:\n        base = min(base, x_i)\n\n   Then max_allowed[j] = base.\n\n However, note: if we have no restrictions, then base remains h.\n\n But wait: what if a restriction has x_i < h? Then we take the minimum x_i from the restrictions that cover j, and then clamp it by h (but if the minimum x_i is already <= h, then we don't need to clamp because we are taking the min and then we are going to set the house to at most that value, which is <= h). Actually, the above procedure does:\n\n   base = h   (starting value)\n   for each restriction covering j: base = min(base, x_i)\n\n   Now, if we have a restriction with x_i = 3 and h=10, then base becomes 3, which is <= h -> valid.\n   If we have a restriction with x_i = 12 and h=10, then base becomes min(10,12)=10 -> valid.\n\n So this works.\n\n However, is that sufficient? Consider: the constraint for the entire interval [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i. But note: we are setting the constraint for each house j independently. But is that safe?\n\n Example: \n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] <= 5\n   Restriction2: [2,2] <= 3\n\n   Then for house1: max_allowed[1]=5, for house2: max_allowed[2]=3.\n\n   Now, what if we set house1 to 5 and house2 to 3: that satisfies both restrictions.\n\n   What if we set house1 to 4 and house2 to 3: also satisfies.\n\n   But note: the restriction says the tallest house in [1,1] is <=5 (so house1<=5) and [2,2]<=3 (so house2<=3). \n\n   However, consider overlapping restrictions: \n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n   Restriction2: [1,2] <= 3\n\n   Then for each house (both house1 and house2): max_allowed[j] = min(10, 5,3) = 3.\n\n   Then we set both houses to 3, which satisfies both restrictions.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two restrictions that are different and overlapping?\n   Example: \n     Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n     Restriction2: [1,1] <= 3\n\n   Then for house1: min(10, 5,3)=3\n        for house2: min(10,5)=5\n\n   Now, we set house1 to 3 and house2 to 5. Check restrictions:\n        Restriction1: [1,2] -> max(3,5)=5 <=5 -> okay.\n        Restriction2: [1,1] -> 3<=3 -> okay.\n\n   This seems to work.\n\n   However, consider: \n        Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] <= 7\n\n   Then for each house: min(10,5,7)=5 -> both houses <=5. Then the max in [1,2] is 5, which satisfies both.\n\n   But now, what if the restrictions are independent and we set a house to a value that is less than the maximum allowed by its individual constraints, but the overall interval might require a higher value? \n\n   Wait, note: the constraints are independent per restriction. The condition for a restriction is that the maximum in the interval is <= x_i. We are ensuring that each house is <= the minimum x_i that covers it. Then the maximum in any interval [l_i, r_i] is at most the minimum x_i (from the restrictions that cover that interval) because each house in the interval is at most that x_i. Therefore, the condition for the restriction [l_i, r_i] is automatically satisfied: the tallest house in [l_i, r_i] is at most x_i (actually, the minimum x_i that covers the entire interval? Not exactly: but note that the restriction [l_i, r_i] requires the maximum to be <= x_i. We are ensuring that every house in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i (because the constraint for a house j in [l_i, r_i] is the minimum of all x_i covering j, and one of those covering j is at least the x_i of this restriction? Actually, we are taking the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover j, so for a house j in [l_i, r_i], we have a constraint <= x_i (because the restriction [l_i, r_i] is one of the ones covering j). But wait, we are taking the minimum of all x_i covering j. So if there is a restriction that gives a lower bound, then we use that. However, for the restriction [l_i, r_i] itself, we must have that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. But if we set each house j to at most the minimum x_i (over all restrictions covering j), then in particular, the house j in [l_i, r_i] is at most x_i (because the restriction [l_i, r_i] is one of the restrictions covering j). Therefore, the entire interval [l_i, r_i] has each house <= x_i, so the maximum is <= x_i.\n\n   Therefore, the independent constraint for each house is sufficient.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that the entire interval [l_i, r_i] is constrained by the minimum x_i. It only requires the maximum in the interval is <= x_i. But by constraining each house j to be at most the minimum x_i covering j, we are actually making sure that the entire interval [l_i, r_i] has houses at most the minimum x_i (among all restrictions covering any point in [l_i, r_i])? \n\n   Let me clarify: \n        In the example: \n            Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n            Restriction2: [1,2] <= 7\n\n        Then for each house, the constraint is min(5,7)=5. Then we set house1 and house2 to at most 5. Then the maximum in [1,2] is 5, which is <=5 and <=7. \n\n        But what if we have:\n            Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n            Restriction2: [1,2] <= 3\n\n        Then for each house, the constraint is 3. Then the maximum in [1,2] is 3, which is <=5 and <=3. \n\n        However, consider:\n            Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n            Restriction3: [1,1] <= 3\n\n        Then for house1: min(5,3)=3, for house2: min(5)=5.\n\n        Now, the maximum in [1,2] is max(3,5)=5, which is <=5 (restriction1) but restriction1 says [1,2] must be <=5, which is satisfied. However, note that there is no restriction that forces the entire interval [1,2] to be <=3. The restriction3 only applies to house1.\n\n        But wait, the restriction1 applies to the entire interval [1,2] and requires the maximum to be <=5. Our assignment [3,5] satisfies that.\n\n        However, the problem is: we are using the minimum of all x_i covering each house. This ensures that for each house j, it is <= the minimum x_i that covers j. But note: the entire interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. How do we know that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i? \n\n        Actually, we don't. Because we set each house j independently to the minimum x_i (from the restrictions covering j) and then the maximum in [l_i, r_i] might be the minimum x_i that covers j (for the worst-case j) but that minimum x_i might be higher than x_i (the current restriction)? \n\n        Let me reexamine:\n\n        In the example: \n            Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n            Restriction3: [1,1] <= 3\n\n        We set house1 to 3 (because min(5,3)=3) and house2 to 5 (because min(5)=5). Then the maximum in [1,2] is 5, which is <=5 (restriction1) and also 5>=3 (restriction3 doesn't require house2 to be <=3, only house1). \n\n        But note: restriction1 requires the entire interval [1,2] to be <=5. We are satisfying that. \n\n        However, consider if we set house2 to 6? Then we break the constraint of restriction1 because 6>5. But our method sets house2 to 5 (min(5)) so that is safe.\n\n        But wait: the constraint for house2 is 5 (from restriction1) and we set it to 5, which is <=5. So that's okay.\n\n        Now, let me try a case where the independent constraint might not be enough:\n\n            Suppose we have two restrictions that do not cover the same houses:\n\n            Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n            Restriction2: [2,3] <= 3\n\n            Then for house1: min(5) = 5 -> so we set house1 to at most 5.\n            For house2: min(5,3)=3 -> house2 at most 3.\n            For house3: min(3)=3 -> house3 at most 3.\n\n            Now, the assignment: [5,3,3] -> check:\n                Restriction1: [1,2] -> max(5,3)=5 <=5 -> ok.\n                Restriction2: [2,3] -> max(3,3)=3 <=3 -> ok.\n\n        Another example:\n\n            Restriction1: [1,3] <= 4\n            Restriction2: [2,4] <= 3\n\n            Then:\n                house1: min(4) = 4\n                house2: min(4,3)=3\n                house3: min(4,3)=3\n                house4: min(3)=3\n\n            Assignment: [4,3,3,3] -> \n                Restriction1: [1,3] -> max(4,3,3)=4 <=4 -> ok.\n                Restriction2: [2,4] -> max(3,3,3)=3 <=3 -> ok.\n\n        But what if we set house1 to 4 and house2 to 3, and then house3 to 4? \n            Then house3 would be 4, but the constraint for house3 is min(4,3)=3, so we cannot set house3 to 4.\n\n        However, the above method does not allow that. So we are forced to set house3 to 3. \n\n        Why is that? Because the constraint for house3 is 3 (from restriction2). So we must set house3 to 3.\n\n        But wait, is house3 in restriction1? Yes, so restriction1 says the entire [1,3] must be <=4. But house3 being 3 is <=4, so that's okay. However, the constraint for house3 is the minimum of the x_i that cover house3: which are 4 (from restriction1) and 3 (from restriction2) -> so 3. Therefore, we must set house3 to 3.\n\n        But is that the only possibility? Actually, we could set house3 to any value from 0 to 3. But we want to maximize profit, so we set it to 3.\n\n        So the independent constraint per house is necessary and sufficient.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute for each house j the maximum allowed height, call it c_j = min( h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i ) [if no restriction, then the min over an empty set is taken as h? Actually, we start with h and then take min with the x_i's, so if no restriction, we get h].\n\n        Then the problem reduces to: for each house j, choose an integer a_j in [0, c_j] to maximize the sum of squares.\n\n        How to maximize the sum of squares? Note that the square function is increasing for nonnegative numbers. So for each house j, we should choose the maximum allowed height, i.e., a_j = c_j.\n\n        Then total profit = sum_{j=1}^{n} (c_j)^2.\n\n        But wait: is that always optimal? \n\n        Example: \n            n=1, h=3, m=1, restriction: [1,1] <= 2.\n            Then c_1 = min(3,2)=2.\n            Then profit = 2^2 = 4.\n\n            But if we choose 2, that's the best we can do.\n\n        However, what if we have two houses and the constraints force one house to be 0 and the other to be 10, but wait: the constraints might interact if they are on overlapping intervals?\n\n        But note: we set each house j to c_j, and we have ensured that the constraints are satisfied. However, is that the maximum? \n\n        Consider: the profit function for a single house is f(a) = a^2, which is convex and increasing for a>=0. Therefore, for each house, the maximum profit we can get is by setting a_j = c_j (the maximum allowed). \n\n        But wait, what if the constraints are not independent? \n\n        Example: \n            n=2, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,2] <= 5.\n            Then we set both houses to 5. Profit = 5^2+5^2=50.\n\n            What if we set one house to 4 and the other to 6? \n                But wait, the constraint says the tallest house in [1,2] must be <=5. 6>5, so not allowed.\n\n            So we cannot set house2 to 6.\n\n        Therefore, the assignment of c_j for each house is the maximum we can set that house to, and we set it to that maximum to maximize the profit from that house.\n\n        Then the answer is simply: for j from 1 to n, let c_j = min( h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i ) [with the understanding that if no restriction covers j, then c_j = h]. Then profit = sum_{j=1}^{n} (c_j)^2.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have two restrictions that together force a house to be lower than if we considered them separately? \n\n        Example: \n            n=1, m=2, two restrictions: [1,1] <= 3 and [1,1] <= 5.\n            Then c_1 = min(3,5)=3. Then profit=9.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two restrictions that are conflicting in the sense that they don't cover the same house? \n\n        Actually, the example above is just one house. Now consider:\n\n            n=2, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,1] <= 5\n            Restriction2: [2,2] <= 3\n\n            Then c_1 = 5, c_2 = 3, profit = 25+9 = 34.\n\n        But is there a way to get more? No, because we cannot set house1 to more than 5 and house2 to more than 3.\n\n        However, wait: what if the restrictions are not independent and we can set a house to a value that is not the maximum allowed by each individual constraint but that helps satisfy a global constraint? \n\n        Let me think: the constraints are independent per restriction. The condition for a restriction i is that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. By setting each house j to the minimum x_i (over the restrictions covering j), we are satisfying all restrictions. And we are setting each house to the maximum allowed by the constraints (so we are getting the maximum profit from each house). \n\n        But note: the constraints are on intervals, and sometimes we might set a house to a lower value to allow adjacent houses to be higher? \n\n        Example: \n            n=2, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,2] <= 5.\n\n            Then we set both houses to 5, profit=50.\n\n            What if we set house1 to 4 and house2 to 5? \n                Then the maximum in [1,2] is 5, which satisfies the restriction. \n                Profit = 16+25 = 41, which is less than 50.\n\n            Similarly, if we set house1 to 5 and house2 to 4, profit=25+16=41.\n\n            So the maximum is achieved when we set both to 5.\n\n        But consider:\n\n            n=2, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,1] <= 3\n            Restriction2: [2,2] <= 3\n\n            Then we set both houses to 3, profit=9+9=18.\n\n            What if we set house1 to 3 and house2 to 10? \n                Then house2=10 violates Restriction2? No, Restriction2 says house2<=3, so 10>3 -> invalid.\n\n            What if we set house1 to 2 and house2 to 3? \n                Then house1=2 (<=3) and house2=3 (<=3) -> valid, but profit=4+9=13 < 18.\n\n        So again, setting each house to the maximum allowed (c_j) gives the maximum profit.\n\n        But wait: what if we have:\n\n            n=2, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,2] <= 5.\n\n            Then we set both to 5, profit=50.\n\n            But what if we set house1 to 0 and house2 to 5? \n                Then the maximum in [1,2] is 5, valid. Profit=0+25=25, which is worse.\n\n        Therefore, the optimal solution is to set each house j to c_j.\n\n        However, wait: the problem statement example:\n\n            Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n            Output: 14\n\n            Using our method:\n                n=3, h=3, m=3\n                Restriction1: [1,1] <=1 -> c1 = min(3,1)=1\n                Restriction2: [2,2] <=3 -> c2 = min(3,3)=3\n                Restriction3: [3,3] <=2 -> c3 = min(3,2)=2\n\n                Profit = 1^2+3^2+2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n            Another example:\n\n                Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n                Output: 262\n\n                n=4, h=10, m=2\n                Restriction1: [2,3] <=8 -> for house2: min(10,8)=8; house3: min(10,8)=8; others: 10\n                Restriction2: [3,4] <=7 -> for house3: min(8,7)=7; house4: min(10,7)=7\n\n                So:\n                    house1: 10\n                    house2: 8\n                    house3: 7\n                    house4: 7\n\n                Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n          Step1: Read n, h, m.\n          Step2: For each of the m restrictions, read (l, r, x)\n          Step3: Precompute an array `max_allowed` of length n+1 (index 1 to n) with initial value h.\n          Step4: For each restriction (l, r, x):\n                  For each house j from l to r:\n                      max_allowed[j] = min(max_allowed[j], x)\n\n          But wait: is that correct? \n\n          In the example: \n            Restriction1: [2,3] <=8 -> then for j=2: max_allowed[2]=min(10,8)=8; j=3: min(10,8)=8.\n\n          Then for Restriction2: [3,4] <=7 -> for j=3: min(8,7)=7; j=4: min(10,7)=7.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          However, note: the above method uses the minimum x_i from the restrictions that cover j. But we are iterating over restrictions and updating the max_allowed for each house.\n\n          But note: the problem says the maximum allowed for house j is the minimum x_i (from the restrictions that cover j) and then clamped by h. However, we started with h, and then we take the minimum with x_i (which are at most h? not necessarily: x_i can be from 0 to h, but note the input says x_i between 0 and h). So we don't need to clamp at the end because we started with h and then we take the minimum, which is <= h.\n\n          However, if we have a restriction with x_i > h, then we set the house to h (because we start with h and then take min(h, x_i)=h). But wait, the input says x_i between 0 and h, so we don't have to worry about x_i > h.\n\n          According to the input: \"0 <= x_i <= h\", so x_i is at most h.\n\n          Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            max_allowed = [h]*(n+1)   # 0-indexed we'll use index1 to index n\n\n            for each restriction (l, r, x):\n                for j from l-1 to r-1 (if we use 0-indexed array) or from l to r (if we use 1-indexed array) but note: the problem labels houses 1 to n.\n\n          But note: the input says the spots are labeled 1 to n.\n\n          Step5: For each house j from 1 to n, set a_j = max_allowed[j] (the computed value) and then profit += a_j * a_j.\n\n          Step6: Print the profit.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have a restriction with x_i=0? Then the house must be 0. That's allowed.\n\n        But let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n            max_allowed[1] = min(3,1)=1\n            max_allowed[2] = min(3,3)=3\n            max_allowed[3] = min(3,2)=2\n\n            profit = 1+9+4=14.\n\n        Example2: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n            max_allowed[1]=10\n            max_allowed[2]=min(10,8)=8\n            max_allowed[3]=min(10,8,7)=7\n            max_allowed[4]=min(10,7)=7\n\n            profit=100+64+49+49=262.\n\n        But wait: the second example input was given as:\n            \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        However, note: the second restriction is [3,4] <=7. We update house3 and house4.\n\n        But what if the restrictions are given in an order that doesn't cover all houses? \n\n        Example: \n            n=3, h=10, m=1, restriction: [2,2] <=5.\n\n            Then:\n                house1: 10\n                house2: 5\n                house3: 10\n\n            Profit = 10^2+5^2+10^2 = 100+25+100 = 225.\n\n        But is that correct? \n            The restriction says the tallest house in [2,2] must be <=5. We set house2 to 5, so it's okay. Houses1 and 3 are set to 10, which is allowed because h=10 and there's no restriction on them.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n            max_allowed = [h] * (n+1)   # index 0 unused, 1..n\n\n            for _ in range(m):\n                data = input().split()\n                l = int(data[0]); r = int(data[1]); x = int(data[2])\n                for j in range(l, r+1):\n                    if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                        max_allowed[j] = x\n\n            profit = 0\n            for j in range(1, n+1):\n                profit += max_allowed[j] * max_allowed[j]\n\n            print(profit)\n\n        However, wait: the above code updates max_allowed[j] to the minimum x encountered in the restrictions covering j. But note: we are iterating over each restriction and updating. We start with h, and then for each restriction we update the houses in that interval to the minimum of the current max_allowed and x.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says the restrictions are given one by one, and we must consider all of them.\n\n        However, let me run the first example through the code:\n\n            n=3, h=3, m=3\n            Initially: max_allowed = [3,3,3,3] (index0 unused, then indices1,2,3)\n\n            First restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1 -> update house1: min(3,1)=1 -> now [3,1,3] (for indices0..3, but we care about 1..3)\n            Second restriction: l=2, r=2, x=3 -> update house2: min(1,3) -> wait, no! We are doing:\n\n                for j in range(l, r+1): \n                    if x < max_allowed[j]: then set max_allowed[j] = x\n\n            But wait, that is not the same as taking the minimum. We are updating only if x is strictly less. \n\n            Example: initially house2 is 3. Then we see x=3, and 3<3 is false, so we don't update.\n\n            But we want the minimum of the current value and x. So we should do:\n\n                max_allowed[j] = min(max_allowed[j], x)\n\n            However, in the code above we are doing:\n\n                if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                    max_allowed[j] = x\n\n            This is equivalent to: set to x only if x is smaller, otherwise leave unchanged. \n\n            But that is the same as taking the minimum.\n\n            However, note: if we have two restrictions for the same house: first one sets it to 5, then a second one with x=3: then we update to 3. Then a third one with x=4: we don't update (because 4>3) and that's correct.\n\n            But what if we have two restrictions: first one sets to 5, then one sets to 4 (which is less than 5): then we update to 4.\n\n            So the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example in the problem does not use the minimum of all x_i, but the minimum of the x_i from the restrictions that cover the house. Our code does:\n\n            We start with h (which is the maximum allowed without any restriction).\n            Then for each restriction, we update the house j (if j is in the interval) by: if x is less than the current max_allowed[j], then set it to x.\n\n            This is equivalent to: after processing all restrictions, max_allowed[j] = min( h, min_{i: j in [l_i, r_i]} x_i )\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But wait: the problem states that the maximum height for a house is h. We are starting with h and then reducing if a restriction requires a lower height.\n\n        However, what if a restriction says x_i > h? Then we would not update (because x_i > h and we start with h, so h < x_i is false) and leave the house at h. But the input says 0<=x_i<=h, so x_i is at most h. Therefore, we don't need to worry.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \n            n=3, h=3, m=3\n            Restriction1: [1,1] 1 -> update house1: 1 < 3 -> set to 1.\n            Restriction2: [2,2] 3 -> update house2: 3 < 1? (current is 3) -> no, so leave as 3.\n            Restriction3: [3,3] 2 -> update house3: 2 < 3 -> set to 2.\n\n            Then profit = 1^2+3^2+2^2=14.\n\n        Example2:\n            n=4, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [2,3] 8 -> update house2: 8<10 -> set to 8; house3: 8<10 -> set to 8.\n            Restriction2: [3,4] 7 -> update house3: 7<8 -> set to 7; house4: 7<10 -> set to 7.\n\n            Then profit = 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2=100+64+49+49=262.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n            max_allowed = [h] * (n+1)   # 1-indexed, from 1 to n\n\n            for i in range(m):\n                data = input().split()\n                l = int(data[0]); r = int(data[1]); x = int(data[2])\n                for j in range(l, r+1):\n                    if x < max_allowed[j",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street with specific zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. Each house's height must comply with all zoning restrictions that apply to its spot, and the maximum allowed height for any house is given by the input parameter `h`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a certain range must not exceed a given height. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the house heights while adhering to these constraints.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive zoning restriction that includes it. This means for each house, we take the minimum value between the global maximum height `h` and the smallest height constraint from all applicable restrictions.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Initialization**: Start by setting the maximum allowable height for each house to `h`.\n   - **Processing Restrictions**: For each zoning restriction, update the maximum allowable height for each house in the specified range to the minimum of its current value and the restriction's height.\n   - **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, compute the profit by summing the squares of the final allowable heights for all houses.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction and updates the heights for all houses in the specified range. Given that both the number of houses `n` and the number of restrictions `m` are up to 50, the solution efficiently handles the constraints with a time complexity of O(m * n), which is optimal for the given problem size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    max_allowed = [h] * (n + 1)\n    \n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index + 1])\n        x = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        for j in range(l, r + 1):\n            if x < max_allowed[j]:\n                max_allowed[j] = x\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for j in range(1, n + 1):\n        total_profit += max_allowed[j] * max_allowed[j]\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first three values are `n` (number of houses), `h` (maximum house height), and `m` (number of restrictions).\n\n2. **Initialization**: An array `max_allowed` is initialized with size `n + 1` (1-indexed for simplicity) where each element starts as `h`, the global maximum height.\n\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code checks all houses in the specified range `[l, r]`. For each house in this range, if the restriction's height `x` is less than the current `max_allowed` value, it updates the house's maximum allowable height to `x`.\n\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is computed by summing the squares of the final `max_allowed` values for all houses from 1 to `n`.\n\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all zoning restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of the square function and careful constraint handling.",
