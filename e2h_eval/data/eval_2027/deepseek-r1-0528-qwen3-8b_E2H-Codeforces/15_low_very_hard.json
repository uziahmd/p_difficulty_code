They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string s of length n.\n The tournament has 2^n teams, with skill levels being a permutation of [1, 2, ..., 2^n].\n The string s has n characters. Each character at index i (0-indexed) corresponds to the result pattern for the (n-i)-th phase?\n Actually, note: \n   In the first phase, there are 2^(n-1) games (so that's the last phase in terms of rounds? Actually, the problem says:\n   - First phase: 2^(n-1) games (round 1)\n   - Second phase: 2^(n-2) games (round 2) ... until the last phase which is 1 game.\n\n But note: the problem says the string s is such that if s_i is '0', then in the i-th phase (which has 2^(n-i) games) the lower skill wins; if '1', the higher skill wins.\n\n However, note the indexing: the problem says \"the i-th phase\", meaning the phase with 2^(n-i) games. So the first phase (i=0) is the one with 2^(n-0) = 2^n games? \n Wait, let me read again: \n   \"in the first phase: split into pairs: 2^(n-1) games\"\n   Then second phase: 2^(n-2) games.\n\n So actually, the phases are from the first round (with the most games) to the final. Therefore, the string s is given such that:\n   s[0] corresponds to the first phase (which has 2^(n-1) games? Actually, wait: the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, but the number of teams is 2^n, so the first phase is the first round. And the next phase is the second round.\n\n But note: the problem says: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n So for i=0, the phase has 2^(n-0) = 2^n games? That doesn't match: the first phase should have 2^(n-1) games.\n\n Let me clarify: \n   Total teams: 2^n.\n   After the first phase: 2^(n-1) teams remain (so the first phase has 2^(n-1) games).\n   Then the second phase: 2^(n-2) games, and so on.\n\n Therefore, the i-th phase (0-indexed) has 2^(n-i-1) games? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\" \n\n But wait: \n   i=0: 2^(n-0) = 2^n -> that would be more than the total games (since we have 2^n teams and we need only 2^(n-1) games in the first round). \n\n Alternatively, note the problem says: \n   \"The tournament consists of 2^n - 1 games.\" \n   and the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then 2^(n-2), etc.\n\n So the total number of games is: 2^(n-1) + 2^(n-2) + ... + 1 = 2^n - 1.\n\n Now, the string s has n characters. Each character corresponds to a phase. There are n phases because the number of rounds is n (from 2^n down to 2^0=1).\n\n But the problem states: \n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-i) games)\"\n\n This must be a mistake? Let me check the example:\n\n Example input: \n   Input: \"3\\n101\"\n\n That means n=3, and s=\"101\".\n\n According to the problem, the first phase (i=0) has 2^(3-0)=8 games? But we have 8 teams, and the first phase should have 4 games.\n\n Alternatively, if we interpret the i-th phase as the (i+1)-th phase (so the first phase is i=0, then the second is i=1, and so on) and the number of games in the i-th phase is 2^(n-1-i), then:\n   For i=0: 2^(n-1-0) = 2^(n-1) -> correct for the first phase.\n\n So the problem likely meant: \n   \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^(n-1-i) games)\"\n\n But the problem says: \"the phase with 2^(n-i) games\". \n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all the winning integers (team skill levels) that can win the tournament based on the given result string. The tournament structure involves multiple phases where each phase's outcome is determined by the characters in the string (0 for lower skill wins, 1 for higher skill wins). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament starts with \\(2^n\\) teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one champion remains. The result string `s` dictates the outcome of each phase: '0' means the lower-skilled team wins, and '1' means the higher-skilled team wins. We need to find all skill levels (from 1 to \\(2^n\\)) that can potentially win the tournament under these conditions.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves simulating the tournament progression for each possible team skill level (from 1 to \\(2^n\\)) and checking if it can emerge as the champion. However, directly simulating for all skill levels is infeasible due to the exponential number of teams (\\(2^n\\) can be up to 262,144 for \\(n=18\\)).\n\n3. **Optimization**: Instead of brute-forcing all skill levels, we use a recursive approach (or dynamic programming) to track which teams can advance through each phase. For each phase, we determine the set of teams that can reach the next phase by applying the phase's result rule (either higher or lower skill wins).\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - **Base Case**: Start with all teams (skill levels 1 to \\(2^n\\)).\n   - **Recursive Step**: For each phase, filter the current set of teams based on the phase's result rule. The winner of each match advances.\n   - **Termination**: After processing all phases, the remaining team is the champion. Collect all such champions across all initial skill levels.\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks each possible champion by leveraging the tournament structure. The complexity is manageable because each phase halves the number of teams, leading to logarithmic depth in recursion.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    s = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    winners = [True] * total_teams\n    \n    def simulate_round(phase_index, current_winners):\n        if phase_index == len(s):\n            return current_winners\n        \n        num_games = 1 << (n - 1 - phase_index)\n        next_winners = []\n        \n        for i in range(0, len(current_winners), 2):\n            if i + 1 >= len(current_winners):\n                next_winners.append(current_winners[i])\n            else:\n                a = current_winners[i]\n                b = current_winners[i+1]\n                if s[phase_index] == '1':\n                    next_winners.append(max(a, b))\n                else:\n                    next_winners.append(min(a, b))\n        return simulate_round(phase_index + 1, next_winners)\n    \n    for seed in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        winners = [seed]\n        final_champion = simulate_round(0, [seed])\n        if final_champion:\n            winners[seed-1] = seed\n            \n    result_set = set()\n    for idx, val in enumerate(winners):\n        if val is not None and val > 0:\n            result_set.add(val)\n            \n    if not result_set:\n        print(\"\")\n    else:\n        sorted_result = sorted(result_set)\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integer `n` (number of phases) and the string `s` (result pattern for each phase).\n2. **Initial Setup**: The total number of teams is \\(2^n\\), and an array `winners` is initialized to keep track of potential champions.\n3. **Simulation Function**: The `simulate_round` function processes each phase, filtering teams based on the phase's result rule ('0' or '1'). It recursively processes each phase until all rounds are completed.\n4. **Checking All Seeds**: For each possible starting team (skill level), the code simulates the tournament and checks if it becomes the champion.\n5. **Output**: The champions are collected in a set to avoid duplicates, sorted, and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible champions by leveraging the tournament's hierarchical structure and the given result string, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n`.",
