The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes with even numbers and odd numbers.\n   Keys with even numbers and odd numbers.\n\n The condition for matching is:\n   - An even chest must be matched with an odd key.\n   - An odd chest must be matched with an even key.\n\n This problem then reduces to: \n   We have two sets of items (even-chests and odd-chests) and two sets of keys (even-keys and odd-keys). \n   The even-chests can only be opened by odd-keys, and the odd-chests can only be opened by even-keys.\n\n However, note that the same key cannot be used twice, and the same chest cannot be opened twice.\n\n So, we can think of it as a bipartite graph between two types of chests and two types of keys, but actually:\n\n Let:\n   E_c = number of even chests\n   O_c = number of odd chests\n\n   E_k = number of even keys\n   O_k = number of odd keys\n\n But note: the matching is constrained by the type. We have two independent bipartite matchings:\n\n   Matching 1: even chests must be matched with odd keys -> maximum matching is min(E_c, O_k)\n   Matching 2: odd chests must be matched with even keys -> maximum matching is min(O_c, E_k)\n\n However, wait: is that really independent? Actually, yes, because the two types of chests require opposite key types.\n\n But note: we cannot use the same key for two different chests. However, since the two matchings are using disjoint sets of keys (odd keys for even chests, even keys for odd chests), the total matching is the sum of the two independent matchings.\n\n However, let's check with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: n=5, m=4\n   Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> even: [14,6,2] (3), odd: [9,11] (2)\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> even: [8,4,20] (3), odd: [7] (1)\n\n   Matching 1: min(3, 1) = 1\n   Matching 2: min(2, 3) = 2\n   Total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E_c=5, O_c=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> E_k=0, O_k=1\n   Matching 1: min(5,1)=1\n   Matching 2: min(0,0)=0\n   Total=1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4\n   Chests: [10] -> even\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0\n   Matching 1: min(1,0)=0\n   Matching 2: min(0,4)=0\n   Total=0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the list of chests and separate into even and odd.\n   Step 3: Read the list of keys and separate into even and odd.\n   Step 4: Calculate:\n        matching1 = min(even_chests_count, odd_keys_count)\n        matching2 = min(odd_chests_count, even_keys_count)\n   Step 5: Print(matching1 + matching2)\n\n However, note: the condition is based on the parity of the numbers. \n\n But wait: what if a chest has an even number? Then we need an odd key. Similarly, an odd chest needs an even key.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   even_chests = count of a_i such that a_i % 2 == 0\n   odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n   even_keys = count of b_j such that b_j % 2 == 0\n   odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   Then answer = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But note: the input constraints are up to 10^5, so this counting is efficient.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each pair (chest and key) meets the condition that their sum is odd. This means even-numbered chests must be paired with odd-numbered keys, and odd-numbered chests must be paired with even-numbered keys.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd numbered chests and keys separately. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Reading the input values for the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n   - Separating the chests and keys into even and odd categories based on their parity.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution efficiently processes the input in linear time, O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is optimal for the given constraints (up to 10^5 elements).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    matching1 = min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n    matching2 = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    \n    print(matching1 + matching2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Chests**: The code counts how many chests have even numbers (`even_chests`) and how many have odd numbers (`odd_chests`).\n3. **Counting Even and Odd Keys**: Similarly, the code counts the number of even and odd keys.\n4. **Calculating Maximum Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys for one type of match, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys for the other type. The sum of these two minima gives the total number of chests that can be opened.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two calculated minima.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages simple counting and arithmetic operations to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
