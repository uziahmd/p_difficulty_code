The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups: even and odd.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_chests = number of chests with even a_i\n        odd_chests = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = number of keys with even b_j\n        odd_keys = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that:\n   - An even chest requires an odd key (because even + odd = odd)\n   - An odd chest requires an even key (because odd + even = odd)\n\n However, we cannot use the same key twice. So we have two independent bipartite matching problems:\n\n   1. Matching between even_chests and odd_keys (each even chest can be matched with any odd key, but each key only once)\n   2. Matching between odd_chests and even_keys\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we match all even_chests with odd_keys or vice versa. We are constrained by the number of keys available in each category.\n\n Actually, the maximum matching for the even_chests would be the minimum of even_chests and odd_keys, but wait: no, because we can also use the even_keys for odd_chests and odd_keys for even_chests.\n\n However, the constraints are independent: \n   - The even_chests can only be opened by odd_keys.\n   - The odd_chests can only be opened by even_keys.\n\n But note: the same key cannot be used twice. However, we have two separate sets of keys: even_keys and odd_keys.\n\n So the total chests we can open is the sum of two independent matchings:\n\n   matching1 = min(even_chests, odd_keys)\n   matching2 = min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n However, wait: is that correct? \n\n Consider: \n   We have even_chests and odd_keys: we can open at most min(even_chests, odd_keys) chests from the even_chests group.\n\n   Similarly, we can open at most min(odd_chests, even_keys) chests from the odd_chests group.\n\n And since these two sets of chests are distinct and the keys used are distinct (because even_keys and odd_keys are disjoint), the total is the sum.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] \n        even_chests: 14,6,2 -> count=3\n        odd_chests: 9,11 -> count=2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20]\n        even_keys: 8,4,20 -> count=3\n        odd_keys: 7 -> count=1\n\n   Then:\n        matching1 = min(3, 1) = 1\n        matching2 = min(2, 3) = 2\n        total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chests=5, odd_chests=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd_keys=1, even_keys=0\n\n   matching1 = min(5,1)=1\n   matching2 = min(0,0)=0\n   total=1 -> matches example.\n\n Third example: \n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_keys=4, odd_keys=0\n\n   matching1 = min(1,0)=0\n   matching2 = min(0,4)=0\n   total=0 -> matches example.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n   1. Read n and m.\n   2. Read the list of n chest values.\n   3. Read the list of m key values.\n   4. Count the number of even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n However, note: \n   For a number x, it is even if x % 2 == 0, else odd.\n\n Code accordingly.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each pair (chest, key) meets the condition that their sum is odd. This condition is satisfied when one is even and the other is odd. \n2. **Intuition**: Separate the chests and keys into two groups based on whether their numbers are even or odd. The solution involves counting how many chests and keys fall into each category.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Categories**: The code counts how many chests have even numbers (even_chest) and how many have odd numbers (odd_chest). Similarly, it counts the number of even and odd keys (even_key and odd_key).\n3. **Calculating Maximum Opens**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering two separate scenarios:\n   - Matching even chests with odd keys (min(even_chest, odd_key)).\n   - Matching odd chests with even keys (min(odd_chest, even_key)).\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of these two minima gives the total number of chests that can be opened, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages simple counting and arithmetic operations to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
