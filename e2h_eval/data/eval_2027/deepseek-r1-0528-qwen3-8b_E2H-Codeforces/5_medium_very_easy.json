Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem in two steps:\n 1. We note that we have two strings: `l` (left boots) and `r` (right boots) of length n.\n 2. We want to form as many pairs as possible. The pairing condition is:\n    - If both are letters, they must be the same.\n    - If one or both are '?', then they are compatible.\n\n However, note: the problem requires outputting the maximum number of pairs and then the pairs.\n\n Important: A boot can be used at most once.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can break down the problem into handling two types of boots: those with fixed colors and those with '?'.\n\n But note: the problem has up to 150000 characters.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea 1: Count the fixed pairs first? But we have to consider that a '?' might be used to match a fixed one, but we want maximum.\n\n Actually, we can use a greedy matching:\n\n However, note: the problem is about two arrays (left and right) and we are allowed to match any left with any right.\n\n We can consider:\n\n  Step 1: Match all the pairs that are forced (i.e., both fixed and matching) and also the pairs where one is fixed and the other is '?'.\n\n But wait: what if we have a '?' on the left and a fixed letter on the right? Then we can match them if the fixed letter is the same as the left's '?' (which it always is for compatibility). Similarly for the other way.\n\n However, the problem is that we have two independent sets (left and right) and we need to assign without conflict.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's denote:\n   We have two strings: l and r.\n\n We can try to count the total pairs by considering:\n\n   - First, we can count the pairs that are fixed and matching. But note: we might use '?' to fill in for missing ones.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require to use all boots. We just want the maximum number of pairs.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. We can form a graph where each node is an index (from 1 to n for left and from 1 to n for right) and edges between left i and right j if the colors are compatible.\n\n  2. Then we want the maximum matching in a bipartite graph. But n can be up to 150000, so we cannot build a graph with O(n^2) edges.\n\n We need a more efficient way.\n\n Observation:\n\n  Each left boot i and right boot j are compatible if:\n      (l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?') and (l[i] == r[j] or l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?')\n  But note: actually, the rule is:\n      compatible if (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j] is any) OR (r[j]=='?' and l[i] is any) OR (both '?').\n\n  Actually, we can simplify: \n      Condition: \n          if l[i] != '?' and r[j] != '?': then l[i] == r[j]\n          else: True\n\n  But note: the condition is symmetric and the above condition is equivalent.\n\n  However, we cannot iterate over every j for each i because that would be O(n^2).\n\n Another idea:\n\n  We can split the boots into two parts:\n\n  Part 1: Boots that are fixed (non '?') on both sides.\n\n  Part 2: Boots that are fixed on one side and '?' on the other.\n\n  Part 3: Boots that are '?' on both sides.\n\n  But note: a '?' on one side can match with a fixed color on the other side, and also with a '?'.\n\n  However, we want maximum matching. We can do:\n\n  Step 1: Precompute for each color (letter) the available counts on the left and right, but note that the indices matter because we have to output the actual indices.\n\n  We cannot simply count because we need to know which indices are used.\n\n  Alternate Insight:\n\n  We can consider two types of matches:\n\n    Type A: Both boots are fixed (non '?').\n    Type B: One boot is fixed and the other is '?'.\n    Type C: Both boots are '?'.\n\n  But note: a '?' can be matched with a fixed boot (Type B) or with a '?' (Type C). However, we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n  We can use a two-step greedy:\n\n  Step 1: Match as many fixed-fixed pairs as possible. But wait, what if we have a fixed boot that can only be matched with a '?'? Actually, no: fixed boots can only be matched with same fixed color or with a '?'.\n\n  However, note: the problem says an indefinite color (i.e., '?') is compatible with any. So we can use a '?' to match a fixed boot. But sometimes we might prefer to use a '?' to match with a fixed boot to free up a fixed boot for another fixed boot? Actually, no: fixed boots are specific.\n\n  Actually, let's think: \n\n  We have two sets:\n\n    Left: \n        Fixed: set of fixed colors (each non '?') and their indices.\n        Question: set of indices with '?'.\n\n    Right:\n        Fixed: set of fixed colors and their indices.\n        Question: set of indices with '?'.\n\n  We can:\n\n    - Use some of the fixed boots to match with fixed boots of the same color. This is necessary because if two fixed boots of same color are present, they must be matched together (if we don't, we might lose the opportunity to use the '?' for something else? Actually, no: we can use the '?' for any, but if we don't use the fixed pair, then we have two fixed boots that are same color and we could use one of them with a '?' and the other one remains, but wait: the fixed boots must be matched with same color. So if we have two fixed boots of color 'a' on the left and two fixed boots of color 'a' on the right, we can form two pairs by matching fixed with fixed. Alternatively, we can use one fixed left 'a' with a '?' on the right and the other fixed left 'a' with the other fixed right 'a'. But note: the fixed right 'a' must be matched with an 'a'. So we cannot avoid using the fixed pairs for fixed boots if we want to use the fixed boots.\n\n  Actually, the problem is: we have two fixed boots of the same color, but we can also use one of them with a '?' and leave the other fixed boot unmatched? That would be worse because we could have matched both fixed boots with two fixed boots (if available) or with two '?'.\n\n  Therefore, the best is to use fixed boots to match with fixed boots of the same color. Then use fixed boots to match with '?' (if there is no fixed boot of the same color) and then use '?' with '?'.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to use a fixed boot with a '?', and that is acceptable. But we can also use a fixed boot with a fixed boot of the same color. So we want to use as many fixed-fixed pairs as possible? Not necessarily: consider if we have:\n\n      Left: \"a?\" and Right: \"?a\"\n\n      We can form two pairs: (a and ?) and (?, a) -> but wait, how?\n\n      Actually, the two pairs are:\n        Option 1: \n            left[0] (a) with right[1] (?) -> compatible because left is fixed and right is '?'\n            left[1] (?) with right[0] (?) -> compatible\n        Option 2: \n            left[0] (a) with right[0] (?) -> compatible\n            left[1] (?) with right[1] (a) -> compatible\n\n      But note: the condition is the same. However, we can form two pairs.\n\n  But wait, the example: \n      n=2\n      l = \"a?\"\n      r = \"?a\"\n\n  We can form two pairs.\n\n  Now, if we try to use fixed-fixed first: there are none. Then we use fixed with '?' and then '?' with '?':\n\n      For left fixed 'a': it can match with any right (because right has '?' and 'a'? Actually, the right has two boots: first is '?' and second is 'a'. So for left fixed 'a', it can match with right[0] (because '?' is compatible) and also with right[1] (because 'a' is same). Similarly, left[1] (which is '?') can match with any right.\n\n  How to maximize? We have to choose two pairs from two lefts and two rights.\n\n  We can use a greedy matching that considers:\n\n    Step 1: Create two graphs: one for fixed-fixed and one for the rest (fixed with '?', and '?' with '?') but note: fixed with '?' is a bipartite edge and '?' with '?' is also an edge.\n\n  Actually, we can use a two-phase:\n\n  Phase 1: Matching fixed boots with fixed boots of the same color.\n\n      We can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each fixed color in left and right.\n\n      However, we cannot simply match by frequency because we need to remember indices.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a greedy algorithm that uses two pointers or a BFS-like for bipartite matching, but n is 150000.\n\n  But note: the problem is asking for the maximum matching. We can use a greedy matching for fixed-fixed by:\n\n      For each color, the number of fixed pairs we can form is min(count_left[color], count_right[color])\n\n      However, we cannot simply take all fixed pairs because the indices must be distinct.\n\n  But note: the fixed boots are distinct by index. So we can:\n\n      Step 1: Count the fixed boots by color for left and right.\n\n      Then, for each color, we can match the fixed boots of that color up to the minimum of the counts.\n\n      Then, we remove these matched indices from the set of fixed boots.\n\n  However, what about when a fixed boot is matched with a fixed boot? Then we mark those indices as used.\n\n  Then, in the remaining, we have:\n\n      Left: \n          Fixed_remaining: the fixed boots that were not matched in phase 1.\n          Question: the '?' boots.\n\n      Right:\n          Fixed_remaining: the fixed boots that were not matched in phase 1.\n          Question: the '?' boots.\n\n  Now, we can match:\n\n      Phase 2: Match fixed_remaining (on left) with any '?' on the right. Similarly, we can match fixed_remaining (on right) with any '?' on the left.\n\n      But note: we can also use a '?' on the left to match a fixed_remaining on the right, and vice versa.\n\n  However, we cannot use a '?' to match a fixed boot arbitrarily because we want to maximize. Actually, we can use a '?' on the left to match either a fixed boot on the right (if available) or a '?' on the right.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to use a '?' to match any, so we can use a '?' to match a fixed boot, and then we have one less fixed boot and one less '?'.\n\n  How to do this without building a full graph?\n\n  We can do:\n\n      In phase 2, we can match:\n\n          For each fixed boot on the left (that wasn't matched in phase 1) with any '?' on the right (if available) -> but we can use each '?' only once.\n\n      Similarly, for each fixed boot on the right (that wasn't matched in phase 1) with any '?' on the left.\n\n  But note: we have two separate sets: left fixed_remaining and right fixed_remaining. And we also have left_question and right_question.\n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      Step 2: For the remaining fixed boots (on left and right) and the question marks, we can match:\n\n          - All left fixed_remaining with right_question (if we have enough right_question) and similarly for right fixed_remaining with left_question.\n\n      But note: we are allowed to use a '?' to match a fixed boot, but we must also consider that the same '?' cannot be used twice.\n\n  However, we can use a bipartite matching between:\n\n      Left: \n          Set A: fixed_remaining (each element is an index) and Set B: question marks (each index)\n\n      Right:\n          Set C: fixed_remaining (indices) and Set D: question marks (indices)\n\n      Then, we can form edges from:\n\n          Left fixed_remaining to Right: all the right boots (both fixed_remaining and question) EXCEPT the fixed_remaining on the right that are not matched? \n\n      Actually, we can model the entire graph as:\n\n          Left nodes: \n            type1: fixed boots (not matched in phase1)\n            type2: '?' boots\n\n          Right nodes:\n            type1: fixed boots (not matched in phase1)\n            type2: '?' boots\n\n          Edges:\n\n            - From a fixed boot (type1) on the left to a right boot: \n                  if the right boot is a fixed boot (type1) then only if the color matches (but we already did phase1, so these fixed_remaining on right are of different color? Actually, no: we removed the fixed boots that matched by color, but we didn't remove the fixed boots that didn't match by color. Wait, phase1: we matched only the fixed boots that had the same color. So the fixed_remaining on the right are the fixed boots that did not have a matching fixed boot on the left? Actually, no: we matched by color, so for a given color, we matched min(left_count[color], right_count[color]). Then the fixed_remaining on the left for a color are left_count[color] - min(left_count[color], right_count[color]), and similarly for the right.\n\n            So now, the fixed_remaining on the left and right are of the same color? Actually, no: they are of the same color as originally, but we have taken away the matched ones. But note: we are going to allow matching a fixed boot (say color 'a') on the left with a fixed boot of a different color on the right? No, because the condition for fixed boots is that they must be the same. So we cannot match a fixed 'a' on the left with a fixed 'b' on the right.\n\n          Therefore, for phase2:\n\n            For a left fixed boot (say color 'a') that was not matched in phase1, we can only match it with a right boot that is either:\n                - a fixed boot of color 'a' (but we've already matched all the fixed boots of color 'a' that were available on the right in phase1, so there should be none left? Actually, no: we matched min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']). So the left_count['a'] - min(...) is the leftover left fixed boots of color 'a', and the right_count['a'] - min(...) is the leftover right fixed boots of color 'a'. But wait, we haven't matched the leftovers by color. \n\n          Correction: In phase1, for color 'a', we matched min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']) pairs. Then the leftover left fixed boots of color 'a' is left_count['a'] - min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']) = max(0, left_count['a'] - right_count['a']). Similarly, the leftover right fixed boots of color 'a' is max(0, right_count['a'] - left_count['a']). \n\n          But note: we cannot use a fixed boot of color 'a' on the left to match a fixed boot of color 'b' on the right.\n\n          So the only possibility for a left fixed boot (color 'a') is to match with a right boot that is either:\n            - a fixed boot of color 'a' (if there is any remaining) OR\n            - a '?' (any color)\n\n          Similarly, for a left '?' boot, it can match with any right boot.\n\n          However, we are going to use a greedy: we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Step 2a: For the left fixed_remaining, we can try to match with the right fixed_remaining of the same color (if any) that were not matched in phase1. But wait, in phase1 we matched the same color, so the remaining fixed boots of the same color are the ones that were not matched because the other side had fewer. So we can match the left fixed_remaining of color 'a' (which is left_count['a'] - min(left_count['a'], right_count['a'])) with the right fixed_remaining of color 'a' (which is right_count['a'] - min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']))? But note: we cannot match two fixed boots of the same color that are leftover because they are the same color and we can match them. However, we are going to match them in phase1? Actually, no: phase1 only matched as many as the minimum. The leftover on the left and the same color on the right are exactly the difference. But wait, if left_count['a'] > right_count['a'], then we have left_count['a'] - right_count['a'] left fixed boots of color 'a' that cannot be matched with a fixed boot of color 'a' on the right (because there aren't enough). Similarly, if right_count['a'] > left_count['a'], then we have right_count['a'] - left_count['a'] right fixed boots of color 'a' that cannot be matched with a left fixed boot of color 'a'.\n\n          So actually, we cannot match the left fixed_remaining of color 'a' with the right fixed_remaining of color 'a' because they are the same color and we are allowed to, but note: we are going to use the fixed boots arbitrarily? \n\n          Let me clarify: we did phase1 by matching the same color. We matched min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']) pairs. The leftover left fixed boots of color 'a' is L = left_count['a'] - min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']) = max(0, left_count['a'] - right_count['a'])\n          and the leftover right fixed boots of color 'a' is R = right_count['a'] - min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']) = max(0, right_count['a'] - left_count['a'])\n\n          Now, we can match the left fixed boots of color 'a' (L of them) with the right fixed boots of color 'a' (R of them)? \n\n          But note: we are allowed to match two fixed boots of the same color even if we didn't account for them in phase1? Actually, we did account for them: we matched as many as the minimum. The leftover is because one side had more. However, we can match the leftover left fixed boots of color 'a' with the leftover right fixed boots of color 'a' only if we have at least one? But wait, the condition is same color, and we have the same color. However, we did not match them in phase1 because we only matched the minimum. Now, we can match them arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not specify an order. We want maximum pairs. The total pairs we can form for color 'a' is min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']). But wait, that is the maximum for that color. So we cannot form more than min(left_count['a'], right_count['a']) pairs for color 'a'. \n\n          Therefore, the leftover fixed boots of color 'a' cannot be matched with each other because we have already taken the maximum for that color.\n\n          So now, for a left fixed boot (color 'a') that is leftover, we cannot match it with a right fixed boot (unless it is a fixed boot of a different color? No, because fixed boots must match by color). So the only option is to match it with a '?' on the right.\n\n          Similarly, for a right fixed boot (color 'a') that is leftover, we can only match it with a '?' on the left.\n\n          Then, we can do:\n\n            Step 2b: Match the leftover fixed boots (on left) with the '?' on the right, but we must use the '?' on the right that are not needed for matching other fixed boots (from the right side) or for matching '?' with '?'.\n\n          But note: the '?' on the right can be used for:\n\n            - Left fixed boots (of any color) that are leftover (from phase1) and also for left '?' boots.\n\n          However, we want to maximize the total pairs.\n\n          We can use the '?' boots as universal. We have a total of:\n\n            total_left_question = len([idx for idx, char in enumerate(l) if char=='?'])\n            total_right_question = len([idx for idx, char in enumerate(r) if char=='?'])\n\n          After phase1, we have:\n\n            fixed_left_remaining = [index for index, char in enumerate(l) if char!='?' and ...?] -> actually, we know the count per color, but we don't have the indices.\n\n          We need to store the indices.\n\n  Revised plan:\n\n  We'll do:\n\n  Step 1: Precompute:\n\n      left_fixed = {} # mapping from color to list of indices (for left)\n      left_question = [] # list of indices for left that are '?'\n      right_fixed = {} # mapping from color to list of indices (for right)\n      right_question = [] # list of indices for right that are '?'\n\n      But we also need to know the fixed boots that are matched and the ones that are not.\n\n  However, we can do:\n\n      We'll create two lists for left and right: one for fixed and one for '?'.\n\n      Then, we want to:\n\n        Phase 1: For each color, we match the fixed boots of that color as many as the minimum of the counts.\n\n        How to do that without mixing colors? We can:\n\n          For each color that appears in left_fixed or right_fixed, we take the minimum of the two counts and then remove that many from both.\n\n        Then, we have:\n\n          left_fixed_remaining: for each color, the leftover fixed boots (if any) that are not matched.\n\n        But note: we want to output the pairs, so we need to record the indices.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a multiset for each color's fixed boots, and then use a two-pointer or a greedy matching for the fixed boots.\n\n  However, the problem constraints (n=150000) and the fact that there are at most 26 colors (letters) makes it feasible to use a dictionary of lists for fixed boots.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Read n, then two strings.\n\n      left_str = input().strip()\n      right_str = input().strip()\n\n      left_fixed_map = defaultdict(list)   # color -> list of indices for left\n      left_question_indices = []\n      for i, char in enumerate(left_str):\n          if char == '?':\n              left_question_indices.append(i+1)   # storing 1-indexed index? the problem uses 1-indexed indices in output.\n          else:\n              left_fixed_map[char].append(i+1)\n\n      Similarly for right_str.\n\n      Then, for each color in left_fixed_map (or union of keys from left_fixed_map and right_fixed_map):\n\n          count_left = len(left_fixed_map[color])\n          count_right = len(right_fixed_map[color])\n          num_pairs = min(count_left, count_right)\n          Then, we remove num_pairs from both sides.\n\n          But we need to remove specific indices? Actually, we don't care which ones are removed because we are going to output the pairs arbitrarily? \n\n          However, we must record which indices are used.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          For each color, we sort the list of indices for left and right (they are already in increasing index order, but we can sort if needed).\n\n          Then, we take the first num_pairs from the left list and the first num_pairs from the right list and mark them as used.\n\n      But note: we are going to output the pairs, so we have to record:\n\n          For each color, we have two sorted lists: left_list and right_list.\n\n          We remove the first num_pairs from both and then the remaining in left_list and right_list are the fixed_remaining for that color.\n\n      Then, we have:\n\n          left_fixed_remaining = {}\n          for color in left_fixed_map:\n              remaining = left_fixed_map[color][num_pairs:]\n              if remaining:\n                  left_fixed_remaining[color] = remaining\n\n          Similarly for right_fixed_remaining.\n\n      However, note: the fixed boots that are matched in phase1: we don't know which ones were chosen. But we don't care for the output order, we just need to know the total.\n\n  Then, we have:\n\n      Step 2: We have left_fixed_remaining (a dict of color->list of indices) and right_fixed_remaining (same).\n\n      Now, we can match the fixed_remaining on the left with the right_question and the fixed_remaining on the right with the left_question, and also we can use the '?' to match with '?'.\n\n      But note: we also have the fixed_remaining that are of the same color? Actually, we already considered that in phase1 and took the minimum. The leftover fixed boots of the same color are the ones that were in excess. However, we cannot match two fixed boots of the same color if they are from the same side (excess) because we don't have the same color on the other side. But wait, we can match a fixed boot (left) of color 'a' with a fixed boot (right) of color 'a' even if we didn't use them in phase1? \n\n      Actually, no: because in phase1 we matched all the fixed boots of color 'a' that we could (min(left, right)). The leftover on left is left_count - right_count (if left_count>right_count) and on right is right_count - left_count (if right_count>left_count). But we cannot match a left fixed boot of color 'a' with a right fixed boot of color 'a' if we have already matched as many as the minimum? \n\n      Actually, we can: the condition for fixed boots is that they must be the same. So we can match any left fixed boot (color 'a') with any right fixed boot (color 'a') as long as we don't exceed the total available. But we did the matching in phase1 for the entire color. We took the minimum and then the rest are left. However, the rest are the ones that are unmatched because the other side ran out. But note: the entire set of fixed boots of color 'a' on the left and right should be matched as much as the minimum. \n\n      Therefore, the leftover fixed boots of color 'a' on the left (if any) cannot be matched with fixed boots of color 'a' on the right (because there are none left). Similarly for the right.\n\n      So the only possibilities for the fixed_remaining are:\n\n          - Left fixed_remaining (color 'a') can only be matched with a '?' on the right.\n          - Right fixed_remaining (color 'a') can only be matched with a '?' on the left.\n\n      Then, we have:\n\n          total_fixed_remaining_left = sum(len(lst) for lst in left_fixed_remaining.values())\n          total_fixed_remaining_right = sum(len(lst) for lst in right_fixed_remaining.values())\n\n          And the total question marks available: \n              total_left_question = len(left_question_indices)\n              total_right_question = len(right_question_indices)\n\n      Now, we can use the question marks to match the fixed_remaining. But note: a '?' can be used for any.\n\n      We can use:\n\n          Step 2a: Match the left_fixed_remaining with the right_question, but we must be careful: we cannot use the same right_question index twice.\n\n          Similarly, match the right_fixed_remaining with the left_question.\n\n      However, we also have the possibility to use the question marks to match with each other.\n\n      We want to maximize the total pairs. The total pairs so far is the sum of phase1 (which is the sum over colors of min(count_left[color], count_right[color])).\n\n      Then, we can add:\n\n          pairs from left_fixed_remaining to right_question: up to min(total_fixed_remaining_left, total_right_question) but wait, we have to consider that the right_question might be needed for matching right_fixed_remaining with left_question.\n\n      Actually, we can use the question marks arbitrarily. The idea:\n\n          We have two sets of \"demand\" from the fixed_remaining:\n\n            - Left_fixed_remaining: we need to match each with a right boot (either a '?' or a fixed boot of the same color, but we already know that the fixed boots of the same color are exhausted). So only '?'.\n            - Right_fixed_remaining: we need to match each with a left boot (either a '?' or a fixed boot of the same color, which is exhausted). So only '?'.\n\n          Additionally, we have the left_question and right_question that can be matched with each other or with the fixed_remaining.\n\n      We can model this as:\n\n          We have:\n\n            A = left_fixed_remaining (size A_total)\n            B = right_fixed_remaining (size B_total)\n            C = left_question (size C_total)\n            D = right_question (size D_total)\n\n          We can form:\n\n            Type1: A with D (but note: we can use a right_question for a left_fixed_remaining, and then that right_question is used and cannot be used again)\n            Type2: B with C\n            Type3: C with D (but we have to subtract the ones used in Type1 and Type2)\n\n          But note: we want maximum pairs. The total pairs we can form from fixed_remaining is:\n\n            min(A_total + B_total, C_total + D_total)  ??? \n\n          Actually, the total pairs from fixed_remaining is limited by the total available '?' (C_total + D_total) and also by A_total and B_total individually? \n\n          Specifically:\n\n            We can use at most D_total for A (because we have D_total right_question) and at most C_total for B (because we have C_total left_question).\n\n          Then, the total pairs from fixed_remaining is: \n\n            Let x = min(A_total, D_total)   [pairs from A and D]\n            Let y = min(B_total, C_total)   [pairs from B and C]\n\n          Then, the remaining question marks: \n            left_question_remaining = C_total - y\n            right_question_remaining = D_total - x\n\n          Then, we can form additional pairs from the remaining question marks: min(left_question_remaining, right_question_remaining)\n\n          So total pairs from phase2 = x + y + min(C_total - y, D_total - x)\n\n          But note: we must assign the pairs to specific indices. However, we are only required to output the maximum number and the pairs.\n\n      However, we are also required to output the pairs. We must assign specific indices.\n\n  Steps for output:\n\n      We are going to:\n\n        Phase1: For each color, we match the fixed boots. We must output these pairs.\n\n        Then, Phase2: We need to output the pairs for the fixed_remaining and the question marks.\n\n      How to assign the pairs for fixed_remaining?\n\n        For left_fixed_remaining: we have a list of indices (we stored them). We must assign them to distinct right_question indices.\n\n        Similarly for right_fixed_remaining.\n\n        Then, the remaining question marks (if any) are assigned to each other.\n\n      But note: the problem does not require a particular order, so we can output the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      We need to keep track of which indices are used.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Parse input.\n\n        Step 2: Separate the left and right into fixed and question.\n\n        Step 3: For each color, match the fixed boots and record the pairs.\n\n        Step 4: For the fixed_remaining, we have two sets: left_fixed_remaining (by color) and right_fixed_remaining (by color). Then, we want to match:\n\n            - Each left_fixed_remaining index with a right_question index (if available)\n            - Each right_fixed_remaining index with a left_question index (if available)\n\n            Then, the remaining question marks (both left and right) are matched arbitrarily.\n\n        Step 5: Output the total pairs (phase1 pairs + phase2 pairs) and then the pairs.\n\n      However, we must not use an index more than once.\n\n      We have:\n\n        Let's collect:\n\n          left_used = set()   # indices used in phase1 and phase2 for left\n          right_used = set()   # indices used in phase1 and phase2 for right\n\n        But we don't want to use the same index twice.\n\n      Alternatively, we can:\n\n        Step 1: Mark the indices that are used in phase1.\n\n        Step 2: For phase2, we have two sets of indices: left_fixed_remaining and right_fixed_remaining (which are not used) and left_question and right_question (which are not used).\n\n        Then, we want to:\n\n          - For each left_fixed_remaining index, assign a distinct right_question index (if available).\n          - For each right_fixed_remaining index, assign a distinct left_question index (if available).\n\n          Then, from the remaining left_question and right_question, we match arbitrarily (as long as we don't use the same index twice).\n\n      But note: the same index in the left_question or right_question can be used only once.\n\n      We can do:\n\n        Let L_q = sorted(left_question)   # list of left question indices\n        Let R_q = sorted(right_question)   # list of right question indices\n\n        Let L_fixed_remaining = []   # flatten the left_fixed_remaining lists\n        Let R_fixed_remaining = []   # flatten the right_fixed_remaining lists\n\n        Then:\n\n          Step 2a: Match L_fixed_remaining with R_q (the right_question) as many as possible.\n\n          Step 2b: Match R_fixed_remaining with L_q (the left_question) as many as possible.\n\n          But note: the same question mark index cannot be used twice.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          We are going to use a greedy matching:\n\n            We'll use two pointers for the fixed_remaining and the question lists.\n\n          However, since the indices are arbitrary (we just need distinct), we can:\n\n            Sort the lists.\n\n            Then, for the left_fixed_remaining and right_question, we can match the smallest available right_question index to the smallest left_fixed_remaining index.\n\n          But note: we must output the pairs in the order of the left index and the right index.\n\n        Alternatively, we can:\n\n          We'll create:\n\n            left_available = left_question   # indices\n            right_available = right_question   # indices\n\n          Then, for each left_fixed_remaining index (we have a list of indices, say L_list), we take the smallest available right_question index and assign it. Then remove that right_question index from the available list.\n\n          Similarly, for each right_fixed_remaining index, we take the smallest available left_question index and assign it.\n\n          Then, after that, we have:\n\n            left_available_remaining = the remaining left_question indices (which we haven't used)\n            right_available_remaining = the remaining right_question indices\n\n          Then, we match the smallest in left_available_remaining with the smallest in right_available_remaining, and so on.\n\n        But note: we must not use the same index twice, and we have two separate sets.\n\n      Steps for phase2:\n\n        Let L_rem = left_fixed_remaining (all indices)   -> list\n        Let R_rem = right_fixed_remaining (all indices)   -> list\n\n        Let L_q = left_question   -> list\n        Let R_q = right_question   -> list\n\n        Then:\n\n          # Match L_rem with R_q\n          We'll take the first min(len(L_rem), len(R_q)) from R_q to assign to L_rem.\n\n          Similarly, match R_rem with L_q: take the first min(len(R_rem), len(L_q)) from L_q.\n\n        But wait, we have to use distinct indices. However, we are using two separate sets (R_q for L_rem and L_q for R_rem). So the indices in R_q and L_q are disjoint. Therefore, we can do:\n\n          Step 2a: \n            Sort R_q (but we don't need to sort, we can just take the first min(len(L_rem), len(R_q)) from R_q? But the problem does not require a particular order, but the output must list the pairs. However, the problem does not specify the order of the pairs, so we can output in any order.\n\n          However, we must output the pairs in the format: for each pair, the left index and the right index.\n\n          But note: the problem expects the left boot index and the right boot index for each pair.\n\n          We can output the pairs in any order, but we must not mix the same index.\n\n        So:\n\n          For the fixed_remaining matching:\n\n            For i in range(min(len(L_rem), len(R_q))):\n                left_index = L_rem[i]   # we must have sorted L_rem? Actually, we stored the indices as we collected, but we should sort by index?\n                right_index = R_q[i]     # but wait, we are using the i-th element of R_q. But we haven't sorted R_q.\n\n          However, the problem does not require a particular order. But note: the input order is the index order. The problem says: the i-th character is the i-th boot.\n\n          But we are storing the indices as 1-indexed. The original string index is 0-indexed, then we added 1.\n\n          The problem does not specify the order of the pairs, so we can output in any order.\n\n          But note: the problem requires the left boot index and the right boot index. We can output the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: if we don't sort, the assignment might be arbitrary. But the problem does not require a specific order.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"Print k â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots. The following k lines should contain pairs a_j, b_j (1 â‰¤ a_j, b_j â‰¤ n). The j-th of these lines should contain the index a_j of the left boot in the j-th pair and index b_j of the right boot in the j-th pair.\"\n\n        There is no requirement for the order of the pairs. So we can output in any order.\n\n        However, we must ensure that we don't use the same index twice",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of boots with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors must be the same, while an indefinite color ('?') can pair with any color. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on color compatibility. The key observation is that '?' can match any color, while fixed colors must match exactly. The challenge is to maximize the number of pairs without reusing any boot.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves two main phases:\n   - **Phase 1**: Match fixed colors (non '?') on both sides. For each color, the number of pairs is the minimum of the counts on the left and right.\n   - **Phase 2**: Use remaining '?' boots to match with unmatched fixed boots and then with each other. The goal is to utilize as many '?' as possible to form additional pairs.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Phase 1**: For each color, count the occurrences on both sides and form pairs up to the minimum count. Track the indices of these pairs.\n   - **Phase 2**: \n     - Match leftover fixed boots with '?' boots from the opposite side.\n     - Match any remaining '?' boots with each other.\n   - The total pairs are the sum from both phases.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently processes each character in the input strings once, making it linear in time complexity, O(n), where n is the length of the strings. This is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed_map = defaultdict(list)\n    left_question_indices = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        idx1 = i + 1\n        if char == '?':\n            left_question_indices.append(idx1)\n        else:\n            left_fixed_map[char].append(idx1)\n            \n    right_fixed_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_question_indices = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        idx1 = i + 1\n        if char == '?':\n            right_question_indices.append(idx1)\n        else:\n            right_fixed_map[char].append(idx1)\n            \n    phase1_pairs = []\n    for color in set(list(left_fixed_map.keys()) + list(right_fixed_map.keys())):\n        left_list = left_fixed_map.get(color, [])\n        right_list = right_fixed_map.get(color, [])\n        left_list.sort()\n        right_list.sort()\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for j in range(num_pairs):\n            left_idx = left_list[j]\n            right_idx = right_list[j]\n            phase1_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n            \n    left_fixed_remaining = []\n    for color in left_fixed_map:\n        remaining = left_fixed_map[color][len(left_fixed_map[color]):]\n        if remaining:\n            left_fixed_remaining.extend(remaining)\n            \n    right_fixed_remaining = []\n    for color in right_fixed_map:\n        remaining = right_fixed_map[color][len(right_fixed_map[color]):]\n        if remaining:\n            right_fixed_remaining.extend(remaining)\n            \n    left_fixed_remaining.sort()\n    right_fixed_remaining.sort()\n    left_question_indices.sort()\n    right_question_indices.sort()\n    \n    phase2_pairs = []\n    ptr_qr = 0\n    for i in range(len(left_fixed_remaining)):\n        if ptr_qr < len(right_question_indices):\n            left_idx = left_fixed_remaining[i]\n            right_idx = right_question_indices[ptr_qr]\n            ptr_qr += 1\n            phase2_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n            \n    ptr_ql = 0\n    for i in range(len(right_fixed_remaining)):\n        if ptr_ql < len(left_question_indices):\n            left_idx = left_question_indices[ptr_ql]\n            right_idx = right_fixed_remaining[i]\n            ptr_ql += 1\n            phase2_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n            \n    left_question_remaining = left_question_indices[ptr_ql:]\n    right_question_remaining = right_question_indices[:ptr_qr] if ptr_qr < len(right_question_indices) else []\n    left_question_remaining.sort()\n    right_question_remaining.sort()\n    \n    num_extra = min(len(left_question_remaining), len(right_question_remaining))\n    for i in range(num_extra):\n        left_idx = left_question_remaining[i]\n        right_idx = right_question_remaining[i]\n        phase2_pairs.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n        \n    total_pairs = phase1_pairs + phase2_pairs\n    total_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    k = len(total_pairs)\n    print(k)\n    for a, b in total_pairs:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n        \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots and two strings representing the colors of left and right boots.\n2. **Separating Boots**: The code separates fixed colors and '?' from both strings, storing their indices.\n3. **Phase 1 Matching**: For each color, it matches fixed boots from both sides up to the minimum count, recording these pairs.\n4. **Phase 2 Matching**: \n   - Leftover fixed boots are matched with '?' boots from the opposite side.\n   - Any remaining '?' boots are paired together.\n5. **Output**: The total pairs from both phases are printed, ensuring all indices are unique and formatted correctly.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging fixed color matches first and then utilizing wildcard '?' boots to cover any remaining possibilities.",
