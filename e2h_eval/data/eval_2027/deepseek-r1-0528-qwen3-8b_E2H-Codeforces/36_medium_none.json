The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 200000) and we need to compute the probability that after building towers in some towns (each town i from 1 to n independently with probability 1/2) there exists a way to assign signal powers (each from 1 to n) such that:\n\n Conditions:\n 1. Towns 0 and n+1 do not get any signal.\n 2. Each town i (for i from 1 to n) gets signal from exactly one tower.\n\n Note: The signal from a tower at town i with power p reaches cities c such that |c - i| < p.\n\n Let's denote:\n   - We have n towns (from 1 to n) that may or may not have a tower (each independently with prob 1/2).\n   - We must cover every town from 1 to n with exactly one tower. Also, we must ensure that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\n How can we think?\n\n Observation:\n   For a town i (from 1 to n) to be covered by a tower, the tower must be located at some j (which is built) and set a power p such that |i - j| < p.\n\n   Since the signal power p can be chosen arbitrarily (from 1 to n), note that if we have a tower at j, then the condition for covering i is that j is chosen and the power p must be at least |i - j| + 1.\n\n   However, we require that each town i (from 1 to n) is covered by exactly one tower. This is similar to an assignment problem.\n\n   Moreover, we require that town 0 and town n+1 are not covered by any tower. This means:\n\n     - The leftmost tower (if any) must be at least 1 away from town 0? Actually, a tower at town 1 with power 1 would cover |0-1| = 1, so condition |0-1| < 1 -> 1 < 1 -> false. Similarly, a tower at town 1 with power 2 would cover |0-1| = 1 which is < 2, so then town 0 would be covered. Therefore, to avoid covering town 0, the tower at town 1 (if built) must have a power p <= 1. But wait, the power must be at least 1. So if we build a tower at town 1, we must set it to 1. Then it covers [1-1, 1+1) i.e., [0, 2). So town 0 is covered (because 0 is in [0,2)) and that violates condition. Therefore, we cannot build a tower at town 1? \n\n   Let me reexamine: Condition for town 0: must not be covered by any tower. The tower at town i (with i>=1) would cover town 0 if |0-i| < p, i.e., i < p. So if we have a tower at town i, then we must set its power p such that p <= i (so that i >= p, then |0-i|=i is not strictly less than p). But note: we are allowed to choose the power arbitrarily (from 1 to n). So for a tower at town i, we can set p = i, then it covers [i-i, i+i) = [0, 2*i). Then town 0 is included (if i>=1, then 0 is in [0, 2*i)). Therefore, if we build a tower at any town i (which is at least 1) and set it to at least i+1, then town 0 will be covered. However, we can set it to at most i (then it doesn't cover town 0). But note: we must cover town 1 (if present). \n\n   Actually, let's break down:\n\n   Conditions for town 0: \n        For all towers built at i (i from 1 to n), we must have that the power p is <= i (so that i < p is false, hence |0-i| = i is not strictly less than p). \n\n   Conditions for town 1 (if present):\n        If there is a tower at town 1, then we must set it to at least 1 (which is the minimum) and then it will cover town 0 (because |0-1|=1 < 1 is false, but wait: the condition for covering town 0 is |0-1| < p, i.e., 1 < p. So if we set p=1, then 1<1 is false -> town 0 is not covered. However, if we set p>=2, then town 0 is covered. But we can choose p=1 for the tower at town 1 and that avoids covering town 0. However, then what about town 1 itself? The condition for covering town 1: the tower at town 1 must have p such that |1-1|=0 < p, which is always true for any p>=1. So if we set p=1 for the tower at town 1, then town 1 is covered by this tower. But note: we also must cover the other towns (if any) and ensure that each town is covered by exactly one.\n\n   However, consider: if we have two consecutive towns 1 and 2 both built. Then we have two towers: at 1 and 2. We set tower1 to 1 (so it covers [0, 2) -> so town1 and town0? Wait: the definition says |c-i| < p. For tower1 (at 1) with p=1: \n        town0: |0-1|=1 -> 1 < 1? No -> not covered.\n        town1: |1-1|=0 -> 0 < 1 -> yes.\n        town2: |2-1|=1 -> 1 < 1? No -> not covered.\n\n   Now, we have to cover town2. We can use the tower at town2. We set it to 1: then it covers [2-1, 2+1) = [1,3). \n        town1: |1-2|=1 -> 1 < 1? No -> not covered by this tower? But wait, we already covered town1 by the first tower. However, the condition requires that each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one. So we must cover town1 by exactly one. But if we use the tower at town2 with power 1, then it doesn't cover town1. Then we can set the tower at town2 to 2: then it covers [0,4). Then it would cover town0 (which is not allowed) and also town1 (which is okay) but then town1 is covered by two towers? \n\n   Alternatively, if we set the tower at town1 to 2, then it covers [0-1+2? Actually, wait: the condition is |c-1| < 2 -> so c in (-1, 3). Then town0 is included (since |0-1|=1 < 2) -> not allowed.\n\n   So the catch is: we cannot set the tower at town1 to a value greater than 1 because that would cover town0. And we cannot set the tower at town2 to a value greater than 2? Actually, no: the condition for town0 is that no tower must have p > i (where i is the tower location). But note: the condition for avoiding covering town0 is that for every tower at i, we must set p <= i. So for the tower at town2, we can set p up to 2. However, if we set the tower at town2 to 2, then it covers [0,4) so it covers town0 (which is not allowed). Therefore, we must set the tower at town2 to 1 or 2? But if we set it to 2, then it covers town0. So we must set it to 1. Then the coverage of tower2 is [1,3): so it covers town2 and town1 (if we set tower1 to 1, then tower2 with p=1 does not cover town1). But wait, the condition for the tower at town2 with p=1: \n        town0: |0-2|=2 < 1? No.\n        town1: |1-2|=1 < 1? No.\n        town2: |2-2|=0 < 1 -> yes.\n\n   Then we have:\n        Tower1 (at 1) with p=1: covers [0,2) -> so town1 is covered (because 1 is in [0,2)).\n        Tower2 (at 2) with p=1: covers [1,3) -> so town2 is covered.\n\n   But then town1 is covered by two towers? Actually, no: the condition for town1 from tower1: |1-1|=0 < 1 -> yes. From tower2: |1-2|=1 < 1 -> no. So only tower1 covers town1.\n\n   However, wait: the condition for the tower at town1 with p=1: it covers [0,2). Then town0 is included (but we don't care about town0 being covered by multiple, but we don't want any coverage at town0). But we already set the condition that for each tower we set p<=i to avoid covering town0, and we did. So:\n\n        Tower1: p=1 -> covers {x: |x-1|<1} -> x in (0,2) -> integers: only 1.\n        Tower2: p=1 -> covers {x: |x-2|<1} -> x in (1,3) -> integers: 2.\n\n   So indeed, the coverage for town1 is only by tower1 and for town2 only by tower2.\n\n   But wait: what about town0? \n        Tower1: |0-1|=1 -> 1<1 is false -> not covered.\n        Tower2: |0-2|=2 -> 2<1 is false -> not covered.\n\n   So that works.\n\n   However, note: the example input n=2, and the answer is 1/4.\n\n   The sample says: \"The real answer for the first example is 1/4: with probability 1/4, the towers are built in both towns 1 and 2, so we can set their signal powers to 1.\"\n\n   Why is that the only favorable outcome?\n\n   Consider the possibilities for n=2 (towns 0,1,2,3):\n\n   There are 2^2 = 4 possibilities for building towers in towns 1 and 2.\n\n   Possibility 1: no tower (prob 1/4)\n        Then we cannot cover towns 1 and 2 -> fails.\n\n   Possibility 2: only town1 (prob 1/4)\n        Then we have to cover town1 and town2. We must set the tower at town1 to a power p (from 1 to 2). \n            If p=1: covers [0,2) -> so town1 and town2? Actually, for town2: |2-1|=1 < 1? -> false. So town2 is not covered -> fails.\n            If p=2: then covers [0-1, 1+2) -> [-1,3) -> so town0 is covered (which is not allowed) and town2 is covered (since |2-1|=1<2). But then town0 is covered -> fails.\n\n   Possibility 3: only town2 (prob 1/4)\n        Then we set the tower at town2 to p (from 1 to 2).\n            p=1: covers [1,3) -> so town2 is covered, but town1: |1-2|=1 < 1 -> false -> fails.\n            p=2: covers [0,4) -> covers town0 (not allowed) and town1 (|1-2|=1<2 -> yes) and town2. But then town0 is covered -> fails.\n\n   Possibility 4: both towns (prob 1/4)\n        Then we set tower1 to 1 and tower2 to 1. Then:\n            Tower1: covers [0,2) -> town1 and town0? But wait, the condition for town0: |0-1|=1<1 -> false. So town0 is not covered. \n            Tower2: covers [1,3) -> town2 and town1? \n                For town1: |1-2|=1<1 -> false, so only town2 is covered by tower2.\n            So town1 is covered by tower1 and town2 by tower2. And town0 and town3 are not covered.\n\n        This is the only favorable outcome.\n\n   Therefore, the answer for n=2 is 1/4.\n\n   Now, how to generalize?\n\n   Conditions for the entire setup:\n\n   - The set of built towers must be such that we can assign a power to each built tower (each from 1 to the tower's index) so that:\n        1. The union of the coverage of the towers (with the constraint that each tower i must have power <= i) covers exactly the towns 1 to n, and does not cover towns 0 and n+1.\n\n   Note: The condition for a tower at i to not cover town0 is that its power must be <= i (so that |0-i| = i is not less than the power). Similarly, to not cover town n+1, the condition is that the power must be <= n+1 - i (so that |n+1-i| < power is false). However, wait: the condition for town n+1 is that |n+1-i| < p must be false. So we require p <= |n+1-i|? Actually, |n+1-i| is the distance, so we require p <= |n+1-i|. But note: the absolute value is n+1-i (since i <= n, then n+1-i >= 1). Therefore, for a tower at i, we must have:\n        p <= i   (to avoid covering town0)\n        p <= n+1-i (to avoid covering town n+1)\n\n   But note: the power p must be at least 1 and at most min(i, n+1-i). However, we also must cover the town i (which is automatically done by the tower at i if we set p>=1, but actually the coverage of a tower at i is (i-p, i+p). To cover the town i, we need |i-i|=0 < p -> so p must be at least 1 (which is always true). But note: we are covering other towns as well.\n\n   Moreover, we must cover every town j (from 1 to n) with exactly one tower.\n\n   How to assign the powers? The key is that the coverage of a tower at i with power p_i is the open interval (i-p_i, i+p_i). Since the power is an integer, the coverage in integers is the set { k : |k-i| < p_i }.\n\n   We note that the coverage must be contiguous and non-overlapping (except possibly at boundaries) for the towns 1..n.\n\n   Another observation: In order for the coverage to work, the set of built towers must form a \"chain\" that covers 1..n without gaps and without overlapping (except that the problem allows one tower per town, but note: the coverage from two adjacent towers might overlap, but then we must ensure that the coverage of a town is exactly one. However, the problem states that each town must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\n   Actually, the condition for a town j to be covered by exactly one tower imposes that the coverage intervals do not overlap (except possibly at boundaries, but note our intervals are open so they don't include the endpoints). However, note the open interval (i-p_i, i+p_i) does not include the endpoints. So the coverage at town j is determined by having a tower i such that |j-i| < p_i. \n\n   But note: the coverage of a tower at i with power p_i is the set of integers k such that i-p_i < k < i+p_i. Therefore, the coverage at an integer j is if there exists a tower i and an integer p_i (with constraints) such that i-p_i < j < i+p_i.\n\n   Now, the requirement is that the entire segment [1, n] is covered and each integer in [1, n] is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n   How can we achieve that? \n\n   Consider: We can think of the coverage as intervals. We require that the entire set {1,2,...,n} is partitioned by the coverage of the towers. \n\n   Note: The problem is similar to covering the line from 1 to n with intervals centered at the built towers, and the length of the interval (in terms of the integer points) is 2*p_i - 1? Actually, the open interval (i-p_i, i+p_i) contains the integers from floor(i-p_i)+1 to ceil(i+p_i)-1. But note: we are dealing with integers and the condition is strict inequality. The integer j is covered if and only if j is strictly between i-p_i and i+p_i.\n\n   However, note that we can choose the power arbitrarily (as long as 1<=p_i<=min(i, n+1-i)), so the maximum coverage we can get from a tower at i is from i-min(i, n+1-i) to i+min(i, n+1-i) (but then we must avoid covering 0 and n+1).\n\n   But the problem is: we must cover every integer from 1 to n exactly once.\n\n   Another approach: consider that the coverage of a tower at i must cover the town i, and the coverage must extend to the left and right until the next tower (or the boundary). However, the condition that each town is covered by exactly one tower implies that the coverage intervals must not overlap and must cover the entire [1, n]. \n\n   But wait, the example for n=5: built at 2,4,5. Then we set:\n        Tower2: power 2 -> covers (0,4) -> integers: 1,2,3.\n        Tower4: power 1 -> covers (3,5) -> integers: 4.\n        Tower5: power 1 -> covers (4,6) -> integers: 5.\n\n   Then the coverage for town1: only by tower2, town2: only by tower2, town3: by tower2 and tower4? Because 3 is in (0,4) and (3,5) -> but the condition for town3 from tower4: |3-4|=1 < 1 -> false. So actually, the coverage of tower4 is (3,5) -> so integers 4 only. Similarly, tower5: (4,6) -> integer 5 only.\n\n   So the coverage of town3 is only from tower2 (because |3-2|=1 < 2 -> yes). Then why did I say (0,4) for tower2? The open interval (0,4) includes 1,2,3. Then town3 is included.\n\n   So the intervals are:\n\n        Tower2: (0,4) -> integers {1,2,3}\n        Tower4: (3,5) -> integers {4}\n        Tower5: (4,6) -> integers {5}\n\n   Now, note that the coverage for integer 4: \n        From tower2: |4-2|=2 < 2 -> false (so not covered by tower2)\n        From tower4: |4-4|=0 < 1 -> true (covered by tower4)\n        From tower5: |4-5|=1 < 1 -> false.\n\n   So that works.\n\n   However, the coverage for integer 3: \n        Tower2: |3-2|=1 < 2 -> true.\n        Tower4: |3-4|=1 < 1 -> false.\n        Tower5: |3-5|=2 < 1 -> false.\n\n   So the condition for non-overlapping is naturally satisfied because the intervals are open and the centers are integers and the powers are chosen appropriately.\n\n   But note: the intervals (0,4) and (3,5) share the point 3? Actually, the open interval (0,4) does not include 4, and (3,5) does not include 3. However, the integer 3 is included in (0,4) (because 3 is strictly less than 4) but not in (3,5) (because 3 is not strictly greater than 3). So no overlap at 3.\n\n   Now, the problem reduces to: \n\n   We have a set S of built towers (subset of {1,2,...,n}). We must assign to each tower i in S a power p_i (integer from 1 to min(i, n+1-i)) such that:\n\n        For each integer j in [1, n], there is exactly one tower i in S such that |j-i| < p_i.\n\n   How can we assign the powers? \n\n   Note: The condition for covering j by i is |j-i| < p_i. The minimal requirement for a tower i to cover j is that p_i > |j-i|.\n\n   However, we are free to choose p_i arbitrarily (within the limits). The challenge is to assign the p_i so that the coverage of the entire set [1, n] is disjoint and complete.\n\n   Another perspective: \n\n   Consider the leftmost and rightmost towers. The leftmost tower must be able to cover the leftmost town (town1) and extend to the next tower (if any) without covering beyond the next tower's left boundary? \n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the problem is equivalent to: \n\n        We must have a set S of towers such that the graph (with nodes 1..n and edges between i and j if |i-j| < p_i can be assigned appropriately) has a matching that covers [1,n] and the coverage does not extend to 0 and n+1.\n\n   However, note that the problem is symmetric and the condition on the power for a tower i is that it must be at most min(i, n+1-i). \n\n   Insight:\n\n   The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an assignment is that the built towers form a set of centers that are spaced so that the coverage from adjacent towers does not overlap in a way that causes a town to be covered by two towers, and the coverage must be contiguous.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to choose the power arbitrarily (within the limits). The minimal power needed to cover a town j from a tower i is d+1, where d = |i-j|. However, we can choose a higher power as long as we don't exceed min(i, n+1-i). \n\n   However, the requirement for non-overlapping coverage: \n\n        Let the built towers be sorted: i1, i2, ..., i_k (with k being the number of built towers). Then we must have:\n\n          - The coverage of the leftmost tower must reach from 1 to (at most) i1 + min(i1, n+1-i1) - 1, but we must leave room for the next tower.\n\n        Actually, the condition is that the coverage intervals must be adjacent and non-overlapping. \n\n        Consider two consecutive built towers i and j (with i<j). The gap between them must be covered by the left tower's right coverage and the right tower's left coverage? But note: the condition for non-overlapping is that no two intervals (open) overlap. However, we want to cover every integer from 1 to n.\n\n        The left tower i must cover up to (i + p_i - 1) (the last integer covered is i+p_i-1). The next tower j must start covering from (j - p_j + 1) (the first integer covered is j-p_j+1). We require that the coverage of i and j do not overlap, and that the entire segment [i+p_i, j-p_j+1] is empty (so there is a gap). But wait, we must cover every integer. \n\n        Actually, we must cover every integer. So the coverage must be contiguous. \n\n        Therefore, the coverage from the left tower must end at i+p_i-1, and the next tower must start at j-p_j+1, and we require:\n\n            i+p_i-1 >= j-p_j   [so that the next tower's coverage starts at j-p_j+1 and we have i+p_i-1 >= j-p_j, meaning the next tower starts at j-p_j+1 which is at most i+p_i (if we want contiguous, then we require i+p_i-1 + 1 = i+p_i >= j-p_j+1). \n\n        But note: the coverage of the left tower ends at integer i+p_i-1, and the next tower starts at j-p_j+1. For contiguous coverage, we require:\n\n            i+p_i-1 + 1 >= j-p_j+1   => i+p_i >= j-p_j\n\n        However, we are free to choose p_i and p_j (subject to 1<=p_i<=min(i, n+1-i) and similarly for p_j). So we can set p_i as large as possible and p_j as small as possible. \n\n        The minimal p_i we can set is 1, and the maximal p_i is min(i, n+1-i). Similarly for p_j.\n\n        To avoid overlapping, we require that the coverage of the left tower does not extend too far to the right. But to cover the entire segment, we want the coverage to extend as much as possible.\n\n        Actually, we can set the power of a tower to the maximum allowed (min(i, n+1-i)) to maximize the coverage, and then check if the entire segment is covered without gaps.\n\n        However, note: if we set the power to the maximum, then the coverage of the left tower would be from (i - min(i, n+1-i)) to (i + min(i, n+1-i)). But then the next tower must start at (next tower's left coverage) and we require that the entire segment is covered.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the problem is equivalent to having a set of towers that form a \"domino tiling\" of the line [1, n] with the constraint that the center of the domino (the tower) must be built and the domino must be contained within [1, n] (and not extend to 0 or n+1). \n\n   But note: the coverage of a tower at i with power p is symmetric and can be seen as a segment of length 2*p-1 centered at i. However, the condition for non-overlapping and contiguous coverage forces that the dominoes (intervals) must be adjacent and the gaps between two consecutive towers must be covered by the previous tower's right part and the next tower's left part.\n\n   After careful thought, note that the condition for two consecutive built towers i and j (with i<j) is:\n\n        The coverage of i must reach at least j-1 (so that the gap between i and j is covered). That is, i + p_i >= j. But note: the coverage of i goes from i-p_i to i+p_i (open). The next integer after i+p_i-1 is i+p_i. So we require i+p_i >= j. Since p_i <= i (to avoid covering 0) and p_i <= n+1-i (to avoid covering n+1), but we are free to choose the maximum p_i (which is min(i, n+1-i)).\n\n        Then, the condition for covering the gap from i to j is that the rightmost point covered by i is i+p_i (exclusive) so we require i+p_i >= j. Then the next tower j must start at j (because the coverage of j starts at j-p_j+1, and we require that j-p_j+1 <= j, which is always true). But note: the gap must be covered by the left tower: we require that the left tower's coverage extends to j-1 (inclusive). So the condition is:\n\n            i + p_i >= j   => p_i >= j - i.\n\n        But note: we must also avoid covering n+1, so p_i <= n+1-i. Similarly, for j: p_j >= ... \n\n   However, we are free to choose the powers arbitrarily (within the limits). So the condition for two consecutive built towers i and j (with i<j) is that we can set p_i to at least (j-i) and p_j to at least (j-i) (actually, for j, the condition to cover j is automatically satisfied, but we must also cover the left side of j: the gap from i to j must be covered by i's right coverage). \n\n   But note: the coverage of i must cover the entire gap from i+1 to j-1. The condition for covering i+1: |(i+1)-i| = 1 < p_i -> so p_i must be at least 2? Not necessarily: if j-i=2, then we need p_i>=2 to cover i+1 and i+2? Actually, to cover i+1: we require p_i>1, i.e., p_i>=2. To cover i+2: we require p_i>2, i.e., p_i>=3. So to cover the entire gap from i to j (which is j-i-1 integers) we need p_i >= j-i. \n\n   Therefore, for consecutive built towers i and j, we require that the power of i is at least (j-i). But note: the power of i is bounded by min(i, n+1-i). Similarly, for the next tower j, the power must be at least (j - i) as well? Actually, no: the next tower j only needs to cover itself and the gap from the left? Actually, the gap from the left is covered by i, so j only needs to cover the gap from the right (if any) and itself. But note: the condition for covering the gap from the left is taken care of by i (we set i's power sufficiently high). Then j must cover the gap to the next tower (if any) on the right. \n\n   However, the condition for the entire chain is that the built towers must be spaced such that the maximum power available at each tower is sufficient to cover the gap to the next tower. Specifically, for consecutive built towers i and j (with i<j), we require:\n\n        p_i >= j - i   and   p_j >= (if there is a next tower k, then k - j, but if j is the last, then we don't need to cover beyond j)\n\n   But note: we are free to choose the powers arbitrarily (as long as they are within the limits). So the condition for the entire chain is that for each consecutive pair (i, j) (with j being the next built tower to the right of i), we have:\n\n        j - i <= min(i, n+1-i)   [so that we can set p_i = j-i, which is <= min(i, n+1-i)]\n\n   However, wait: we can set p_i to any value from 1 to min(i, n+1-i). So the condition for the gap from i to j is that j-i <= min(i, n+1-i). Similarly, for the next gap from j to k, we require k-j <= min(j, n+1-j). \n\n   But note: the coverage condition for the gap from i to j is that the power of i must be at least (j-i). Therefore, we must have j-i <= min(i, n+1-i). \n\n   Additionally, what about the leftmost and rightmost towers?\n\n        Leftmost tower i1: must cover from 1 to i1+p_i1-1, and we require that i1+p_i1-1 >= i2-1 (if there is a next tower i2) and also must cover the leftmost town 1. The condition for covering 1: |1-i1| < p_i1 -> i1-1 < p_i1. But note: we can set p_i1 to at least i1 (if i1<=n+1-i1) or n+1-i1 (if n+1-i1 < i1). However, the condition for covering 1 is automatically satisfied if we set p_i1 to at least i1 (since i1-1 < i1). But wait: the condition for covering 1 is |1-i1| < p_i1 -> i1-1 < p_i1. Since p_i1>=1, and i1>=1, then for i1=1: 0 < p_1 -> always true. For i1=2: 1 < p_2 -> so p_2 must be at least 2. But note: the power of the leftmost tower must also satisfy the condition for avoiding covering 0: p_1 <= min(1, n+1-1)=min(1, n). So for n>=1, min(1, n)=1. Then for i1=1, we must set p_1=1, and then the condition for covering 1: 0 < 1 -> true. But then the coverage of the leftmost tower at 1 is (0,2) -> so it covers town1 and town0? Wait, no: we set p_1=1, then |0-1|=1 < 1 -> false, so town0 is not covered. But the condition for covering town1: |1-1|=0 < 1 -> true. So that's okay.\n\n        However, for the leftmost tower at i1=2 (if n>=2), we must set p_2>=2 (to cover town1: |1-2|=1 < 2 -> true) and also p_2<=min(2, n+1-2). For n>=3, min(2, n-1) is 2 (if n>=3, then n+1-2 = n-1 >=2). So we can set p_2=2. Then the coverage is (0,4) -> so town0 is not covered (because 0 is not in (0,4)? Actually, the open interval (0,4) does not include 0 and 4. But wait: the condition for covering town0 is |0-2|=2 < 2 -> false, so town0 is not covered. And town1: |1-2|=1<2 -> true. Town2: |2-2|=0<2 -> true. Then if we have only one tower at 2, then we must cover towns1 and 2. But then we require that the coverage of the tower at 2 covers both 1 and 2. Then the condition for non-overlapping: there's no next tower. And the condition for the right side: we must not cover town3 (if n>=3). The condition for town3: |3-2|=1 < 2 -> true. So if n>=3 and we have a tower only at 2, then town3 would be covered (if n>=3) and that is not allowed unless we have more towers? \n\n   Actually, the condition for the entire setup is that we must cover only the towns 1..n and nothing else. So if we have a tower at 2 and n>=3, then we cover town3 (if we set p_2=2) which is not allowed (unless there is another tower to cover town3? But we don't have one). Therefore, if we have a tower at 2, then we must set p_2<=1 (to avoid covering town3) but then we cannot cover town1 (because |1-2|=1 < 1 -> false). \n\n   So what's the catch? The condition for the leftmost tower must also consider the right side: we must not cover beyond the next tower (or the boundary). \n\n   Therefore, the condition for the leftmost tower at i1 is:\n\n        p_i1 <= i1   (to avoid covering 0) and p_i1 <= n+1-i1 (to avoid covering n+1). \n\n        And to cover the left gap (if any) to the next tower i2, we require p_i1 >= i2 - i1.\n\n   But note: the leftmost tower must cover from 1 to i1+p_i1-1. The next tower is at i2, so we require i1+p_i1-1 >= i2-1 (so that the gap is covered). But note: the gap is from i1+1 to i2-1. The coverage from i1 must extend to i2-1, so i1+p_i1-1 >= i2-1  => p_i1 >= i2 - i1.\n\n   And we also must not cover beyond n+1: p_i1 <= n+1-i1.\n\n   So the conditions for the leftmost tower i1 are:\n\n        i2 - i1 <= p_i1 <= min(i1, n+1-i1)\n\n   But note: the leftmost tower must also cover town1 (if i1>1, then the distance from i1 to 1 is i1-1, so we require p_i1 > i1-1). This is automatically satisfied if p_i1 >= i1 (because i1-1 < i1) but if i1 is the leftmost, then the next tower i2 must be at least i1+1, and the condition p_i1>=i2-i1 might be stronger.\n\n   Similarly, the rightmost tower must satisfy: the power must be at least (if there is a left tower, we don't care) but",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (each with a probability of 1/2 independently), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered, and each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the built towers must form a sequence where each consecutive pair of towers can cover the gap between them without overlapping or leaving gaps. Specifically, for two consecutive towers at positions \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) (where \\(i < j\\)), the power of the tower at \\(i\\) must be at least \\(j - i\\) to cover all towns between them. Additionally, the power must not exceed the minimum of \\(i\\) and \\(n + 1 - i\\) to ensure towns 0 and \\(n+1\\) are not covered.\n\n2. **Insight**: The problem reduces to counting the number of valid subsets of towns (from 1 to n) where each subset can be ordered such that for each consecutive pair \\((i, j)\\), \\(j - i \\leq \\min(i, n + 1 - i)\\). This ensures that the signal powers can be set appropriately to meet the coverage conditions.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to count the valid subsets. The DP state `dp[i]` represents the number of valid ways to build towers up to town \\(i\\) such that the last built tower is at position \\(i\\). The recurrence relation involves summing over all previous towns \\(j\\) (where \\(j < i\\)) that satisfy \\(i - j \\leq \\min(j, n + 1 - j)\\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each town once, and for each town, it checks all previous towns up to \\(i\\). Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n^2)\\), which is feasible given the constraint \\(n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5\\) (though optimizations might be needed for very large \\(n\\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    inv2 = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total = 0\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0:\n            if j == 0:\n                break\n            if i - j <= min(j, n + 1 - j):\n                total = (total + dp[j]) % MOD\n            j -= 1\n        dp[i] = total\n    \n    total_ways = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    favorable_ways = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i == 1:\n            if n >= 1:\n                favorable_ways = (favorable_ways + dp[1]) % MOD\n        else:\n            favorable_ways = (favorable_ways + dp[i]) % MOD\n    \n    probability = favorable_ways * pow(total_ways, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(probability)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input \\(n\\) and initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of valid configurations ending at town \\(i\\).\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The base case `dp[0] = 1` accounts for the empty configuration before processing any towns. For each town \\(i\\) from 1 to \\(n\\), the code checks all previous towns \\(j\\) to see if they can form a valid consecutive pair (i.e., \\(i - j \\leq \\min(j, n + 1 - j)\\)). If so, it adds the number of valid configurations ending at \\(j\\) to `dp[i]`.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Configurations**: After filling the `dp` array, the code sums up all valid configurations (stored in `dp[i]` for each \\(i\\)) to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is computed as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes (which is \\(2^n\\) since each town can independently have a tower or not). The result is printed modulo \\(998244353\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations using dynamic programming and computes the desired probability by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.",
