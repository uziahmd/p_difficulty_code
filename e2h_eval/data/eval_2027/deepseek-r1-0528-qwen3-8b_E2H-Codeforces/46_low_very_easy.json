The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. So we can have a subsegment that is almost strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We want to find the longest contiguous subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Precompute two arrays: \n    - `left[i]`: the length of the increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change) \n        Conditions for left[i]:\n          left[0] = 1\n          For i>=1: \n            if a[i] > a[i-1]: then left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            else: left[i] = 1\n\n 2. Similarly, precompute `right[i]`: the length of the increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (without any change)\n    Conditions for right[i]:\n        right[n-1] = 1\n        For i from n-2 down to 0:\n            if a[i] < a[i+1]: then right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            else: right[i] = 1\n\n 3. Now, consider that we are allowed to change one number. There are three cases:\n\n    Case 1: The entire segment is already strictly increasing. Then we can use the whole segment without any change? Actually, but note: we are allowed to change one number, so even if the entire segment is increasing, we can change one and still have the same length, but the problem allows at most one change so we can also use the entire segment without changing. However, we might have an opportunity to merge two increasing segments with one change in the middle.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"change at most one\", so if the entire segment is already strictly increasing, then we can use the entire segment without changing. However, sometimes we can get a longer segment by including more at the ends? Actually, no, because the entire segment is the longest.\n\n    However, there's a catch: the entire segment might not be increasing, but we might fix one element to merge two increasing parts.\n\n    We can consider:\n\n    a) The subsegment might be entirely increasing (then we don't use any change). But note: we are allowed to change one, so we can also consider segments that are not increasing but become increasing after one change.\n\n    How do we check for a candidate segment?\n\n    We can try to combine two increasing segments [0:i] and [i+1:j] by fixing the element at position i (which is currently causing the break). \n\n    Conditions for merging two increasing segments with one change at position i:\n\n        Let the left part be from L to i-1 (so last element is a[i-1]), and the right part from i+1 to R (first element is a[i+1]).\n        Then we require that after changing a[i] to some value x, we have:\n            a[i-1] < x < a[i+1]\n\n        But note: we are only allowed one change. Also, the entire segment must be strictly increasing.\n\n        So the condition is that the left part is increasing (so we know the last element is a[i-1]) and the right part is increasing (so the first element is a[i+1]). Then we can set x to be any integer between a[i-1] and a[i+1]. If such an integer exists, then the entire segment from L to R (with the fixed a[i]) is strictly increasing.\n\n        However, note: if the left part has length 1 (so no element before i) or the right part has length 1 (no element after i), then the condition is simpler.\n\n    Actually, we can consider:\n\n        Option 1: Without any change, the longest increasing contiguous subsegment.\n        Option 2: With one change, we can merge two increasing segments (if the break is fixable).\n\n    But note: the change might be at the very beginning or end? Actually, if we change an element at the boundary, then we don't have both left and right to compare. So we must consider:\n\n        Candidate 1: Entirely increasing segments (length L, which is the maximum of left or right? Actually, we can take the maximum of all left[i] and right[i] but note: we can also merge two segments.\n\n        However, the problem allows the entire segment to be increasing (so we don't need to change) but then we can also consider segments that are not entirely increasing but can be fixed by one change.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Let ans = max( max(left), max(right) )   [because we can have a segment that doesn't require any change]\n\n        Then, consider the possibility of merging two increasing segments by changing the element at position i (from 1 to n-2, because we need at least one element on the left and one on the right).\n\n        Condition for position",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of a sequence where, by changing at most one element, the subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible subsegments that meet this criterion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (`left_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at each position `i` without any changes.\n   - **Right Array (`right_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at each position `i` without any changes.\n\n2. **Initial Maximum Length**: The initial answer is the maximum value found in either `left_arr` or `right_arr`, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any modifications.\n\n3. **Merging Segments with One Change**: For each position `i` (from 1 to n-2), check if the elements before and after `i` can form a strictly increasing sequence when `a[i]` is modified. Specifically:\n   - If the left part (elements before `i`) and the right part (elements after `i`) are both increasing, then the merged segment's length is `left_arr[i-1] + right_arr[i+1] + 1` (accounting for the modified `a[i]`).\n   - Ensure that the modified `a[i]` lies between the last element of the left segment and the first element of the right segment to maintain strict increasing order.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the entire segment is already strictly increasing or where merging segments is not possible due to boundary conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(max(left_arr), max(right_arr))\n    \n    for i in range(1, n-1):\n        if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n            ans = max(ans, left_arr[i-1] + right_arr[i+1] + 1)\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length `n` and the sequence `a`.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially 1 since no changes are needed.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: These arrays are computed to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsegments ending and starting at each position, respectively.\n4. **Initial Answer**: The initial answer is derived from the maximum values in the `left_arr` and `right_arr`, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegments without modifications.\n5. **Merging Segments**: For each position `i`, if the elements before and after `i` can form a strictly increasing sequence when `a[i]` is modified (i.e., `a[i-1] < a[i+1]`), the potential merged segment length is calculated and compared to the current maximum.\n6. **Output**: The maximum length found is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments that can be made strictly increasing with at most one modification, leveraging precomputed arrays to minimize redundant calculations.",
