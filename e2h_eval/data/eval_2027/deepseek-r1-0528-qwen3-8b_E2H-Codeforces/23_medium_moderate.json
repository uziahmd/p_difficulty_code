In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three strings in a single line. Each string is two characters: a digit and then one of 'm', 'p', or 's'. But note: the input is given as three separate strings in one line? Actually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\", meaning we have one line with three space separated strings? Or are they concatenated?\n\n Let me read the example: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But wait, the example input format is:\n\n   Input: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n   Input: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n   Input: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input example is given as three examples. However, the problem states:\n\n   The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\n So the input is one line with three strings? Or three strings? \n\n Actually, looking at the example: \n\n   Input: \n        ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is ambiguous. But the example output is:\n\n        ['0', '0', '1']\n\n So we have three test cases? Or one test case with three tiles?\n\n Let me clarify the problem statement: \"The only line contains three strings\". That means we have one line of input that has three strings (each string is two characters). But note: the example input is given as three separate examples. However, the problem is asking for the minimum number of draws for her hand.\n\n Actually, the problem does not say there are multiple test cases. It says the input is one line with three strings (the three tiles). \n\n But wait, the example input is shown as:\n\n        ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This might be a representation of three separate inputs. However, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n After re‐reading: the input is one line, and that line has three strings. Each string is a tile? Or each string is a representation of the hand?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"three strings\" — but then each tile is represented by two characters. And the hand has three tiles. So the input should be three two-character strings. But how are they delimited?\n\n Example input: \"1s2s3s\" ? or \"1s 2s 3s\"?\n\n The example output is given as three separate outputs: '0', '0', '1'. \n\n Clarification from the example: \n   First example: \"1s 2s 3s\" -> output 0.\n   Second example: \"9m 9m 9m\" -> output 0.\n   Third example: \"3p 9m 2p\" -> output 1.\n\n But wait, the second example is \"9m 9m 9m\", which is three tiles, but actually the second example input is given as three identical tiles? \n\n However, note the example input is given as three examples. The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\n So, we are to assume that the input is one line containing three strings? Or one line containing six characters (three tiles without spaces)?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n So each tile is two characters. The hand has three tiles, so we have three two-character strings.\n\n How are these three two-character strings given? The problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\".\n\n This means we can split the line by space. Or if there's no space, then we have to take the first two characters as one tile, next two as the next, etc.\n\n But the example input is provided as:\n\n        Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This suggests that the input line for the first example would be \"1s2s3s\"? Or \"1s 2s 3s\"?\n\n Let me check: the problem says \"The only line contains three strings\". In programming competitions, it is common to have the input as space separated values.\n\n However, the example input is written with spaces. So likely, the input is three two-character strings separated by spaces.\n\n But wait, the example input is written as:\n\n        ['1s 2s 3s', ...]\n\n This is a list of three strings, but each string is two characters? Actually, no: the first string is \"1s 2s 3s\", which is six characters (if including spaces). That doesn't match.\n\n Alternatively, perhaps the example input is meant to be three separate lines? But the problem says \"The only line\".\n\n After reading the problem again: \"The only line contains three strings\". Then the example input should be three strings in one line. \n\n But note: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is confusing because the first element of the list is a string \"1s 2s 3s\", which is actually three tiles (each being two characters) without spaces? Or with spaces?\n\n Since the problem says: \"three strings\", and each tile is represented by two characters, but the hand has three tiles, then the input is one line with three two-character strings. \n\n How are the three two-character strings delimited? The problem doesn't specify. But typically, we use spaces. \n\n However, the example input is written in the problem as:\n\n        ['1s 2s 3s', ...]\n\n But note: the first example input is three tiles: '1s', '2s', '3s'. So the entire input line is \"1s 2s 3s\", meaning three tokens (each token is two characters).\n\n So we can split the input line by spaces and then we get a list of three strings, each of length 2.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read the entire line and split by space. Then we have a list `tiles` of three strings, each string is two characters.\n\n 2. We have three tiles. We need to compute the minimum number of draws to form at least one mentsu.\n\n Conditions for mentsu: either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\n Note: we can draw any tile arbitrarily many times.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Case 0: Already has a mentsu -> 0 draws.\n\n Case 1: Not having a mentsu, but we can form one by drawing 1 or 2 tiles.\n\n We are allowed to draw any tiles. So we can consider:\n\n - Koutsu: we need three identical. So if we have two identical, then we can complete by drawing one more. If we have one, then we need two.\n\n But note: we are allowed to draw any tile, so we don't necessarily have to complete the existing duplicates.\n\n However, we are only concerned with forming at least one mentsu. We don't need to use all tiles.\n\n Also, we can form a shuntsu: three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n We have three tiles. We can also consider drawing one or two tiles to form a mentsu.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Option 1: Check if we already have a koutsu or shuntsu.\n\n Option 2: If not, then we consider:\n\n   - Drawing 1 tile: then we have four tiles. We need to check if there exists a way to form a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu) by adding one tile.\n\n   - But note: we are allowed to choose which tile to draw. We want the minimum number of draws (0, 1, 2, or maybe even 3? but note: we only need one mentsu, and we have three tiles, so maximum we might consider is 2 draws? Actually, we can form a mentsu with 3 tiles. So we start with three, then we can draw up to two to have five tiles. But we don't require to use all tiles. However, the mentsu must be formed by three tiles. \n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n 0 draws: if the hand already has a mentsu (i.e., either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Otherwise, 1 draw: if by adding one tile we can form a mentsu.\n\n Otherwise, 2 draws: if by adding two tiles we can form a mentsu.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the drawn tiles in forming the mentsu? Actually, we can ignore some tiles. So we only need to form one set of three tiles.\n\n However, we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose the best ones.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let the hand be a multiset of three tiles.\n\n We can represent a tile by (number, suit). The number is an integer from 1 to 9, and the suit is one of 'm','p','s'.\n\n Step 1: Check for 0 draws.\n\n   - Koutsu: if there exists a tile that appears three times? But we have exactly three tiles. So if we have three same, then yes.\n\n   - Shuntsu: if there exists three distinct tiles (in terms of (suit, sorted numbers)) such that they are consecutive and same suit.\n\n     But note: the hand has three tiles. So we can have:\n\n        [x, x+1, x+2] in the same suit.\n\n     However, what if we have duplicate numbers? Then we cannot form a shuntsu with three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n     Example: [1m, 2m, 3m] -> shuntsu.\n\n     Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> no shuntsu.\n\n     Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> no.\n\n Step 2: Check for 1 draw.\n\n   We have four tiles (original three plus one drawn). We need to see if we can form a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu) from three of them.\n\n   Since we can choose the drawn tile arbitrarily, we can try to complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n   Possibilities for 1 draw:\n\n     a) Complete a triplet: \n        - We have two of the same tile. Then we can draw one more to get three. So if there's a tile that appears twice, then we can complete that to a koutsu with one draw.\n\n        - Also, we might have two different tiles that are the same? Actually, we have three tiles. So duplicates: counts are 3 (already covered), or 2 and 1 (then we can complete the pair to triplet). Or all distinct.\n\n     b) Complete a sequence:\n\n        - We have two tiles that are part of a sequence. For example, if we have [x, x+1] then we need x+2 (same suit). Similarly, we might have [x, x-1, x-2] or [x, x-1] and x-2, etc.\n\n        Actually, we can break down:\n\n          Let the hand be [a,b,c]. We can sort the hand by suit and then by number.\n\n          We consider each suit separately.\n\n          For a fixed suit, we have some numbers. Then we can look for consecutive sequences.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So we can choose a tile that completes a sequence.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] and [4m] is left, but we don't need to use the 4m for the mentsu.\n\n        However, we can form the mentsu [1m,2m,3m] with one draw.\n\n        Another example: [1m, 3m, 4m] -> we can draw 2m to form [1m,2m,3m] but wait, 2m is drawn and then we have [1m,2m,3m] and 4m. Or we can form [2m,3m,4m] by drawing 2m? But wait, we don't have two 2m's. Actually, we have [1m,3m,4m] and we draw 2m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m,4m]. Now we can form [1m,2m,3m] (a shuntsu) OR [2m,3m,4m] (another shuntsu). So yes.\n\n        But note: we can only draw one tile, and we can form one mentsu.\n\n        However, we must check: is there a way to form a shuntsu by drawing one tile?\n\n        Conditions for shuntsu with one draw:\n\n          - We have two tiles that are consecutive (with the same suit) and then we need the missing one.\n\n          - Or we have two tiles that are not consecutive but the gap is two, then we can complete the middle? Actually, no: for example, [1m,3m,4m]: we have 1m and then 3m,4m. The consecutive pairs are (3m,4m). Then we can complete the sequence [2m,3m,4m] by drawing 2m. Alternatively, we can complete [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m. So same.\n\n        Actually, the condition for a shuntsu with one draw is:\n\n          There exists a suit S and a set of numbers (in the hand) that can be extended by one number to form a consecutive triple.\n\n          More precisely, let the numbers in the same suit be {a, b, c} (if there are duplicates, then we might have less than three distinct numbers). \n\n          Steps for shuntsu with one draw:\n\n            Group by suit.\n\n            For each suit, let the distinct numbers be sorted. Then, we can consider:\n\n              Case 1: We have two consecutive numbers and one missing in between? Actually, we need three consecutive. So if we have two consecutive numbers (like n and n+1) then we can complete by drawing n+2 (if n+2 <=9) OR n-2 (if n>=3). But wait, we must have the base for the sequence.\n\n            Actually, we can look for any contiguous block of two numbers (in the same suit) and then check the possibility of the third.\n\n            However, note: we can have duplicates. Example: [1m,2m,2m] -> then we have two 2m. Then we can form [1m,2m,?] but we already have two 2m, so we need a 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. But wait, we have two 2m, so we can use one 2m for the sequence and the other 2m is extra. Alternatively, we could use two 2m for the sequence? No, because the sequence requires three distinct consecutive numbers (though note: the definition does not explicitly say distinct, but the example [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] forms [5p,4p,6p] or [5p,7p,6p] — wait, the example uses distinct numbers. \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"A shuntsu is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit\", and the examples: [1m,2m,3m] and [5s,7s,6s] (note: [5s,7s,6s] is sorted as [5s,6s,7s]). \n\n            The key is: the three tiles must be three consecutive numbers. So they must be distinct.\n\n            Therefore, if we have duplicates, we cannot use the same number twice.\n\n            So for a shuntsu, we need three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n            Then, for the hand [1m,2m,2m]: we have two 2m. Then we can use one 2m and then we need 1m and 3m? But wait, we already have 1m and two 2m. Then we can use 1m, one of the 2m, and then we need 3m. So yes, we can complete by drawing 3m.\n\n            Similarly, if we have [1m,2m,3m,3m] then we can form [1m,2m,3m] with one draw? Actually, we already have [1m,2m,3m] (if we have three distinct) but here we have two 3m. Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] without drawing? But wait, we have three distinct: 1m,2m,3m. So that is already a shuntsu.\n\n            Therefore, the presence of duplicates does not prevent the formation of a shuntsu as long as there are three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n            However, if we have [1m,1m,2m], then we don't have three distinct numbers. We have two distinct: 1m and 2m. Then we cannot form a shuntsu with three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n            So for shuntsu with one draw, we need:\n\n                There exists a suit S and a set of distinct numbers in S of size at least 2, and the numbers are consecutive or nearly consecutive such that by adding one number (the missing one) we complete a consecutive triple.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Group by suit.\n\n                For each suit, let the distinct numbers present be sorted.\n\n                Then, we can consider:\n\n                    - If we have two distinct consecutive numbers (say [n, n+1]), then we can complete the triple by drawing n+2 (if n+2<=9) or n-2 (if n>=3). But note: we can also have the triple [n-2, n-1, n] if we have [n-1, n] and then we need n-2.\n\n                    - Similarly, if we have [n, n+2] (with a gap of one) then we can complete by drawing n+1.\n\n                Actually, we can look for two consecutive numbers (adjacent in the sorted distinct list) and then check the possibility of the next or previous.\n\n                But note: we might have more than two distinct numbers. Then we might have multiple ways.\n\n            However, we are allowed to draw only one tile, so we can complete only one gap.\n\n            Algorithm for one draw for shuntsu:\n\n                For each suit S:\n                    Let L = sorted list of distinct numbers in the hand that belong to suit S.\n\n                    Then, consider the gaps:\n\n                        Case 1: We have at least two distinct numbers, and the numbers are consecutive (or can be completed by one).\n\n                    Actually, we can check:\n\n                        Let T be the set of distinct numbers in suit S.\n\n                        We want to know if there exists an integer x (not in T) such that T ∪ {x} contains a consecutive triple.\n\n                    But note: we can only add one tile. So we are looking for a consecutive triple that is contained in T ∪ {x}. Since we are only adding one, then the consecutive triple must be contained in T except one missing number.\n\n                    So: the consecutive triple must be three consecutive numbers: (a, a+1, a+2). We can check:\n\n                        For each a from 1 to 7 (since a+2<=9):\n\n                            Let the triple be (a, a+1, a+2).\n\n                            Count how many of these are in T.\n\n                            If we have two of them, then we can complete by drawing the missing one.\n\n                    However, note: we might have the same tile drawn twice? But the problem says we can draw any tile arbitrarily, but we are only drawing one. So we can only supply one tile.\n\n                    Example: T = {1,3} (suit S). Then we are missing 2. Then we can draw 2 to form [1,2,3].\n\n                    Example: T = {2,3} (suit S). Then we are missing 1. Then we can draw 1 to form [1,2,3]? But wait, we don't have 1. But the definition requires the three tiles to be the ones we have and the drawn one. So we can form [1,2,3] by having 2 and 3 and drawing 1.\n\n                    However, note: the drawn tile must be available (and we can choose any). So yes.\n\n                    But wait: the example [1m, 3m, 4m] for suit m: distinct numbers {1,3,4}. Then we can form [2,3,4] by drawing 2, or [1,2,3] by drawing 2 (but wait, we don't have 2 originally). Actually, we have 1,3,4. Then:\n\n                        For [1,2,3]: we are missing 2 -> we can draw 2.\n                        For [2,3,4]: we are missing 2 -> we can draw 2.\n\n                    So we can complete with one draw.\n\n                    But note: we might have multiple possibilities, but we only need one.\n\n            However, we must also consider koutsu with one draw:\n\n                Condition: we have two identical tiles (same number and same suit). Then we can draw one more to make three.\n\n            So for 1 draw, we can have:\n\n                Option A: koutsu: if there exists a tile (same suit and same number) that appears at least two times.\n\n                Option B: shuntsu: if there exists a suit S and a consecutive triple (a, a+1, a+2) such that two of the numbers are present in S and the third is missing.\n\n            Therefore, if either condition holds, then we can do it in one draw.\n\n Step 3: Check for 2 draws.\n\n   If we cannot do it in 0 or 1, then we check if we can do it in 2.\n\n   With two draws, we can form:\n\n        Option A: koutsu: if we have one tile, then we need two more. But wait, we have three tiles. We can use two draws to complete two different tiles? Actually, we only need one mentsu. So we can complete one triplet. But we have three tiles. The best way to complete a triplet is if we have two of the same, then we need one more. But we are drawing two, so we can complete a triplet if we have one of the same? Actually, no: if we have one tile, then we need two more. But we can draw two of the same.\n\n        However, we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n        But note: we might have two different ways to form a mentsu.\n\n        However, note: we can also consider using the two draws to form a triplet from scratch. But we have three tiles. We might not have any duplicates.\n\n        Actually, the minimal draws is 2 if:\n\n            - We have three distinct tiles (no duplicates) and they are not forming a shuntsu and no two are the same.\n\n            Then we can:\n\n                Option 1: Draw two tiles to complete a triplet: but we don't have any duplicate, so we would need to draw three of the same to form a triplet? Actually, no: we can draw two tiles of the same type to form a triplet from scratch. But wait, we have three tiles. We are going to have five tiles. Then we can form a triplet from two of the drawn tiles and one of the original? Actually, no: the triplet must be three identical. So if we have one original tile, then we need two more of that same tile. But we can draw two of that tile.\n\n                Example: hand [1m, 2m, 3m]. We can draw two 1m to form [1m,1m,1m]. Similarly, we can draw two 2m or two 3m.\n\n                Option 2: Form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                Example: hand [1m, 2p, 3s]. We can draw two tiles to form a shuntsu. But note: we can choose any tiles. So we can draw two tiles of the same suit and consecutive numbers.\n\n                But note: we can also form a triplet from scratch by drawing two of the same? Actually, we can form a triplet by drawing two of one tile (if we have one tile of that suit and number). But wait, we don't have any tile of that suit and number? Then we have to draw three? Actually, no: we are drawing two, then we have five tiles. Then we can pick three of the drawn ones? But the drawn ones must be identical. So if we draw two 1m, then we only have two 1m, which is not a triplet. We need three.\n\n                Actually, to form a triplet, we need three identical. So we must have at least one of that tile already? \n\n                Correction: the problem says: \"she can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\" So we can draw duplicates of existing tiles.\n\n                But if we don't have a tile, we can still draw three of the same. However, we are only allowed to draw two. So we cannot form a triplet from scratch by drawing two. We must have at least one tile of that kind to complete a triplet with two draws.\n\n                Therefore, for koutsu with two draws:\n\n                    We must have at least one tile in the hand (so we can use one) and then we draw two more of the same.\n\n                But wait, we have three tiles. We can choose any tile to complete. However, if we have one tile of type X, then we can draw two more X to form a triplet.\n\n                Similarly, if we have two tiles of type X, then we can draw one more to form a triplet (which is one draw). So two draws is only needed when we have zero or one.\n\n                Actually, for koutsu:\n\n                    If we have three: 0 draws.\n                    If we have two: 1 draw (as above).\n                    If we have one: then we need to draw two more (so two draws) to form a triplet.\n\n                But wait, we can also form a triplet by drawing three of a kind that we don't have? Then that would be three draws. So two draws is insufficient for a triplet from scratch.\n\n                Similarly, for shuntsu:\n\n                    We can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n                    Example: hand [1m, 4m, 7m]. We can draw two tiles: 2m and 3m? Then we have [1m,2m,3m,4m,7m] and then we can form [1m,2m,3m]. So that works.\n\n                    But note: we can also form a different shuntsu.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can form a shuntsu by having two of the same tile? No, shuntsu requires distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n                So for shuntsu, we can form:\n\n                    If we have two tiles that are part of a sequence, but the third is missing and the third is not available to draw with one draw (because the gap is too big) then we might need two draws.\n\n                    Example: hand [1m, 5m, 9m]. Then to form a shuntsu, we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m (two draws) OR [5m,6m,7m] by drawing 6m,7m (two draws) OR [8m,9m,10m] is invalid (10m not allowed). \n\n                But wait, we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles that are not consecutive? Actually, we need to form a consecutive triple.\n\n                However, note: we are allowed to choose any two tiles. So we can choose two tiles arbitrarily.\n\n                But note: we must form a consecutive triple. So we can choose two tiles that complete two parts of two different sequences? Actually, we only need one mentsu.\n\n                Therefore, we can consider:\n\n                    We can form a shuntsu if we can find a consecutive triple (a, a+1, a+2) such that at least one of the three numbers is already in the hand (same suit) and the other two can be drawn.\n\n                    But wait, we can draw two tiles, so we can complete a sequence that has at least one tile.\n\n                Actually, we can also form a shuntsu that doesn't use any of the existing tiles? Then we need to draw three tiles (one for each number). But that is three draws, which is worse.\n\n                So the minimal for shuntsu with two draws is when we have at least one tile in the hand that belongs to the suit of the sequence we are going to form.\n\n                However, we can form a shuntsu in two draws if:\n\n                    There exists a consecutive triple (a, a+1, a+2) (in the same suit) such that the hand has at least one tile in that suit (any number) and the other two numbers are not present, but we can draw two.\n\n                But wait, we can also form a shuntsu by combining two draws with two existing tiles? Actually, we have three tiles. We can use two of the existing tiles and one drawn.\n\n                Actually, the two draws can be used to complete two parts of a sequence that we have one part of.\n\n                Example: hand [1m, 3m, 4m] -> we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing one 2m (so one draw) OR [2m,3m,4m] by drawing one 2m. But wait, we already considered one draw.\n\n                What about a hand that doesn't have any two consecutive numbers? \n\n                Example: hand [1m, 2m, 4m] -> we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 3m (one draw) OR [3m,4m,5m] by drawing 3m and 5m (two draws). But wait, we can also form [2m,3m,4m] by drawing 3m (one draw). \n\n                Actually, we have two possibilities: [1m,2m,3m] and [2m,3m,4m]. The first requires drawing 3m (one draw) and the second requires drawing 3m (one draw). \n\n                So the example [1m,2m,4m] is covered by one draw.\n\n                Example requiring two draws for shuntsu:\n\n                    hand [1m, 1m, 1m] -> we have three 1m, so we have a koutsu (0 draws) -> so not this.\n\n                    hand [1m, 2p, 3s] (all distinct and different suits). Then we can form a koutsu by drawing two more of one of the tiles? For example, draw two 1m to form [1m,1m,1m] (two draws). Similarly, we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles of the same suit and consecutive numbers. \n\n                    But note: we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles that are part of a sequence that we don't have any tile in the hand. But then we need three draws (one for each tile). \n\n                    Alternatively, we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles that complete a sequence that we have one tile. But we don't have any tile in the same suit for a sequence. \n\n                    Example: hand [1m, 2p, 3s]. We can draw two tiles of suit m, say 2m and 3m, then we have [1m,2m,3m] (a shuntsu). So that is two draws.\n\n                    But wait, we didn't use the existing 2p and 3s. We are allowed to ignore them. So we can form a shuntsu in suit m by drawing two tiles (2m and 3m). \n\n                    Therefore, we can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles (of the same suit) that form a consecutive triple with one of the existing tiles (but we don't have any in that suit). Actually, we have one tile in suit m (the 1m). Then we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m.\n\n                    Similarly, we can form a triplet in suit m by drawing two 1m (to complete from one 1m). \n\n                    So for the hand [1m,2p,3s]:\n\n                        Option 1: koutsu: we have one 1m, so we can draw two 1m -> two draws.\n\n                        Option 2: shuntsu: we have one 1m, so we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] -> two draws.\n\n                    Therefore, two draws.\n\n                But wait, is there a way to do it in one draw? \n\n                    One draw: koutsu: we don't have two of the same, so no.\n\n                    One draw: shuntsu: we need a consecutive triple in the same suit. We have only one tile per suit. \n\n                    For suit m: [1m] -> we need two more: 2m and 3m? but we can only draw one. Then we can form [1m,2m,?] but we don't have 3m. Or [0m,1m,2m] is invalid. Similarly, for suit p: [2p] -> we can form [1p,2p,3p] by drawing 1p and 3p? but that's two. Or [0p,1p,2p] invalid.\n\n                    So no one-draw solution.\n\n                Therefore, the answer for [1m,2p,3s] is 2.\n\n            However, note: we can form a shuntsu in a suit that we don't have any tile? Then we need three draws (one for each tile). So that is worse.\n\n            So the minimal is two.\n\n            Therefore, two draws condition:\n\n                Either:\n\n                    a) We can form a koutsu by drawing two tiles (if we have exactly one tile of a kind).\n\n                    b) We can form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles (if we have at least one tile in the suit we are going to use, and then we complete the consecutive triple by drawing two more; OR if we have no tile in the suit, then we can still form a consecutive triple by drawing three, but that is three draws, so not minimal).\n\n                Actually, for shuntsu with two draws, we require that we have at least one tile in the suit of the consecutive triple we are going to form.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to choose any two tiles. So we can choose two tiles arbitrarily. We don't have to stick to the same suit? Actually, the consecutive triple must be in the same suit.\n\n            Therefore, if we have at least one tile in a suit, we can form a consecutive triple in that suit by drawing two more (if we don't have two consecutive numbers already, then we can complete the entire triple from scratch by drawing two, but wait: we have one tile, say x. Then we can form [x-2, x-1, x] by drawing x-2 and x-1, or [x, x+1, x+2] by drawing x+1 and x+2. But note: the consecutive triple must be three consecutive numbers.\n\n            However, we must consider the boundaries: numbers from 1 to 9.\n\n            So the two draws condition is satisfied if:\n\n                Condition for koutsu: There exists a tile (same suit and same number) that appears exactly once (so we can draw two more).\n\n                Condition for shuntsu: There exists a suit S such that the hand has at least one tile of suit S, and we can form a consecutive triple (a,a+1,a+2) in suit S by drawing two tiles (meaning that two of the three numbers are missing, but we can draw the two missing ones). \n\n            However, note: we might have two tiles of the same suit, but not consecutive. Then we can complete the consecutive triple by drawing one or two. But wait, we are checking two draws. Actually, we are trying to cover all possibilities.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think: the minimal number of draws is the minimum number of tiles to add so that there exists a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n            We can also consider:\n\n                Let f(0) = 0 if there is already a mentsu, else we check 1, then 2.\n\n            But note: sometimes we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles even if we have duplicates? Actually, no: if we have duplicates, then one draw is enough for koutsu (if two) or for shuntsu (if two consecutive and one missing). \n\n            Therefore, we can summarize:\n\n                Let hand = [t1, t2, t3]\n\n                Step 0: Check for 0 draws.\n\n                    - Koutsu: any tile repeated three times? (count(t) >=3 for any tile)\n\n                    - Shuntsu: any three tiles (distinct) in the same suit with consecutive numbers (sorted, the numbers form an arithmetic progression of difference 1).\n\n                Step 1: Check for 1 draw",
