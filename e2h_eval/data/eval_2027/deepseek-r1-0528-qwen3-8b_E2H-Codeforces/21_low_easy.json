The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes with even numbers and odd numbers.\n   Keys with even numbers and odd numbers.\n\n The condition for matching is:\n   - An even chest must be matched with an odd key (since even + odd = odd).\n   - An odd chest must be matched with an even key (since odd + even = odd).\n\n However, note that if we have two even keys and two odd chests, we can use the even keys only on the odd chests, but if we have more chests of one type than the other, we cannot use all.\n\n Actually, we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem, but note the constraints (n, m up to 10^5). We cannot do a general bipartite matching algorithm (like Hopcroft–Karp or DFS-based) because the graph is too large.\n\n But observe: \n   Let E_c = count of even chests\n   Let O_c = count of odd chests\n\n   Let E_k = count of even keys\n   Let O_k = count of odd keys\n\n Then, the even chests can only be matched with odd keys, and odd chests can only be matched with even keys.\n\n So the maximum number of chests we can open is at most min(E_c, O_k) [for even chests] + min(O_c, E_k) [for odd chests]? \n\n However, wait: we have two independent sets. But note that the same key cannot be used twice. So we have two separate bipartite matchings:\n\n   Matching1: even_chests (E_c) with odd_keys (O_k)\n   Matching2: odd_chests (O_c) with even_keys (E_k)\n\n And the total matching is the sum of the two, but we are constrained by the available keys. However, the two sets of keys are disjoint (even keys and odd keys are distinct). So the entire set of keys is partitioned.\n\n But note: we cannot use an even key for an even chest. Similarly for odd.\n\n However, there is no direct conflict between the two matchings because the keys used in the first matching (odd keys) are distinct from the keys used in the second matching (even keys). \n\n But wait, what if we have a limited number of odd keys? Then we can use at most min(E_c, O_k) from the even-chest part. Similarly, we can use at most min(O_c, E_k) from the odd-chest part.\n\n Then the total chests opened would be min(E_c, O_k) + min(O_c, E_k).\n\n However, let's check with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \"5 4\", then chests [9,14,6,2,11] -> \n        even chests: 14,6,2 -> count=3\n        odd chests: 9,11 -> count=2\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> \n        even keys: 8,4,20 -> count=3\n        odd keys: 7 -> count=1\n\n   Then according to the above:\n        min(3, 1) = 1 (from even chests using odd keys)\n        min(2, 3) = 2 (from odd chests using even keys)\n        total = 3 -> matches the sample output.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\", chests [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E_c=5, O_c=0.\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> E_k=0, O_k=1.\n\n   Then: min(5, 1) = 1, min(0,0)=0 -> total=1.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\", chests [10] -> even -> E_c=1, O_c=0.\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0.\n\n   Then: min(1,0)=0, min(0,4)=0 -> total=0.\n\n So the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the list of chests (n integers).\n   Step 3: Read the list of keys (m integers).\n\n   Step 4: Count:\n        even_chest = number of chests with a_i % 2 == 0\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = number of keys with b_j % 2 == 0\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   Step 5: result = min",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each pair (chest and key) meets the condition that their sum is odd. This means even-numbered chests must be paired with odd-numbered keys, and odd-numbered chests must be paired with even-numbered keys.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd chests and keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is constrained by the smaller of these two groups:\n   - The number of even chests can be matched with the number of odd keys (but not exceeding the total available odd keys).\n   - The number of odd chests can be matched with the number of even keys (but not exceeding the total available even keys).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves simple counting and arithmetic operations to determine the maximum possible matches without needing complex graph algorithms or bipartite matching, thus optimizing for efficiency with O(n + m) time complexity.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once to count their parity (even or odd), resulting in linear time complexity O(n + m), which is optimal for the given constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n            \n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n            \n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective values.\n2. **Counting Parity**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even-numbered. The remaining are considered odd-numbered.\n3. **Matching Calculation**: The solution calculates the maximum possible matches by taking the minimum between the number of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the number of odd chests and even keys. These two values are summed to get the total number of chests that can be opened.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two minimum values calculated earlier.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages simple arithmetic and counting to solve the problem within optimal time complexity, ensuring it handles the upper constraint limits effectively.",
