There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^18) and we need to compute the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\n The tournament is single elimination (knockout). The rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one has played differs by no more than one from the other.\n\n However, note that the winner must win all his games. The problem is to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Observation:\n In a standard single-elimination tournament with n players, the winner plays in log2(n) games (if n is a power of two). But the twist is the arrangement rule and we are allowed to arrange the grid arbitrarily (as long as the rule holds).\n\n How to think?\n We want the winner to play as many games as possible. Let the winner be player 1.\n\n Let f(k) be the maximum number of players that can have a tournament where the winner plays k games, satisfying the condition.\n\n How do we build the tournament?\n\n Condition for matches: when scheduling a match, the two players must have played a number of games that differ by at most one.\n\n We can model the tournament as having rounds, but the key is that the winner must be in a position to accumulate wins.\n\n Another idea: consider the structure of the tournament. The winner must win k games. This means the tournament must have at least 2^k leaves (the initial players) and the total number of players must be at least the number of players required to have a path of k wins.\n\n However, note that the rule might allow a different grouping. Let's break down:\n\n After k wins, the winner has played k games. The condition for the matches along his path must be satisfied.\n\n Consider the condition when scheduling the matches for the winner:\n\n - Before the first game, both players (the winner and the opponent) have 0 games. So they can play.\n - Then, after the first win, the winner has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent must have either 0, 1, or 2? But wait, the rule says the two players must have numbers of games differing by at most one.\n\n However, note that the winner must play k consecutive games. The opponents in the k-th game must have been built from subtrees that satisfy the condition.\n\n Alternatively, we can use recursion or dynamic programming to define the maximum number of players that can be arranged so that the winner can play k games.\n\n Let F(k) = the minimum number of players needed to have a tournament where the winner plays exactly k games and the condition is satisfied.\n\n How to form the tournament for k games?\n\n The winner must win k games. The last game (the k-th) is against an opponent who has either k-1 or k-2 games (but note: the condition is that the two players' games differ by at most one). However, we want to maximize the number of games the winner plays, so we need to arrange the entire tournament so that the winner's path is as long as possible.\n\n Actually, we want to compute the maximum k such that there exists a tournament with n players and the winner plays k games.\n\n Let's define:\n   Let T(k) = the minimum number of players needed to have a tournament where the winner plays k games (and the condition holds).\n\n Base case:\n   k = 0: 0 players? Not really. We need at least 1 player. But actually, the tournament starts with at least 2 players for a game. However, if we consider the winner without any game, then we don't have a tournament? So perhaps we start from k=1.\n\n   For k=1: we need 2 players.\n\n   For k=2: the winner must win two games. The first game: the winner beats someone (so we have 3 players: the winner and two others). But wait, the second game: the winner must play against a player that has either 1 or 0 games. However, the opponent in the second game must come from a subtree. How many players do we need?\n\n   Let me think recursively:\n\n   To have the winner play k games, the entire tournament must be structured so that:\n\n   - The first k-1 games are played by the winner, and the k-th game is the final.\n\n   But the condition applies to every match.\n\n   We can consider two cases for the k-th game:\n\n   Case 1: The opponent in the k-th game has played k-1 games (then the winner must have played k-1 as well, so the two are equal).\n   Case 2: The opponent in the k-th game has played k-2 games (then the winner has k-1 and the opponent k-2, which is a difference of one).\n\n   However, we are trying to minimize the total number of players. We can also consider that the winner's path is built from",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a single-elimination tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the winner must win all their games, and the tournament structure must adhere to the given rule. The challenge is to maximize the number of games the winner plays without violating the rule.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players \\( n \\) is at least the minimum number of players required for a tournament where the winner plays \\( k \\) games. This minimum number of players for \\( k \\) games can be derived by considering a balanced binary tree structure where each level corresponds to a game round.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the maximum \\( k \\). For each candidate \\( k \\), we calculate the minimum number of players needed (denoted as `min_players`) which is \\( 2^k - 1 \\). However, due to the specific constraints of the problem, we adjust this calculation to account for the tournament's structure more accurately.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The binary search operates in \\( O(\\log n) \\) time since the search space is from 1 to \\( n \\), and each check involves logarithmic calculations. This ensures the solution is efficient even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    low = 1\n    high = n\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        # Calculate the minimal number of players needed for k = mid\n        if mid == 1:\n            min_players = 2\n        else:\n            min_players = (1 << (mid - 1)) * (1 << (mid - 1)) + (1 << (mid - 1)) * (1 << (mid - 1))\n            # Simplify the above: actually, the minimal players for k games is 2^k + 2^(k-1) - 1? \n            # But note: our earlier reasoning was that the minimal players for k games is 2^k + 2^(k-1) - 1? \n            # Actually, let me recompute: \n            # For k=1: 2 players\n            # For k=2: 3 + 1? No, let's think differently.\n            # Alternatively, we can compute the minimal players for k games as follows:\n            # The winner plays k games, so he needs k opponents. Each opponent comes from a subtree.\n            # The minimal configuration is a complete binary tree with k levels, but adjusted for the condition.\n            # After reconsideration, the standard way is to use the formula: (2^k - 1) but that doesn't fit the condition.\n            # Actually, the minimal number of players for k games is 2^k + 2^(k-1) - 1? \n            # Let's derive: \n            # For k=1: 2 players -> 2^1 + 2^0 - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2. Correct.\n            # For k=2: 3 + 1? Wait, 2^2 + 2^1 - 1 = 4 + 2 - 1 = 5. But we know for 2 games, minimal players is 3 (since the winner must beat two players, and those two must have played one game each, so total players: winner + two others, but then the two others must have been scheduled properly. Actually, in a standard single elimination, 4 players are needed for 2 wins (two rounds). But wait, the problem allows non-standard scheduling? \n            # The problem says: two players can play if their game counts differ by at most one. \n            # So for k=2, we can have:\n            #   Round1: Player1 vs Player2 (Player1 wins)\n            #   Then, we need a second opponent for Player1. But how many players total? We can have three players: \n            #   - In the first game, Player1 beats Player2 (now Player1 has 1 win).\n            #   - Now, for the second game, Player1 must play against someone who has either 0 or 1 wins. The only other player is Player3, who hasn't played any game. So they can play (difference is 1). \n            #   Thus, with 3 players, the winner can play 2 games. \n            # So the minimal players for k=2 is 3.\n            # How about k=3?\n            #   We need at least 5 players? \n            #   - First game: Player1 vs Player2 -> Player1 wins (1 win)\n            #   - Second game: Player1 vs Player3 -> Player1 wins (2 wins)\n            #   - Now, for the third game, Player1 must play against someone who has either 1 or 2 wins. The remaining players are 4 and 5 (each with 0 wins). But wait, the difference between Player1's 2 wins and the opponent's 0 wins is 2, which violates the rule. \n            #   So we need to ensure that the opponent in the third game has at least 1 or 2 wins. \n            #   We can arrange the tournament differently:\n            #   - Round1: Player1 vs Player2, Player3 vs Player4 -> winners (say Player1 and Player3) meet in the next round.\n            #   - Round2: Player1 vs Player3 -> Player1 wins (2 wins)\n            #   - Now, we need a third opponent for Player1. We have Player5 (0 wins). But again, difference is 2. \n            #   Alternatively, we can have:\n            #   - Round1: Player1 vs Player2, Player3 vs Player4, Player5 vs Player6 (if we have 6 players)\n            #   - Round2: Player1 vs Player3, Player5 vs Player6 -> say Player1 and Player5 win.\n            #   - Round3: Player1 vs Player5 -> Player1 wins (3 wins)\n            #   But with 6 players, the winner plays 3 games. Is 6 the minimal? \n            #   Let's try with 5 players:\n            #   - Round1: Player1 vs Player2, Player3 vs Player4, and Player5 sits out? But then we have two winners (Player1 and Player3) for the next round.\n            #   - Round2: Player1 vs Player3 -> Player1 wins (2 wins)\n            #   - Now, we need a third game for Player1. The remaining player is Player5 (0 wins). The difference is 2, which is not allowed. \n            #   So minimal players for k=3 is 6.\n            #   Pattern:\n            #       k=1: 2\n            #       k=2: 3\n            #       k=3: 6\n            #   It seems the minimal players for k games is \\( 2^k + 2^{k-1} - 1 \\) for k>=2? \n            #       k=2: 4 + 2 - 1 = 5 -> but we saw 3 is enough. So that formula is not matching.\n            #\n            # Let me try to derive the minimal players for k games:\n            #   In the first game, the winner plays one game. Then, to play a second game, there must be another player who hasn't played any game (so that the difference is 1). Then, for the third game, the opponent must have played either 1 or 2 games. \n            #   We can model it as:\n            #       Level 1 (first round): 2^(k-1) games? Not exactly.\n            #\n            # After reading the problem examples and constraints, note that the sample input 10 gives output 4. \n            #   For n=10, the answer is 4. \n            #   What is the minimal players for k=4? \n            #       k=1: 2\n            #       k=2: 3\n            #       k=3: 6\n            #       k=4: ? \n            #   According to the example, with 10 players, the winner can play 4 games. \n            #   The minimal players for k=4 should be less than or equal to 10. \n            #   Let's assume the minimal players for k games is given by the recurrence:\n            #       T(k) = 2*T(k-1) + 1\n            #   But T(1)=2, T(2)=5, T(3)=11, T(4)=23... but that does not match the example.\n            #\n            # Another approach: \n            #   The winner must play k games. The total number of players must be at least the sum of the players in the subtrees of the winner's path. \n            #   The structure resembles a binary tree where each node (game) has two children (players advancing). But the condition restricts the balance of the tree.\n            #   The minimal number of players for k games is actually the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number? \n            #   Let's list minimal players for k:\n            #       k=1: 2\n            #       k=2: 3\n            #       k=3: 5\n            #       k=4: 9\n            #   Then the pattern is: 2, 3, 5, 9 -> which is similar to Fibonacci but not exactly.\n            #   Alternatively, consider that the minimal players for k games is \\( 2^k + 2^{k-1} \\) for k>=1? \n            #       k=1: 2 + 1 = 3 -> not 2.\n            #\n            # Let me look at the example outputs:\n            #   Input: 2 -> Output: 1 (k=1)\n            #   Input: 3 -> Output: 2 (k=2)\n            #   Input: 4 -> Output: 2 (k=2)\n            #   Input: 10 -> Output: 4 (k=4)\n            #\n            # How did they get 4 for 10? \n            #   With 10 players, the winner can play up to 4 games. \n            #   The minimal players for k=4 is 10? Actually, the problem states that the tournament has n players, and we want the maximum k such that the tournament can be arranged with n players.\n            #\n            # After careful thought, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is:\n            #   T(1) = 2\n            #   T(2) = 3\n            #   T(3) = 7  (because with 7 players, the winner can play 3 games: \n            #           Round1: two games (players 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4) -> winners 1 and 3\n            #           Round2: 1 vs 3, and then 5 vs 6 (but wait, we have only 7 players, so after two games in round1, we have three winners including the winner of 5 vs 6?

Correct.\n            #\n            # Therefore, the solution is to find the maximum integer k such that k*(k+1)//2 <= n.\n            # This is equivalent to solving the quadratic inequality: k^2 + k - 2*n <= 0.\n            # The positive root is (-1 + sqrt(1+8*n))/2.\n            # So k_max = floor((-1 + sqrt(1+8*n))/2)\n            #\n            # But note: the quadratic equation for the triangular number T_k = k*(k+1)/2.\n            # We want the maximum k with T_k <= n.\n            # So k_max = floor((-1 + sqrt(1+8*n))/2)\n            #\n            # However, let's test with n=10: \n            #   discriminant = 1 + 80 = 81, sqrt(81)=9, then (-1+9)/2=4.0 -> floor is 4.

Correct.\n            #\n            # So the solution is to compute k = floor((-1 + sqrt(1+8*n))/2)\n            #\n            # However, note that the triangular number condition exactly matches the examples. The reason is that the tournament structure resembles a triangular arrangement where each round requires a certain number of players, and the maximum number of games the winner can play is limited by the triangular number constraint.\n\n    # Therefore, we can solve by:\n    #   k_max = floor((-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * n)) / 2)\n    #\n    # But note: the input n can be as large as 10^18, so we need to use floating point carefully, but the square root of 8e18 is about 2.8e9, which is within the precision of double for integers up to around 10^15, but 10^18 might be pushing the limits.

This is derived from the tournament structure where each game the winner participates in requires a certain number of players, leading to a triangular arrangement. The solution efficiently computes \\( k \\) using the quadratic formula and integer square root to handle very large values of \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)) without resorting to iterative methods that would be computationally expensive. The final result is printed as the maximum number of games the winner can play.",
