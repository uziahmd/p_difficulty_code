The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes:\n        Even: E_chest = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 0]\n        Odd: O_chest = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 1]\n\n   Keys:\n        Even: E_key = [x for x in b if x % 2 == 0]\n        Odd: O_key = [x for x in b if x % 2 == 1]\n\n Note: \n   - An even chest requires an odd key.\n   - An odd chest requires an even key.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite matching problems:\n\n   Problem 1: Match even chests with odd keys.\n   Problem 2: Match odd chests with even keys.\n\n However, note that the same key cannot be used twice. But observe: the sets of keys for even and odd are disjoint (because even keys are used for odd chests and odd keys for even chests). So the two matchings do not interfere.\n\n Then the total number of chests we can open is the sum of the maximum matching in these two bipartite graphs? \n\n But wait: the problem is that we have two separate sets and we cannot use a key twice. However, the keys are partitioned into two sets (even and odd) and so are the chests. Therefore, the two bipartite graphs are independent.\n\n However, note that the condition for matching is just based on parity. The actual numbers don't matter for the matching condition (only parity). Therefore, we can model this as:\n\n   Graph 1: Chestes_even (left nodes) and Keys_odd (right nodes) -> complete bipartite graph (since any even chest can be matched with any odd key, and vice versa for the other graph).\n\n BUT: Actually, the condition is only on parity, so every even chest can be matched with every odd key, and every odd chest with every even key. \n\n However, we are limited by the counts. This is a bipartite graph with no edges missing between the two sets (except the fact that we cannot use a key more than once). Therefore, the maximum matching in a complete bipartite graph between two sets is min(|left|, |right|).\n\n So:\n\n   Matching1 = min(len(E_chest), len(O_key))\n   Matching2 = min(len(O_chest), len(E_key))\n\n Then the answer is Matching1 + Matching2.\n\n Let's check with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4; a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]; b = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14 -> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11 -> odd\n\n        E_chest = [14,6,2] -> count=3\n        O_chest = [9,11] -> count=2\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20 -> even\n\n        E_key = [8,4,20] -> count=3\n        O_key = [7] -> count=1\n\n   Then:\n        Matching1 = min(3, 1) = 1   [matching even chests with odd keys: 3 even chests but only 1 odd key -> 1 chest]\n        Matching2 = min(2, 3) = 2   [matching odd chests with even keys: 2 odd chests and 3 even keys -> 2 chests]\n\n        Total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> E_chest=5, O_chest=0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> E_key=0, O_key=1\n\n   Matching1 = min(5,1)=1\n   Matching2 = min(0,0)=0\n   Total = 1 -> matches example.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   Chest: [10] -> even -> E_chest=1, O_chest=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_key=4, O_key=0\n\n   Matching1 = min(1,0)=0\n   Matching2 = min(0,4)=0\n   Total = 0 -> matches example.\n\n However, wait: in example 3, the chest is even and the keys are even. But the condition requires odd sum. Since even + even = even -> not odd. So indeed, no matching.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Read n, m\n   Read list a of n integers\n   Read list b of m integers\n\n   Count the number of even and odd in a and b.\n\n   Then:\n        matching1 = min(count_even_chests, count_odd_keys)\n        matching2 = min(count_odd_chests, count_even_keys)\n\n   Print matching1 + matching2\n\n But note: we defined:\n        E_chest: even numbers in a -> count_even_chests\n        O_chest: odd numbers in a -> count_odd_chests\n        E_key: even numbers in b -> count_even_keys\n        O_key: odd numbers in b -> count_odd_keys\n\n So we can do:\n\n   count_even_chests = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n   count_odd_chests = n - count_even_chests\n\n   count_even_keys = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n   count_odd_keys = m - count_even_keys\n\n Then compute.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints are up to 10^5, so counting is efficient.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and vice versa. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys based on parity (even or odd). An even-numbered chest must be matched with an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest must be matched with an even-numbered key. Each key and chest can be used at most once.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting the number of even and odd numbered chests and keys separately. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches for each parity combination (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each chest and key exactly once to count their parities, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    count_even_chest = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            count_even_chest += 1\n            \n    count_odd_chest = n - count_even_chest\n    \n    count_even_key = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            count_even_key += 1\n            \n    count_odd_key = m - count_even_key\n    \n    matching1 = min(count_even_chest, count_odd_key)\n    matching2 = min(count_odd_chest, count_even_key)\n    \n    result = matching1 + matching2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking each number's parity.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of matches for even chests with odd keys is the minimum of the counts of even chests and odd keys. Similarly, the maximum matches for odd chests with even keys is the minimum of the counts of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Output Result**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two match counts, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to determine the optimal number of chests to open, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.",
