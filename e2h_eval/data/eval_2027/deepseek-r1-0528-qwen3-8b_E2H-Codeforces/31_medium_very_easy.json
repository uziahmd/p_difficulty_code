Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers.\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer between -x and x (inclusive) to make the total sum zero.\n\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n Then we need to find a set of k cards (each card's absolute value <= x) such that the sum of these k cards is -S.\n\n We want the minimum k (nonnegative integer) for which there exists k numbers (each in [-x, x]) that add up to -S.\n\n Note: The problem allows infinitely many cards of each integer from -x to x.\n\n Observation:\n 1. If S == 0, then we don't need any additional cards -> answer 0.\n 2. Otherwise, we are allowed to choose k cards. The maximum absolute value of a card is x, so the maximum positive sum we can get from k cards is k*x, and similarly the maximum negative is -k*x.\n\n Conditions for k:\n   We require that | -S | <= k*x, i.e., k >= ceil(|S| / x)\n\n However, note that we might not need to achieve the exact sum with k being only the minimal k from the above? But wait, we have the freedom to choose any integers in [-x,x]. Actually, the necessary condition is that the absolute value of the target (-S) must be <= k*x.\n\n But is that sufficient? Actually, by the coin problem (or Frobenius number) for multiple denominations, note that we have all integers from -x to x. However, we are allowed to use k cards and we can choose any integers in that range. The key is: we can form any integer T (with T being the sum of k cards) such that T is between -k*x and k*x, and also T must have the same parity as k*x? Not exactly, because we can choose both positive and negative arbitrarily. Actually, we can form any integer T in the interval [-k*x, k*x] as long as we have enough cards? \n\n But note: we are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. This set is symmetric and includes 0. Actually, with k=1, we can form any integer from -x to x. With k=2, we can form from -2x to 2x, but note that if we use two cards, the smallest sum is -2x and the largest 2x. However, are there gaps? For example, with x=2 and k=2, can we form 1? Yes: 2 and -1, or 1 and 0, etc. Actually, we can form every integer in the range [-2x, 2x] because the set of integers from -2 to 2 includes every integer from -4 to 4? Wait, no: with two cards of maximum 2, the possible sums are from -4 to 4, but we can form every integer in between because we can adjust by 1s. However, note that we have all integers from -x to x. So with k cards, we can form every integer from -k*x to k*x (because the set of numbers is contiguous and we can adjust by 1). Actually, this is true for k>=1 and x>=1: because the set {-x, -x+1, ..., x} is contiguous. Then, by the theory of linear combinations, since we have consecutive integers, we can form any integer in the interval [min_sum, max_sum] (which is [-k*x, k*x]) as long as k>=1.\n\n Therefore, the condition is: we can achieve the target T = -S if and only if |T| <= k*x.\n\n Then the minimal k is the smallest nonnegative integer k such that |S| <= k*x.\n\n However, note: what if S is negative? Then T = -S is positive, so condition is still |S| <= k*x.\n\n But wait: there is a catch. What if we can use fewer cards by not necessarily using the maximum absolute value per card? The condition above is necessary and sufficient because the entire set of integers from -x to x is available, and we can use k cards to get any integer between -k*x and k*x.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the smallest k (an integer >=0) satisfying k*x >= |S|, i.e., k = ceil(|S| / x) if |S|>0, but note: if |S|==0, k=0.\n\n However, let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n   n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> S = -1+1+2 = 2.\n   Then k must satisfy k*2 >= 2 -> k>=1. So answer 1.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n   n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> S = -4.\n   Then k must satisfy k*3 >= 4 -> k>= ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. So answer 2.\n\n However, note: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer from -x to x arbitrarily.\n\n But wait: what if we can use 0? Then sometimes we might break the sum into smaller steps. However, the condition above holds because we are allowed to use zeros. But zeros don't change the sum. So the minimal k is indeed ceil(|S|/x).\n\n However, consider: we might be able to use more than one card to achieve the same effect with a smaller k? No, because k is the number of cards and we require the absolute value of the total of the new cards to be at least |S|. And the maximum absolute value we can get with k cards is k*x, so we need k*x >= |S|.\n\n But note: there is a possibility that we can use negative and positive numbers to cancel out without needing to reach the full |S|? Actually, no: we are required to make the entire sum zero. The current sum is S, so we need the new cards to sum to -S. The magnitude of the new cards' sum must be at least |S| (in absolute value) and we can only add numbers that are bounded by x in absolute value.\n\n Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |S|.\n\n However, note: k must be at least 0. If S==0, then k=0.\n\n But wait: what if |S| is very large? Actually, the problem states that the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value, and n<=1000, x<=1000, so the maximum |S| is at most 1000*1000 = 1000000. But note: k*x >= |S|, so k >= |S|/x. Since x>=1, k is at least |S| (if x=1) which is 1000000, which is acceptable to compute.\n\n However, we are guaranteed that the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value, but note: the sum S can be negative or positive.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Read n and x.\n  2. Read the list of n integers.\n  3. Compute S = sum(list)\n  4. Let T = abs(S)\n  5. If T == 0: print 0.\n  6. Else: k = ceil(T / x). But note: if T % x == 0 then k = T//x, else k = T//x + 1.\n\n However, note: we can use integer arithmetic. Since T and x are positive integers, we can do:\n\n   k = (T + x - 1) // x   [This is ceiling division for positive numbers]\n\n But wait: if T is divisible by x, then (T+x-1)//x = (T-1)//x + 1, which is T//x. Otherwise, it rounds up.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   k = (T - 1) // x + 1\n\n Example: T=2, x=2 -> (2-1)//2 + 1 = 1//2 + 1 = 0+1 = 1 -> correct.\n          T=4, x=3 -> (4-1)//3 + 1 = 3//3 + 1 = 1+1 = 2 -> correct.\n\n However, note: if T=0, then we don't use this, but we already handled T==0.\n\n But wait: what if T is 0? Then we don't enter this branch. So we are safe.\n\n However, note: there is an alternative scenario. What if the problem requires that we cannot use the same card twice? But the problem says \"infinitely many cards\", so we can use duplicates.\n\n But wait: what if the minimal k is not the ceiling of T/x? Consider: we are allowed to use any numbers from -x to x. But note: we are not limited by the sign. The minimal k is indeed the ceiling of T/x because:\n\n   In k cards, the maximum absolute value we can cover is k*x. So we require k*x >= T.\n\n But is that sufficient? Yes, because we can use k cards and assign the sum arbitrarily as long as the total is -S and the absolute value of the total is T (which is <= k*x). We can distribute the values arbitrarily (even with zeros) so that the sum is exactly -S.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   if S == 0: 0\n   else: ceil(|S|/x)\n\n However, wait: what if the current set of cards already has a sum that is zero? Then we don't need any card.\n\n But there is a catch: what if we can use negative and positive cards to cancel the sum? Actually, the problem is: we have the found cards, and we can add any number of cards (from the infinite set) to make the entire set have sum 0.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we use the minimal number of cards beyond the ones we found? Actually, we are counting the total cards we need to find. The input gives n found cards. We are going to add k more. So the total cards will be n+k, but the problem asks for the minimum number of cards to add (k).\n\n But wait: the example output for the first sample is 1, meaning we found 3 cards and we need to add 1. The second sample: we found 2 cards and we need to add 2.\n\n So our reasoning is correct.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\" (to make the sum equal to zero). So we are counting the additional cards.\n\n But note: the problem does not say \"minimum number of cards including the ones he found\". It just says \"the minimum number of cards does he need to find\", meaning the additional ones.\n\n Therefore, the answer is k (the minimal number of additional cards) = ceil(|S|/x) if S != 0, and 0 otherwise.\n\n However, there's a twist: what if the current set of cards already has a sum that is zero? Then we don't need to add any, so 0.\n\n But wait: what if the current set of cards doesn't have sum zero, but we can use negative and positive cards to cancel? Our reasoning above holds.\n\n But wait: consider the following: maybe we don't need to use the minimal k because we can use some of the found cards again? Actually, no: the problem says we are looking for cards (additional ones). The found cards are given and we cannot change them. We are only allowed to add more cards.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from  - x to x.\" So we are only concerned with the additional cards.\n\n But wait: what if we are allowed to remove some found cards? The problem doesn't say that. We are only adding.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Read n, x and the list of n integers.\n\n   S = sum(list)\n\n   if S == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        T = abs(S)\n        # k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= T\n        # k = ceil(T / x)\n        # Using integer arithmetic: \n        k = (T + x - 1) // x   # This is ceiling division for positive integers\n\n        # However, wait: what if T is 0? We already handled S==0, so T>0.\n\n        print(k)\n\n But wait: let me check with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: S=2, T=2, x=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n Example 2: S=-4, T=4, x=3 -> (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n However, wait: what if we have a fractional part? Let's try T=5, x=3: ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=3, x=3: (3+3-1)//3 = (5)//3 = 1 -> but 5//3 is 1 in integer floor division. However, 5//3 is 1, but we want ceil(3/3)=ceil(1)=1. Correct.\n\n Actually, the formula for ceiling division for positive integers a and b is: (a + b - 1) // b.\n\n However, note: if T=0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0, but we don't use that because we have the if S==0.\n\n But wait: what if S is negative? Then T is positive, so we are good.\n\n However, wait: what if S is negative? Then we use T = abs(S). So yes.\n\n But wait: there's an alternative: what if we can use the same card multiple times? But note the problem says \"infinitely many\", so we can.\n\n However, wait: there is a catch when the current sum S is not zero, but the minimal k might be achieved by a combination that doesn't use the maximum absolute value per card? Actually, the condition k*x >= |S| is necessary and sufficient, so we are correct.\n\n But wait: consider the following example: \n   n=1, x=1, found card = [1]. Then S=1, T=1, k = ceil(1/1)=1. We need one card: -1. So correct.\n\n Another example: n=2, x=1, found cards = [1,1]. Then S=2, T=2, k=ceil(2/1)=2. We need two cards: each -1. Correct.\n\n Another example: n=2, x=2, found cards = [1,1]. Then S=2, T=2, k=ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. So we need one card: -2. But wait, is that allowed? The card must be between -2 and 2, and -2 is allowed. Correct.\n\n However, consider: n=1, x=2, found card = [1]. Then S=1, T=1, k=ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1. So we need one card: -1. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if we have n=3, x=1, found cards = [1,1,1]. Then S=3, T=3, k=ceil(3/1)=3. We need three cards: each -1. Correct.\n\n However, wait: what if we have n=3, x=2, found cards = [1,1,1]. Then S=3, T=3, k=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Then we need two cards. But can we form 3 with two cards (each from -2 to 2)? The maximum positive from two cards is 4, so yes. But we need -3. The minimal absolute value per card is 1, so we can use two cards: -2 and -1 -> sum -3. That works. So k=2 is correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total = sum(arr)\n   if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        T = abs(total)\n        # Ceiling division: (T + x - 1) // x\n        k = (T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n However, wait: let me test with T=3, x=2: (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n But wait: what if T is 0? Then we have handled by the first condition.\n\n But wait: what if the sum is negative? Then T = abs(total) is positive, so we are good.\n\n However, there is an edge: if x is 1, then k = T (since (T+1-1)//1 = T//1 = T). So that's correct.\n\n But wait: what if x is larger than T? Then k=1. Because (T+x-1)//x = (T-1)//x + 1, and if T<=x, then (T-1)//x is 0, so k=1. That's correct: we can use one card (with value -T) because |T|<=x.\n\n Therefore, the code should be:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   if s == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        T = abs(s)\n        # We can write k = (T + x - 1) // x\n        k = (T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n However, wait: there is a catch. The problem does not require that the additional cards must be distinct. But we are using the fact that we can choose any integer from -x to x arbitrarily. So the above holds.\n\n But wait: what if we have a very large T? The problem constraints say n<=1000 and x<=1000, so T is at most 1000*1000 = 1000000, and x at least 1, so k is at most 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, wait: there's another way to think: sometimes we might need to use more than one card because the absolute value of the required sum might be too large for one card, but we are allowed to use multiple cards. The above formula gives the minimum k.\n\n But wait: what if the minimal k is 0? Then we don't need to add any card. We have that case.\n\n However, wait: what if the current sum is zero? Then we don't need to add any, so k=0.\n\n One more example: n=0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry about n=0.\n\n But wait: the input format: first line two integers n (>=1) and x (>=1). So we are safe.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. We are given n and then n integers.\n\n But note: the example input format: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n How do we read that?\n\n   data = input().split()\n   n = int(data[0]); x = int(data[1])\n\n   Then next line: input().split() for the list.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as a string in the example: \n      ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n But in the actual input, we'll get two lines.\n\n Let me run through the example:\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n        n=3, x=2, arr = [-1,1,2] -> s=2, T=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> output 1.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n        n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, T=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> output 2.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says the second sample output is 2.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings. In the problem, the input is two integers and then a list of n integers.\n\n However, I notice: the example input string is given as a single string with spaces and a newline. We are reading the first line and then the second line.\n\n So the code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n   if not data: \n        # no input, but guaranteed at least one line\n        pass\n\n   first_line = data[0].split()\n   n = int(first_line[0])\n   x = int(first_line[1])\n   arr = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n\n But the problem says the second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n But note: the input may have two lines. The first line is two integers, the second line is n integers.\n\n However, what if n=0? The problem says n>=1.\n\n So we can safely do:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n But wait: the problem says the second line contains n space-separated integers. So if n=1, then the second line has one integer.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n But wait: the problem says the first line: two integers n and x. Then the second line: n integers.\n\n However, the example input is:\n\n   \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n So:\n\n   first_line = \"3 2\" -> n=3, x=2.\n   second_line = \"-1 1 2\" -> three integers.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   s = sum(arr)\n\n   if s == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        T = abs(s)\n        k = (T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n But wait: wait! There is a flaw in the reasoning.\n\n Consider: what if we can use a combination of positive and negative numbers to cancel the sum with fewer cards? Actually, no: the condition is that the absolute value of the deficit (|S|) must be covered by the total absolute value of the new cards. But note: we are allowed to use negative and positive arbitrarily. However, the minimal number of cards is still determined by the fact that the total absolute value we can contribute from k cards is at most k*x (if we use all positive or all negative, we get the maximum absolute value). But wait, we can mix. However, the requirement is that the algebraic sum of the new cards is -S. The algebraic sum can be positive or negative, but the absolute value of the algebraic sum must be at least |S|, and we can only achieve an algebraic sum of up to k*x (in absolute value). \n\n However, note: the algebraic sum can be negative or positive, and we are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. The key is: we are not constrained by the absolute value of each card, but the algebraic sum must be exactly -S.\n\n But the condition is: the algebraic sum must be -S, and the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |S|.\n\n Why? Because even though we can use negative and positive, the total algebraic sum is bounded by the maximum absolute value we can assign to each card. However, the algebraic sum can be negative or positive arbitrarily, but the magnitude of the algebraic sum cannot exceed k*x. So the condition is necessary.\n\n But is it sufficient? Yes, because we can choose the cards arbitrarily. We need to achieve -S. We can use k cards. We can set k-1 cards to x and one card to -S - (k-1)*x, but wait: we must ensure that the last card is between -x and x. However, note that we are not limited to using only positive and then one negative. Actually, we can use any combination. The classic problem: represent T (which is -S) as the sum of k integers each between -x and x. The necessary and sufficient condition is that |T| <= k*x and k>=ceil(|T|/x). But note: we are allowed to use any integer, so we can break T arbitrarily as long as the absolute value of each term is at most x. \n\n However, the standard solution for representing an integer T as the sum of k integers (each between -x and x) is that |T| <= k*x. But wait, is that the only condition? Actually, yes, because we can adjust the signs arbitrarily. For example, if T is positive, we can use as many positive cards as needed (up to x) and then adjust with negative ones? Actually, no: we need the total to be T. But note, we can use negative cards to reduce the positive ones. However, the condition |T|<=k*x is necessary because the maximum absolute value we can get is k*x. And it is sufficient because we can use the following greedy-like method: \n\n   We want to form T (positive) with k cards. We can use at least ceil(T/x) cards if we use only positive, but we can use negative cards to adjust? Actually, no: negative cards would reduce the total. \n\n Let me reexamine: we want to form T (positive) as the sum of k integers, each in [-x, x]. We can use negative cards, but then we would need to compensate by having even more positive cards. However, the minimal k is still ceil(|T|/x). Why? \n\n Consider: if we use k cards, the maximum positive sum we can get is k*x. Similarly, the maximum negative is -k*x. So to get a positive T, we require T <= k*x. Also, the minimal k is the smallest k such that k*x >= T.\n\n But note: we can also use negative cards? How does that help? Actually, if we use a negative card, then we are subtracting from the positive total. So to get a positive T, we must have the positive part dominate. The condition remains: the total positive part must be at least T, and the negative part is arbitrary. However, we can also use a mix. But the condition is that the sum of the positive parts must be at least T and the negative parts can be anything as long as the total is T.\n\n Actually, we can break T arbitrarily as long as the total of the positive parts minus the total of the negative parts is T. And the positive parts are at most k*x and negative parts are at least -k*x, so the total is between -k*x and k*x.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the entire k*x. The condition is just that |T| <= k*x. \n\n However, consider: we are forming T (positive) as the sum of k integers. The minimal k is the smallest k such that k*x >= T. Because we can set k-1 cards to x and the last card to T - (k-1)*x, and we require that T - (k-1)*x <= x (so that the last card is not exceeding x). \n\n Condition: T - (k-1)*x <= x  => T <= k*x.\n\n But note: we are allowed to use negative cards as well. Actually, we don't need to use only positive. We can use a negative card and then compensate with a larger positive card? But wait, the maximum positive card is x. So if we use a negative card, then we must have at least one positive card that is x, and then the rest must account for the remaining T + (negative value). \n\n However, the condition k*x >= T is necessary and sufficient because:\n\n   - We can always represent T as the sum of k cards (each between -x and x) if |T| <= k*x.\n\n Why? We can use a greedy algorithm: \n\n   Let r = T.\n   We can use a card with value min(r, x) and then update r = r - min(r, x) and then proceed until k cards are used. But wait, we can also use negative cards. However, we are trying to form a positive T. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n   We are allowed to use any integers from -x to x. So we can represent any integer T in the range [-k*x, k*x] as the sum of k integers (each in [-x,x]). This is a known fact.\n\n Therefore, the minimal k is ceil(|S|/x).\n\n However, wait: what if T is negative? Then we need to form a negative sum. The condition is the same: |T| <= k*x, so k >= ceil(|T|/x).\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: there is a known issue: what if the deficit is 0? We handled that.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the cards can be positive, negative, and zero. So zeros are allowed. But zeros don't help in changing the sum. So we can ignore zeros.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   if s == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        T = abs(s)\n        # Ceiling division: (T + x - 1) // x\n        k = (T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n However, wait: let me test with the example that was given in the note: \n\n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> S=-4, T=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2 -> correct.\n\n   Another example: \"1 1\\n1\" -> S=1, T=1, k=(1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"1 10\\n5\" -> S=5, T=5, k=(5+10-1)//10 = (14)//10 = 1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 5\" -> S=10, T=10, k=(10+10-1)//10 = 19//10 = 1 -> wait, 19//10 is 1 in integer floor division, but ceil(10/10)=ceil(1)=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 6\" -> S=11, T=11, k=(11+10-1)//10 = 20//10=2 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 4\" -> S=9, T=9, k=(9+10-1)//10 = 18//10=1 -> wait, 18//10 is 1? But 9/10=0.9 -> ceil(0.9)=1, and 1*10>=9 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 3\" -> S=8, T=8, k=(8+10-1)//10=17//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 2\" -> S=7, T=7, k=(7+10-1)//10=16//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 1\" -> S=6, T=6, k=(6+10-1)//10=15//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 0\" -> S=5, T=5, k= (5+10-1)//10=14//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 -1\" -> S=4, T=4, k=(4+10-1)//10=13//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 -2\" -> S=3, T=3, k=(3+10-1)//10=12//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 -3\" -> S=2, T=2, k=(2+10-1)//10=11//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 -4\" -> S=1, T=1, k=(1+10-1)//10=10//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 -5\" -> S=0 -> then we print 0.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 -6\" -> S=-1, T=1, k= (1+10-1)//10=10//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 -10\" -> S=-5, T=5, k=(5+10-1)//10=14//10=1 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 10\" -> S=15, T=15, k=(15+10-1)//10=24//10=2 -> correct.\n\n   Example: \"2 10\\n5 11\" -> but wait, the input says the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. So if x=10, then 11 is invalid. But the problem guarantees that the numbers do not exceed x in absolute value.\n\n Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n However, wait: what if the deficit is very small, but we have to use at least one card because we cannot use zero? Actually, we are allowed to use zero. But note: if the deficit is not zero, we need to cancel it. We can use one card to cancel the deficit if the deficit is between -x and x. But note: the deficit is S, and we need to add cards to make the total sum 0. So the cards must sum to -S.\n\n Since we are allowed to use zeros, we can use zeros and then one card to cancel the deficit. But wait, zeros don't change the sum, so if we use zeros we still need to cancel the deficit. The minimal k is still ceil(|S|/x). \n\n But wait: zeros are allowed, but they don't help in reducing the deficit. So the minimal k is still determined by the deficit.\n\n However, note: we can use a card with value -S (if |S|<=x) then k=1. But if |S|<=x, then ceil(|S|/x)=ceil(a number between 0 and 1)=1. But wait: if |S|==0, then k=0. If |S|>0 and <=x, then k=ceil(|S|/x)=1.\n\n Example: |S|=0 -> 0 cards.\n          |S|>0 and <=x -> 1 card.\n\n But wait: what if |S| is 0.5? But note, S is an integer (because the cards have integers). So |S| is an integer.\n\n Therefore, we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if x is very large? Then k=ceil(|S|/x) becomes 1 if |S|>=1 and <=x, and 0 if |S|==0.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   if s == 0:\n        print(0)\n   else:\n        T = abs(s)\n        k = (T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\n However, wait: there is a known issue with the ceiling division formula for integers: \n\n   (T + x - 1) // x\n\n This formula works for positive T and x.\n\n But note: T is positive (we took absolute value) and x is positive.\n\n Therefore, we are good.\n\n But wait: what if T is 0? Then we don't use this branch.\n\n However, let me test with T=0: \n        k = (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (since x-1 < x) -> so if we accidentally didn't handle S==0, then we would print 0 for T=0, which is correct. But we already handled S==0.\n\n But wait, what if S!=0 but T=abs(S)=0? Then S=0, so we don't enter the else. So no problem.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, x = map",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his found cards becomes zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x (inclusive). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be balanced by the sum of the additional cards. If the current sum of the found cards is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, the additional cards must sum to the negative of the current sum (i.e., -S, where S is the sum of the found cards).\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of additional cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the current sum divided by the maximum absolute value allowed on the cards (x). This is because each card can contribute at most ±x to the sum. Thus, the minimal number of cards needed is the smallest integer k such that k*x ≥ |S|.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the sum of the found cards. If the sum is zero, the answer is zero. Otherwise, compute the absolute value of the sum and use ceiling division to find the minimal number of cards required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total = sum(arr)\n    if total == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        T = abs(total)\n        k = (T + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line contains n integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the sum is zero, print 0 since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: For a non-zero sum, calculate the absolute value of the sum (T). The minimal number of additional cards (k) is found using ceiling division: `(T + x - 1) // x`. This formula ensures that k is the smallest integer such that k*x is at least T.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the computed value of k.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of additional cards required by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
