Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (each between 1 and 10) so the total points are at most 20.\n Then, R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n Conditions:\n - We need a perfect matching: each base gets one rebel and vice versa.\n - The straight paths from base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect (except at endpoints).\n\n Note: The problem says \"any two (straight) paths ... do not intersect in the galaxy plane\", meaning that the segments (from base to its assigned rebel) should not cross.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire set of points is in a particular order. But the condition is that the matching must be such that the segments drawn do not intersect.\n\n Important: The problem states that no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about degenerate cases.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since R and B are small (at most 10), we can try to use a combinatorial matching approach. But note: the condition on non-intersecting segments is geometric.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify which rebels and bases are connected. We have to assign each base to exactly one rebel and each rebel to exactly one base.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have R rebels and B bases. We need a bijection (matching) between the two sets of points such that the segments connecting each pair do not intersect with any other segment.\n\n 2. But note: the condition is that the entire set of segments (drawn from base to its matched rebel) must not have any two segments intersect (except at endpoints). However, observe that if two segments AB and CD (where A,B are base-rebel pairs) are drawn, they might intersect even if they are from different bases and different rebels.\n\n 3. However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning every two segments must not intersect. This is a very strong condition.\n\n Alternate interpretation: the entire set of segments must form a planar graph? Actually, the problem says \"do not intersect\" (in the galaxy plane). But note: the endpoints are distinct and the segments are between base and rebel. The condition is that no two segments (from two different pairs) should cross.\n\n 4. But wait: the problem does not require that the entire set of segments is drawn without crossing. It says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\".\n\n 5. Therefore, we must find a perfect matching (if R == B) such that the segments (edges) in the matching do not cross.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the matching is between all rebels and bases if R != B? Actually, the problem states: \n   \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\"\n\n So it requires a bijection only if R == B? Actually, the problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian\" and \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". Therefore, we must have R = B, otherwise there's no perfect matching.\n\n But wait, the example input: \n   First example: \"3 3 ...\" -> R=3, B=3, output Yes.\n   Second example: \"2 1 ...\" -> R=2, B=1, output No.\n\n So actually, we must check that R == B. If R != B, then output 'No'.\n\n However, the problem says: \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\", so the matching must be a bijection. Therefore, if R != B, there is no solution.\n\n But wait, the example input format: first line gives R and B, then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n So step 0: if R != B, then we output 'No'.\n\n Now, if R == B, we need to check if there exists a perfect matching (bijection) between the rebels and bases such that the segments connecting the pairs do not cross.\n\n How to check for non-crossing?\n\n Observation: In a set of non-crossing segments, the matching is non-crossing if and only if the segments do not cross. \n\n However, note: the problem does not specify an ordering of the points. But there is a known fact: in the plane, a set of non-crossing edges (with no three collinear) can be represented by matching the points in a certain order.\n\n Another idea: we can consider the two sets of points (rebels and bases) and then sort them by x-coordinate or y-coordinate and see if there is a matching that satisfies the condition.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following property: if we draw the segments without crossings, then the matching must be non-crossing. We can try to check all permutations? But R and B are up to 10,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each pair do not intersect. The solution involves checking two main conditions: whether the number of spaceships equals the number of bases, and if such a matching exists where no segments cross.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching Condition**: The first step is to verify if the number of spaceships (R) equals the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, it's impossible to form a perfect matching, and the answer is immediately \"No\".\n2. **Geometric Matching Check**: If R equals B, we proceed to check all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases. For each permutation, we verify if the segments connecting the base points to their assigned spaceship points intersect. This involves checking every pair of segments in the current matching to ensure they do not intersect.\n3. **Non-Intersecting Segments Check**: For any two segments (from two different pairs in the matching), we use the cross product method to determine if they intersect. The cross product helps in checking the relative orientation of three points, which is essential for determining if two line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    r = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    rebels = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(r):\n        x = float(data[index])\n        y = float(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for i in range(b):\n        x = float(data[index])\n        y = float(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if r != b:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    from itertools import permutations\n    n = r\n    \n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) >= (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n    \n    def do_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n        A, B = seg1\n        C, D = seg2\n        \n        if ccw(A, B, C) == 0 or ccw(A, B, D) == 0 or ccw(C, D, A) == 0 or ccw(C, D, B) == 0:\n            return False\n            \n        return (ccw(A, B, C) != ccw(A, B, D)) and (ccw(C, D, A) != ccw(C, D, B))\n        \n    found = False\n    for perm in permutations(range(n)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                base1 = bases[i]\n                base2 = bases[j]\n                rebel1 = rebels[perm[i]]\n                rebel2 = rebels[perm[j]]\n                seg1 = (base1, rebel1)\n                seg2 = (base2, rebel2)\n                if do_intersect(seg1, seg2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Perfect Matching Check**: If R does not equal B, the solution immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Cross Product Calculation**: The `ccw` function calculates the cross product to determine the orientation of three points, which helps in checking if segments intersect.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `do_intersect` function uses the cross product to check if two line segments intersect by verifying their orientations.\n5. **Permutation Check**: All possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases are checked. For each permutation, the solution verifies if any two segments intersect. If a valid permutation is found where no segments intersect, it outputs \"Yes\"; otherwise, it outputs \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible matchings while leveraging geometric properties to ensure non-intersecting segments, providing the correct solution for the given constraints.",
