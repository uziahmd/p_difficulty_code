During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.Neko has two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint the smallest non-negative integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the lowest common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible.If there are many possible integers $$$k$$$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 10', '21 31', '5 10']\n\n### Output\n['2', '9', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test, one should choose $$$k = 2$$$, as the least common multiple of $$$6 + 2$$$ and $$$10 + 2$$$ is $$$24$$$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a+k) and (b+k) is minimized. If multiple k give the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nLet d = a - b. Without loss of generality, assume a <= b, so we can set d = b - a (but note: if a > b, then we can swap and adjust accordingly). However, let's consider:\n\nWe have two numbers: x = a+k and y = b+k, so x-y = a-b (constant difference).\n\nWe know that LCM(x, y) * GCD(x, y) = x*y, so minimizing LCM(x,y) is equivalent to maximizing GCD(x,y) because the product x*y = (a+k)*(b+k) is not necessarily fixed (it increases with k) but the GCD might be.\n\nAlternatively, note that the LCM must be at least the maximum of (a+k) and (b+k). Also, the LCM must be divisible by the GCD.\n\nBut note: the condition for k is that k >= max(0, -min(a,b)) but since a,b>=1, k>=0.\n\nWe can also note that the problem is symmetric in the sense that we can assume without loss of generality that a<=b, and then consider the positive difference d = b - a (if a>b, then we swap and remember to take negative d? Actually, we can always consider d = |a-b|, but the signs matter.\n\nLet g = gcd(x, y) = gcd(a+k, b+k). Since x-y = a-b (if we let x = a+k, y = b+k, then x-y = a-b), then g divides (x-y) as well. So g divides |a-b|.\n\nTherefore, the gcd must be a divisor of |a-b|. \n\nSo we can consider all divisors of |a-b| (unless a==b, then |a-b|=0, then we have to handle separately).\n\nBut note: if a == b, then the two numbers are equal: x = y = a+k. Then LCM(a+k, a+k) = a+k. We want to minimize that. The smallest k is 0, because when k=0, LCM is a, and increasing k will make the LCM larger. So the answer is 0.\n\nNow, if a != b, let d = |a-b|. Then any common divisor g must divide d. Moreover, we require that g divides both (a+k) and (b+k). But note:\n\ng divides (a+k) and (b+k) => g divides (a+k) - (b+k) = a-b, so indeed g divides d.\n\nMoreover, for a divisor g (which divides d) to be the gcd of (a+k) and (b+k), we need that k is chosen so that:\n   (a+k) mod g == 0 and (b+k) mod g == 0.\n\nBut note: (a+k) mod g = (a mod g + k mod g) mod g, and similarly for b. However, we can also note that:\n\nSince g divides (a+k) and (b+k), then k ≡ (-a) mod g and k ≡ (-b) mod g. But note that since g divides (a-b), we have (-a) mod g and (-b) mod g must be the same? Actually, because (a-b) is divisible by g, then a ≡ b (mod g). Therefore, the condition is just k ≡ (-a) mod g (and equivalently k ≡ (-b) mod g).\n\nSo for a fixed divisor g of d, the k must satisfy k ≡ r (mod g), where r = (-a) mod g (which can be written as (g - a % g) % g, but note: we can also write k = t*g + r0, where r0 is the smallest non-negative residue of (-a) mod g, i.e., r0 = (g - a % g) % g, but wait: actually, we can write k ≡ (-a) mod g, so k = m*g - a, but then k must be non-negative. Alternatively, we can set k_min = (-a) % g, but then if (-a) % g is negative, we adjust? Actually, the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers: \n\nWe can compute r0 = (-a) % g, which gives the smallest non-negative remainder. Then k must be at least r0, and then k = r0, r0+g, r0+2g, etc.\n\nBut note: we cannot take k=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is minimized. If multiple values of \\( k \\) yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the difference between \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is constant (\\( |a - b| \\)). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) must be a divisor of this constant difference. Therefore, we can consider all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) (or handle the case when \\( a = b \\) separately).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\), we determine the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\). This \\( k \\) is derived from the congruence relation \\( k \\equiv (-a) \\mod g \\). The LCM for such a \\( k \\) can then be computed, and we keep track of the minimal LCM encountered.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - If \\( a = b \\), the minimal LCM is achieved at \\( k = 0 \\).\n   - Otherwise, for each divisor \\( g \\) of \\( |a - b| \\):\n     - Compute the smallest non-negative \\( k \\) satisfying \\( k \\equiv (-a) \\mod g \\).\n     - Calculate the LCM of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\).\n     - Track the minimal LCM and the corresponding smallest \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of divisors of \\( |a - b| \\) is \\( O(\\sqrt{|a - b|}) \\), which is efficient given the constraints (since \\( |a - b| \\) can be up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    d = abs(a - b)\n    divisors = set()\n    i = 1\n    while i * i <= d:\n        if d % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n        i += 1\n        \n    best_k = 0\n    best_lcm = (a + b + abs(a - b)) // gcd(a + b + abs(a - b), 1)\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        r = (-a) % g\n        k_candidate = r\n        x = a + k_candidate\n        y = b + k_candidate\n        current_lcm = abs(x * y) // gcd(x, y)\n        if current_lcm < best_lcm:\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n        else:\n            if current_lcm == best_lcm:\n                if k_candidate < best_k:\n                    best_k = k_candidate\n                    \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from standard input.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If \\( a \\) equals \\( b \\), the answer is immediately \\( 0 \\) since the LCM of any number with itself is the number itself, and \\( k = 0 \\) minimizes it.\n3. **Divisor Calculation**: For \\( a \\neq b \\), the code calculates all divisors of \\( |a - b| \\). These divisors are potential candidates for the GCD of \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\).\n4. **Finding Minimal LCM**: For each divisor \\( g \\), the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( g \\) divides both \\( a+k \\) and \\( b+k \\) is found using the congruence relation \\( k \\equiv (-a) \\mod g \\). The LCM for this \\( k \\) is computed and compared to the current minimal LCM, updating the best \\( k \\) whenever a smaller LCM is found or a smaller \\( k \\) yields the same LCM.\n5. **Output**: The smallest \\( k \\) that minimizes the LCM is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking divisors of the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), leveraging mathematical properties to avoid brute-force checks and ensure optimal performance.",
