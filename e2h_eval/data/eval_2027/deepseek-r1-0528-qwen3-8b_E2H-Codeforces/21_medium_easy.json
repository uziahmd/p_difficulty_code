The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes with even numbers and odd numbers.\n   Keys with even numbers and odd numbers.\n\n The condition for matching is:\n   - An even chest must be matched with an odd key (since even + odd = odd).\n   - An odd chest must be matched with an even key (since odd + even = odd).\n\n However, note that if we have two even keys and two odd chests, we can use the even keys only on the odd chests, but if we have more chests of one type than the other, we are limited by the number of keys of the opposite parity.\n\n But note: the matching is bipartite. We cannot use a key twice, so we need to consider:\n\n Let:\n   E_chest = number of chests with even numbers\n   O_chest = number of chests with odd numbers\n\n   E_key = number of keys with even numbers\n   O_key = number of keys with odd numbers\n\n Then, the maximum chests we can open is the minimum between:\n   - The number of even keys and odd chests (but wait, actually we can assign even keys to odd chests and odd keys to even chests independently? However, note that the total matching is constrained by the two independent sets.\n\n Actually, we have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n   Graph1: Even keys connected to Odd chests.\n   Graph2: Odd keys connected to Even chests.\n\n And the total matching is the sum of the two matchings.\n\n However, in each bipartite graph, the maximum matching is limited by the smaller side (if we assume we can match arbitrarily without any other constraints). But note: the two graphs use disjoint sets of keys and chests.\n\n So, the maximum matching from even keys to odd chests is min(E_key, O_chest) [but wait, actually we are not forced to use all keys, but we can use at most E_key keys and there are O_chest chests, so we can't use more than min(E_key, O_chest) in that part]?\n\n However, let me think: we have two separate constraints. The entire set of chests we can open is the union of two sets: \n   - Some odd chests (from Graph1) and some even chests (from Graph2)\n\n But note: the two sets are independent. However, the catch is that the same key cannot be used twice and the same chest cannot be opened twice.\n\n So, the maximum number of chests we can open is:\n\n   Let x = min(E_key, O_chest)   [this is the number of odd chests we can open via even keys]\n   Let y = min(O_key, E_chest)   [this is the number of even chests we can open via odd keys]\n\n Then the answer is x + y.\n\n But wait, is that correct? Consider: \n   We have two independent sets. The even keys can only open odd chests, and odd keys can only open even chests. There is no overlap in the chests they can open. So we can indeed do both simultaneously.\n\n Example from the first test case:\n   Input: \"5 4\", then chests [9,14,6,2,11], keys [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14-> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11-> odd\n\n   So, E_chest = 3 (14,6,2), O_chest = 2 (9,11)\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20-> even\n\n   E_key = 3 (8,4,20), O_key = 1 (7)\n\n   Then:\n        x = min(E_key, O_chest) = min(3,2) = 2\n        y = min(O_key, E_chest) = min(1,3) = 1\n        total = 3.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n Second example:\n   Input: \"5 1\", chests [2,4,6,8,10] (all even, so E_chest=5, O_chest=0)\n          keys [5] (odd, so E_key=0, O_key=1)\n\n   Then:\n        x = min(0,0)=0\n        y = min(1,5)=1\n        total=1.\n\n Third example:\n   Input: \"1 4\", chest [10] (even: E_chest=1, O_chest=0)\n          keys [20,30,40,50] (all even: E_key=4, O_key=0)\n\n   Then:\n        x = min(4,0)=0\n        y = min(0,1)=0\n        total=0.\n\n So the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, m.\n   Step 2: Read the list of n integers for chests.\n   Step 3: Read the list of m integers for keys.\n\n   Step 4: Count even and odd in chests and keys.\n\n   Step 5: Calculate:\n        part1 = min(count_even_keys, count_odd_chests)\n        part2 = min(count_odd_keys, count_even_chests)\n\n   Step 6: Print part1 + part2.\n\n However, wait: what if we have a chest that is even and a key that is even? They cannot be matched. Similarly, odd and odd cannot be matched. So the above separation is correct.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys, given that a key can only open a chest if the sum of their numbers is odd. This means one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if they have opposite parity (one even and one odd). Therefore, we can categorize both the chests and keys into even and odd groups.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves counting how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and keys. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of two parts:\n   - The number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys (limited by the smaller of the counts of even keys and odd chests).\n   - The number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys (limited by the smaller of the counts of odd keys and even chests).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves simple counting and arithmetic operations. We count the even and odd numbers in the chests and keys, then compute the two parts as described and sum them up.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves reading and processing the input arrays once, which takes O(n + m) time, where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient for the given constraints (up to 10^5 elements).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n            \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n            \n    part1 = min(even_key, odd_chest)\n    part2 = min(odd_key, even_chest)\n    \n    result = part1 + part2\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking each number's parity.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: The solution calculates two parts:\n   - **Part1**: The number of odd chests that can be opened using even keys, which is the minimum of the count of even keys and odd chests.\n   - **Part2**: The number of even chests that can be opened using odd keys, which is the minimum of the count of odd keys and even chests.\n4. **Output Result**: The sum of Part1 and Part2 gives the total number of chests that can be opened, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity condition to maximize the number of chests opened without any complex computations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
