    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element from the array will remove either the minimum or the maximum (or somewhere in between) and then the instability is the new max minus the new min.\n\n However, note that the instability of the entire array after removal might not necessarily be determined by the original min and max. But we can consider:\n\n Let the original array be `a`. Without loss of generality, we can sort the array.\n\n After removing an element, the instability is max(remaining) - min(remaining).\n\n There are two cases where we might get a lower instability:\n 1. Removing the global minimum, then the new min would be the next smallest, and the max remains the same.\n 2. Removing the global maximum, then the new max would be the next largest, and the min remains the same.\n\n But also, we might remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, but sometimes that could help? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, then the min and max remain the same as the original. Therefore, the instability would be the same as the original. So the only chance to improve the instability is by removing either the min or the max.\n\n However, wait: consider the example [1, 3, 3, 7]. \n   Original: min=1, max=7, instability=6.\n   If we remove 1: then array becomes [3,3,7] -> min=3, max=7 -> instability=4.\n   If we remove 7: then array becomes [1,3,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n   If we remove a 3: then array becomes [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n\n So indeed, the best is to remove the maximum.\n\n But let me try another example: [1,2,3,4]\n   Remove 1: [2,3,4] -> instability=2\n   Remove 2: [1,3,4] -> instability=3\n   Remove 3: [1,2,4] -> instability=3\n   Remove 4: [1,2,3] -> instability=2\n\n So the answer is 2.\n\n Now, what if the array has duplicates? For example, [1,1,2,3,4]:\n   Removing one of the 1s: [1,2,3,4] -> instability=3\n   Removing the other 1: same as above -> 3\n   Removing 2: [1,1,3,4] -> min=1, max=4 -> 3\n   Removing 3: [1,1,2,4] -> min=1, max=4 -> 3\n   Removing 4: [1,1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> 2\n\n So we have to consider that the min might appear multiple times.\n\n Approach:\n Sort the array.\n\n Then, note that the instability after removal is determined by the remaining min and max. The min and max of the entire array are the first and last elements.\n\n However, we are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n Consider:\n Option 1: Remove an occurrence of the global minimum (if there are multiple, we can remove one of them). Then the new min will be the next distinct value (which is the next element in the sorted array if we remove one occurrence of the minimum). But wait: if we remove one occurrence of the minimum, the next smallest value is still the minimum if there are duplicates? Actually, no: if we remove one occurrence, then the next smallest value is the next element (which might be the same as the minimum if there are duplicates).\n\n Actually, we don't need to know the distinct values. We can consider:\n\n Let b = sorted(a)\n\n Possibilities for removal:\n\n Case 1: Remove an element that is the global minimum (at index i). Then the new min is:\n   If i==0 (the first element) and there is at least one more element with value b[0], then the new min is still b[0] (because we removed one duplicate). But if we remove the first occurrence and there is no duplicate, then the new min is b[1].\n\n However, note: we are only removing one element. The min of the remaining array is the smallest value that remains. Similarly for the max.\n\n So we can consider:\n\n Option A: Remove the first element (min) -> then the array becomes b[1:], so the min is b[1] and the max is b[-1]. Instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n Option B: Remove the last element (max) -> then the array becomes b[:-1], so the min is b[0] and the max is b[-2]. Instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n But wait: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the min and max are unchanged, so the instability is b[-1]-b[0]. And that is the original.\n\n However, there is a catch: what if we remove an element that is the min, but it's not the first element? Actually, the first element is the min. Similarly, the last element is the max. But there could be multiple mins and multiple maxes.\n\n Actually, we must consider all possibilities? But note: the min and max of the entire array are fixed. Removing an element that is not the min doesn't change the min (unless there are no more mins). Similarly for max.\n\n Actually, we can break the array into segments:\n\n Since the array is sorted, the min is b[0] and the max is b[-1].\n\n If we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max remain the same.\n\n If we remove an element that is the min, then the new min is the next smallest value (which is the smallest value in the array that is >= b[0]). Similarly for the max.\n\n But note: if we remove an occurrence of the min, then the min of the remaining array is:\n   If there are multiple mins, then the min is still b[0] (because we have at least one left). Only when we remove the last occurrence of the min, the min becomes the next value.\n\n Similarly, for the max.\n\n So we have to consider:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove an occurrence of the min (but not necessarily the first one) -> then the min might become the next distinct value (if we remove the last occurrence of the min) or remain the same.\n\n However, we cannot iterate over all n elements because n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We note that the instability after removal is either:\n   (original_max - original_min)   [if we remove an element that is neither the last occurrence of min nor the last occurrence of max?] -> but wait, actually if we remove an element that is not the min or not the max, then the min and max are unchanged.\n\n But actually, the instability is always (max_remaining - min_remaining). The max_remaining is either the original max or the original max if we didn't remove the last occurrence of the max. Similarly for min.\n\n However, we can consider:\n\n Let the sorted array be b.\n\n The instability after removal is the maximum of the remaining numbers minus the minimum of the remaining numbers.\n\n We can consider two types of removals:\n\n Type 1: Removing an element that is the current minimum (so the element is <= the next element, but actually we know the array is sorted). Actually, we can consider:\n\n   If we remove an element at position i, then:\n\n   - The new min is: if i==0, then the new min is b[1] (if n>=2). Otherwise, the min is still b[0] (if there are duplicates at the beginning).\n   - The new max is: if i==n-1, then the new max is b[n-2]. Otherwise, the max is still b[n-1].\n\n But wait, that is not entirely correct. For the min: if we remove an element that is the min, but there is another min, then the min remains. Similarly for the max.\n\n So:\n\n   Let m = b[0] (min) and M = b[-1] (max)\n\n   Consider the set of indices where the element is m (the min). Let the last occurrence of m be at index i (i.e., the last index such that b[i]==m). Similarly, the first occurrence of M (the max) is at index j (the first index such that b[j]==M).\n\n   Then:\n\n   Option 1: Remove the last occurrence of the min. Then the new min is the next distinct value (b[i+1]) and the max remains M. Instability = M - b[i+1]\n\n   Option 2: Remove the first occurrence of the max. Then the new max is the previous distinct value (b[j-1]) and the min remains m. Instability = b[j-1] - m\n\n   But wait, there might be a better removal: what if we remove an element that is in the middle? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is M - m.\n\n   However, we want to minimize the instability.\n\n   Also, note: we are allowed to remove any one element.\n\n   So the candidate answers are:\n\n     candidate1 = M - m   [if we remove an element that is neither the last min nor the first max? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is the last min, then the min changes, so we have candidate1 = M - (next min after the last min) ]\n\n   Actually, we must consider:\n\n   The instability after removal is:\n\n     If we remove an element that is not the last occurrence of the min and not the first occurrence of the max, then the min and max remain the same: M - m.\n\n     If we remove the last occurrence of the min, then the min becomes the next distinct value (which is the first value greater than m) and the max remains M: so instability = M - (next distinct min) = M - (b[i+1] if i is the last index of m, then i+1 is the next distinct)\n\n     If we remove the first occurrence of the max, then the max becomes the previous distinct value (which is the last value less than M) and the min remains m: so instability = (previous distinct max) - m = (b[j-1]) - m.\n\n   But note: we are not forced to remove the last occurrence of the min or the first occurrence of the max. We can remove any occurrence. However, if we remove a min that is not the last occurrence, then the min remains m. Similarly, if we remove a max that is not the first occurrence, then the max remains M.\n\n   So the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum among:\n\n     candidate1 = M - m   [if we remove an element that is not the last min and not the first max? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is the last min, then we get a different candidate, and similarly for the first max]\n\n   But wait: we are allowed to remove one element. We are not forced to remove the last min or the first max. However, if we remove an element that is the last min, then we get candidate = M - (next distinct min). Similarly, if we remove the first max, we get candidate = (prev distinct max) - m.\n\n   And if we remove an element that is neither, then we get M - m.\n\n   But note: maybe we can remove an element that is the last min OR the first max, and then compare the two candidates.\n\n   However, we are allowed to remove only one element. So we can choose which one to remove. We are looking for the minimum instability.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the minimum between:\n\n     candidate1 = M - m   (if we remove an element that is not the last min and not the first max, then we get this. But wait, if we remove an element that is the last min, we don't get this, and similarly for the first max.)\n\n   Actually, we have to consider:\n\n   Let candidate_remove_min = M - (next distinct min)   [if we remove the last occurrence of the min]\n   Let candidate_remove_max = (prev distinct max) - m    [if we remove the first occurrence of the max]\n\n   And candidate_remove_other = M - m   [if we remove an element that is not the last min and not the first max]\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is the last min? Then we don't have to remove the first occurrence of the max, but we are allowed to remove one element. Similarly, we can remove the first occurrence of the max and leave the last min.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. So we can choose to remove the last min, or the first max, or something else.\n\n   But the key is: we want the minimal instability.\n\n   So the answer is the minimum of:\n\n     candidate1 = M - m   [if we remove an element that is not the last occurrence of the min and not the first occurrence of the max, then we get this. However, if we remove the last occurrence of the min, we don't get this, and similarly for the first occurrence of the max.]\n\n   But wait: we are allowed to remove one element. We are not forced to remove an element that is the last min or the first max. However, we are trying to minimize the instability. So we can choose the best removal.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   candidate1: Remove the last occurrence of the min -> instability = M - (b[first_index_of_non_min] if exists, but actually we can use the next distinct value from the last min)\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Let i = 0, while i < n and b[i] == b[0]: i++   -> then the last min is at index i-1? Actually, we can find the first index where the value is not the min.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let left = 0, right = n-1.\n\n   The min is b[0], the max is b[-1].\n\n   Now, we want to consider:\n\n   Option 1: Remove the last occurrence of the min. Then the new min is the smallest value in the remaining array. The smallest value in the remaining array is the first value that is not the min (if we remove the last min, then the min is still present until we remove all min). Actually, we must remove one occurrence. So:\n\n     The number of min occurrences is count_min = (last_index_min - first_index_min + 1) [if we let first_index_min=0, then last_index_min is the last index with value b[0]]\n\n     Then, if we remove one occurrence of the min, the remaining min is:\n        if count_min > 1: then the min is still b[0] (because we have at least one left)\n        if count_min == 1: then the min becomes b[1] (if n>1)\n\n   Similarly for the max.\n\n   However, we don't know how many min and max there are. But note: we are only removing one element.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n   candidate_remove_min = \n        if there are multiple min (i.e., at least two): then the min remains b[0] and the max remains b[-1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[0] (same as original)\n        if there is only one min: then removing the min, the new min is b[1] and the max remains b[-1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n   Similarly for max:\n\n        candidate_remove_max = \n            if there is only one max: then the new max is b[-2] and min remains b[0] -> instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n            if there are multiple max: then the max remains b[-1] and min remains b[0] -> instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n   But wait, what if we remove an element that is both the last min and the first max? Then the array has only one element? No, because n>=2.\n\n   However, note: the array has at least 2 elements.\n\n   But also, we can remove an element that is the min but not the max? Or the max but not the min?\n\n   Actually, the above two conditions are independent.\n\n   However, we have three possibilities:\n\n     candidate1: Remove an element that is the min (and there are multiple mins) -> then the min remains, so instability = M - m (same as original) -> but wait, if we remove a min that is not the last one, then the min remains. But we are allowed to remove any element. So we are not forced to remove the last min. However, if we remove a min that is not the last one, then the min remains the same. Similarly, if we remove a max that is not the first one, then the max remains the same.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is the minimum among:\n\n      candidate_a = M - m   [removing an element that is not the last min and not the first max]\n\n      candidate_b = M - (b[k]) where k is the smallest index such that b[k] != m (if we remove the last min, then the min becomes the next distinct value, which is b[k])\n      candidate_c = (b[l]) - m where l is the largest index such that b[l] != M (if we remove the first max, then the max becomes the previous distinct value, which is b[l])\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove only one element. So we can choose which one to remove.\n\n   However, we can also remove an element that is the last min and the first max? That is, if the array is [1, 100000] (two elements) then the last min is the first element and the first max is the last element. Then:\n\n      candidate_b = 100000 - b[1] = 100000 - 100000 = 0\n      candidate_c = b[0] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\n\n   So the answer is 0.\n\n   How do we compute these without iterating too much?\n\n   Steps:\n\n     Sort the array.\n\n     Let m = b[0], M = b[-1]\n\n     Find the first index where the element is not m (for the min side): \n        i = 0\n        while i < n and b[i] == m:\n            i += 1\n        Then, if i < n, the next distinct value is b[i] (if we remove the last occurrence of m, then the min becomes b[i] if i < n, but wait: we are removing one occurrence, so if there are multiple m, we remove one and the min remains m unless we remove the last one? Actually, no: we are removing one occurrence. The min remains m if there is at least one m left.\n\n   Wait, let me clarify:\n\n   The condition for the min to change is: if we remove the last occurrence of the min (i.e., there is no more min left). Similarly for the max.\n\n   So:\n\n     candidate_remove_min_effect = (if the frequency of m is 1) then the min becomes b[1] (if n>=2), else if frequency of m > 1, then the min remains m.\n\n   Similarly, for max.\n\n   But note: we are not limited to removing the last occurrence of the min. We can remove any occurrence. However, if we remove an occurrence that is not the last one, then the min does not change.\n\n   Therefore, the two candidates we care about are:\n\n     candidate1: Removing the last occurrence of the min (if exists) -> then the min becomes the next distinct value (if available) or if not available (like the entire array is one element) then we have to check, but n>=2 so we don't have to worry.\n\n     candidate2: Removing the first occurrence of the max (if exists) -> then the max becomes the previous distinct value.\n\n   And candidate3: Removing an element that is neither the last min nor the first max -> then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is M-m.\n\n   But wait, we are allowed to remove one element. We can choose the removal that minimizes the instability.\n\n   So we can compute:\n\n     Let freq_min = frequency of m in the array.\n     Let freq_max = frequency of M in the array.\n\n     candidate_after_removing_min = \n          if freq_min == 1: \n              then the min becomes the next distinct value (the smallest value greater than m). How to get that? We can look at the next distinct value: the next value in the sorted array that is greater than m, which is the first index where b[i] > m. But note: there might be duplicates of m? Actually, if we remove the only m, then the next distinct value is the next value (which is the smallest value greater than m). So we can do:\n\n              We can precompute the next distinct value for m: \n                  i = 0\n                  while i < n and b[i] == m:\n                      i += 1\n                  if i < n:\n                      next_min_val = b[i]\n                  else:\n                      # This case: all elements are m -> then n==1? but n>=2, so this won't happen.\n                      next_min_val = None\n\n              Then candidate_after_removing_min = M - next_min_val\n\n          else: \n              # There are multiple mins, so even if we remove one, the min remains m.\n              candidate_after_removing_min = M - m   [but wait, if we remove a min, the min remains m, so the instability is the same as the original]\n\n     Similarly, candidate_after_removing_max = \n          if freq_max == 1:\n              # Then we remove the last element, so the new max is b[-2]\n              candidate_after_removing_max = b[-2] - m\n          else:\n              candidate_after_removing_max = M - m\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can choose to remove an element that is the min (if exists) OR the max (if exists) OR an element in the middle. And we want the minimal instability.\n\n   But note: we are not forced to remove the min or the max. However, removing an element that is neither the last min nor the first max leaves the instability as M-m.\n\n   So the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n        candidate_mid = M - m   (if we remove an element that is neither the last min nor the first max)\n\n        candidate_remove_min = (if we remove the last min) then the instability is M - (next distinct min) [if there was only one min] OR if there were multiple, then we don't get a change by removing a min (because the min remains) so the instability is still M-m.\n\n        candidate_remove_max = (if we remove the first max) then the instability is (prev distinct max) - m [if there was only one max] OR if there were multiple, then the max remains so the instability is M-m.\n\n   However, wait: if we remove an element that is the last min, we are allowed to do that and we get a candidate. Similarly for the first max.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove only one element. We can choose which one. So we can consider:\n\n        candidate1 = M - m   (removing an element that is not the last min and not the first max)\n\n        candidate2 = (if we remove the last min and if the frequency of min is 1) then candidate = M - (next distinct min) \n        candidate3 = (if we remove the first max and if the frequency of max is 1) then candidate = (prev distinct max) - m\n\n   However, we are also allowed to remove the last min even if there are multiple mins? Then the min remains, so the instability is still M-m. Similarly, removing a max that is not the first occurrence (so there are multiple) leaves the max unchanged, so the instability is M-m.\n\n   Therefore, the only chance to get a lower instability is if:\n\n        Either we remove the last min and the frequency of min is 1, then the min increases and the instability decreases.\n\n        Or we remove the first max and the frequency of max is 1, then the max decreases and the instability decreases.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to remove only one element. So we can choose to remove one element. We are not forced to remove the min or the max.\n\n   However, if we remove an element that is the last min (and there is only one min) then we get a candidate. Similarly for the max.\n\n   But also, we can remove the last min and the first max if they are the same element? Actually, if the array is [1, 100000] then the last min is 1 and the first max is 100000, which are distinct.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n     Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n     Step 2: Sort the list.\n     Step 3: Let m = a[0], M = a[-1]\n     Step 4: Count the frequency of m and M.\n\n        We can use:\n            count_min = 1\n            i = 1\n            while i < n and a[i] == m:\n                count_min += 1\n                i += 1\n\n            Similarly for max from the end.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n            count_min = a.count(m)   -> but n can be up to 10^5, and a.count() goes through the entire list, so we do two counts? Actually, we can do:\n\n            count_min = 0\n            for num in a:\n                if num == m:\n                    count_min += 1\n\n            Similarly for M.\n\n        But note: we already have the sorted array, so we can use the sorted array to count.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            count_min = 0\n            i = 0\n            while i < n and a[i] == m:\n                count_min += 1\n                i += 1\n\n            Similarly for max:\n\n            count_max = 0\n            i = n-1\n            while i>=0 and a[i] == M:\n                count_max += 1\n                i -= 1\n\n     Step 5: Compute:\n\n        candidate_mid = M - m\n\n        candidate_remove_min = None\n        if count_min == 1:\n            # Then the next distinct min is the next element (if exists) in the sorted array, which is the first element that is greater than m.\n            # But note: if we remove the only min, then the new min is the next element (if any) or if the array has only one element? but n>=2, so there is at least two elements.\n\n            # We can find the next distinct value: \n            #   Since the array is sorted, the next distinct value is the first element that is not m.\n            #   We can use the sorted array: the first index i such that a[i] > m is the next distinct min.\n\n            # Actually, we already know the sorted array. We can do:\n\n            #   j = 0\n            #   while j < n and a[j] == m:\n            #       j += 1\n            #   if j < n:\n            #       next_min_val = a[j]\n            #   else:\n            #       next_min_val = None   (but n>=2 and we removed the only min, then there should be at least one element left, so j must be < n)\n\n            # But wait, we can also use the fact that we have the sorted array and we know the min is m and we removed one occurrence, so the new min is the next value.\n\n            # However, we already counted the min, so we know there is only one m. Then the next distinct value is the first value that is not m, which is at index count_min (but count_min was the total count, so the next distinct value starts at index count_min). \n\n            # Actually, we can use:\n\n            #   candidate_remove_min = M - (a[count_min] if count_min < n else M)   -> no, because the array is sorted, the next distinct value is at index count_min (since the first count_min elements are m). But note: we are removing one occurrence, so we have n-1 elements. The min of the remaining array is the smallest value that is left. Since we removed one m, the remaining array has the first (count_min-1) elements as m? No, we removed one m, so the remaining array has (count_min-1) copies of m and the rest.\n\n            # But wait, if count_min==1, then we remove the one m, so the new min is the next distinct value, which is a[1] (if n>=2). Actually, the entire array is sorted, so the next distinct value is the first element after the m's.\n\n            # Since we have the sorted array, we can do:\n\n            #   candidate_remove_min = M - (a[count_min] if count_min < n else a[-1])   -> but count_min is the total count, so the next distinct value is at index count_min (0-indexed, the first non-m is at index count_min). But wait, our array is stored as a, and we have:\n\n            #   a[0:count_min] = [m]*count_min, then a[count_min] is the next.\n\n            # So candidate_remove_min = M - a[count_min]\n\n        candidate_remove_max = None\n        if count_max == 1:\n            # Then the previous distinct value is the last element that is not M.\n            # Since the array is sorted, the last non-M is at index n - count_max - 1.\n\n            # The array: a[0] ... a[n-1] = M repeated count_max times at the end.\n\n            # The previous distinct value is a[n-count_max-1] (if n-count_max-1 >=0)\n\n            candidate_remove_max = a[n-count_max-1] - m\n\n        But wait: in the example [1,3,3,7] (n=4, a=[1,3,3,7]): \n            m=1, M=7, count_min=1, count_max=1.\n            candidate_remove_min = 7 - a[1] = 7-3 = 4\n            candidate_remove_max = a[4-1-1] - 1 = a[2] - 1 = 3-1 = 2\n\n            Then the minimal instability is min(candidate_mid, candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max) = min(6,4,2) = 2 -> correct.\n\n        In the example [1,2,3,4] (n=4, a=[1,2,3,4]):\n            m=1, M=4, count_min=1, count_max=1.\n            candidate_remove_min = 4 - a[1] = 4-2=2\n            candidate_remove_max = a[4-1-1] - 1 = a[2]-1 = 3-1=2\n            candidate_mid = 4-1=3\n            Then the minimal is min(3,2,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n        Example [1,100000] (n=2, a=[1,100000]):\n            m=1, M=100000, count_min=1, count_max=1.\n            candidate_remove_min = 100000 - a[1] = 100000 - 100000 = 0\n            candidate_remove_max = a[0] - 1 = 1-1=0\n            candidate_mid = 100000-1=99999\n            Then minimal is 0 -> correct.\n\n        Example [1,1,2,3,4] (n=5, a=[1,1,2,3,4]):\n            m=1, M=4, count_min=2, count_max=1.\n            candidate_remove_min: since count_min>1, we don't consider candidate_remove_min as a way to lower the instability (because even if we remove one 1, the min remains 1). So we only have candidate_remove_max and candidate_mid.\n\n            candidate_remove_max = a[5-1-1] - 1 = a[3]-1 = 3-1=2\n            candidate_mid = 4-1=3\n\n            But wait, we are allowed to remove an element that is the last min? Actually, we have two 1's. If we remove one 1, then the min remains 1. So the instability is 4-1=3. But if we remove the 4, then the instability becomes 3-1=2.\n\n            So the answer is 2.\n\n            However, note: candidate_remove_min is not considered because count_min>1, so we don't get a change by removing a min. But we can also remove an element that is the min (one of the two) and then the instability is 3, which is worse than 2. So we don't want to consider that.\n\n            So the minimal instability is the minimum of candidate_mid and candidate_remove_max.\n\n            candidate_mid = 3, candidate_remove_max=2 -> answer=2.\n\n        Example [1,2,2,3] (n=4, a=[1,2,2,3]):\n            m=1, M=3, count_min=1, count_max=1.\n            candidate_remove_min = 3 - a[1] = 3-2=1\n            candidate_remove_max = a[4-1-1] - 1 = a[2]-1 = 2-1=1\n            candidate_mid = 3-1=2\n            Then minimal=1.\n\n        Example [1,2,3,3] (n=4, a=[1,2,3,3]):\n            m=1, M=3, count_min=1, count_max=2.\n            candidate_remove_min = 3 - a[1]=3-2=1\n            candidate_remove_max: since count_max>1, we don't consider candidate_remove_max (because removing one 3, the max remains 3) -> so the instability is 3-1=2.\n            candidate_mid = 3-1=2\n\n            But wait, we can remove the min (1) and get instability 3-2=1, or remove a 3 and get 3-1=2. So the minimal is 1.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            candidate1 = M - m   (candidate_mid)\n\n            candidate2 = None\n            if count_min == 1:\n                # Then we can remove the only min and the new min is the next distinct value (a[count_min] because the first count_min elements are m, so the next is at index count_min)\n                # But wait, the array is sorted, so the next distinct value is a[count_min] (if count_min < n) but note: if we remove the min, the array becomes a without the first occurrence (but which occurrence? actually, we are removing one occurrence, and the array is sorted so we can remove the first one and the next distinct value is the next element, but if we remove the first occurrence, the next distinct value might be the same as the min if there are duplicates?

Actually, the min of the array after removal is the smallest value remaining. Since we remove one min, the smallest value remaining is the smallest value that is >= m. But because there is no other m, the smallest value remaining is the next distinct value, which is a[count_min] (because the array is sorted and the first count_min elements are m). \n\n            candidate3 = None\n            if count_max == 1:\n                # Then we can remove the only max, and the new max is the previous distinct value, which is a[n-count_max-1] (because the last count_max elements are M, so the previous distinct value is the one before the last M, i.e., at index n-count_max-1)\n\n                candidate3 = a[n-count_max-1] - m\n\n            Then, the answer is the minimum of candidate1, candidate2, candidate3.\n\n        However, wait: in the example [1,2,3,3] (n=4, a=[1,2,3,3]), we have:\n\n            m=1, M=3, count_min=1, count_max=2.\n\n            candidate1 = 3-1=2\n            candidate2 = 3 - a[1] = 3-2=1\n            candidate3 is None (because count_max=2>1)\n\n            Then answer = min(2,1) = 1 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the array is [1,2,3,3] and we remove the min (1)?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the potential changes in the minimum and maximum values when an element is removed.\n2. **Identify Extremes**: After sorting, the first element is the smallest (min) and the last element is the largest (max) in the original array.\n3. **Count Frequencies**: Calculate how many times the min and max values appear in the array. This helps in determining if removing one occurrence of these values will change the min or max of the resulting array.\n4. **Evaluate Candidates**: \n   - **Candidate 1**: The instability remains the same if we remove an element that is neither the only occurrence of the min nor the only occurrence of the max.\n   - **Candidate 2**: If the min appears only once, removing it changes the new min to the next distinct value, reducing the instability.\n   - **Candidate 3**: Similarly, if the max appears only once, removing it changes the new max to the previous distinct value, potentially reducing the instability.\n5. **Determine Minimum Instability**: The answer is the smallest value among the three candidates.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    m = a[0]\n    M = a[-1]\n    \n    count_min = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < n and a[i] == m:\n        count_min += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    count_max = 0\n    i = n-1\n    while i >= 0 and a[i] == M:\n        count_max += 1\n        i -= 1\n        \n    candidate_mid = M - m\n    \n    candidate_remove_min = None\n    if count_min == 1:\n        candidate_remove_min = M - a[count_min]\n        \n    candidate_remove_max = None\n    if count_max == 1:\n        candidate_remove_max = a[n - count_max - 1] - m\n        \n    ans = candidate_mid\n    if candidate_remove_min is not None:\n        ans = min(ans, candidate_remove_min)\n    if candidate_remove_max is not None:\n        ans = min(ans, candidate_remove_max)\n        \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n2. **Counting Min and Max Occurrences**: The code counts how many times the smallest and largest values appear in the array. This helps in deciding whether removing one occurrence will affect the min or max of the resulting array.\n3. **Calculating Candidates**:\n   - **Candidate_mid**: This represents the instability if we remove an element that is neither the only min nor the only max. The min and max remain unchanged.\n   - **Candidate_remove_min**: If the min occurs only once, removing it changes the new min to the next distinct value, thus reducing the instability.\n   - **Candidate_remove_max**: Similarly, if the max occurs only once, removing it changes the new max to the previous distinct value, potentially reducing the instability.\n4. **Finding the Minimum Instability**: The solution compares all three candidates (if applicable) and selects the smallest value, which is the minimized instability after removing one element from the original array. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to evaluating a few critical scenarios, leveraging sorting and frequency counting to minimize computational overhead.",
