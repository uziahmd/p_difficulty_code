Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\n Okay, this problem is about navigating between two points in a plane divided by n infinite lines (roads). The key observation is that the roads divide the plane into regions (blocks) and we can move from one block to another if they share a common border (i.e., the blocks are adjacent). However, moving across an intersection (a point where two or more roads meet) without having a nonzero common segment is not allowed.\n\nBut note: the movement condition is defined by having a nonzero common border. This means that two blocks are adjacent (and hence can be moved in one step) if they share a segment (not just a point) of their boundaries.\n\nHowever, note that the entire plane is divided by n lines. The regions are convex polygons (or unbounded regions) and the graph of regions is such that crossing a road takes you from one region to another. But the problem does not require us to count crossings of roads but steps (which are moves between adjacent regions).\n\nBut here's the catch: we are only allowed to move from one block to another if they share a nonzero boundary segment. This implies that two regions are adjacent if and only if they are separated by exactly one road. Because if two regions are separated by two or more roads, then they don't share a common boundary segment (they only meet at an intersection, which is a point, so the common border has zero length).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: how many roads must we cross to get from home to university? However, note that the answer is not simply the number of roads we cross because sometimes we can cross multiple roads at once (at an intersection) and then we are in a region that has crossed all those roads? But wait, the movement condition is: one step moves you from one block to an adjacent block (crossing exactly one road). So if we are to cross k roads, then we need k steps? \n\nHowever, consider the example: \nInput 1: \n  Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), n=2, roads: [0 1 0] and [1 0 0]\nOutput: 2\n\nIndeed, the two roads are the x-axis and y-axis. The home (1,1) is in the first quadrant and the university (-1,-1) is in the third. To get there, we must cross the x-axis and the y-axis. Each crossing is one step. So two steps.\n\nBut what if we have three roads? Consider:\nInput 2:\n  Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), n=3, roads: [1 0 0], [0 1 0], [1 1 -3]\n\nThe third road: x+y-3=0. How does that affect? The home (1,1) and university (-1,-1) are on the same side of the third road? Let's check: \n  For (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0.\n  For (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 <0 -> same side.\n\nSo we still have to cross two roads: the x-axis and the y-axis.\n\nBut the output is 2.\n\nNow, what if we have two roads and the home and university are separated by two roads, but the two roads are not orthogonal? Then we still have to cross two roads, so two steps.\n\nBut wait, what if we have two roads that are the same? The problem says no two roads are the same.\n\nSo the idea: each road divides the plane into two half-planes. We can assign a sign (or side) for each road to the home and to the university. If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, then that road must be crossed an odd number of times. Otherwise, even.\n\nHowever, note that we are allowed to cross a road multiple times? But the problem is asking for the minimum number of steps. Since we can choose the order arbitrarily, we can assume we cross each road at most once. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut wait: is that always true? \n\nConsider: we are moving from home to university. We must cross a road if and only if the two points lie on opposite sides. And each crossing of a road counts as one step, and we can cross one road per step. So the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut let me test with the provided examples.\n\nExample 1: \n  Two roads: x-axis (a=0,b=1,c=0) and y-axis (a=1,b=0,c=0).\n  Home (1,1): \n      For x-axis: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 >0 -> positive.\n      For y-axis: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 >0 -> positive.\n  University (-1,-1):\n      For x-axis: 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> negative.\n      For y-axis: 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> negative.\n\n  So both points are on the same side for both roads? Then according to above, we don't need to cross any road? But the example output is 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Actually, wait: the home (1,1) is in the first quadrant, university (-1,-1) in the third. The two roads (x-axis and y-axis) separate the plane into four quadrants. The home is in the first quadrant and the university in the third. The direct path from (1,1) to (-1,-1) goes through the origin (an intersection) but the problem states that we cannot cross at the intersection if that is the only common border? Actually, the problem says: \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\nBut note: the two blocks adjacent to an intersection do not share a nonzero common border because the common border is only a point. Therefore, to go from first quadrant to third, we must cross two roads: first the x-axis then the y-axis (or vice versa). Each crossing is a step.\n\nBut according to the half-plane method, we have to check: for each road, whether the two points are on the same side or not.\n\nIn the example, for the x-axis: \n  home: 1 (positive) and university: -1 (negative) -> different sides -> must cross.\nFor the y-axis: \n  home: 1 (positive) and university: -1 (negative) -> different sides -> must cross.\n\nSo two roads must be crossed. \n\nNow, the example 2: \n  Home (1,1) and university (-1,-1) and three roads: [1 0 0], [0 1 0], [1 1 -3].\n\nWe already saw that the third road (x+y-3=0) has both points on the same side (both negative). So we only have two roads that separate them. Therefore, two steps.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\n1. Read home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2)\n2. Read n, then n lines of [a, b, c] for the road equation a*x + b*y + c = 0.\n\n3. For each road, evaluate the expression a*x + b*y + c for both home and university.\n   - If the signs (or the product) of the two evaluations are negative, then the two points are on opposite sides of the road. We mark this road as separating.\n\n4. The answer is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut wait, is that always the minimal steps? Because each step crosses exactly one road, and we must cross every separating road at least once, and we can do that without crossing non-separating roads. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\nHowever, note: it is possible that by crossing two roads (that are separating) we might have an intermediate region that is separated by two roads, and then we have to cross two roads to get from home to that intermediate region and then two more to get to university? But actually, we are counting the minimal steps. We can cross the roads in any order, and we only need to cross each separating road once. Therefore, the total minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\nBut wait, what if two separating roads are crossed at the same time (at an intersection)? Then we would be crossing two roads at the same step? \n\nHowever, note the movement condition: we can only move from one block to another if they share a nonzero common border. The common border is a segment of one road. Therefore, we cannot cross two roads at once (because crossing two roads at once would mean stepping from one block to another block that is separated by two roads, which is not adjacent). \n\nMoreover, when we cross one road, we enter a new block. Then from that block, we cross the next road. So each step is one road.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This means that we can only cross one road per step.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of steps is indeed the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nLet me test with a simple case: one road. Then if home and university are on opposite sides, then one step. That matches.\n\nAnother test: no roads. Then n=0, then 0 steps.\n\nBut wait, the input says n>=1.\n\nAnother test: two roads that are the same? But the problem says no two roads are the same.\n\nAlso, note that the evaluation: we must be cautious with the sign of the equation. The equation is a*x+b*y+c=0. We can define the side by the sign of (a*x+b*y+c). \n\nHowever, note that the equation can be multiplied by -1 and represent the same line. But the problem states that the roads are given by the equation aix+biy+ci=0, and we are guaranteed that neither home nor university lies on any road.\n\nSo the plan:\n\ncount = 0\nfor each road (a, b, c):\n    f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    # Check if the two points are on opposite sides: one positive and the other negative.\n    if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nThen output count.\n\nBut wait: what if the evaluation is zero? The problem says that neither home nor university lies on the road, so f1 and f2 should not be zero. But we are guaranteed that, so we don't have to worry.\n\nHowever, note: the equation might have negative signs. Our condition using < and > is valid because the sign of the equation defines the side.\n\nBut consider: if we define the equation as a*x+b*y+c=0, then the set { (x,y) | a*x+b*y+c >=0 } is one side and the other side is <0? Actually, the sign determines the side. \n\nBut note: the equation is linear and the line is the boundary. The sign of the expression (without normalization) is arbitrary because we can multiply the entire equation by -1. However, since we are comparing the signs of two expressions (from the same road) for two points, the relative sign (same or opposite) is independent of the scaling of the coefficients (unless we change the sign of the entire equation, then the signs of f1 and f2 flip, but then the condition (f1<0 and f2>0) becomes (f1>0 and f2<0) and vice versa, but the condition \"opposite\" is symmetric.\n\nBut wait, if we flip the entire equation (multiply by -1) then both f1 and f2 become negative of the original. Then the condition (f1<0 and f2>0) becomes (-f1<0 and -f2>0) i.e. (f1>0 and f2<0). Similarly, (f1>0 and f2<0) becomes (f1<0 and f2>0). So the condition is symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the code is:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\nseparating_count = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    # Evaluate for home and university\n    f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    # Check if the two points are on opposite sides of the road\n    if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n        separating_count += 1\n\nprint(separating_count)\n\nBut wait, let me test with the provided examples.\n\nExample 1: \n  Home (1,1), University (-1,-1), roads: [0 1 0] and [1 0 0]\n\nRoad1: [0,1,0]: equation y=0.\n  f1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 >0\n  f2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> opposite, count=1.\n\nRoad2: [1,0,0]: equation x=0.\n  f1 = 1*1+0*1+0=1>0\n  f2 = 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1<0 -> opposite, count=2.\n\nOutput 2. Correct.\n\nExample 2: \n  Home (1,1), University (-1,-1), roads: [1 0 0], [0 1 0], [1 1 -3]\n\nFirst two roads: same as above, so two separating roads.\n\nThird road: [1,1,-3]\n  f1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0\n  f2 = 1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3 = -1-1-3 = -5 <0 -> same side, so not counted.\n\nSo output 2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the road equation is given in a normalized form? Actually, the problem does not specify, so we have to use the given equation.\n\nOne more test: \n  Home (0,0) and University (0,0) -> same point. Then no steps. But the input says home and university are not on the road, but they could be the same point? The problem doesn't say they are distinct. Let's read the problem: \"Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block.\" It does not say distinct.\n\nIf home and university are the same, then we don't need to move. So the number of steps is 0.\n\nBut our code: \n  For each road: if (f1 and f2) are both positive, both negative, or one zero? But wait, the problem guarantees that neither home nor university is on the road, so if the two points are the same, then they are both not on the road. Then for each road, we evaluate the same value twice (since home and university are the same). So f1 and f2 are the same. Then the condition (opposite) fails. So we count 0. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the home and university are distinct but the same side for all roads? Then 0 steps. That is correct.\n\nWhat if the two points are on the same side for all roads, but we are in the same block? Yes, then 0 steps.\n\nBut note: the problem says the home and university are in some blocks. They are guaranteed not to be on a road, but they could be in the same block. Then 0 steps.\n\nAnother test: two roads that are parallel. Example: two horizontal lines. \n  Road1: y=1 (equation: 0*x+1*y-1=0)\n  Road2: y=2 (equation: 0*x+1*y-2=0)\n  Home: (0,0) -> below both.\n  University: (0,3) -> above both.\n\nThen we must cross two roads: first y=1 then y=2. So two steps.\n\nOur code:\n  Road1: f1 = 0*0+1*0-1 = -1, f2=0*0+1*3-1=2 -> opposite, count=1.\n  Road2: f1 = 0*0+1*0-2=-2, f2=0*0+1*3-2=1 -> opposite, count=2.\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut what if the two roads are not parallel but intersect? Example: two perpendicular roads. We already did that.\n\nAnother test: three roads forming a triangle? Actually, the roads are infinite lines, so they form a set of regions. The minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nHowever, wait: is it always the case that the minimal steps is the number of separating roads? \n\nYes, because each separating road must be crossed an odd number of times, and the minimal way is to cross each exactly once. And since we can cross one road per step, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\nBut note: the problem says that we are allowed to move from one block to another if the common border is nonzero. This means that we can only cross one road at a time. Therefore, we cannot skip a separating road. We must cross each separating road at least once.\n\nHence, the answer is the number of separating roads.\n\nBut wait, I recall that in some problems (like the classic \"how many lines separate two points\") the answer is the number of lines that separate the two points. \n\nHowever, note that the problem statement says: \"Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.\"\n\nEach step moves you from one block to an adjacent one (crossing one road). The entire journey is a sequence of steps, and each step crosses one road. The total number of roads crossed is the number of steps. And the minimal number of roads to cross is the number of separating roads.\n\nTherefore, the program is as above.\n\nBut wait: what if the two points are separated by k roads, but the graph of regions is such that you can cross two roads at once (if they are arranged in a way that two roads meet at a point and then you can jump from one side of the first two to the other side of the second two without crossing the intermediate regions)? \n\nActually, no. The movement is defined by the common border. You can only move from one block to another if they share a common border (a segment). This means that you can only cross one road at a time. \n\nMoreover, the entire plane is divided by the lines. The regions are connected components. The dual graph is a planar graph. But the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of edges (roads) to cross, and that is the number of separating roads.\n\nI think the reasoning is solid.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nEdge: we must use integer arithmetic. The inputs can be up to 10^6, and n up to 300. The multiplications are up to 10^6 * 10^6 * 300? Actually, no: each road we do two multiplications (a*x1, a*x2, etc.) and then add. But the numbers are integers, so we can use Python integers.\n\nHowever, note: the products a*x1 might be as large as 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, and then we have three coefficients (a, b, c) but we are doing two such evaluations per road. But 300 roads is acceptable.\n\nCode:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    data = input().split()\n    if not data:\n        continue\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    c = int(data[2])\n    \n    # Calculate the value for home and university\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    \n    # Check if the two values have opposite signs (one positive, one negative)\n    if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThis should work.\n\nBut wait: what if the value is zero? The problem says neither home nor university is on the road, so we don't have to worry.\n\nLet me run the sample tests.\n\nSample Input 1: \n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nOutput: 2\n\nSample Input 2:\n1 1\n-1 -1\n3\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 1 -3\n\nOutput: 2\n\nBut wait, the second sample input is provided as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the second example input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut note: the third road is [1 1 -3]. We tested and it gave 2.\n\nHowever, the problem statement also says:\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nSo we output 2 for both.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut that is two examples. The first example has 2 roads and the second has 3. Our code outputs 2 for both.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Output\", and the example outputs are ['2','2'].\n\nBut note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then gives two examples. However, the input format is standard: first line home, second university, third n, then n lines.\n\nBut wait, the example input is given as a list of strings. In the competition, the input will come from stdin.\n\nOur code reads from stdin.\n\nTherefore, we are good.\n\nBut wait, one more corner: what if the road equation is given with negative signs? Example: road equation -x - y + 0 = 0, which is equivalent to x+y=0.\n\nThen for home (1,1): -1-1+0 = -2 <0.\nUniversity (-1,-1): -(-1)-(-1)+0 = 1+1+0=2>0 -> opposite, so count.\n\nBut if we had the equation x+y=0, then (1,1): 1+1=2>0, (-1,-1):-1-1=-2<0 -> opposite.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo the code is robust.\n\nLet me submit.\n\nHowever, wait: the problem statement says the roads are defined by aix+biy+ci=0. Our condition is based on the sign of the expression. This is correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says the roads are infinite. We are only concerned with the side of the line.\n\nI think we are done.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement example input is given as:\n\nExample 1: \n  Input: \n    1 1\n    -1 -1\n    2\n    0 1 0\n    1 0 0\n\nExample 2: \n  Input:\n    1 1\n    -1 -1\n    3\n    1 0 0\n    0 1 0\n    1 1 -3\n\nBut note: in the example 2, the third road is given as [1 1 -3]. Our code uses the equation 1*x+1*y-3=0. \n\nBut wait, the example 2 output is 2, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if we have a road that is given with a negative constant? Example: equation 0*x+0*y+1=0 -> but wait, the problem says ai and bi are not both zero. So we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\nAnother thing: the equation might be given with a zero coefficient for a or b? For example, vertical line: a=1, b=0, c=0 (x=0). This is handled.\n\nSimilarly, horizontal line: a=0, b=1, c=0 (y=0). This is handled.\n\nBut wait, what if the road equation is given as 0*x + 0*y + c = 0? Then c must be nonzero because otherwise the equation is 0=0 (the whole plane) and that is not allowed. The problem says \"ai and bi are not both equal to zero\", so we are safe.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead home, university, n, then for each road, read a,b,c and compute the two values, then check the signs.\n\nWe'll output the count.\n\nBut wait, one more test: if the two points are separated by 0 roads, then 0.\n\nTest: \n  Home (0,0), University (0,0) -> 0.\n\nBut the problem says the home and university are not on the road, but they can be the same point.\n\nAnother test: two points on the same side for all roads, distinct points.\n\nExample: \n  Home (0,0), University (0,1), with a road: x=0 (vertical line). \n  Then for the road [1,0,0]:\n      Home: 0 -> wait, no: the home (0,0): 1*0+0*0+0=0 -> but wait, the problem says home is not on the road. So we cannot have (0,0) on the road x=0? Actually, (0,0) is on the road x=0.\n\nBut the problem says: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\".\n\nSo in our test, we cannot have (0,0) if there's a road x=0.\n\nLet me choose a safe example: \n  Road: x=0 (equation: 1*x+0*y+0=0) -> then home (1,0) and university (2,0): both positive? Then same side. So 0 steps.\n\nBut wait, the two points are (1,0) and (2,0). They are both on the positive side of x=0. So no separation.\n\nBut what if we have two roads: x=0 and y=0. Then home (1,1) and university (2,2): both positive for both roads? Then 0 steps.\n\nBut wait, (1,1) and (2,2) are in the same quadrant (first quadrant). So they are in the same block. Correct.\n\nNow, what if we have two roads: x=0 and y=0, and home (1,1) and university (-1,1). Then:\n  Road1 (x=0): \n      home: 1>0, university: -1<0 -> opposite, so count=1.\n  Road2 (y=0): \n      home: 1>0, university: 1>0 -> same, so count remains 1.\n\nThen output 1.\n\nThat is correct: we only need to cross the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nFinal code:\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n    if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nLet me run the provided examples.\n\nExample 1: \n  Input: \n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      2\n      0 1 0\n      1 0 0\n\n  Output: 2\n\nExample 2:\n  Input:\n      1 1\n      -1 -1\n      3\n      1 0 0\n      0 1 0\n      1 1 -3\n\n  Output: 2\n\nIt works.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says the input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut in the competition, the input is given from stdin. Our code reads from stdin.\n\nWe are good.\n\nI think we are done.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting point (home) to a destination (university) in a plane divided by several infinite lines (roads). The key observation is that each step involves crossing exactly one road, and the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plane is divided into regions by the given lines. Each line acts as a boundary between two regions. The home and university are located in two distinct regions (or possibly the same region). The movement between regions is allowed only if they share a common border segment (i.e., crossing one line at a time).\n2. **Intuition**: For each line, check if the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, then crossing this line is necessary to reach the destination. The total number of such lines gives the minimal steps required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each line, evaluate the side of both points relative to the line using the line equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). If the evaluations have opposite signs, the line separates the two points and must be crossed once.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each line exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. With \\(n\\) lines, the complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    x1 = int(data[idx])\n    y1 = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    x2 = int(data[idx])\n    y2 = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[idx])\n        b = int(data[idx+1])\n        c = int(data[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are the coordinates of the home, followed by the university's coordinates. The next value is the number of roads, followed by the coefficients of each line equation.\n2. **Processing Each Line**: For each line, the code checks if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the line. This is done by evaluating the line equation at both points. If one evaluation is positive and the other negative, the line separates the two points.\n3. **Counting Separating Lines**: The count of such separating lines directly gives the minimal steps required, as each step involves crossing one line.\n4. **Output the Result**: The total count of separating lines is printed, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal path by leveraging geometric properties of lines and point positions, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
