Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (each between 1 and 10) so we can use combinatorial methods.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read R and B.\n 2. Read the next R lines for the Rebel spaceships.\n 3. Read the next B lines for the bases.\n\n We have R + B points in total (all distinct, no three collinear).\n\n The problem: Assign each base to exactly one spaceship (and vice versa) such that the straight line segments (from base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect.\n\n Note: The assignment must be a perfect matching (i.e., bijection) between the set of spaceships and bases.\n\n Since R and B are at most 10, we can consider generating all permutations (if R == B) or use bipartite matching with constraints.\n\n However, note: the condition is about non-intersecting straight line segments. But note that the problem does not require the entire set of segments to form a planar graph? Actually, the requirement is that any two paths (from a base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect.\n\n Important: The problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" (meaning two edges) do not intersect. So if we have multiple edges, they must not cross.\n\n How to check for non-intersection?\n   Two line segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) in the plane: we can use the standard method by checking the orientation (cross product) to see if the two segments intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say that the edges are drawn from a base to a spaceship, but the entire set of edges must not have any intersections. Also, note that the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear, so we don't have degenerate cases.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are to assign each base (B points) to one of the R spaceships (R points). Since the assignment is a perfect matching, we require R = B? Actually, the problem states: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". Therefore, we must have R = B.\n\n But wait, the input example: \n   First example: R=3, B=3 -> so same number.\n   Second example: R=2, B=1 -> so R != B, then there is no perfect matching.\n\n So first, if R != B, then output 'No'.\n\n Then, we have to assign the R bases (wait, actually the bases are B points, and spaceships are R points) so if R != B, we cannot have a bijection. Therefore, we can immediately say:\n\n   if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        exit()\n\n But note: the problem statement says: \"the assignment is a perfect matching\", meaning the sets must have the same size.\n\n However, let's read the problem again: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This implies |spaceships| = |bases|, i.e., R=B.\n\n So step 1: if R != B, output \"No\".\n\n Now, if R == B, we have to find a perfect matching (bijection) from the R spaceships to the R bases (or from the set of bases to the set of spaceships) such that the straight line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify which set is which. Actually, the input gives:\n   First two integers R, B.\n   Then R lines for spaceships.\n   Then B lines for bases.\n\n And the assignment is from bases to spaceships? Actually, the problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian (a spaceship)\" and \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So it's a bipartite graph between the two sets.\n\n But note: the condition for non-intersection: the entire set of edges (which are straight line segments) must not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify which point is which. But we have two sets: one set of R points (spaceships) and one set of B points (bases). And we are matching the base set (size B) to the spaceship set (size R). Since R=B, we can consider the two sets as two sets of R points.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship\". So the edges are from base to spaceship.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the two sets are distinct and that the edges only connect a base to a spaceship. The condition is that the two segments (from two different bases to their spaceships) must not intersect.\n\n But note: the entire configuration includes only these edges. And the edges are between two distinct sets. There's no edge within the same set.\n\n However, we have to consider: even though the edges are between two sets, they might cross.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Since R (and B) is at most 10, we can try to generate all perfect matchings (there are R! possibilities, which is 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in worst-case, but note: we are going to check each matching for non-intersecting edges?).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a recursive backtracking to try to assign bases to spaceships and check for crossings as we assign.\n\n However, note: the condition is global: no two edges should intersect. But note: two edges that are both present must not intersect.\n\n But note: if we assign two bases to two spaceships, then the two edges (base1 to spaceship1 and base2 to spaceship2) must not intersect.\n\n However, the problem does not require the entire set of edges to be non-intersecting only for the pairs we draw? Actually, we are drawing R edges (since R=B) and we require that no two edges (even if they are not adjacent) should intersect.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning every pair of edges must not intersect.\n\n However, note that two edges that are incident to the same vertex (like base1 and base2 both connected to the same spaceship) would share an endpoint. The problem says \"paths\" (edges) and typically we consider that edges sharing an endpoint do not \"intersect\" in the interior. But the problem says \"in the galaxy plane\", and the endpoints are distinct. However, the problem does not explicitly say that endpoints are allowed to meet. But note: the bases and spaceships are distinct points, and the edges are from base to spaceship. So two edges that share a base or a spaceship will meet at the common endpoint. But the problem says \"do not intersect\", and typically in geometry, two segments that share an endpoint are considered to intersect at that point? However, the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" and the example doesn't specify.\n\n Let me read: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane\"\n\n The example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        0 0\n        2 0\n        3 1\n        -2 1\n        0 3\n        2 2\n\n   They are connecting the bases to the spaceships. The example output is \"Yes\".\n\n In the example, one possible way is to connect in order. Let's assume the bases are the last three points: (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2) and spaceships are (0,0), (2,0), (3,1).\n\n If we assign:\n   base (-2,1) -> (0,0)\n   base (0,3) -> (2,0)\n   base (2,2) -> (3,1)\n\n Then we have three edges. Do they intersect? \n\n   Edge1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n   Edge2: (0,3) to (2,0)\n   Edge3: (2,2) to (3,1)\n\n We must check that Edge1 and Edge2 do not intersect, Edge1 and Edge3 do not, and Edge2 and Edge3 do not.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the entire drawing is planar, but only that the edges (the two-segment paths) do not intersect. And note that the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear.\n\n However, the problem says \"any two\", meaning every pair of edges must not intersect (even if they are not adjacent). But note: two edges that share an endpoint: do they intersect? The problem says \"paths\" from a base to a spaceship. The base is an endpoint and the spaceship is an endpoint.\n\n In typical geometric problems, two segments that share an endpoint are not considered to cross (they only meet at the endpoint). However, the problem does not specify. But note the example: if we have two edges that share an endpoint, then they meet at that endpoint. Is that considered an intersection? Probably not, because the problem says \"paths\" and the entire path is the segment. However, the problem says \"in the galaxy plane\", and two segments that meet at an endpoint do not cross in the interior.\n\n Therefore, we only need to check for proper intersections (i.e., two edges that do not share a common endpoint) and that the intersection is not at an endpoint.\n\n How to check if two segments AB and CD intersect (properly)?\n\n Conditions:\n   1. The orientations around the four points must be mixed: one segment has A above the line CD and B below, and the other segment has C above the line AB and D below.\n\n However, we can use the following:\n\n   We can check if the two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) intersect by:\n\n      def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n          # Check if the two segments ab and cd intersect (including possibly at endpoints? but we need to avoid that if they share an endpoint)\n\n          # However, we are only concerned with edges that do not share an endpoint (because if they share an endpoint, then they are incident and we don't consider that as an intersection in the middle). But note: in our matching, two edges that share an endpoint are incident to the same base or same spaceship.\n\n          # But wait: our edges are from base to spaceship, and the base set and spaceship set are disjoint (given the problem: \"no two points coincide\"). So the two sets are disjoint. Therefore, no two edges share an endpoint.\n\n          # Why? Because the bases and spaceships are distinct. So the set of bases and the set of spaceships are disjoint.\n\n          # Therefore, we don't have to worry about endpoints being shared.\n\n          # Then, we can use the standard method for checking if two segments intersect (without endpoint condition).\n\n          # Standard method: check the orientation of triplet (a, b, c) and (a, b, d) and (c, d, a) and (c, d, b) to see if the points c and d lie on opposite sides of ab, and a and b lie on opposite sides of cd.\n\n          # However, we can use the cross product method.\n\n          def cross(o, a, b):\n              return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n          def sign(x):\n              return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0\n\n          # Check if point p is on the left, right, or collinear of segment o->a (relative to o->a)\n          # But note: no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about collinearity.\n\n          # Check if segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect.\n\n          # We check if the two segments cross by the orientation test.\n\n          o1 = sign(cross(a, b, c))\n          o2 = sign(cross(a, b, d))\n          o3 = sign(cross(c, d, a))\n          o4 = sign(cross(c, d, b))\n\n          # If any three points are collinear, then we have a problem, but the problem states no three points are collinear.\n\n          # Then, the segments intersect if and only if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0.\n\n          # However, this is the standard method.\n\n          return o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0\n\n But wait, there is another possibility: if the segments are collinear, but the problem says no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n However, note: our segments are defined by four distinct points (since base and spaceship sets are disjoint, and no two points coincide). But note: the entire set of points (spaceships and bases) are distinct (guaranteed: no two points coincide). So the four points are distinct.\n\n But note: the condition for the standard method is that the two segments are properly crossing (not just touching at an endpoint). However, we already established that the two edges do not share an endpoint (because the sets are disjoint). Therefore, we can use the above.\n\n However, wait: the standard method also requires that the four points are in general position (no three collinear) which is given.\n\n But note: the standard method using cross products and signs also works for non-collinear points.\n\n However, let me double-check: the method checks if the two segments cross by ensuring that the two endpoints of the first segment are on opposite sides of the second, and vice versa.\n\n But what if one segment is completely inside the triangle formed by the other? Actually, the condition is sufficient and necessary for proper crossing (excluding endpoints).\n\n So we can define a function `intersects(seg1, seg2)` that takes two segments (each segment is a tuple of two points: (A, B) and (C, D)) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\n Now, the algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Read R and B.\n   Step 2: If R != B, print \"No\" and exit.\n   Step 3: Read the R spaceships and B bases, and combine them into two lists: \n           spaceships = [list of R points]\n           bases = [list of B points]\n\n   Step 4: Generate all permutations of the bases (or the spaceships) and for each permutation, assign the j-th base to the j-th spaceship.\n\n   Step 5: For a given assignment (matching): \n           edges = []\n           for i in range(R):\n               base_point = bases_perm[i]\n               spaceship_point = spaceships[i]   # but wait, we are assigning bases to spaceships arbitrarily. Actually, we can fix the spaceship set and assign bases to them.\n\n           But note: the problem does not specify which set is fixed. However, we are free to assign any base to any spaceship. But note: the condition is symmetric? Actually, the condition is about the edges (which are directed from base to spaceship, but the geometric condition is symmetric for the two segments.\n\n           However, we can fix the spaceship set and permute the bases.\n\n   Step 6: For the current matching (a list of edges: each edge is (base_i, spaceship_j)), check every pair of edges (i, j) (with i < j) to see if they intersect.\n\n   Step 7: If we find a matching where none of the edges intersect, then output \"Yes\" and break.\n\n   Step 8: If none of the matchings work, output \"No\".\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the matching is between the two sets arbitrarily. But note: the assignment must be a bijection. We are generating all bijections (permutations of bases for the fixed spaceship set).\n\n But wait: the two sets are distinct. The problem does not specify which set is fixed. Actually, we can choose either. Let me think: the condition for the edges is symmetric. The edges are defined from base to spaceship. But the two sets are fixed by the input.\n\n However, we can also fix the bases and permute the spaceships. But note: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", meaning we are assigning a spaceship to each base. So the matching is from bases to spaceships. Therefore, we should fix the base set and assign each base to a spaceship.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix the spaceship set and assign each spaceship to a base. The condition for the edges is the same: the edge is from base to spaceship. But note: the edges are defined by the base and the spaceship. So the direction doesn't matter for the intersection (since the segment is the same regardless of direction).\n\n However, the problem says: \"from a base to its assigned spaceship\", so the edge is base -> spaceship. But the geometric condition is independent of direction.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   Let S = list of spaceships (fixed)\n   Let B_list = list of bases (to be permuted)\n\n   Then for a permutation p of B_list, we form edges: for i, base in enumerate(B_list): edge = (base, S[i])\n\n   Then we check all pairs of edges.\n\n But wait, we have R = B, so we are matching the base set to the spaceship set.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the matching to be from bases to spaceships, but the condition is symmetric. Actually, the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", so we are assigning a spaceship to each base. This is a matching from bases to spaceships.\n\n But note: the condition of non-intersection is independent of the direction, so we can also consider matching from spaceships to bases and then the edges are from spaceship to base, but the problem states the path is from base to spaceship. However, the segment is the same.\n\n But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship\". So the edge is base -> spaceship. But the condition for non-intersection is the same as for spaceship -> base.\n\n However, we must note: the entire set of edges is defined by the matching. The matching is a bijection from bases to spaceships.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Read R and B. If R != B, output \"No\".\n   Step 2: Read the next R lines for spaceships, and the next B lines for bases.\n\n   Step 3: If R == B, then we have to check all permutations of the bases (which are B! = R! since R=B) and for each permutation, we assign the i-th base to the i-th spaceship (but wait: the assignment is arbitrary. Actually, we can assign the bases arbitrarily to the spaceships. But note: the condition is that the set of edges (from base to spaceship) must not intersect.\n\n   However, we can fix the order of the spaceships arbitrarily (say, the order we read them) and then assign the bases in a permutation.\n\n   But note: the condition for non-intersection is independent of the order of the edges. However, the way we assign (which base goes to which spaceship) matters.\n\n   Example: if we fix the spaceship set and then assign bases to them, then the edges are defined by the base and the spaceship.\n\n   Step 4: We need to check all permutations of the bases (of length R) and for each permutation, form the edges (base[i] to spaceship[i]) and then check that no two edges intersect.\n\n   Step 5: How to check two edges (edge1: from base_a to spaceship_i, edge2: from base_b to spaceship_j) for intersection?\n\n        We represent an edge by (A, B) where A is the base and B is the spaceship.\n\n        Then, we check if the two segments (A, B) and (C, D) intersect.\n\n   Step 6: We must check every pair of edges (i.e., every unordered pair of edges) in the matching.\n\n   However, note: the matching has R edges, and we have to check C(R,2) pairs.\n\n   Step 7: Since R is at most 10, the maximum number of edges is 10, so we have to check 45 pairs per matching. The total number of matchings is 10! = 3628800, and 3628800 * 45 is about 163 million checks. Each check involves 4 cross products (each cross product is a few multiplications and subtractions). This is acceptable in Python? Maybe, but we can optimize by breaking early.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a smarter way: if we fix the spaceship set and sort the bases by some criteria, then we can use a planarity test for the entire set of edges? But note: the edges are not necessarily connected, and we are only concerned with the crossing of the edges.\n\n   However, 163 million * (cost of one check) might be acceptable in Pyton if we code the cross product efficiently.\n\n   Let me estimate: 163e6 * (4 cross products, each cross product: 2 multiplications and 2 subtractions, and then sign checks). Then 163e6 * (about 10 operations) = 1.63e9 operations. In Python, this might be borderline in speed, but note that the problem constraints say that R, B <= 10, and the worst-case is 10, so we have to handle 10. But 10! is 3628800, and 3628800 * 45 is 163296000, which is 163 million. In C++ this would be acceptable, but in Python we might need to optimize.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different approach: we know that the set of edges must form a planar graph. But note: the graph is a complete bipartite graph? No, we are only drawing the matching edges. The entire graph is just a set of edges (a matching) and we require that these edges do not cross.\n\n   There is a known fact: a set of edges (a matching) in the plane (with distinct endpoints) is non-crossing if and only if we can order the edges without crossings. But note: we are fixing the positions of the points.\n\n   Another idea: we can use a recursive backtracking that assigns bases to spaceships one by one, and as we assign, we check that the new edge does not cross any of the already drawn edges. However, the edges are not drawn in any particular order. But note: the condition is global: no two edges cross. So we can break when we add an edge that crosses any existing edge.\n\n   Steps for backtracking:\n\n     Sort the spaceships and bases by some criteria? Or we can try to order by x-coordinate or y-coordinate to reduce the chance of crossing? \n\n     Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        We have two sets: S (spaceships) and B (bases). We want to assign each base to a spaceship so that the edges do not cross.\n\n        We can use a greedy method: sort the bases by x-coordinate, and then assign the leftmost base to the spaceship that is \"visible\" without crossing? \n\n        But note: the problem is small (at most 10) so we can use brute-force by generating all permutations, but we break early if we detect a crossing.\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n            for each permutation (which is 10! ~ 3.6e6) we check 45 pairs. \n\n        But 3.6e6 * 45 is 162e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we might need to write efficient code.\n\n        Let me write the helper function for segment intersection.\n\n   However, we must note: the two sets of points (bases and spaceships) are fixed. We can precompute the list of bases and the list of spaceships.\n\n   Implementation of `segments_intersect`:\n\n        def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            # a, b, c, d are tuples (x,y) representing points.\n            # returns True if the segments (a->b) and (c->d) intersect (properly, not at endpoints, and we know the sets are disjoint so no endpoint is shared)\n\n            # Using cross product method.\n\n            def cross(o, a, b):\n                return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n            # Check the orientation of the triplet (a, b, c) and (a, b, d)\n            def sign(x):\n                if x > 0:\n                    return 1\n                elif x < 0:\n                    return -1\n                else:\n                    return 0\n\n            o1 = sign(cross(a, b, c))\n            o2 = sign(cross(a, b, d))\n            o3 = sign(cross(c, d, a))\n            o4 = sign(cross(c, d, b))\n\n            # If the two segments intersect, then the orientations must be one positive and one negative for both segments.\n            if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0:\n                return True\n            return False\n\n   But note: there is a possibility that the two segments are collinear? The problem states no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   However, wait: the four points are from two segments. It is possible that the four points are not in general position? Actually, the condition \"no three points are collinear\" applies to the entire set of points (spaceships and bases). So the four points are in general position (no three collinear). Therefore, the above function is safe.\n\n   Now, the main loop:\n\n        from itertools import permutations\n\n        spaceships = [...]   # list of R points (each point is (x, y))\n        bases = [...]        # list of B points (each point is (x, y))\n\n        # If R != B, we already returned \"No\"\n\n        # Generate all permutations of bases (which are B = R points)\n        found = False\n        n = R\n        for perm in permutations(bases):\n            # Build the matching: for i in range(n): edge from perm[i] to spaceships[i]\n            edges = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                edges.append( (perm[i], spaceships[i]) )\n\n            # Now check every pair of edges in edges\n            valid = True\n            # We'll check all pairs (i, j) with i < j\n            for i in range(len(edges)):\n                for j in range(i+1, len(edges)):\n                    # Get the two edges: edges[i] = (A, B) and edges[j] = (C, D)\n                    A, B = edges[i]\n                    C, D = edges[j]\n                    if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if not valid:\n                    break\n\n            if valid:\n                found = True\n                break\n\n        if found:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n        else:\n            print(\"No\")\n\n   But wait: is this correct? \n\n   Example: the provided example.\n\n   Example 1: \n        R=3, B=3\n        Spaceships: [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n        Bases: [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\n        One of the permutations is: [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)] -> then edges are:\n            edge1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n            edge2: (0,3) to (2,0)\n            edge3: (2,2) to (3,1)\n\n        Check edge1 and edge2: \n            segment1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n            segment2: (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n            We can plot: \n                segment1: from (-2,1) to (0,0) -> goes down to the right.\n                segment2: from (0,3) to (2,0) -> goes down to the right.\n\n            These two segments: do they cross?\n\n            Let me compute the cross products:\n\n            For segment1 (a=(-2,1), b=(0,0)): \n                cross1 = cross(a, b, c) for c=(0,3): \n                    cross((-2,1), (0,0), (0,3)) = (0 - (-2))*(3-1) - (0-1)*(0 - (-2)) = (2)*(2) - (-1)*(2) = 4 + 2 = 6 -> positive\n                cross2 = cross((-2,1), (0,0), (2,0)) = (2 - (-2))*(0-1) - (0-1)*(0 - (-2)) = (4)*(-1) - (-1)*(2) = -4 + 2 = -2 -> negative.\n\n            So for segment1, the two endpoints (0,3) and (2,0) are on opposite sides.\n\n            Now for segment2 (c=(0,3), d=(2,0)):\n                cross3 = cross((0,3), (2,0), (-2,1)) = (-2-0)*(1-3) - (1-3)*(2-0) = (-2)*(-2) - (-2)*(2) = 4 + 4 = 8 -> positive\n                cross4 = cross((0,3), (2,0), (0,0)) = (0-0)*(0-3) - (0-3)*(2-0) = 0 - (-3)*2 = 6 -> positive.\n\n            Wait, both positive? Then they are on the same side. Therefore, the condition for segment2 fails: we require one positive and one negative.\n\n            So the two segments do not intersect.\n\n            Now check edge1 and edge3, and edge2 and edge3.\n\n            But wait: the example output is \"Yes\", so there must be a matching that works. However, the matching we tried (the identity permutation of the bases) does not work? \n\n            Actually, we must try all permutations. The example says \"one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order\". \n\n            What does \"in order\" mean? \n\n            The input for bases is given as:\n                -2 1\n                0 3\n                2 2\n\n            And the spaceships are given as:\n                0 0\n                2 0\n                3 1\n\n            So if we assign the first base (-2,1) to the first spaceship (0,0), the second base (0,3) to the second spaceship (2,0), and the third base (2,2) to the third spaceship (3,1), then we have the edges as above.\n\n            But we just saw that the first two edges do not intersect, but let me check the second and third, and the first and third.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the example intended a different matching.\n\n            Let me check the example provided in the problem statement: \n\n                Input: \n                    ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', ...]\n\n            The example output: Yes.\n\n            So there exists a matching. Which one?\n\n            Another matching: \n                base1 (-2,1) -> spaceship2 (2,0)\n                base2 (0,3) -> spaceship1 (0,0)\n                base3 (2,2) -> spaceship3 (3,1)\n\n            Then edges:\n                edge1: (-2,1) to (2,0)\n                edge2: (0,3) to (0,0) -> this is a vertical line at x=0 from (0,3) to (0,0)\n                edge3: (2,2) to (3,1)\n\n            Check edge1 and edge2: \n                edge1: from (-2,1) to (2,0)\n                edge2: from (0,3) to (0,0)\n\n                The vertical line at x=0: the edge1 passes through x=-2 to x=2, so it must cross x=0. The edge2 is at x=0 from y=0 to y=3.\n\n                At x=0, edge1: \n                    The equation of edge1: from (-2,1) to (2,0): slope = (0-1)/(2+2) = -1/4.\n                    Equation: y - 1 = (-1/4)(x+2) -> y = (-1/4)x + 1/2 + 1/4? Let me compute: \n                        y = (-1/4)(x+2) + 1\n                    At x=0: y = (-1/4)(2)+1 = -0.5+1 = 0.5.\n\n                So edge1 crosses the vertical edge2 at (0,0.5). \n\n                But note: the endpoints of edge2 are (0,0) and (0,3). The crossing point (0,0.5) is on the segment edge2 (since 0<=0.5<=3) and on edge1 (since x from -2 to 2, and 0 is in [-2,2]). \n\n                However, the problem says the two sets are disjoint and no three points are collinear. \n\n                But wait, the four points: (-2,1), (2,0), (0,3), (0,0) are distinct and no three are collinear. However, the edge1 and edge2 cross at (0,0.5) which is not one of the endpoints. Therefore, this matching is invalid.\n\n            Another matching: \n                base1 (-2,1) -> spaceship3 (3,1)\n                base2 (0,3) -> spaceship2 (2,0)\n                base3 (2,2) -> spaceship1 (0,0)\n\n            Then edges:\n                edge1: (-2,1) to (3,1)  -> horizontal at y=1 from x=-2 to x=3\n                edge2: (0,3) to (2,0)\n                edge3: (2,2) to (0,0)\n\n            Check edge1 and edge2: \n                edge1: (-2,1) to (3,1): horizontal at y=1.\n                edge2: (0,3) to (2,0): goes from (0,3) to (2,0)\n\n                Equation for edge2: from (0,3) to (2,0): slope = (0-3)/(2-0) = -3/2, so y = - (3/2)x + 3.\n\n                Does edge2 cross edge1? At y=1: \n                    1 = - (3/2)x + 3  => (3/2)x = 2 => x = 4/3.\n\n                The x=4/3 is between -2 and 3 (so on edge1) and between 0 and 2 (on edge2). So they cross.\n\n            Another matching:\n                base1 (-2,1) -> spaceship1 (0,0)\n                base2 (0,3) -> spaceship3 (3,1)\n                base3 (2,2) -> spaceship2 (2,0)\n\n            Then edges:\n                edge1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n                edge2: (0,3) to (3,1)\n                edge3: (2,2) to (2,0) -> vertical line at x=2 from y=0 to y=2.\n\n            Check edge1 and edge2: \n                edge1: (-2,1) to (0,0)\n                edge2: (0,3) to (3,1)\n\n                Check with our function:\n\n                For edge1 (a=(-2,1), b=(0,0)) and edge2 (c=(0,3), d=(3,1)):\n\n                o1 = cross(edge1, c): cross((-2,1),(0,0),(0,3)) = (0-(-2))*(3-1) - (0-1)*(0-(-2)) = 2*2 - (-1)*2 = 4+2=6 -> positive.\n                o2 = cross(edge1, d): cross((-2,1),(0,0),(3,1)) = (3-(-2))*(1-1) - (1-1)*(0-(-2)) = 5*0 - 0*2 = 0 -> wait, this is zero? \n\n                But note: the problem states no three points are collinear. However, we are using the entire set of points (which includes the ones used in the segments). The four points: (-2,1), (0,0), (0,3), (3,1). \n\n                The three points (-2,1), (0,0), (0,3) are not collinear, but (0,0) and (3,1) are two points. The cross product for (0,0) and (3,1) with respect to the segment (-2,1) to (0,0) is computed as:\n\n                    cross(o, a, b) for o=(-2,1), a=(0,0), b=(3,1) is:\n                      (0 - (-2))*(1-1) - (0-1)*(3-(-2)) = (2)*(0) - (-1)*(5) = 0 + 5 = 5 -> wait, I did it wrong.\n\n                Let me recalc: \n                    cross(o, a, b) = (a.x - o.x)*(b.y - o.y) - (a.y - o.y)*(b.x - o.x)\n                    o = (-2,1), a=(",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the bases and spaceships to find one where none of the connecting segments cross each other.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (bijection) between two sets of points (bases and spaceships) such that no two connecting segments intersect. The key observation is that if the number of bases (B) and spaceships (R) are not equal, no such matching exists. Otherwise, we must check all possible permutations of assignments.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each permutation of the bases assigned to the spaceships, we need to verify that every pair of segments (from different bases to their respective spaceships) does not intersect. The intersection check is done using the cross product method to determine if the orientations of the segments relative to each other ensure they cross.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints (R and B up to 10), a brute-force approach is feasible. We generate all permutations of the bases and for each permutation, check all pairs of segments for intersections.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of permutations is R! (up to 3,628,800 for R=10). For each permutation, we check C(R, 2) segment pairs (up to 45 for R=10). Each segment intersection check involves a constant-time operation (cross product calculations), making the total operations manageable within Python's capabilities for small inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    R = int(next(it))\n    B = int(next(it))\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(next(it))\n        y = int(next(it))\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(next(it))\n        y = int(next(it))\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    def cross(o, a, b):\n        return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])\n    \n    def sign(x):\n        return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0\n        \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        oa = cross(a, b, c)\n        ob = cross(a, b, d)\n        oc = cross(c, d, a)\n        od = cross(c, d, b)\n        \n        if sign(oa) == sign(ob):\n            return False\n        if sign(oc) == sign(od):\n            return False\n            \n        return True\n        \n    n = R\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        edges = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            edges.append((perm[i], spaceships[i]))\n            \n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(edges)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(edges)):\n                A, B = edges[i]\n                C, D = edges[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers R (number of spaceships) and B (number of bases). If R and B are not equal, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n2. **Storing Points**: The coordinates of the spaceships and bases are stored in separate lists.\n3. **Cross Product and Sign Functions**: These helper functions compute the cross product of three points and determine the sign of the result, which is used to check the orientation of points relative to a segment.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function checks if two segments intersect by verifying that their endpoints lie on opposite sides of each other.\n5. **Permutation Check**: All permutations of the bases are generated. For each permutation, segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship are checked for intersections. If any permutation yields no intersecting segments, the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments to determine if a valid non-intersecting matching exists, leveraging combinatorial generation and geometric intersection checks.",
