Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (l, r, cost)\n We need two vouchers i and j such that:\n   (1) They don't intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n   (2) The sum of their durations is exactly x: (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x.\n\n Let d_i = r_i - l_i + 1 (duration of voucher i)\n\n Then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n We want to minimize cost_i + cost_j.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since the total duration is fixed (x), for each voucher i with duration d, we need a voucher j with duration x-d.\n\n However, we have two conditions for non-overlapping. The condition is: \n   Condition 1: r_i < l_j   OR   Condition 2: r_j < l_i.\n\n Note: Without loss of generality, we can consider the two cases separately.\n\n But note: the condition \"at least one\" is equivalent to saying that the two intervals do not overlap.\n\n We can break down the problem by considering the two cases:\n\n Case 1: The first voucher ends before the second starts (r_i < l_j). Then we can consider:\n   For a fixed voucher i (with duration d_i), we are looking for a voucher j with duration d_j = x - d_i, and also having r_i < l_j.\n\n Case 2: The second voucher ends before the first starts (r_j < l_i). Similarly, we can consider the same set of vouchers but in reverse order.\n\n However, note: if we consider the entire set, then the two cases are symmetric. But we must avoid double counting? Actually, we are just looking for two distinct vouchers. We can process all vouchers and for each duration d, store the vouchers by their duration and by their time intervals.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the duration for each voucher: d = r - l + 1.\n\n 2. We note that the total duration must be x, so we are looking for pairs (d, x-d) for d from 1 to x-1.\n\n 3. We'll create a dictionary (or list of lists) mapping from duration to a list of (l, r, cost) for vouchers with that duration.\n\n However, the condition of non-overlapping complicates things. We need to check for the non-overlapping condition.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can precompute for each duration d, and then for each voucher in duration d, we know it has [l, r]. Then for a complementary duration d2 = x - d, we need a voucher [l2, r2] such that either:\n   Case 1: r < l2   (if we use the first voucher as the first part and the second as the second)\n   Case 2: r2 < l   (if we use the second voucher as the first part and the first as the second)\n\n But note: the problem does not specify which one is first. So we have to consider both orders.\n\n However, we can think: we are going to consider every pair (i, j) such that d_i + d_j = x and the two intervals don't overlap. But iterating over all pairs is O(n^2) and n can be up to 200,000.\n\n So we need an efficient way.\n\n Idea:\n\n Precompute:\n   Let's group vouchers by duration. Then for each duration d, we have a list of intervals (l, r, cost).\n\n Then for each d, let d2 = x - d.\n\n But how to check non-overlap? We have two possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: The first voucher (with duration d) ends before the second (with duration d2) starts: r1 < l2.\n\n Possibility 2: The second voucher ends before the first starts: r2 < l1.\n\n We can process the vouchers by their time (l and r) to quickly query.\n\n However, note that the non-overlapping condition can be broken into two independent conditions. We can try:\n\n For a fixed voucher i (with duration d) and a complementary voucher j (with duration d2), we require that either:\n   r_i < l_j   OR   r_j < l_i.\n\n This is equivalent to the intervals being disjoint.\n\n We can restructure:\n\n We want to consider two sets of vouchers: one set for duration d, and one set for duration d2.\n\n Then, for each voucher in set d, we want to find the cheapest voucher in set d2 that satisfies either condition.\n\n But note: the condition depends on the specific intervals.\n\n We can precompute two structures for each duration? Actually, we don't need to for each duration, but we can preprocess the entire set by storing:\n\n   For each duration, we can store the list of intervals (l, r, cost) and then sort them by l and by r.\n\n Then, for a given voucher (l1, r1) from duration d, we want to consider:\n\n   In the complementary set (duration d2), we want to find a voucher (l2, r2, cost2) such that either:\n        (a) r1 < l2   -> then the interval (l1, r1) is entirely to the left of (l2, r2)\n        (b) r2 < l1   -> then the interval (l2, r2) is entirely to the left of (l1, r1)\n\n And we want the minimal cost2.\n\n How to do this quickly?\n\n We can precompute for each duration d2, two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by l (to quickly find the smallest l that is greater than r1 for condition (a))\n   - One sorted by r (to quickly find the smallest r that is less than l1 for condition (b))\n\n Then, for each voucher in duration d, we can:\n\n   For condition (a): We look in the set for duration d2 for the smallest cost among vouchers that start at l2 > r1.\n\n   For condition (b): We look in the set for duration d2 for the smallest cost among vouchers that end at r2 < l1.\n\n Then we take the minimum cost found from these two conditions (if any) and then combine with the current voucher's cost.\n\n But note: the same voucher cannot be used twice (since i != j). So we have to be careful.\n\n However, we are grouping by duration. It is possible that d == d2, then we are using two different vouchers from the same duration d. But then we have to ensure they are distinct.\n\n Steps for the algorithm:\n\n Step 1: Read input.\n\n Step 2: Create a dictionary `vouchers_by_duration` that maps duration -> list of (l, r, cost).\n\n Step 3: Preprocess each duration group:\n\n   For each duration d, we have a list of tuples (l, r, cost). We will create two sorted lists for the group:\n\n      - One sorted by l (and we can store the entire tuple or just the (l, cost) and then have a separate list for r? Actually, we need to retrieve the minimal cost for a given condition.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d2:\n\n      - A sorted list by l, and then for each element we can store (l, r, cost). Then for condition (a) we want the minimal cost among all vouchers with l > r1.\n\n      - Similarly, a sorted list by r, and for condition (b) we want the minimal cost among all vouchers with r < l1.\n\n   To get the minimal cost for a condition, we can:\n\n      For condition (a): In the sorted-by-l list for duration d2, we want all vouchers with l >= (r1+1) and then take the minimal cost.\n\n      For condition (b): In the sorted-by-r list for duration d2, we want all vouchers with r <= (l1-1) and then take the minimal cost.\n\n   We can preprocess each group by:\n\n      - Sorting by l, and then building a Fenwick tree or segment tree for the costs? Or we can do a simpler thing: since we only need the minimal cost, we can precompute a suffix minimum array for the sorted-by-l list (from highest l to lowest, the minimal cost from that point to the end). Similarly for the sorted-by-r list (from lowest r to highest, the minimal cost from the beginning to that point).\n\n   However, note: we are iterating over many vouchers (up to 200,000) and for each voucher we do two queries (each query in a sorted array of up to 200,000 elements). We need to do this efficiently.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n      For each duration d2, we create:\n\n          list1: sorted by l, and then we build an array min_cost_from_end that for each index i (in the sorted-by-l list) stores the minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n          Similarly, list2: sorted by r, and then build an array min_cost_from_start that for each index i stores the minimum cost from the start to index i.\n\n   Then, for condition (a) for a given r1:\n\n        We want the minimal cost among all vouchers in duration d2 with l > r1.\n\n        In the sorted-by-l list (for duration d2) we can find the first index where l > r1 (using bisect_right or bisect_left). Then the minimal cost from that index to the end is stored in min_cost_from_end at that index.\n\n   Similarly for condition (b):\n\n        We want the minimal cost among all vouchers in duration d2 with r < l1.\n\n        In the sorted-by-r list, we find the last index where r < l1 (using bisect_left for l1, then the last index before that) and then the minimal cost from the start to that index is stored in min_cost_from_start.\n\n   But note: we must avoid using the same voucher twice. However, if d != d2, then the vouchers are from different groups so no conflict. If d == d2, then we are looking at the same group. Then we must not consider a voucher that is the same as the current one? Actually, the problem says two distinct vouchers.\n\n   However, when d == d2, the current voucher (from the same group) is not allowed. But note: we are processing the current voucher (from duration d) and then looking for a voucher from duration d2 (which is the same as d). We must avoid matching the same voucher.\n\n   But wait: we are processing the current voucher (from duration d) and then the complementary set is the same duration d. How do we avoid matching the same voucher? \n\n   Actually, the condition for non-overlapping might hold even for the same voucher? But we are not allowed to use the same voucher. However, the problem requires two distinct vouchers.\n\n   We must ensure that we don't pick the same voucher twice.\n\n   There are two ways:\n\n     1. When d == d2, we have to skip the current voucher when querying the same group.\n\n     2. Alternatively, we can process the two groups separately and then combine.\n\n   However, note: we are iterating over all vouchers in duration d. Then for each voucher, we query the set of vouchers in duration d2 (which is the same as d) excluding the current one? That would be too heavy.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d2 (including d==d2) two data structures (one for condition a and one for condition b) and then when we are processing a voucher in duration d (and d==d2) we can exclude the current voucher by having a separate structure that excludes the current one? But that would complicate.\n\n   Another idea: do not precompute the entire set for the same group, but rather for each group, we precompute two sorted arrays and then for condition (a) and (b) we do:\n\n        candidate1 = query_condition_a(d2, r1)   # returns minimal cost for a voucher in d2 with l > r1, but if d==d2, then we must not include the current voucher? But wait, the current voucher is being considered from the same group, but we haven't removed it.\n\n   Actually, we are storing the entire group. We can do:\n\n        For a given voucher (l1, r1, cost1) in duration d, we want to find in the complementary set (duration d2) a voucher (l2, r2, cost2) such that either condition holds and the voucher is not the same as the current one.\n\n   But if d != d2, then no problem. If d == d2, then we have to exclude the current voucher.\n\n   However, the problem is that the same voucher (same index) is not allowed, but two different vouchers (even if they have the same (l, r, cost)) are allowed? Actually, the input may have duplicate vouchers? The problem does not say they are distinct.\n\n   So we must account for duplicates: two different vouchers (with same (l, r, cost)) are allowed, unless they are the same voucher (same index) but we are storing by duration and the same (l, r, cost) might appear multiple times.\n\n   Actually, the input gives n vouchers. Each voucher is distinct by its index, but the attributes (l, r, cost) might repeat.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot rely solely on (l, r, cost) to identify a voucher. But note: the problem says \"exactly two vouchers\", so if two vouchers have the same (l, r, cost) then they are different.\n\n   However, we are storing by duration. So if two vouchers have the same (l, r, cost) and same duration, they are in the same bucket.\n\n   We must design the data structure for each duration to account for multiple identical vouchers? Actually, we are storing the entire list. Then, when we query, we are getting the minimal cost from the entire list (which might include the current voucher if d==d2). So we have to remove the current voucher from the set for the same duration.\n\n   But wait: we are processing one voucher at a time, and then querying the complementary set. We cannot remove the current voucher from the entire set because we are going to process many.\n\n   Alternatively, we can split the solution:\n\n     We consider two cases: when d != d2 and when d == d2.\n\n   But note: the problem doesn't specify that the two vouchers must be distinct by index. They are distinct by index because they are two different vouchers. However, if there are two identical vouchers (same l, r, cost) then they are two distinct ones. But if we have two identical vouchers, then we can use two of them.\n\n   However, the issue is: if we are in the same duration and we have two identical vouchers, then we can use two different ones (with the same attributes) and they are distinct. But if we are processing one of them, then we must not use the same one again.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"two vouchers i and j (i≠j)\" so they are distinct by index.\n\n   So if we have two identical vouchers, then when we are processing the first one, we should not consider the second one as the same? Actually, no: they are different indices. So we must allow the same (l, r, cost) from different vouchers.\n\n   Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n\n        For each duration d, we have a multiset of (l, r, cost). \n\n        Then, for a voucher (l1, r1, cost1) of duration d:\n\n            We want to find a voucher (l2, r2, cost2) in the multiset of duration d2 (which is x-d) such that:\n\n                (l2, r2) is not the same as (l1, r1) if d == d2? Actually, no: the same (l, r, cost) but from a different index is allowed.\n\n            But wait: the problem doesn't require the two vouchers to be distinct in attributes, only by index. However, we don't have the index in our data structure.\n\n        Therefore, we must store the entire multiset and then when d == d2, we must not match a voucher that is the same as the current one? Actually, we cannot tell by (l, r, cost) alone. \n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify that the two vouchers must be distinct by more than just index. They can have the same (l, r, cost) and still be distinct.\n\n        So the problem: we have two distinct indices i and j. Even if they have the same (l, r, cost), they are allowed.\n\n        But then why would we need to exclude the current one? Because the current one is one occurrence, and there might be another occurrence (same attributes) that we can use.\n\n        Actually, we don't. The only exclusion is that we cannot use the same index twice.\n\n        However, we are storing by duration. The same index is represented once. We are not storing indices.\n\n        So we have a problem: if we store by duration, then we lose the index. But the condition for non-overlapping is defined by the intervals and the cost is additive.\n\n        Therefore, we must design the data structure to be a multiset for each duration.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to use two different vouchers (distinct by index) that have the same (l, r, cost). So we must not remove the current voucher from the multiset when d==d2.\n\n        Then why was the previous concern about the same voucher? The problem says distinct by index, but we are storing by duration. We are not storing the index. Therefore, we cannot distinguish between two vouchers with the same (l, r, cost) and same duration.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"two vouchers i and j (i≠j)\" — meaning two distinct ones. Our data structure does not have the index, so we cannot avoid matching the same voucher if we have duplicates? Actually, we don't have the original index, so if there are two identical vouchers, then when we query we will get the other one.\n\n        However, what if we have two identical vouchers? Then we can use both. But if we have only one, then we cannot use the same one twice.\n\n        But note: we are storing the entire multiset. So if we have two identical, then the multiset has two. Then when we process the first, we query and the second is present. Similarly, when we process the second, we query and the first is present.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the same (l, r, cost) but different indices are stored as two separate elements in the multiset.\n\n        Therefore, we do not need to remove the current one because we are storing the entire multiset and we are not tracking indices.\n\n        But wait: the problem says distinct by index. However, the non-overlapping condition is defined by the intervals. Two different vouchers (with same intervals) are allowed. So the condition is purely on the intervals and the cost.\n\n        However, note: the condition \"don't intersect\" is defined by the intervals. Two identical intervals do not intersect? Actually, they are the same interval. Then condition (a): r_i < l_j -> if the intervals are the same, then r_i >= l_j (because l_j = l_i, and r_i = r_j, and l_i <= r_i, so r_i >= l_j). Similarly, condition (b) fails. Therefore, two identical intervals (same [l, r]) will always intersect (unless one is entirely to the left of the other, but if they are the same, they are not disjoint). So two identical intervals (same [l, r]) will not satisfy the non-overlapping condition.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider: if d == d2 and the current voucher is [l1, r1] and we are looking for a voucher [l2, r2] with the same [l1, r1] (so same duration), then the condition requires that either r1 < l1 (which is false because r1>=l1) or r1 < l1 (again false). So two identical intervals do not form a valid pair.\n\n        But note: two different vouchers with the same [l, r] might form a valid pair? Actually, no: because if two intervals are the same, then they are not disjoint. Therefore, we can safely ignore the case of matching two identical intervals.\n\n        However, what if we have two different intervals (same duration) that are identical? Then they are the same interval. But the problem says: two distinct vouchers (by index). So if the two intervals are the same, then they are not disjoint. Therefore, we cannot use two identical intervals.\n\n        But what if we have two intervals that are the same? Then they are not disjoint, so we cannot use them together.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply store the entire multiset and then for each duration d2, we build two sorted lists (by l and by r) and then compute the minimal cost for the conditions.\n\n        However, we must account for the fact that the same voucher (same index) is not allowed. But we don't have the index. \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the two vouchers to be distinct by index in the data structure. We are storing by duration, and the same index is stored once. But we are going to process each voucher independently.\n\n        But note: the problem states that we choose two distinct vouchers (so two distinct indices). We are iterating over each voucher (each index) and then for each, we consider all other vouchers (all indices) in the complementary set. However, we are grouping by duration. So if a voucher is in duration d, then it is only considered for complementary set d2 = x-d.\n\n        The catch: we are storing the entire multiset for each duration, so we are including all vouchers (all indices) in that duration.\n\n        Then, when we process a voucher (index i) in duration d, we are querying the entire multiset of duration d2 (which includes all indices) for a voucher (any index) that satisfies the non-overlapping condition. But we must not use the same index twice.\n\n        However, the problem says distinct indices. Therefore, we must not match the same index. But we don't have the index in the multiset.\n\n        How to fix?\n\n        We must store the entire multiset and then we must not match the same voucher? But we don't know the index. \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the two vouchers to be distinct by anything other than being two different ones. But if we store by duration, we lose the index. \n\n        However, note: the condition for non-overlapping is independent of the index. But the problem says two distinct vouchers (by index). \n\n        But wait: the same (l, r, cost) from two different indices are two different vouchers. And they are allowed if they are disjoint. \n\n        The issue is: we are storing by duration, and then we are building a data structure for each duration. Then when we query, we are getting the minimal cost from the entire multiset (all indices). Then we are combining two vouchers. But if we have two vouchers with the same (l, r, cost) (same duration) and they are not disjoint, then we can use them together? No, because they are the same interval and hence not disjoint.\n\n        But if they are disjoint? Then we can use them. \n\n        Actually, two different vouchers (different indices) with the same (l, r, cost) are the same interval. Then they are not disjoint (they are the same interval, so they overlap completely). So we cannot use two identical intervals.\n\n        However, what if we have two different intervals (same duration) that are the same? Then they are the same interval. \n\n        But wait, same duration does not imply same interval. For example, two different intervals can have the same duration. \n\n        So the problem is: we are storing by duration, and then we build two sorted lists (by l and by r) and then a minimal cost array. Then we are going to use the entire multiset for the complementary set.\n\n        Then, when we process a voucher, we are allowed to use any voucher from the complementary set (as long as it satisfies the condition). And if the same voucher (same index) appears twice? Actually, no: we are storing by duration and we are reading the input once. Each voucher is stored once.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have the same voucher (same index) in the same duration set. We are storing each voucher once.\n\n        But wait: the same voucher (same index) is stored in one duration set. Then when we process it, we are going to query the complementary set and the same voucher (same index) is not in the complementary set (unless d2 = d and the same voucher is in both? no, because the same voucher is stored in the set for duration d, and we are querying the set for duration d2). \n\n        Actually, the same voucher (index i) is stored in duration d_i. Then we are processing it in the set for duration d_i. Then we query the set for duration d2 = x - d_i. The same voucher i is not in that set, unless d_i = d2 and the same voucher i is stored in the set for duration d_i (which it is) and then we are querying the same set. But then we are allowing the same voucher? \n\n        Wait, no: the set for duration d2 (when d_i = d2) is the same set as the set we are processing. But we are processing the voucher i and we are querying the same set. Then we are including voucher i itself? \n\n        We must not include the same voucher (same index) twice.\n\n        Therefore, we must remove the current voucher from the set for the same duration when d==d2.\n\n        But we are building the data structure for each duration at the beginning. Then we cannot update the data structure for each query (because n is up to 200,000 and the number of queries is 200,000, and updating the data structure for each query would be too slow).\n\n        Alternative: Instead, we can precompute the entire data structure for each duration, and then for each voucher, we consider the complementary set. But if d==d2, then we cannot use the same voucher. However, we don't know which ones are the same.\n\n        Another idea: Instead of storing the entire multiset, we store the entire multiset and then for each duration, we build two structures (for condition a and b) that are static (the entire set). Then, when d==d2, we have to subtract the current voucher's effect.\n\n        But note: the current voucher is one occurrence. And the data structure for the complementary set (same duration) is built from all occurrences. Then, we can do:\n\n            candidate_cost = query_condition_a(d2, r1)   [minimal cost in d2 with l > r1]\n            candidate_cost2 = query_condition_b(d2, l1)   [minimal cost in d2 with r < l1]\n\n            Then, if d==d2, we must check if the minimal cost we got comes from the current voucher. But we don't know which voucher gave the minimal cost.\n\n        This becomes messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d, two sorted lists (by l and by r) and then two arrays for the minimal cost (suffix and prefix). Then, we can store the entire multiset and then for each voucher, we query the complementary set without worrying about removal. Then, if d==d2, we have to subtract the current voucher from the set? But we cannot because the set is static.\n\n        We can do two passes: one for d != d2 and one for d == d2, but then we have to update the data structure for the same duration for each query (which is too slow).\n\n        Another idea: We can store for each duration d the entire multiset, and then for each duration d, we build:\n\n            list_l[d]: sorted list of (l, cost) for all vouchers in d.\n            list_r[d]: sorted list of (r, cost) for all vouchers in d.\n\n            Then, we precompute:\n\n                min_cost_by_l[d] = an array that for each index i in list_l[d] (sorted by l) stores the minimum cost from i to the end (suffix minima).\n\n                min_cost_by_r[d] = an array that for each index i in list_r[d] (sorted by r) stores the minimum cost from the beginning to i (prefix minima).\n\n        Then, for a voucher (l1, r1, cost1) in duration d:\n\n            Let d2 = x - d.\n\n            If d2 not in the dictionary (or no voucher in d2), then skip.\n\n            Else:\n\n                Condition (a): Find in list_l[d2] the first index where l >= r1+1 (actually, we want l > r1, so l >= r1+1). Then the minimal cost from that index to the end is min_cost_by_l[d2][index].\n\n                Condition (b): Find in list_r[d2] the last index where r <= l1-1. Then the minimal cost from the start to that index is min_cost_by_r[d2][index].\n\n            Then candidate = min(candidate_a, candidate_b) [if available]\n\n            Then total_cost = cost1 + candidate\n\n            Then update global answer.\n\n        Now, the issue: if d == d2, then the current voucher is in the set d2. So the query might return the current voucher? But the current voucher has [l1, r1] and we are querying for condition (a): l2 > r1. But the current voucher has l1, and we are processing the current voucher with [l1, r1]. Condition (a) requires l2 > r1. The current voucher's l1 might be <= r1 (because the voucher is [l1, r1]), so it won't be included in condition (a). Similarly, condition (b) requires r2 < l1. The current voucher's r1 might be >= l1, so condition (b) also fails.\n\n        Therefore, even if we query the same duration set, the current voucher (if present) will not satisfy either condition. So we don't need to remove it.\n\n        Why?\n\n        Condition (a): We require l2 > r1. The current voucher has l1, and we know that the voucher's own condition is that l1 <= r1 (because the interval [l1, r1] is valid). Therefore, l1 <= r1, so the condition (a) for the current voucher is l1 > r1 -> false.\n\n        Condition (b): We require r2 < l1. The current voucher has r1, and we know that r1 >= l1 (because the interval [l1, r1] is valid). Therefore, r1 < l1 is false.\n\n        Therefore, the current voucher (if present in the complementary set) will not be selected by the conditions. So we don't need to remove it.\n\n        Therefore, we can proceed as follows:\n\n            Precompute:\n                d_to_vouchers = defaultdict(list)\n                for each voucher (l, r, cost):\n                    d = r - l + 1\n                    d_to_vouchers[d].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n            Then, for each duration d, we create two lists:\n\n                list_l[d] = sorted( [(l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in d_to_vouchers[d]] )   # sort by l\n                list_r[d] = sorted( [(r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in d_to_vouchers[d]] )   # sort by r\n\n            Then, for each duration d, we create:\n\n                # For condition a (query by l): we want to quickly get the minimal cost for all vouchers with l >= a given value (say, L0)\n                # Build a suffix minimum array for list_l: \n                #   Sort list_l by l (which we did). Then, we traverse from high l to low l and keep the minimum cost from that point to the end.\n\n                # Similarly, for condition b (query by r): we want the minimal cost for all vouchers with r <= a given value (say, R0)\n                #   Sort list_r by r. Then, we traverse from low r to high r and keep the minimum cost from the beginning to that point.\n\n            Steps for building the suffix min for list_l[d]:\n\n                sorted_list = list_l[d]  # already sorted by l\n                min_suffix = [0] * len(sorted_list)\n                # Traverse from last element to first:\n                min_val = float('inf')\n                for i in range(len(sorted_list)-1, -1, -1):\n                    l_val, cost_val = sorted_list[i]\n                    if cost_val < min_val:\n                        min_val = cost_val\n                    min_suffix[i] = min_val\n\n                But then, we need to map a given L0 to the first index with l >= L0. Then the minimal cost from that index is min_suffix[index].\n\n            Similarly for list_r[d]:\n\n                sorted_list = list_r[d]   # sorted by r\n                min_prefix = [0] * len(sorted_list)\n                min_val = float('inf')\n                for i in range(len(sorted_list)):\n                    r_val, cost_val = sorted_list[i]\n                    if cost_val < min_val:\n                        min_val = cost_val\n                    min_prefix[i] = min_val\n\n            Then, for each voucher in duration d (with d1 = d):\n\n                d2 = x - d\n                if d2 not in d_to_vouchers: \n                    continue\n\n                # Condition (a): We need a voucher in d2 with l > r1 (where r1 is the r of the current voucher)\n                #   In list_l[d2]: find the first index i such that l >= r1+1 (we can use bisect_left for r1+1)\n                arr = list_l[d2]   # list of (l, cost) sorted by l\n                target = r1 + 1   # we want l >= target\n                idx = bisect.bisect_left(arr, (target, 0))   # arr is list of (l, cost) so we can compare by l first.\n\n                if idx < len(arr):\n                    candidate_a = min_suffix[d2][idx]   # but wait, we built min_suffix for the entire list_l[d2]?

So we can find the largest r that is < l1, which is the same as the last index with r < l1.\n\n                # Using bisect_left on arr for (l1) returns the first index with r >= l1.\n                idx = bisect.bisect_left(arr, (l1, 0))   # arr is list of (r, cost); we want r < l1, so the index returned is the first index with r>=l1, then the valid ones are from 0 to idx-1.\n\n                if idx > 0:\n                    candidate_b = min_prefix[d2][idx-1]   # because min_prefix[d2] is built for indices 0 to idx-1\n                else:\n                    candidate_b = None\n\n                Then, if candidate_a is not None and candidate_b is not None:\n                    total = cost1 + min(candidate_a, candidate_b)\n                    update global answer.\n\n                Or, if one is None, then use the other.\n\n            But note: we built the min_suffix and min_prefix for each duration d2.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping the vouchers by their duration and then querying for complementary durations while ensuring the intervals do not overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration (i.e., the number of days they last). This helps in quickly accessing all vouchers that can potentially form a pair with a given voucher.\n2. **Sorting and Preprocessing**: For each duration group, we sort the vouchers by their start day (`l`) and end day (`r`). We then preprocess these sorted lists to create suffix and prefix minimum cost arrays. These arrays allow us to efficiently query the minimum cost voucher that meets specific conditions (either starting after a certain day or ending before a certain day).\n3. **Querying Complementary Durations**: For each voucher, we determine the complementary duration needed to sum up to `x`. Using the preprocessed data structures, we then query the complementary duration group for vouchers that do not overlap with the current voucher. The non-overlapping condition is checked by ensuring one voucher ends before the other starts.\n4. **Finding Minimum Cost**: For each valid pair found during the query, we compute the total cost and keep track of the minimum cost encountered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    d_to_vouchers = defaultdict(list)\n    for (l, r, cost_val) in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        d_to_vouchers[d].append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    dict_list_l = {}\n    dict_min_suffix = {}\n    dict_list_r = {}\n    dict_min_prefix = {}\n    \n    for d, v_list in d_to_vouchers.items():\n        list_l = []\n        list_r = []\n        for (l, r, cost_val) in v_list:\n            list_l.append((l, cost_val))\n            list_r.append((r, cost_val))\n            \n        list_l.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        list_r.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        \n        dict_list_l[d] = list_l\n        arr = list_l\n        min_suffix_arr = [0]*len(arr)\n        cur_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):\n            cur_min = min(cur_min, arr[i][1])\n            min_suffix_arr[i] = cur_min\n        dict_min_suffix[d] = min_suffix_arr\n        \n        dict_list_r[d] = list_r\n        arr = list_r\n        min_prefix_arr = [0]*len(arr)\n        cur_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            cur_min = min(cur_min, arr[i][1])\n            min_prefix_arr[i] = cur_min\n        dict_min_prefix[d] = min_prefix_arr\n        \n    best_ans = float('inf')\n    for d1, v_list in d_to_vouchers.items():\n        d2 = x - d1\n        if d2 < 1 or d2 not in dict_list_l:\n            continue\n            \n        for (l1, r1, cost1) in v_list:\n            candidate_a = None\n            candidate_b = None\n            \n            arr_l = dict_list_l[d2]\n            target_a = r1 + 1\n            pos = bisect.bisect_left(arr_l, (target_a, 0))\n            if pos < len(arr_l):\n                candidate_a = dict_min_suffix[d2][pos]\n                \n            arr_r = dict_list_r[d2]\n            target_b = l1\n            pos = bisect.bisect_left(arr_r, (target_b, 0))\n            if pos > 0:\n                candidate_b = dict_min_prefix[d2][pos-1]\n                \n            if candidate_a is None and candidate_b is None:\n                continue\n                \n            total_cost = cost1\n            if candidate_a is not None:\n                total_cost = min(total_cost, cost1 + candidate_a)\n            if candidate_b is not None:\n                total_cost = min(total_cost, cost1 + candidate_b)\n                \n            if total_cost < best_ans:\n                best_ans = total_cost\n                \n    if best_ans == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(best_ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration (calculated as `end - start + 1`). This allows efficient access to vouchers that can form pairs with a given voucher.\n3. **Sorting and Preprocessing**: For each duration group, vouchers are sorted by their start and end days. Suffix and prefix minimum cost arrays are built to quickly find the cheapest voucher that meets specific temporal conditions (starting after a certain day or ending before a certain day).\n4. **Querying Complementary Durations**: For each voucher, the complementary duration (to sum to `x`) is calculated. The preprocessed data structures are queried to find the cheapest non-overlapping voucher from the complementary duration group.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum total cost from all valid pairs is tracked and printed. If no valid pairs are found, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and preprocessing, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
