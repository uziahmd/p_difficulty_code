After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: first line has n and m, then n lines with m characters (each row is a string of m digits)\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines (each containing m characters) and store as a list of strings.\n\n However, note: the input example is given as a string that includes the two integers and then the marks. But the problem says:\n   The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100)\n   Next n lines each containing m characters\n\n But the example input is provided as:\n   ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n Actually, we can read from stdin. Let me assume the input comes from standard input.\n\n Approach:\n For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), we can find the maximum mark in that subject. Then, for each student i, \n if there exists at least one subject j for which the student's mark is equal to the maximum mark of that subject (and note: even if there are multiple students with the same maximum mark, they are all considered best for that subject), then the student is successful.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So having the maximum mark is necessary and sufficient.\n\n But note: what if there are multiple students with the same maximum? Then they are all best for that subject.\n\n So for each student, we need to check: for at least one subject, the student's mark is the maximum for that subject.\n\n Steps in code:\n\n 1. Parse the first line to get n and m.\n 2. Read the next n lines (each as a string of length m).\n 3. Create a list for the marks for each student (we have n students, each with m marks).\n\n Alternatively, we can transpose the data: for each subject, we have a list of marks from all students.\n\n Then, for each subject j, let max_j = max( marks[j][i] for i in range(n) ) [But note: the input is given as rows of students, so if we store by student, then we need to iterate per subject]\n\n Let's structure the data:\n\n Option 1: Store the marks in a 2D list where the first dimension is student index (0 to n-1) and the second is subject (0 to m-1).\n\n Then, we can do:\n\n   # Precompute the maximum for each subject (each column)\n   subject_max = [0] * m\n   for j in range(m):\n        col = [marks[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        subject_max[j] = max(col)\n\n   Then for each student i, check:\n        for j in range(m):\n            if marks[i][j] == subject_max[j]:\n                then this student is successful (at least one subject) -> break inner loop.\n\n But note: we don't need to break for counting, but we can set a flag and break once found.\n\n However, we are only required to count the number of successful students.\n\n Alternatively, we can also think: for a student, we don't necessarily need to check every subject. But since n and m are small (<=100), it's acceptable.\n\n Example: First sample\n   Input: \n      3 3\n      223\n      232\n      112\n\n   We have 3 students and 3 subjects.\n\n   Represent as:\n      student0: ['2','2','3']\n      student1: ['2','3','2']\n      student2: ['1','1','2']\n\n   subject_max for subject0: max('2','2','1') -> '2'\n            subject1: max('2','3','1') -> '3'\n            subject2: max('3','2','2') -> '3'\n\n   Now check student0:\n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> successful.\n   student1:\n        subject0: '2' == '2' -> successful.\n   student2:\n        subject0: '1' != '2'\n        subject1: '1' != '3'\n        subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n   So output 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read n and m from the first line.\n\n   Then read the next n lines.\n\n   Let data = []\n   for i in range(n):\n        s = input().strip()\n        data.append(list(s))\n\n   Then compute the subject_max list.\n\n   Then for each student i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of each student in each subject.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student in that subject. This involves transposing the data to process columns (subjects) instead of rows (students).\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful. The solution involves iterating through each student's marks and comparing them against the precomputed maximum marks for each subject.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    \n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    marks_list = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        if len(s) != m:\n            s = s[:m]\n        marks_list.append(list(s))\n        \n    subject_max = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [marks_list[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        subject_max[j] = max(col)\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if marks_list[i][j] == str(subject_max[j]):\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line contains the integers n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Data Preparation**: The marks for each student are stored as a list of lists (`marks_list`), where each inner list represents a student's marks across all subjects.\n3. **Subject Maximum Calculation**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by examining all students' marks in that subject. This is stored in `subject_max`.\n4. **Successful Student Check**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark (`subject_max`) for that subject. If so, the student is marked as successful, and their contribution is added to the count.\n5. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input data, leverages simple loops for comparison, and ensures optimal performance given the constraints (n and m up to 100). The solution is straightforward and easy to understand, focusing on clear logic and minimal computational overhead.",
