There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n The tournament is knockout. We are to find the maximum number of games the winner can play, under the rule that two players can play only if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\n Observation:\n\n In a knockout tournament, the total number of games is fixed (n-1) but the winner must win all his games and the structure must follow the given rule.\n\n Let's denote by f(n) the maximum number of games the winner can play in a tournament with n players.\n\n Consider how the tournament can be structured. The winner must win k games. Then, the tournament must have at least k rounds, and the structure must allow the winner to play k games without violating the condition.\n\n However, note the condition: two players can play only if the difference in their previous games is at most one.\n\n We can think of building a bracket that allows the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n Another approach: the entire tournament forms a binary tree (if we ignore the possibility of having more than two players per round, which we do because it's knockout). But note: the rule is about the number of games already played, which corresponds to the level (or depth) in the tree.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to the \"Allergy Tournament\" or \"King of the Hill\" type.\n\n However, note the example: \n   n=2 -> 1 game\n   n=3 -> 2 games\n   n=4 -> 2 games\n   n=10 -> 4 games\n\n What is happening?\n\n Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then, the tournament must have at least 2^k players? Not exactly.\n\n Alternatively, consider:\n\n After k wins, the winner has played k games. The condition for the matches is that the next match (the (k+1)-th) can only be against a player who has played at most k-1 or k games? Actually, the rule says: the number of games one has played must differ by at most one from the other.\n\n So, when the winner has played k games, then the next opponent must have played either k-1, k, or k+1 games? But wait, the winner hasn't played the next game yet, so the opponent must have a number of games (which we'll call x) such that |x - k| <= 1.\n\n However, note: the opponent must have won all his previous matches. So the opponent is also a winner from his own subtree.\n\n The key is to determine the minimum number of players required for a winner to play k games.\n\n Let F(k) be the minimum number of players needed so that one player can win k games under the given rule.\n\n How do we build F(k)?\n\n - To have the first game (k=1): you need 2 players. Then the winner plays 1 game.\n\n - For k=2: the winner must play two games. In the first game, he beats someone. Then, he must beat someone else. But note: the rule says that the second opponent must have played at most 1 game (since the winner has played 1 game, so the difference must be at most 1). However, the second opponent must have won his first game. So the second opponent must come from a subtree that has at least 2 players (so that he won one game). Therefore, the total players: the winner's first opponent and the entire subtree for the second opponent: 1 (the winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 2 (second opponent's subtree) = 4. But wait, we can structure it differently.\n\n Actually, the winner's two opponents can be arranged in two different ways:\n\n Option 1: \n   Round 1: [Winner vs A] and [B vs C]\n   Then, the winner (who has 1 win) plays the winner of B vs C (who has 1 win). This is allowed (same number of games). Then, we have:\n        Winner: 2 wins.\n        The two byes (if any) are not used.\n\n   Total players: 1 (winner) + 1 (A) + 2 (B and C) = 4.\n\n Option 2: \n   But what if we have 3 players? Then the first two play, and the winner then must play the third. But the third hasn't played any game. Then the winner has 1 game, and the third has 0. The difference is 1, so allowed. Then the winner would have 2 wins. So for n=3, the winner can have 2 wins.\n\n However, the examples say:\n   n=3 -> output 2\n\n So the minimal number of players for k=2 is 3.\n\n Therefore, our initial thought for F(k) must account for two types",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in their previous games is at most one. The solution involves understanding the tournament structure and finding the minimal number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is knockout, meaning each player must win all their matches to continue. The key observation is that the winner's path through the tournament must adhere to the rule where each subsequent opponent has a game count differing by at most one from the winner's current game count.\n2. **Insight**: The problem can be broken down into finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) games does not exceed \\( n \\). This minimal number of players for \\( k \\) games is given by the sum of a geometric series: \\( 2^k - 1 \\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use binary search to efficiently find the maximum \\( k \\) (number of games) such that \\( 2^k - 1 \\leq n \\). The binary search operates over possible values of \\( k \\), checking if the minimal players needed for \\( k \\) games fit within \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    low, high = 0, n\n    ans = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        total_players_needed = (1 << mid) - 1\n        if total_players_needed < n:\n            ans = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` set to 0 and `high` set to \\( n \\), representing the range of possible games the winner could play.\n2. **Mid Calculation**: For each midpoint `mid`, compute the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `mid` games, which is \\( 2^{\\text{mid}} - 1 \\).\n3. **Adjust Search Range**: If the computed players are less than \\( n \\), it means the winner can potentially play more than `mid` games, so we adjust `low` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, we adjust `high` to `mid - 1`.\n4. **Result Storage**: The highest valid `mid` value (stored in `ans`) is printed as the result, representing the maximum number of games the winner can play under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible number of games using binary search, leveraging the properties of geometric series to determine the minimal tournament size required for each potential number of games. The solution handles very large values of \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)) efficiently due to the logarithmic nature of binary search.",
