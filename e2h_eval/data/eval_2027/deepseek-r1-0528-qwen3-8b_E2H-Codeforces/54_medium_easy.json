Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a.\n We have a regular convex n-gon with vertices numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on its sides) is as close as possible to `a` (in degrees).\n\n Note: In a regular convex polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n How to think about the problem?\n\n The angle we form is at vertex v2. The two sides of the angle are from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n Since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 can be expressed in terms of the number of edges (or vertices) from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the angle to be formed by two consecutive sides of the polygon, but by two rays from v2 passing through two other vertices.\n\n Actually, we are allowed to choose any three distinct vertices.\n\n Observation:\n\n In a circle (the circumcircle of the regular polygon), the angle at v2 (which is an inscribed angle) is half the absolute difference of the arcs (the two arcs between v1 and v3). But note: the angle is measured from the two sides, so the two points v1 and v3 must lie on opposite sides of the chord from v2 to the center? Actually, the angle at v2 can be computed by considering the two arcs: the arc from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3, but wait, there are two ways to split the circle.\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire circle is 360 degrees. The two arcs (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3) can be measured in terms of the number of edges. Let d1 be the number of edges from v2 to v1 (along one direction) and d2 the number of edges from v2 to v3 (along the other direction). Then the total circle is divided into two arcs: one of length d1 and the other of length (n - d1 - 1) [if we consider the vertices] but actually, we are dealing with edges so the central angles are multiples of 360/n.\n\n However, note: the angle we form is actually the angle between two chords from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. This angle is equal to 180° minus the central angle subtended by the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2? Actually, there's a formula for the inscribed angle: it is half the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\n But wait, the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. So the measure is (arc from v1 to v3 not containing v2) / 2.\n\n However, note: the entire circle is 360°, and the two arcs from v1 to v3 (one containing v2 and one not) sum to 360°. Therefore, the arc not containing v2 is 360° - (arc containing v2). But the inscribed angle uses the opposite arc.\n\n Alternatively, we can also consider the two points v1 and v3 and the two arcs they form. The angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to v2 (i.e., the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't pass through v2). But note: the problem does not specify which side is the angle, so we are free to choose the two sides.\n\n Actually, we can use the following:\n\n The angle at v2 is:\n   angle = (arc_length_opposite) * (180) / (n * (arc_length_opposite in terms of edges?))\n\n Let me reframe:\n\n In a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n\n Consider two vertices v1 and v3. The arc from v1 to v3 (the minor arc) has k edges, then the central angle is k*(360/n) and the inscribed angle (at a point v2 on the remaining part of the circle) is half the central angle if the point is on the major arc? Or is it half the difference of the arcs?\n\n Actually, the inscribed angle theorem says: the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\n In our case, the angle at v2 intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. So if we let the intercepted arc (from v1 to v3 without going through v2) have central angle x, then the inscribed angle is x/2.\n\n But note: the entire circle is 360°. The intercepted arc is the one opposite to the angle. How do we express x in terms of the polygon?\n\n Alternatively, we can fix v2 and then consider two directions (clockwise and counterclockwise). Let the two points be at distances d1 and d2 (in terms of steps, i.e., edges) from v2. Then the intercepted arc is the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2, which has length (n - d1 - d2) edges? Actually, no.\n\n Let me define:\n\n Let the polygon have vertices 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 (we'll map to 1-indexed later). Fix vertex v2 at 0.\n\n Then, let v1 be at position -d (so d steps counterclockwise) and v3 be at position e (e steps clockwise). Then the total circle is divided into two arcs: the arc from v1 to v2 (length d) and from v2 to v3 (length e). The remaining arc from v3 to v1 (going the long way) is n - d - e.\n\n However, the angle at v2 intercepts the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. In this representation, the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc going from v1 to v3 that passes through the other side, which is the arc of length (n - d - e) (if we consider the entire circle as n edges). \n\n But wait, the inscribed angle theorem applies when the angle is formed by two chords from a point on the circle. The intercepted arc is the one that is \"seen\" by the angle, i.e., the arc between v1 and v3 that is opposite to the angle. In our setup, the arc opposite to the angle (not containing v2) is the one that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through the segment from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3. Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that is the complement of the two arcs we have (from v1 to v2 and from v2 to v3) in the circle? \n\n Actually, the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not include v2. The length of that arc is (d + e) because from v1 to v2 is d edges (so d+1 vertices including endpoints, but we are talking about edges) and from v2 to v3 is e edges. Then the arc from v1 to v3 via v2 has d+e edges? But the entire circle is n edges, so the other arc (without v2) is n - (d+e) edges.\n\n Then the central angle for the intercepted arc is (n - (d+e)) * (360/n) degrees? Then the inscribed angle would be half of that.\n\n But wait, the inscribed angle theorem: the angle is half the intercepted arc (central angle). So:\n\n   angle = ( (n - (d+e)) * 360 / n ) / 2 = (n - d - e) * (180/n)\n\n However, note: the above reasoning is for the case when the angle is formed by two chords and the intercepted arc is the one opposite. But in our setup, we fixed v2 and chose two points: one at d edges counterclockwise and one at e edges clockwise. Then the intercepted arc (the one opposite) is the entire rest of the circle, which is n - (d+e) edges.\n\n But is that correct? Let's test with a square (n=4). Suppose we take a square: vertices 0,1,2,3.\n\n Example: \n   n=4, a=45 -> we want an angle of 45.\n\n   If we fix v2 at 0, and take v1 at 3 (so d=1) and v3 at 1 (so e=1). Then the intercepted arc is from 3 to 1 without going through 0: that arc has 2 edges (edges 2 and 3? Actually, the edges are: from 3 to 0 is edge 3, from 0 to 1 is edge 0. The arc from 3 to 1 that does not go through 0: that would be the arc from 3 to 2 to 1, which has 2 edges (edges 2 and 3, but wait: edges are between consecutive vertices). Actually, we have to be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following approach:\n\n In a regular n-gon, the angle at vertex v2 between two vertices v1 and v3 (with v1 and v3 on the two sides) can be calculated by:\n\n   angle = 180 - ( (d + e) * (360 / n) ) / 2   ??? \n\n Wait, let me think differently. There is a known fact: in a regular polygon, the interior angle is ((n-2)/n)*180. But that's the interior angle of the polygon itself, which is formed by two consecutive sides. That is fixed for the polygon.\n\n But here, we are forming an angle at a vertex by two chords that are not necessarily consecutive. The angle can be any value between 0 and 180 (since it's a convex polygon).\n\n Another known fact: the angle between two chords intersecting at a point on the circle (v2) is half the difference of the intercepted arcs? Actually, that is for two chords that cross inside the circle. Here, the chords are from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3, so they only meet at v2.\n\n Actually, the inscribed angle theorem says: the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the one that the angle \"sees\", which is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n In our example of the square (n=4) with v2 at 0, v1 at 3, and v3 at 1:\n\n   The intercepted arc from v1 to v3 (without v2) is the arc from 3 to 1 that goes through 2, which is two edges (so central angle 180 degrees). Then the inscribed angle is 90 degrees.\n\n But wait, the problem says that in the square we can form 45 or 90 degrees. \n\n How to get 45 degrees? \n   We can take two consecutive edges from v2. For example, v2 at 0, v1 at 3 (adjacent) and v3 at 1 (adjacent). Then the intercepted arc is the arc from 3 to 1 that goes through 0? Actually, no: the intercepted arc for the angle at 0 between 3 and 1 is the arc from 3 to 1 that does not contain 0? That arc is the one that goes from 3 to 2 to 1, which is 180 degrees, giving 90 degrees.\n\n Alternatively, if we take v1 at 3 and v3 at 2 (so from 0, we take two edges clockwise: 0->1->2, so e=2, and one edge counterclockwise: d=1). Then the intercepted arc is the arc from 3 to 2 that does not contain 0? The entire circle: from 3 to 2, the direct way is 1 edge (edge 2) but the other way is 3 edges (from 3 to 0 to 1 to 2). Since the inscribed angle is defined by the intercepted arc that is opposite, we take the minor arc? Actually, the inscribed angle is always taken for the minor arc? No, the theorem states: the angle is half the intercepted arc (the one that is intercepted by the two rays). In a circle, the intercepted arc is the one that lies in the interior of the angle. \n\n Actually, the inscribed angle theorem states: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that lies in the interior of the angle.\n\n In our square, if we form an angle at 0 that is 45 degrees, then the intercepted arc must be 90 degrees. How to achieve that?\n\n Let me consider: from vertex 0, we draw two chords to vertices that are two edges apart in one direction and one edge apart in the other? \n\n Alternatively, note that the problem allows any three distinct vertices. So in the square, we can also form:\n\n   Option 1: vertices 0, 1, 2 -> angle at 0: the two sides are from 0 to 1 and from 0 to 2. The intercepted arc for the angle at 0 is the arc from 1 to 2 (minor arc) which is 90 degrees, so the angle is 45 degrees.\n\n   Option 2: vertices 0, 1, 3 -> angle at 0: the two sides are from 0 to 1 and from 0 to 3. The intercepted arc is the arc from 1 to 3 that does not contain 0, which is the arc from 1 to 2 to 3 (270 degrees) but wait, we usually take the minor arc? Actually, the inscribed angle theorem uses the intercepted arc that is the one between the two points (v1 and v3) that is facing the angle. In this case, the angle at 0 for the two points 1 and 3: the two points 1 and 3 are adjacent to 0. The angle at 0 is the exterior angle? Actually, in a square, the angle at 0 between 0-1 and 0-3 is the same as the angle between two adjacent sides, which is 90 degrees.\n\n So how do we compute the angle?\n\n Let me fix v2 and two other vertices v1 and v3. Without loss of generality, assume the vertices are arranged in a circle.\n\n We can label the vertices 0 to n-1 (then convert to 1-indexed by adding 1). Let the positions of v1, v2, v3 be i, j, k (with j fixed as v2). Then the two arcs from j to i and j to k. The angle at j is determined by the two arcs: the one from j to i and j to k, and the intercepted arc is the one that goes from i to k without passing through j.\n\n But note: the entire circle is 360 degrees. The two arcs from j to i and j to k (the ones we traverse to get to i and k) are of lengths L1 and L2 (in terms of central angles). Then the intercepted arc (opposite) is 360 - (L1 + L2). Then the angle is (360 - (L1 + L2)) / 2.\n\n However, in the square example with j=0, i=1, k=2: \n   L1 (from 0 to 1) is 90 degrees, L2 (from 0 to 2) is 180 degrees? Actually, no: the central angle for an edge is 90 degrees. The arc from 0 to 1 is 90 degrees, and the arc from 0 to 2 is 180 degrees (because 2 edges). Then the intercepted arc is 360 - (90+180) = 90 degrees, so the angle is 45 degrees.\n\n But wait, if we take j=0, i=1, k=3: \n   Arc from 0 to 1: 90, arc from 0 to 3: 90 (because from 0 to 3 is one edge in the opposite direction, so central angle 90). Then the intercepted arc is 360 - (90+90) = 180 degrees, so the angle is 90 degrees.\n\n This matches.\n\n So the formula: \n   Let the central angles for the two arcs (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3) be (d1 * (360/n)) and (d2 * (360/n)), where d1 and d2 are the number of edges from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 (taking the shorter arc? Actually, we are allowed to go either way, but note: the two arcs we consider must be the ones that do not contain the other vertex? \n\n However, we must consider the entire circle. The intercepted arc is the rest of the circle, so we must take the two arcs that together with the intercepted arc make up the entire circle.\n\n But note: the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two parts we are measuring. The intercepted arc is the rest. However, we must be cautious: the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two sides of the angle, and they are adjacent to v2. The intercepted arc is the opposite one.\n\n How do we determine d1 and d2?\n\n We can define d1 as the minimum number of edges from v2 to v1 (either clockwise or counterclockwise) and similarly d2 for v3. But wait, the angle we form is determined by the two chosen directions. Actually, the two points v1 and v3 must be on the two sides of the angle, meaning that the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two sides. However, the intercepted arc is the one that is the complement.\n\n But note: the entire circle is 360. The two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (the ones we use for the sides) must be the ones that are adjacent and not overlapping. Actually, the two arcs we use must be disjoint and together with the intercepted arc they cover the entire circle.\n\n However, we can also consider that the two sides of the angle are two chords from v2. The two arcs (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3) are the two parts that we don't use for the intercepted arc.\n\n But wait, the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. How do we compute the central angle for the intercepted arc?\n\n Let the entire circle be 360. The two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (the ones we are using for the sides) are the ones that are adjacent to v2. The intercepted arc is the rest. The length of the intercepted arc in terms of edges is: (n - (d1 + d2))? \n\n Actually, if we go from v2 to v1, we can go either clockwise or counterclockwise. Similarly for v3. But the two sides of the angle must be two distinct sides, so we are effectively splitting the circle into three arcs: the arc from v1 to v2 (of length d1), the arc from v2 to v3 (of length d2), and the arc from v3 to v1 (which is the intercepted arc, of length n - d1 - d2). \n\n However, the two sides of the angle are the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3, and they must be the two arcs that are adjacent to v2. But note: the entire circle is n edges, and the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (if we take the shorter path for each) might not necessarily add up to less than n. \n\n Actually, the intercepted arc is the one that is the entire circle except the two arcs (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3). But note: the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two sides, so they are the two parts that are adjacent to v2. The intercepted arc is the rest.\n\n However, the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are not independent: they must be two arcs that are separated by the vertex v2. The intercepted arc is the one that is opposite, and its length is (n - d1 - d2) edges? \n\n But note: the entire circle has n edges. The two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (each being the minimal arc) might not cover the entire circle. Actually, the two minimal arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 might not be the ones we want for the angle. \n\n Important: The problem does not require the two sides to be the minimal arcs. We are free to choose any two distinct vertices. However, the angle is determined by the intercepted arc (the one opposite). \n\n But note: the two sides of the angle are the two chords from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. This arc can be the minor arc or the major arc? Actually, the inscribed angle theorem uses the intercepted arc that is the one that is intercepted by the angle. In a convex polygon, the angle is formed by two chords and the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite and not containing v2.\n\n However, the intercepted arc must be the one that is opposite to the angle. In a circle, the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc, and the intercepted arc is the one that the angle subtends.\n\n Now, we can vary the positions of v1 and v3. The angle can range from nearly 0 (when v1 and v3 are very close to v2) to nearly 180 (when the intercepted arc is nearly 360, but then the angle is nearly 180).\n\n But note: the polygon is convex, so the angle must be less than 180.\n\n How to iterate? n can be up to 10^5.\n\n We cannot iterate over all triples (v1, v2, v3). We need an efficient way.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Since the polygon is regular, the angle only depends on the two distances (in edges) from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. But note: the two distances are not independent because the intercepted arc is the entire circle minus the two arcs (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3). However, we must consider that the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the ones that we are using for the sides, and they must be contiguous from v2? Actually, no: the two sides are just two chords from v2. The intercepted arc is the rest.\n\n But note: the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two sides of the angle. The intercepted arc is the one that connects v1 and v3 without passing through v2.\n\n However, the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 must be the two arcs that are adjacent to v2. Actually, we can choose any two vertices. The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n The key is: the angle is determined by the number of edges in the intercepted arc. Let the intercepted arc have k edges, then the central angle is (k * (360/n)) and the inscribed angle is (k * (360/n)) / 2 = (k * 180) / n.\n\n But note: k must be at least 1 and at most n-2 (because the intercepted arc must not include v2, and there are n-3 vertices in the intercepted arc? Actually, the intercepted arc has k edges, meaning k+1 vertices, but the two endpoints are v1 and v3, so the intercepted arc has k edges and k+1 vertices (including v1 and v3). The entire circle has n edges and n vertices.\n\n Also, the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 must account for the remaining n - k edges (split into two parts). The two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 must be the two parts that are adjacent to v2 and together they form n - k edges. But note: the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two sides, so the total edges from v2 to v1 (minimal or maximal?) is not fixed.\n\n Actually, the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2, and that arc has k edges (so k+1 vertices, including v1 and v3). Then the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (the ones we are using for the sides) must be the two arcs that connect v2 to the two endpoints of the intercepted arc. The entire circle is broken into three arcs: \n   arc1: from v1 to v2 (length d1)\n   arc2: from v2 to v3 (length d2)\n   arc3: from v3 to v1 (length k)\n\n And we have: d1 + d2 + k = n   (because the entire circle has n edges, and each edge is traversed once).\n\n However, note: the edges are shared. Actually, the entire circle has n edges. The three arcs (as sets of edges) are disjoint and together they form the entire circle. But wait, the intercepted arc (arc3) is the one from v3 to v1 (without passing v2). The two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the other two parts.\n\n But note: the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two sides, so they are the arcs that are adjacent to v2. The intercepted arc is the opposite one.\n\n So the condition is: d1 + d2 + k = n, and k is the intercepted arc in edges.\n\n Then the angle is (k * 180) / n.\n\n But note: the inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc (in degrees). The intercepted arc is k * (360/n) degrees, so the inscribed angle is (k * 360 / n) / 2 = (k * 180) / n.\n\n Now, we have: d1 + d2 + k = n, and k = n - d1 - d2.\n\n Then the angle = ( (n - d1 - d2) * 180 ) / n.\n\n But note: d1 and d2 are the number of edges from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (the sides). However, we must also consider that the two arcs d1 and d2 can be taken in either direction. But note: the entire circle is n edges, and the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two parts that are adjacent to v2. The intercepted arc is the rest.\n\n However, there is a catch: the two arcs d1 and d2 must be the minimal arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3? Actually, no: we can take the long way around. But the problem is: we are allowed to choose any three distinct vertices. The angle is determined by the intercepted arc.\n\n But note: the intercepted arc is uniquely defined as the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. And the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (the sides) are the other two arcs.\n\n However, the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are not independent: they are the two arcs that are adjacent to v2. The entire circle is broken into three arcs: the two adjacent to v2 and the one opposite.\n\n But note: the two sides of the angle are the two chords from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3, and these chords do not necessarily follow the minimal path. However, the intercepted arc is defined as the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2, so the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the ones that do contain v2 (but wait, they start at v2 and go to v1 and v3, so they are the two sides). \n\n The key is: the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2, and the two sides are the arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (which together with the intercepted arc form the entire circle).\n\n Therefore, the angle is ( (n - d1 - d2) * 180 ) / n, but note: d1 and d2 are the number of edges in the two adjacent arcs (the ones from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3). However, the entire circle is n edges, so d1 + d2 + k = n, and k is the intercepted arc in edges.\n\n But note: the two adjacent arcs (d1 and d2) must be the entire arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. How do we assign d1 and d2?\n\n Actually, we can consider the entire circle and fix v2. Then, we can let the two adjacent arcs be of lengths d1 and d2 (in edges) such that d1 and d2 are nonnegative integers and d1+d2 <= n-1 (because the intercepted arc must be at least 1 edge). But note: the two arcs are separated by v2, so the entire circle is broken into three arcs: d1, d2, and k = n - d1 - d2.\n\n However, the two arcs d1 and d2 are the edges from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. But note: the two arcs d1 and d2 are the edges that are immediately adjacent to v2. \n\n But wait, the two sides of the angle are two chords. The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. The two arcs d1 and d2 are the edges from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3, and they are the two parts of the circle that are adjacent to v2. \n\n The important thing is: the angle depends only on k = n - d1 - d2.\n\n But note: d1 and d2 can be any positive integers (at least 1 edge) and d1+d2 <= n-1.\n\n However, we are allowed to choose any three distinct vertices, so d1 and d2 can be any integers from 1 to n-1, but note: the two arcs must be separated by v2, and the intercepted arc must be the rest.\n\n But note: the two arcs d1 and d2 are not necessarily the minimal arcs. For example, from v2 to v1, we could go the long way, but then the intercepted arc would be different.\n\n Actually, the definition of the angle: the two sides of the angle are the two chords from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. \n\n However, the circle is symmetric. We can also consider that the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two arcs that are adjacent to v2, and the intercepted arc is the rest. But note: the two arcs d1 and d2 must be the ones that are adjacent to v2 and are the ones we use for the sides.\n\n But wait, what if we choose the long way for one of the sides? Then the intercepted arc would be the small arc? \n\n Example: n=4, v2=0, v1=0->3 (short way: 1 edge) and v3=0->1 (short way: 1 edge). Then the intercepted arc is the one that goes from 3 to 1 without passing 0, which is the arc of 2 edges (which is the long way). But if we choose the long way for one side, say from v2=0 to v1=3 by the long way: that is 3 edges (0->1->2->3). Then the intercepted arc would be the arc from 3 to 1 that does not contain 0, which is now the short arc (1 edge)? \n\n Actually, the intercepted arc is defined as the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. So if we choose the long way from v2 to v1, then the two sides of the angle are the long way and the short way for the other? Then the intercepted arc is the one that is the rest, which is the same as if we had chosen the short way for both? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n The intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. The two sides are the two chords from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The intercepted arc is independent of the direction we take to get from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. \n\n However, the formula for the intercepted arc is: the entire circle minus the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 (the ones we use for the sides). But note: the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the ones we use for the sides, and they are the two parts that are adjacent to v2. \n\n But wait, there are two possibilities for each of v1 and v3: the short arc and the long arc. However, the problem does not specify which arc to use. But note: the angle is formed by the two chords. The intercepted arc is the one that is opposite, so it is uniquely defined: the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n Therefore, if we choose the long way for one of the sides, then the intercepted arc becomes smaller.\n\n Example: n=4, v2=0, v1=3 (long way: 3 edges) and v3=1 (short way: 1 edge). Then the intercepted arc is the arc from 3 to 1 that does not contain 0. The entire circle has 4 edges. The two sides: 3 edges (for v1) and 1 edge (for v3) -> total 4 edges, so the intercepted arc is 0 edges? That doesn't make sense.\n\n Actually, the entire circle is 4 edges. The two sides (arcs) are 3 edges and 1 edge, so together they are 4 edges, meaning the intercepted arc is 0 edges. But the intercepted arc must connect v1 and v3. \n\n Alternatively, we must consider that the two sides (arcs) are the two arcs that are adjacent to v2 and that together with the intercepted arc form the entire circle. But the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite, so it is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2. \n\n When we choose the long way from v2 to v1, we are essentially choosing the arc that goes the other way. Then the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are not the two smallest ones. \n\n Actually, the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are the two arcs that are used for the sides, and they must be the two arcs that are adjacent to v2. The intercepted arc is the one that is the rest. \n\n But note: the entire circle is broken into three arcs: \n   arc1: from v2 to v1 (the one we choose for the side)\n   arc2: from v2 to v3 (the one we choose for the side)\n   arc3: from v1 to v3 (the intercepted arc)\n\n And the sum of the three arc lengths (in edges) is n.\n\n However, the arc lengths for arc1 and arc2 are not fixed: we can choose either the short or the long arc for each side. But note: the intercepted arc must not contain v2. \n\n Actually, the intercepted arc is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2, so the two sides must be the two arcs that are adjacent to v2. This means that the two sides are the two arcs that leave v2 and go to v1 and v3, and they are the two arcs that are incident to v2.\n\n Therefore, the two sides must be the two arcs that are incident to v2, and they are the two minimal arcs? Not necessarily: we can choose the long arc for one side, but then the intercepted arc would be the other long arc? \n\n Let me try with n=4, v2=0, v1=3 (by the long way: 3 edges) and v3=1 (by the short way: 1 edge). Then the two arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 are 3 and 1. The entire circle is 4, so the intercepted arc is 0. But wait, the intercepted arc must connect v1 and v3. The arc from v1 (3) to v3 (1) that does not contain v2 (0) is the arc that goes from 3 to 1 without passing 0: that is the arc 3->2->1, which is 2 edges. \n\n What went",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently searching for the optimal vertices without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the angle formed by three vertices in a regular convex polygon can be derived from the intercepted arc opposite the vertex. The angle is half the measure of this intercepted arc. The intercepted arc's length depends on the number of edges between the vertices.\n2. **Insight**: For any vertex `v2`, the angle formed with vertices `v1` and `v3` is determined by the intercepted arc between `v1` and `v3` that does not include `v2`. The measure of this angle is `(k * 180) / n`, where `k` is the number of edges in the intercepted arc and `n` is the total number of edges in the polygon.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Instead of checking all possible triplets (which is computationally expensive for large `n`), we recognize that the optimal angle can be found by considering arcs close to the target angle `a`. Specifically, we calculate the closest arc length `k` such that the angle `(k * 180) / n` is nearest to `a`. This involves solving for `k` around `k0 = (a * n) / 180` and checking nearby values.\n4. **Efficiency**: By focusing on the most relevant arc lengths around the calculated `k0`, we reduce the number of checks from O(n^3) to O(1) or O(n) depending on the approach, making the solution feasible for large `n` (up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    k0 = (a * n) / 180.0\n    k0_floor = math.floor(k0)\n    k0_ceil = math.ceil(k0)\n    \n    best_angle_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    candidates = set()\n    if n >= 3:\n        candidates.add((1, 2, 3))\n    \n    k_candidates = [k0_floor, k0_ceil]\n    if abs(k0 - int(k0)) < 1e-5:\n        k_candidates.append(int(k00_floor))\n    \n    for k in k_candidates:\n        if k <= 0 or k >= n:\n            continue\n        angle_val = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n            best_angle_val = angle_val\n    \n    k_list = [best_k]\n    for k_adjust in [-1, 1, -2, 2]:\n        k_candidate = best_k + k_adjust\n        if k_candidate <= 0 or k_candidate >= n:\n            continue\n        angle_val = (k_candidate * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = diff\n            best_k = k_candidate\n            best_angle_val = angle_val\n    \n    k_list = [best_k]\n    for k_adjust in range(-5, 6):\n        k_candidate = best_k + k_adjust\n        if k_candidate <= 0 or k_candidate >= n:\n            continue\n        angle_val = (k_candidate * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n        if diff < best_angle_diff:\n            best_angle_diff = diff\n            best_k = k_candidate\n            best_angle_val = angle_val\n    \n    k = best_k\n    total_edges = n\n    d1_plus_d2 = total_edges - k\n    \n    if d1_plus_d2 == 0:\n        d1 = 1\n        d2 = d1_plus_d2 - 1\n    else:\n        d1 = d2 = d1_plus_d2 // 2\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = v2 + d1\n    if v1 > n:\n        v1 = v1 % n\n        if v1 == 0:\n            v1 = n\n    v3 = v2 + d2 + d1 + 1\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 = v3 % n\n        if v3 == 0:\n            v3 = n\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle in degrees).\n2. **Calculating Target Arc**: The target arc length `k0` is derived from the given angle `a` using the formula `k0 = (a * n) / 180.0`.\n3. **Finding Optimal Arc**: The algorithm checks arc lengths around `k0` to find the one that produces an angle closest to `a`. It adjusts the arc length by small increments to ensure the minimal difference.\n4. **Vertex Selection**: Once the optimal arc length `k` is found, the vertices are selected such that the intercepted arc between them matches `k`. The vertices are chosen based on their positions relative to the central vertex `v2`.\n5. **Output**: The selected vertices are printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space to a manageable set of candidates, ensuring optimal performance even for large polygons.",
