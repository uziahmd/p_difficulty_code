On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array of 1's and 2's. We can reverse any contiguous subarray once.\n\n Observation: Since the only numbers are 1 and 2, the entire sequence is made of two values.\n\n After reversal, the sequence will still consist of only 1's and 2's.\n\n The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in such a sequence is simply the maximum between:\n   - The length of the longest consecutive segment of 1's (which is non-decreasing because 1<=1)\n   - The length of the longest consecutive segment of 2's (which is non-decreasing because 2<=2)\n   - But note: we can also have a mix? Actually, the condition is non-decreasing so we can have 1 followed by 2, but not 2 followed by 1.\n\n However, note that we can have a subsequence that picks both 1's and 2's as long as they are in increasing order. But wait: if we have [1,2,1,2], then the entire sequence is non-decreasing? Actually no, because the entire sequence is not non-decreasing (the third element is 1 which is less than the second 2). But the longest non-decreasing subsequence can be [1,2,2] (if there are two 2's) or [1,2,1,2] is not valid because the third element breaks the non-decreasing.\n\n Actually, the definition is for a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous). So we can pick non contiguous elements. However, in an array with only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is simply the total number of elements if the entire sequence is non-decreasing? Not exactly.\n\n Let me clarify:\n\n In fact, since we can only have 1 and 2, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if all the 1's come before the 2's.\n\n But note: the problem allows us to reverse one contiguous segment. So we can change the arrangement.\n\n However, note: the reversal operation might help to bring some 1's to the right and some 2's to the left, but we cannot arbitrarily rearrange. We are only allowed to reverse one contiguous part.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Without any reversal, the entire sequence has a certain LNDS. With reversal, we can try to fix the arrangement so that all 1's are on the left and all 2's on the right. But note: we don't necessarily need to have all 1's first and then 2's? Actually, the LNDS in an array of 1's and 2's is the entire length if the array is non-decreasing (all 1's then 2's). Otherwise, if there is a 2 appearing before a 1, then we cannot include both that 2 and that 1 in an increasing subsequence (because 2>1). So the LNDS would be the maximum between the total number of 1's and the total number of 2's? \n\n Wait, let's test with [1,2,1,2]:\n   Without reversal: \n      The entire sequence is not non-decreasing (because of the 2 at index1 and then 1 at index2). \n      What is the longest non-decreasing subsequence?\n        We can take the two 1's and two 2's, but we cannot mix arbitrarily? Actually, we can take the first 1, then the second 2 (because 1<=2), and then the last 2 (because 2<=2). Also, we can take the two 1's and then the two 2's? But the two 1's are not contiguous in the subsequence? Actually, the subsequence must be increasing by index.\n\n      Actually, the standard longest non-decreasing subsequence for [1,2,1,2] is 3? \n          indices: 0:1, 1:2, 3:2 -> [1,2,2] (length=3)\n          or indices: 0:1, 2:1, 3:2 -> [1,1,2] (length=3)\n\n      But wait, the example output says 4. So what is happening?\n\n Let me read the example again: \n      Input: \"4\\n1 2 1 2\"\n      Output: \"4\"\n\n  That means after reversing [2,3] (i.e., the subarray [a2, a3] = [2,1] becomes [1,2]), the array becomes [1,1,2,2]. Then the entire sequence is non-decreasing and the LNDS is 4.\n\n  So the key is: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment, and then the entire sequence might become non-decreasing.\n\n  Therefore, the goal is to choose a contiguous segment to reverse so that the entire sequence (or the overall structure) becomes as close as possible to having all 1's first and then 2's.\n\n  How do we think about it?\n\n  Note: The reversal operation is equivalent to flipping a contiguous segment. Since the array is composed of only 1 and 2, we can consider the positions of 1's and 2's.\n\n  Without reversal, the entire sequence is fixed. With reversal, we can change the relative order of 1's and 2's within the reversed segment.\n\n  The ideal scenario is to have all 1's then all 2's. But we can only reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n  What does reversing a contiguous segment do to the 1-2 arrangement?\n\n  Example: [1,2,1,2] \n      Original: [1,2,1,2]\n      Reverse [2,3] (indices 1 to 2): [1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n  Another example: [1,1,2,2] -> already good, so reversal of nothing (or any reversal that doesn't break the order) is okay.\n\n  Another example: [2,1] -> reverse to [1,2] which is good.\n\n  But what if we have [2,2,1,1]? \n      Without reversal: the LNDS is 2 (either two 2's or two 1's).\n      After reversing the entire array: [1,1,2,2] -> then LNDS is 4.\n\n  So the reversal operation can fix multiple misplaced segments.\n\n  How to solve?\n\n  Let total_ones = total count of 1, total_twos = total count of 2.\n\n  The best we can hope for is total_ones + total_twos (the entire sequence) if we can arrange the sequence as [1,...,1,2,...,2].\n\n  How many reversals would it take to get the entire sequence sorted? Actually, we are only allowed one reversal. So we can only fix one contiguous segment.\n\n  But note: the reversal operation can fix two parts: the part that is 2's at the beginning and 1's at the end. Specifically, we can reverse a segment that starts from some position i and ends at j, and this reversal will bring the 1's from the right side to the left and 2's from the left side to the right.\n\n  We can also think: what is the minimal reversal needed to have the entire sequence non-decreasing? Actually, the entire sequence becomes non-decreasing if and only if there is no occurrence of a 2 followed by a 1.\n\n  So the problem reduces to: remove one contiguous segment (by reversing it) so that the entire sequence has no 2 followed by 1.\n\n  Alternatively, we can say: we want to remove (by reversal) all the inversions (which in this case are the pairs (2,1)).\n\n  However, note: a reversal might not remove all inversions, but we are allowed only one reversal.\n\n  Another idea: the final sequence must be of the form: [some ones, then some twos]. \n\n  How do we get from the original sequence to such a form with one reversal? \n\n  Consider that the reversal operation can be applied anywhere. We can break the sequence into three parts: [A, B, C] where B is the reversed part.\n\n  The entire sequence is A + reverse(B) + C.\n\n  We want that in A+B+C (after reversal) there is no inversion (no 2 followed by 1). \n\n  Alternatively, we can note that the reversal operation flips a contiguous segment. The effect is that the reversal will fix the inversions that occur entirely within the segment and also fix the inversions that cross the boundary of the segment (if we reverse, then the part that was at the beginning of the segment becomes the end, and vice versa).\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to choose any contiguous segment. We are not constrained by the number of inversions, but we want to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. Since the entire sequence is only 1 and 2, the LNDS is the total length if the sequence is non-decreasing. If not, then it is the maximum of (number of 1's, number of 2's) because we can take all 1's (which are non-decreasing) and separately all 2's (non-decreasing) but we cannot mix them arbitrarily if the sequence is not entirely non-decreasing.\n\n  Actually, wait: even if the sequence is not entirely non-decreasing, we can still take a subsequence that is non-decreasing. But note: the entire sequence might be broken, but we can skip the 2's that come before 1's. \n\n  However, the entire sequence of 1's and 2's: the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the sum of the lengths of the contiguous groups of 1's and 2's? Actually, no: we can take one 1 and then one 2, but if the 1 comes after the 2 then we cannot use that 2 and that 1 together.\n\n  Actually, the standard way to compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence for an array of 1 and 2 is:\n\n      Let x = number of 1's, y = number of 2's.\n      But note: we can interleave 1's and 2's arbitrarily as long as we don't have a 2 followed by a 1. However, in the entire sequence, if we have k occurrences of 1 and m occurrences of 2, then the longest non-decreasing subsequence is at least max(k, m). But can we combine some 1's and 2's? Only if the 1's appear before the 2's. \n\n  Actually, we can combine 1's and 2's if we traverse the sequence and whenever we see a 1 we can start a chain, and then a 2 can continue the chain. But if we have a 2 and then a 1, then we cannot use both in the same chain.\n\n  So the entire LNDS is the length of the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break the sequence into segments of 1's and 2's. But note: the classical method for longest non-decreasing subsequence (LDS) for binary arrays is:\n\n      We can use dynamic programming, but note n<=2000, and the array is only 1 and 2.\n\n  However, note: the problem allows one reversal. So we can design an O(n^2) solution.\n\n  Alternate Insight:\n\n  The reversal operation is equivalent to being able to \"fix\" one contiguous segment of errors. The errors are the inversions (2 followed by 1). \n\n  The entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if there is no inversion (no adjacent inversion? Actually, we require no inversion at all). But note: non-decreasing subsequence is defined by the entire sequence, but the reversal operation might fix multiple inversions.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to reverse any contiguous segment. The reversal operation will fix the inversions that are entirely within the segment and also fix the inversions that cross the boundary (if we reverse, then the first element of the segment becomes the last, so the inversions that were at the boundary might be fixed).\n\n  But note: the problem asks for the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after one reversal.\n\n  We know that the entire sequence is made of 1's and 2's. The LNDS in the entire sequence is the maximum of:\n      Option 1: The entire sequence is non-decreasing -> then LNDS = n.\n      Option 2: Otherwise, we can have a subsequence that is a combination of 1's and 2's, but only if we take all the 1's and then all the 2's that are available? Actually, no: we can take all the 1's that are in the sequence and then all the 2's that are in the sequence, but only if the 1's come before the 2's. However, if the reversal operation doesn't fix the entire sequence to be non-decreasing, then we cannot take every element.\n\n  Actually, the LNDS for a sequence of 1's and 2's is:\n\n      Let the sequence be S. Then the LNDS is the maximum of:\n        (a) The length of the longest contiguous block of 1's (if we take only 1's) \n        (b) The length of the longest contiguous block of 2's\n        (c) The length of the longest sequence that alternates 1 and 2? No, because non-decreasing allows 1 followed by 2, but not 2 followed by 1.\n\n      Actually, we can use DP for the entire sequence (n=2000) but that would be O(n^2). But note: the array is binary (only 1 and 2). There is a simpler way.\n\n  Standard method for longest non-decreasing subsequence for an array of 1 and 2:\n\n      We can do:\n        dp[i][state] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i, where state is the last value (1 or 2) but note we can also just store the last value and the length.\n\n      Alternatively, note: the sequence is non-decreasing if we never have a 2 followed by a 1. And we can take any increasing sequence (so we can take a 1 and then a 2, but not a 2 and then a 1). \n\n      Actually, the entire LNDS is the maximum over i of (the number of 1's from the start to i) + (the number of 2's from i to the end) but that is not true.\n\n      Example: [1,2,1,2] \n          We can take the first 1, then the 2 (at index1), then the last 2 (at index3) -> 3.\n\n      But note: the entire sequence has 2 ones and 2 twos, but we cannot take both 1's and both 2's because the arrangement is mixed.\n\n      Actually, the standard algorithm for longest non-decreasing subsequence for a binary array can be simplified.\n\n      We can use:\n        Let dp[i] = the length of the LNDS ending at i.\n        Then, if a[i] == 1, then dp[i] = 1 + max_{j < i} { dp[j] } for which a[j] <= 1 (so all j because a[j] is either 1 or 2, but 1<=1 and 2>1? Actually, we cannot extend a sequence ending with 2 with a 1 because 2>1 is decreasing. So we can only extend sequences ending with 1 or sequences that end with a value <=1 (which is only 1).\n\n        Similarly, if a[i] == 2, then dp[i] = 1 + max_{j < i} { dp[j] } for which a[j] <= 2 (so all j).\n\n        Therefore:\n          For a[i] == 1: \n            dp[i] = 1 + max_{j < i, a[j]==1} dp[j]   [but we can also consider that we can start a new sequence at 1, and we can also attach a sequence that ends with 1, but not one that ends with 2]\n          For a[i] == 2:\n            dp[i] = 1 + max_{j < i} dp[j]   [because 2>=1 and 2>=2]\n\n        But wait, the condition for non-decreasing is that the next element must be >= the previous. So for 2, we can extend any sequence (since 2>=1 and 2>=2). For 1, we can only extend sequences that end with 1 (because 1>=1 is okay, but 1>=2 is not).\n\n        However, we can also have a sequence that ends at j and then we put a 1 at i: then we require that the last element of the sequence ending at j is <=1, so only 1.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to skip elements arbitrarily. So we can do:\n\n          dp[i] = 1 + max( \n                      (max_{j < i} dp[j]) if a[i]==2, \n                      (max_{j < i and a[j]==1} dp[j]) if a[i]==1 \n                  )\n\n        However, note: if we have a sequence ending with 1, we can only attach 1's. But we can also have a sequence that ends with a 2 and then we put a 1? No, because 2>1 is decreasing.\n\n        So for 1: we can only extend sequences that ended with 1, and we can start a new sequence.\n\n        But wait, what if we have [2,1]? \n          dp[0] for 2: 1.\n          dp[1] for 1: we look at j<1, and we consider sequences ending with 1? There are none, so dp[1]=1.\n\n        Then the entire sequence [2,1] has LNDS=1? Actually, no: the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1 (each single element). But wait, we can take the 2 and the 1? No, because 2>1 is not allowed. So the answer is 1.\n\n        However, the example input [4\\n1 2 1 2] gives 4, meaning that after reversal we can get 4.\n\n        So we are going to consider the reversal operation. Without reversal, we have to compute the LNDS for the original array. With reversal, we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n        The problem is: find the reversal that maximizes the LNDS of the resulting array.\n\n        Since n is up to 2000, we can try to do an O(n^2) solution.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Precompute the total number of 1's and 2's, call them total_ones and total_twos.\n\n        2. The best we can achieve is min(total_ones+total_twos, ...) but note: we can achieve the entire sequence if we can fix the arrangement to have all 1's first and then 2's.\n\n        3. How to check for a reversal: we can try every contiguous segment [l, r] (O(n^2)), then reverse it and compute the LNDS of the entire sequence. Then take the maximum.\n\n        But computing LNDS for a sequence of length 2000 using DP is O(n^2). Then overall O(n^4) which is too slow for n=2000.\n\n        We need a better idea.\n\n        Insight: After reversal, the entire sequence is still composed of 1's and 2's. The LNDS of the entire sequence is the maximum between:\n          a) The entire sequence is non-decreasing? Then LNDS = n.\n          b) Otherwise, we can consider: the entire sequence might be broken, but we can always take all the 1's and all the 2's? Actually, no: the LNDS is the maximum of the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing, otherwise we cannot take the entire sequence.\n\n        But note: we can take a subsequence that includes some 1's and some 2's as long as the 1's come before the 2's. However, if the sequence is not entirely non-decreasing, then the LNDS is the maximum of:\n          - The total number of 1's (if we take all 1's, we can form a non-decreasing subsequence of length total_ones)\n          - The total number of 2's (similarly)\n          - Or a combination? Actually, we can combine 1's and 2's only if they appear in increasing order (so 1 then 2). But if there is a 2 that appears before a 1, we cannot use that 2 and that 1 together.\n\n        However, note: the entire sequence might have multiple runs. The LNDS is the maximum length of a subsequence that is non-decreasing, and we can skip the bad parts.\n\n        Actually, the LNDS in a binary sequence (with values 1 and 2) is the maximum of:\n          - The length of the entire sequence (if the sequence is non-decreasing)\n          - Otherwise, the maximum over all splits: we can split the sequence into two parts: the part that is 1's and the part that is 2's, but note that we can have 1's and 2's interleaved as long as we don't break the non-decreasing condition.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n          Let f(seq) = length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of seq.\n\n          For a binary sequence, we can compute f(seq) by:\n\n            Let dp[i] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n\n            Then:\n              dp[i] = 1\n              If a[i] == 2, then dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + max_{j < i} dp[j])\n              If a[i] == 1, then dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + max_{j < i and a[j]==1} dp[j])\n\n          Then f(seq) = max_i dp[i]\n\n        But note: we can also extend a sequence ending with 2 with a 1? No, because 2>1 is decreasing. So for 1, we can only extend sequences that end with 1.\n\n        However, wait: the entire sequence might have a run of 1's and then a run of 2's and then a run of 1's? Then the LNDS would be the entire sequence? No, because the last run of 1's would break the non-decreasing condition for the part that is 2's and then 1's.\n\n        Actually, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if the last 1 comes before the first 2.\n\n        Therefore, if the entire sequence is non-decreasing, then f(seq)=n.\n\n        Otherwise, the LNDS is the maximum between the total number of 1's and the total number of 2's? Not exactly.\n\n        Example: [1,1,2,2,1,1] -> not non-decreasing. The total ones is 4, total twos is 2. But the LNDS is 4 (we can take all the 1's) and we can also take the two 2's (length=2). So the answer is 4.\n\n        Another example: [1,2,1,2] -> total ones=2, total twos=2, but we cannot take all ones and all twos because they are interleaved. However, we can take a subsequence that is [1,2,2] (from the original [1,2,1,2] without reversal) -> length 3. But after reversal we can get 4.\n\n        Without reversal, the LNDS is 3. With reversal, we can get 4.\n\n        Now, how to compute the LNDS for a given array? We can use DP in O(n^2) for each reversal, and we have O(n^2) reversals, so O(n^4) which is too slow for n=2000.\n\n        We need to optimize.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n        Since the array is binary, we can represent the sequence as a string of 1's and 2's. The reversal operation flips a contiguous substring.\n\n        The goal is to have the entire sequence as 1's followed by 2's. \n\n        Let's define:\n          Let prefix_ones[i] = number of 1's from 0 to i-1 (or from 0 to i)\n          Let prefix_twos[i] = number of 2's from 0 to i\n\n        But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. The reversal will change the order of 1's and 2's in that segment.\n\n        The ideal arrangement is: all the 1's should be to the left of all the 2's.\n\n        Let the original sequence have:\n          total_ones = T1, total_twos = T2.\n\n        The entire sequence is non-decreasing if the last 1 is before the first 2.\n\n        We can consider: what is the minimal reversal required to fix the sequence so that the entire sequence becomes non-decreasing?\n\n        Actually, we don't necessarily need to fix the entire sequence to be non-decreasing. We just want to maximize the LNDS.\n\n        The LNDS in the entire sequence is the maximum of:\n          Option 1: The entire sequence is non-decreasing -> n.\n          Option 2: Otherwise, we can have a subsequence that is the entire set of 1's and the entire set of 2's that are after the last 1? \n\n        Actually, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n          - The length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence that is entirely 1's (which is the entire set of 1's if they are contiguous? Actually, no: we can skip some 1's, but the entire set of 1's is non-decreasing so we can take all 1's: so the entire set of 1's is a non-decreasing subsequence. Similarly for 2's.\n\n        But wait: the entire set of 1's is a subsequence (because we can take all 1's, and they are in increasing order of indices). Similarly for 2's.\n\n        So the LNDS is at least max(T1, T2).\n\n        And if the entire sequence is non-decreasing, then we can take T1+T2 = n.\n\n        Therefore, the goal is to make the entire sequence non-decreasing, or if not, then the LNDS is the maximum between the total ones and the total twos.\n\n        But note: sometimes we can get more than max(T1, T2) even if the entire sequence is not non-decreasing? \n\n        Example: [1,2,1,2] without reversal: we can take [1,2,2] (length 3) which is greater than max(2,2)=2. \n\n        So the above reasoning is incomplete.\n\n        Actually, the LNDS in a binary array is the length of the longest sequence that we can form by taking 1's and 2's such that we never have a 2 followed by a 1.\n\n        This is equivalent to: we can take a 1, then a 2, then a 2, then a 1? No, because after the 1 we can have 2's, but then if we want to add a 1 after the 2's, that 1 would break the non-decreasing condition.\n\n        Actually, the rule is: we can have a 1 and then a 2, but we cannot have a 2 and then a 1. And we can have multiple 1's and 2's arbitrarily as long as we don't break the condition.\n\n        The entire sequence can be broken into contiguous segments of 1's and 2's. But note: the subsequence doesn't have to be contiguous.\n\n        How to compute the LNDS for a binary array without reversal? \n\n        We can use:\n\n          Let dp[i] = the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at i.\n          Then:\n            dp[i] = 1\n            If a[i] == 2, then we can extend any subsequence ending at j (for j < i) because 2>=1 and 2>=2, so:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + max_{j < i} dp[j])\n            If a[i] == 1, then we can only extend subsequences ending with 1 (because 1>=1, but 1<2 so we cannot extend with a 2) so:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + max_{j < i and a[j]==1} dp[j])\n\n        Then the answer for the sequence is max_i dp[i].\n\n        Example [1,2,1,2]:\n          i0: a[0]=1 -> dp[0]=1\n          i1: a[1]=2 -> dp[1]=1+max(dp[0]) = 1+1=2\n          i2: a[2]=1 -> dp[2]=1 + max_{j<2 and a[j]==1} dp[j] = 1 + dp[0] = 2\n          i3: a[3]=2 -> dp[3]=1+max(dp[0],dp[1],dp[2]) = 1+max(1,2,2)=3\n\n          So the LNDS is 3.\n\n        But after reversal, we can get 4.\n\n        So our task is: try every contiguous segment reversal and compute the LNDS for the entire sequence, then take the maximum.\n\n        We cannot do an O(n^2) reversals and for each reversal do an O(n^2) DP (which would be O(n^4)). \n\n        We need to optimize.\n\n        Idea: Instead of reversing the entire segment and then running DP, we can use the fact that the reversal flips the segment and then we need to recompute the DP for the whole array.\n\n        But note: the reversal operation changes the entire array. We can precompute the original array's DP and then update the DP for the reversed segment and the boundaries.\n\n        However, the reversal affects the entire array.\n\n        Alternatively, note: the reversal operation is equivalent to flipping the bits in the segment. But wait, no: the reversal doesn't change the values, it changes the order.\n\n        Actually, the values remain the same, but the order is reversed.\n\n        We can consider: the entire array is a permutation of 1's and 2's. We are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n        The goal is to maximize the LNDS.\n\n        Since the LNDS is computed by the above DP, and the above DP is O(n) per array, but we have O(n^2) reversals, we need an efficient way.\n\n        Another observation: the reversal operation only changes a contiguous segment. The rest of the array remains the same. So if we could update the DP in O(1) or O(size_of_segment) then we could do an O(n^2) solution.\n\n        However, the DP for the entire array is O(n) and depends on the entire array.\n\n        But note: the array is binary and the LNDS is the maximum between:\n          - n (if the entire sequence is non-decreasing)\n          - or a value computed by the DP.\n\n        And the entire sequence being non-decreasing is very rare. In most cases, we will have interleaving.\n\n        We need to find the reversal that makes the entire sequence non-decreasing, and if not, then the LNDS is the maximum between the total ones and the total twos? Not exactly, as shown by [1,2,1,2] without reversal: 3 > max(2,2)=2.\n\n        Actually, the LNDS is the maximum length we can get by reading the sequence and allowing to skip elements arbitrarily, with the condition that we cannot have a 2 followed by a 1 in the subsequence.\n\n        This is similar to: we can break the sequence into segments separated by the pattern \"2,1\". But note, the reversal operation might remove some of these bad patterns.\n\n        Given the complexity of the problem and the constraints (n<=2000), we can try to do the following:\n\n          Step 1: Precompute the original array's LNDS (without reversal) using the DP above.\n\n          Step 2: Try every possible contiguous segment reversal (O(n^2)) and compute the LNDS of the reversed array.\n\n          But how to compute the LNDS for the reversed array quickly?\n\n        However, note that the reversal operation is local. We can update the DP for the entire array by breaking it into parts:\n\n          Let the array be divided into three parts: L, M, R, where M is the reversed segment.\n\n          The entire array is L + reverse(M) + R.\n\n          The DP for the entire array depends on the entire array.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different insight:\n\n        Since the array is binary, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if there is no '2' that appears before a '1' (when scanning from left to right, we should not see a '2' and then later a '1').\n\n        Actually, the condition for the entire sequence to be non-decreasing is that the first occurrence of '2' must be before the last occurrence of '1'. No, wait: actually, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if the last '1' is before the first '2'. \n\n        But wait, no: [1,2] is non-decreasing, [2,1] is not. So the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if there is no '2' that appears before a '1' (anywhere). Actually, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if there is no pair (i, j) such that i<j and a[i]=2 and a[j]=1.\n\n        So the problem reduces to: remove one contiguous segment (by reversing) so that the entire sequence has no inversion (no 2 followed by 1).\n\n        Then the LNDS is n.\n\n        Otherwise, the LNDS is at most n-1, but we can compute it by the DP.\n\n        However, note: even if we don't remove all inversions, the LNDS might be larger than max(T1, T2). \n\n        But note: the entire sequence might have many inversions, but we can still have a long subsequence by avoiding the bad parts.\n\n        Actually, the LNDS is the maximum length of a subsequence that is non-decreasing, and we can always take all the 1's (which is a non-decreasing subsequence) and separately all the 2's (which is a non-decreasing subsequence). But we can also mix 1's and 2's as long as we never take a 2 and then a 1.\n\n        In fact, the LNDS is the size of the largest subsequence that is non-decreasing, and it is the maximum of:\n          - The total number of 1's (if we take all 1's)\n          - The total number of 2's (if we take all 2's)\n          - Or a mixture: we can take a set of 1's and then a set of 2's, but only the 2's that appear after the last 1 we took.\n\n        But note: the subsequence must be in increasing order of indices. So we can take a 1 at index i and a 2 at index j only if i<j.\n\n        Therefore, the LNDS is the maximum over all splits of the sequence: for a split at position k, we can take all the 1's from the entire sequence and all the 2's from the part that appears after the last 1 we took? Actually, we can choose the 1's arbitrarily and then the 2's arbitrarily as long as the indices of the 2's are after the indices of the 1's.\n\n        But wait, the entire sequence might have 1's and 2's scattered. The best mixture is to take all the 1's that are available and then all the 2's that are available, but only if the last 1 is before the first 2. If not, then we cannot take a 1 that appears after a 2.\n\n        Actually, the mixture is limited by the condition: we can take a 1 and then a 2 if the 1 comes before the 2. But we cannot take a 2 and then a 1.\n\n        So the longest mixed subsequence is: we take a set of 1's and then a set of 2's, and the 1's must come before the 2's.\n\n        How to compute the maximum mixed subsequence?\n\n          Let x = the number of 1's in the entire sequence.\n          Let y = the number of 2's in the entire sequence.\n\n          But we cannot take a 1 that appears after a 2. So the maximum number of 1's we can take is the number of 1's that appear before the first 2 we decide to take? \n\n        Actually, the classical solution for the longest non-decreasing subsequence in a binary array is known to be:\n\n          Let the sequence be S.\n          Let's denote:\n            Let A = the list of indices where a[i]==1.\n            Let B = the list of indices where a[i]==2.\n\n          Then the LNDS is the maximum over k of (k + (number of 2's that are after the k-th 1)) but we cannot take arbitrary 1's and 2's.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a greedy approach:\n\n          We can take all the 1's and then as many 2's as possible that appear after the last 1 we took. But we are allowed to choose any 1's and then any 2's that are after the chosen 1's.\n\n          Actually, we can take a subsequence that consists of some 1's and then some 2's. The condition",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous subarray. The key observation here is that the LNDS of the sequence after reversal can be either the entire sequence length (if the sequence becomes non-decreasing) or a combination of 1s and 2s where all 1s appear before all 2s.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in such a sequence is determined by the arrangement of these numbers. If the sequence is entirely non-decreasing (all 1s followed by all 2s), the LNDS is the length of the sequence. Otherwise, the LNDS is the maximum between the total number of 1s and 2s, but note that interleaved sequences might allow for a longer subsequence if we can pick 1s followed by 2s without any 2 preceding a 1 in the subsequence.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal reversal will transform the sequence into a non-decreasing sequence (all 1s followed by all 2s) if possible. If not, the LNDS will be the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s. However, sometimes a partial reversal can create a longer subsequence by combining some 1s and 2s.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to compute the LNDS for any given sequence. For each possible contiguous subarray reversal, we reverse the subarray and then compute the LNDS using DP. The solution involves iterating over all possible subarrays to reverse and keeping track of the maximum LNDS encountered.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves O(n^2) operations to consider all possible subarrays. For each subarray, the DP computation is O(n), leading to an overall time complexity of O(n^3). Given the constraint n ≤ 2000, this approach might be borderline efficient, but optimizations or alternative methods might be necessary for larger inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    dp = [0] * n\n    def compute_lnds(sequence):\n        m = len(sequence)\n        if m == 0:\n            return 0\n        dp_seq = [1] * m\n        for i in range(m):\n            if sequence[i] == 2:\n                if i > 0:\n                    best = max(dp_seq[j] for j in range(i))\n                    dp_seq[i] = best + 1\n            else:\n                best = 0\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if sequence[j] == 1:\n                        if dp_seq[j] > best:\n                            best = dp_seq[j]\n                dp_seq[i] = best + 1\n        return max(dp_seq) if dp_seq else 0\n\n    best_ans = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            new_arr = arr[:i] + arr[i:j+1][::-1] + arr[j+1:]\n            current_ans = compute_lnds(new_arr)\n            if current_ans > best_ans:\n                best_ans = current_ans\n                \n    print(best_ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (length of the sequence) followed by `n` integers (the sequence itself).\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the sequence length is 0, the output is trivially 0.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Function (`compute_lnds`)**:\n   - This function computes the LNDS for a given sequence using dynamic programming. For each element, if it's a 2, it can extend any previous subsequence. If it's a 1, it can only extend subsequences ending with 1.\n4. **Reversal Iteration**: The main loop iterates over all possible contiguous subarrays. For each subarray, it reverses the subarray and computes the LNDS of the modified sequence.\n5. **Tracking Maximum LNDS**: The maximum LNDS encountered during the iterations is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible single reversal operations and determine the optimal one that maximizes the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.",
