Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of burned candles to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour and then becomes one burned candle.\n   - After using the initial candles, we can collect all the burned candles to make new ones.\n\n Steps:\n   Let total_hours = 0\n   Let current_candles = a\n   Let leftover = 0\n\n However, we can think of it as:\n   total_hours += current_candles   # because each candle gives one hour\n   Then, we have 'current_candles' burned candles (from the ones that just burned) and we can use them to make more.\n\n But note: we can also use leftover from previous cycles.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We start with 'a' candles. This gives 'a' hours. Then, we have 'a' burned candles.\n\n   With 'a' burned candles, we can make floor(a / b) new candles, and we are left with a % b burned candles.\n\n   Then we add the new candles to our current stock, and we can burn them again.\n\n   However, note that when we use the new candles, they will also become burned candles in the next cycle.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        hours += current\n        # Now, we have 'current' burned candles from this batch.\n        # We can form new_candles = current // b\n        # And leftover = current % b\n        # Then set current = new_candles + leftover (because the leftover burned candles remain)\n\n   But wait: the above process would use the same burned candles from the same batch? Actually, no: we use the burned candles from every batch.\n\n   However, let's test with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n   Start: current = 4, hours=0.\n   First iteration: \n        hours = 4\n        new_candles = 4 // 2 = 2\n        leftover = 4 % 2 = 0\n        current = 2\n\n   Second iteration:\n        hours = 4 + 2 = 6\n        new_candles = 2 // 2 = 1\n        leftover = 0\n        current = 1\n\n   Third iteration:\n        hours = 6 + 1 = 7\n        new_candles = 1 // 2 = 0\n        leftover = 1\n        current = 0 + 1 = 1? -> but wait, in the third iteration, we are burning 1 candle, so we get 1 burned candle, then we try to form new ones from 1 burned candle? which is less than b (2), so we can't.\n\n   However, in the example output, the answer is 7.\n\n   But note: in the second iteration, after burning the 2 candles, we get 2 burned candles. Then we form 2//2 = 1 new candle, and leftover 0. Then we have 1 candle to burn. Then we burn that one, which gives 1 hour and then 1 burned candle, but then we cannot form a new candle from 1 (since 1 < 2). So the total hours is 4+2+1 = 7.\n\n   However, the above algorithm does not account for the fact that the leftover from the previous batches are carried over. In the third iteration, we have current=1, and then we burn that 1, adding 1 hour, and then we have 1 burned candle. Then we update current: 1//2=0 and 1%2=1, so current becomes 0+1 = 1. Then the loop continues.\n\n   We need to break when current becomes 0? But if we have leftover, we might have non-zero current even after the last burn.\n\n   Actually, the problem is: we are burning the current candles and then we get burned candles (which is equal to the number of candles we burned). Then we use those burned candles to form new ones.\n\n   The algorithm:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But wait, actually we can combine: we start with a, then we get a burned candles. Then we make new_candles = (a + leftover) // b, and leftover becomes (a + leftover) % b? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   while current > 0:\n        hours += current\n        # The current candles we burned, so we have 'current' burned candles to use for making new ones.\n        # But we also have any leftover from previous cycles?\n        # Actually, we should consider: the total available burned candles is the current batch (which is 'current') plus any leftover from previous cycles?\n\n   Let me reframe:\n\n   We start with a candles (and 0 burned candles initially). Then we burn 'a' candles, so we get 'a' burned candles. Then we can form a//b new candles and leave a % b burned candles. Then we have a//b new candles to burn, and we will get a//b burned candles from burning them, plus the leftover a % b.\n\n   So we can simulate:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   burned = 0\n\n   while candles + burned > 0:\n        # Burn all available candles (candles + burned) won't work because burned is separate.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   total = a\n   while total >= b:\n        # How many hours do we get from the current batch? Actually, we don't need to separate because we are going to reuse.\n\n   Another common solution for similar problems (like collecting bottle caps) is:\n\n   hours = a\n   while a >= b:\n        new_candles = a // b\n        hours += new_candles\n        a = new_candles + a % b\n\n   Let's test with [4,2]:\n        Start: a=4, hours=4\n        Condition: 4>=2 -> true\n            new_candles = 4//2 = 2\n            hours = 4+2 = 6\n            a = 2 + 4%2 = 2+0 = 2\n        Then 2>=2 -> true\n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1\n            hours = 6+1 = 7\n            a = 1 + 0 = 1\n        Then 1<2 -> break, output 7.\n\n   Now test with [6,3]:\n        Start: a=6, hours=6\n        Condition: 6>=3 -> true\n            new_candles = 6//3 = 2\n            hours = 6+2 = 8\n            a = 2 + 6%3 = 2+0 = 2\n        Then 2<3 -> break, output 8.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   So the code:\n\n   Read the input, split to get a and b.\n\n   Then:\n\n   hours = a\n   while a >= b:\n        new_candles = a // b\n        hours += new_candles\n        a = new_candles + (a % b)\n\n   Print hours.\n\n   However, note: what if b==1? The problem states b>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Let's test with another example: [10,5]\n        Start: a=10, hours=10\n        Condition: 10>=5 -> true\n            new_candles = 10//5 = 2\n            hours = 10+2 = 12\n            a = 2 + 10%5 = 2+0 = 2\n        Then 2<5 -> break, so 12 hours.\n\n   But let's think: \n        Initially 10 candles -> 10 hours, then 10 burned -> 10//5=2 new candles, then 2 hours (total 12) and then we have 2 burned, which is not enough. Correct.\n\n   Another example: [1,2] -> a=1, b=2. Since 1<2, we break and output 1.\n\n   Example: [3,2]\n        Start: a=3, hours=3\n        Condition: 3>=2 -> true\n            new_candles = 3//2 = 1\n            hours = 3+1 = 4\n            a = 1 + 3%2 = 1+1 = 2\n        Then 2>=2 -> true\n            new_candles = 2//2 = 1\n            hours = 4+1 = 5\n            a = 1 + 0 = 1\n        Then 1<2 -> break, so 5 hours.\n\n   Check: \n        Hour 1-3: burn 3 candles -> 3 burned. Make 3//2 = 1 new candle (with 1 leftover). Then burn the 1 new candle (hour 4) -> now burned candles are 1 (from the first 3) + 1 (from the new one) = 2. Then we can make 2//2 = 1 new candle (with 0 leftover). Then burn that one (hour 5). Then we have 1 burned candle (from the last one) and can't make a new one. Total 5.\n\n   So the code is:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   a = int(data[0])\n   b = int(data[1])\n\n   hours = a\n   while a >= b:\n        new_candles = a // b\n        remainder = a % b\n        hours += new_candles\n        a = new_candles + remainder\n\n   print(hours)\n\n   This should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a burned candle. These burned candles can be combined to form new candles, which can then be burned again, extending the total burning time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`. Each candle provides one hour of light.\n2. **Recycling Burned Candles**: After burning all available candles, recycle the burned candles. For every `b` burned candles, you can create one new candle.\n3. **Iterative Process**: Continue the process of burning candles and recycling the burned ones until you no longer have enough burned candles to form a new candle (i.e., fewer than `b` burned candles remain).\n4. **Accumulate Hours**: Each time you burn candles, add the number of candles burned to the total hours. This includes both the initial candles and any new candles formed from recycled burned candles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    hours = a\n    while a >= b:\n        new_candles = a // b\n        remainder = a % b\n        hours += new_candles\n        a = new_candles + remainder\n        \n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The program reads the input values for the initial number of candles (`a`) and the number of burned candles needed to form a new candle (`b`).\n2. **Initial Hours**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each candle burns for exactly one hour.\n3. **Loop for Recycling**: While there are at least `b` candles available (either initial or recycled), the loop continues:\n   - **Form New Candles**: Calculate how many new candles can be formed from the current number of candles (`a // b`).\n   - **Update Hours**: Add the number of new candles to the total hours since each will provide an additional hour of light.\n   - **Update Remaining Candles**: The remaining candles consist of the new candles formed plus any leftover burned candles that couldn't form a full new candle (`a = new_candles + remainder`).\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when there are fewer than `b` candles left, meaning no more new candles can be formed. The total accumulated hours are then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the burning time by continuously recycling burned candles into new ones, ensuring optimal use of all available resources.",
