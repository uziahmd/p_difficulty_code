The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are only allowed to use a key j on a chest i if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1, meaning one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chest group 0: even numbers\n   Chest group 1: odd numbers\n\n Similarly, for keys:\n   Key group 0: even numbers\n   Key group 1: odd numbers\n\n Condition for using a key from group 0 (even) on a chest: the chest must be in group 1 (odd) because even+odd is odd.\n Condition for using a key from group 1 (odd) on a chest: the chest must be in group 0 (even) because odd+even is odd.\n\n So we have two types of pairs that work:\n   Type A: even key with odd chest\n   Type B: odd key with even chest\n\n Now note: one key can open at most one chest, and one chest at most once.\n\n This becomes a bipartite matching problem. However, note that the graph is actually two disconnected bipartite graphs:\n\n   Graph 1: even keys -> odd chests (Type A)\n   Graph 2: odd keys -> even chests (Type B)\n\n And these two graphs are independent.\n\n But note: we are not limited by the total number of keys or chests? Actually, we are, but we can use each key at most once and each chest at most once.\n\n So we can model this as two independent bipartite graphs and then the answer is the maximum matching in both? Actually, no: we are just counting the total number of matches we can get from both.\n\n However, note that the two graphs do not share nodes (because the nodes are separated by parity). The chests and keys are partitioned by parity, so:\n\n   Let:\n     E_chest = list of even chest numbers\n     O_chest = list of odd chest numbers\n     E_key = list of even key numbers\n     O_key = list of odd key numbers\n\n Then, the edges are:\n   From E_key to O_chest (for Type A)\n   From O_key to E_chest (for Type B)\n\n Since the two sets of edges are independent, we can compute the maximum matching for each separately.\n\n However, note that the classical matching algorithms (like Hopcroft-Karp or DFS based) for bipartite graphs are efficient for |V| up to 10^5? Actually, Hopcroft-Karp runs in O(sqrt(V)*E) which might be acceptable for up to 10^5 nodes, but note that the edges in each bipartite graph can be up to 10^5*10^5 in the worst case? Wait, no: we are not going to build a complete bipartite graph. But wait: how many edges are there?\n\n Actually, in the first graph (even keys to odd chests), every even key is connected to every odd chest? No, the condition is fixed by parity, so actually the condition is automatically satisfied by the grouping. So the entire set of even keys can be used for any odd chest? Similarly, the entire set of odd keys can be used for any even chest.\n\n But wait: the condition is only about parity, and we've separated by parity. So if a key is even, then it can open every odd chest. Similarly, an odd key can open every even chest.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the same parity condition beyond the modulus 2. So the bipartite graph for even keys and odd chests is a complete bipartite graph from E_key to O_chest, and similarly for odd keys and even chests.\n\n But wait: that's correct. So the edges are not arbitrary, they are complete between the two sets.\n\n Then, the maximum matching in a complete bipartite graph? Actually, no: the graph is complete, but we have two independent bipartite graphs.\n\n However, in a complete bipartite graph K_{|A|,|B|}, the maximum matching is min(|A|, |B|).\n\n But wait: is that true? Yes, because you can assign each node in the smaller set to a distinct node in the larger set.\n\n However, note: the two graphs are independent, so the total matching is the sum of the matchings in the two graphs.\n\n Therefore, the answer would be: \n   matching1 = min(len(E_key), len(O_chest))\n   matching2 = min(len(O_key), len(E_chest))\n\n Then total matching = matching1 + matching2\n\n But wait, is that really the case? Consider: we have two sets of edges, and we are matching independently. Since the two graphs are disjoint (no shared nodes), yes.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> \n        even: [14,6,2] -> count=3\n        odd: [9,11] -> count=2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] ->\n        even: [8,4,20] -> count=3\n        odd: [7] -> count=1\n\n   Then matching1 (even keys to odd chests): min(3,2)=2\n        matching2 (odd keys to even chests): min(1,3)=1\n        total = 3.\n\n   The example output is 3.\n\n   Second example: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even:5, odd:0\n        Keys: [5] -> odd:1, even:0\n        matching1: min(0,0)=0\n        matching2: min(1,5)=1\n        total=1.\n\n   Third example: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n        Chests: [10] -> even:1, odd:0\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> even:4, odd:0\n        matching1: min(4,0)=0\n        matching2: min(0,1)=0\n        total=0.\n\n So the solution is indeed to count the even and odd in chests and keys, and then take the minimum for each of the two bipartite graphs and add them.\n\n But wait: is it that simple? Let me think again.\n\n In the bipartite graph for even keys and odd chests, we have a complete bipartite graph. The maximum matching is indeed the minimum of the two set sizes. Similarly for the other.\n\n However, note: what if we have more keys than chests? Then we can only use up to the number of chests. Similarly, if we have more chests than keys, we are limited by the keys.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   Read n, m\n   Read list of n integers for chests\n   Read list of m integers for keys\n\n   Count even and odd in chests:\n        even_chest = 0\n        for num in chest_list:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_chest += 1\n            else:\n                odd_chest = n - even_chest   # Alternatively, we can count odd_chest separately.\n\n   Similarly for keys.\n\n   Then:\n        matching1 = min(even_keys, odd_chest)\n        matching2 = min(odd_keys, even_chest)\n\n        print(matching1 + matching2)\n\n But wait: what if we don't count odd_chest separately? We can do:\n\n        even_chest = sum(1 for num in a if num % 2 == 0)\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = sum(1 for num in b if num % 2 == 0)\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n Then proceed.\n\n However, let's test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Chests: [9,14,6,2,11] -> even_chest=3, odd_chest=2.\n        Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> even_key=3, odd_key=1.\n        matching1 = min(3,2)=2, matching2=min(1,3)=1 -> 3.\n\n Example 2: \n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\n        Keys: [5] -> even_key=0, odd_key=1.\n        matching1 = min(0,0)=0, matching2=min(1,5)=1 -> 1.\n\n Example 3:\n        Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> even_key=4, odd_key=0.\n        matching1 = min(4,0)=0, matching2=min(0,1)=0 -> 0.\n\n It matches.\n\n However, wait: is there any constraint that we cannot use a key more than once? But in our counting, we are just taking the minimum of the two sets. This is because in a complete bipartite graph, the maximum matching is the size of the smaller set. And since the two graphs are independent, we just add the two.\n\n But note: the problem says one key can be used only once and one chest only once. Our matching in the complete bipartite graph already enforces that.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints are up to 10^5, so we must read the input efficiently and use a linear scan.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But wait: is the graph really complete? Yes, because the condition is purely by parity. So if a key is even, then it can open every odd chest, regardless of the actual numbers.\n\n Therefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chest = 0\n   for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n   odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n   even_key = 0\n   for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n   odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   result = min(even_key, odd_chest) + min(odd_key, even_chest)\n\n   print(result)\n\n But wait: let me check the example again. The example input was provided as a string, but the example input format is:\n\n   \"5 4\"\n   \"9 14 6 2 11\"\n   \"8 4 7 20\"\n\n We read the first line, then the next two lines.\n\n However, the example input is given as:\n\n   ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', ...]\n\n But the example input has three lines: first line \"5 4\", second line \"9 14 6 2 11\", third line \"8 4 7 20\".\n\n Our code reads three lines: \n   First line: n, m\n   Second line: list of n integers\n   Third line: list of m integers\n\n This is correct.\n\n However, the problem statement says:\n\n   The first line contains integers n and m.\n   The second line contains n integers.\n   The third line contains m integers.\n\n So we are good.\n\n But note: the input numbers can be as large as 10^9, but modulo 2 is safe.\n\n Let's run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\" -> Output: 3\n\n Example 2: \n        Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\" -> Output: 1\n\n Example 3: \n        Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\" -> Output: 0\n\n However, wait: in example 3, the input has two lines: \n        First line: \"1 4\"\n        Second line: \"10\"\n        Third line: \"20 30 40 50\"\n\n But the third line has 4 numbers, so m=4, and the second line has one number, so n=1.\n\n Our code will read:\n        n=1, m=4\n        a = [10]\n        b = [20,30,40,50]\n\n Then:\n        even_chest: 10 % 2 == 0 -> True -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n        even_key: all four keys are even -> even_key=4, odd_key=0\n\n        matching1 = min(4,0)=0\n        matching2 = min(0,1)=0\n\n        Output 0.\n\n But wait: the example output is 0.\n\n However, note: the example input format in the problem statement is exactly as described.\n\n But wait: the example input in the note is given as:\n\n        Input: \n          5 4\n          9 14 6 2 11\n          8 4 7 20\n          5 1\n          2 4 6 8 10\n          5\n          1 4\n          10\n          20 30 40 50\n\n        Output:\n          3\n          1\n          0\n\n However, the problem statement says:\n\n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        # Neko Finds Grapes\n\n        [problem description]\n\n        ### Input\n        ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n        ### Output\n        ['3', '1', '0']\n\n So the example inputs are given as a list of strings, but in the actual input, we have three separate test cases? \n\n Actually, the problem says \"Print the maximum number of chests you can open.\" for each test case? Or is it one test case?\n\n The problem statement doesn't specify multiple test cases. The example input is shown as a list of strings, but the actual input format is one test case per run.\n\n But wait, the sample input in the problem is given as:\n\n        Input:\n          ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n This is just the problem's way of showing multiple examples. In the actual competition, the input would be one test case.\n\n However, looking at the example, the input is provided as three separate test cases? Or is it one big string?\n\n Actually, the example input is given as a list of strings, but the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then the input format.\n\n Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one test case.\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as three separate strings, and the expected output is three numbers. \n\n However, the problem statement says \"Print the maximum number of chests you can open.\" (singular) and the example output is three numbers.\n\n Clarification: the problem statement example includes three examples. But in the competition, the input will be one test case.\n\n Since the problem does not mention multiple test cases, we write the code for one test case.\n\n But wait: the example input is provided as a list of strings. How should we handle that? \n\n Actually, the example input is just illustrative. In the competition, the program reads from stdin until EOF or one test case.\n\n Since the problem constraints say n, m up to 10^5, and the input format is three lines, we assume one test case.\n\n However, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', ...]\n\n This is just a representation of the input. In reality, we read from stdin.\n\n So the code I wrote above is for one test case.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says \"The first line contains integers n and m\", etc. So we read one test case.\n\n Therefore, we output one integer.\n\n However, the example output is a list of integers. That is because the example has multiple test cases? \n\n Let me check the problem statement again: \n\n        Input\n        The first line contains integers n and m (1<=n,m<=10^5) — the number of chests and the number of keys.\n        The second line contains n integers ...\n        The third line contains m integers ...\n\n There is no indication of multiple test cases.\n\n So we assume one test case.\n\n But the example input is given as a list of three strings. This is just to show three different examples.\n\n Therefore, the code I wrote is correct for the stated problem.\n\n However, if the competition provides multiple test cases, we would need to adjust.\n\n But the problem says: \"The first line contains integers n and m\", meaning one test case.\n\n If there are multiple test cases, the problem would have specified.\n\n So we output the code for one test case.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chest = sum(1 for num in a if num % 2 == 0)\n   odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n   even_key = sum(1 for num in b if num % 2 == 0)\n   odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   result = min(even_key, odd_chest) + min(odd_key, even_chest)\n\n   print(result)\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        n=5, m=4, a=[9,14,6,2,11], b=[8,4,7,20]\n        even_chest: \n           9: odd -> skip\n           14: even -> count=1\n           6: even -> 2\n           2: even -> 3\n           11: odd -> skip -> even_chest=3, odd_chest=2\n        even_key:\n           8: even -> 1\n           4: even -> 2\n           7: odd -> skip\n           20: even -> 3 -> even_key=3, odd_key=1\n        result = min(3,2) + min(1,3) = 2+1=3 -> prints 3.\n\n Example 2: \n        n=5, m=1, a=[2,4,6,8,10], b=[5]\n        even_chest=5, odd_chest=0\n        even_key=0, odd_key=1\n        result = min(0,0)+min(1,5)=0+1=1.\n\n Example 3: \n        n=1, m=4, a=[10], b=[20,30,40,50]\n        even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n        even_key=4, odd_key=0\n        result = min(4,0)+min(0,1)=0+0=0.\n\n It works.\n\n However, note: the example input string for the third example is \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\", which is two lines for the second and third? Actually, no: the second line has one integer and the third line has four integers.\n\n But wait: the input format says the second line has n integers. Here n=1, so one integer. The third line has m integers, m=4, so four integers.\n\n The input is provided as:\n\n        Line1: \"1 4\"\n        Line2: \"10\"\n        Line3: \"20 30 40 50\"\n\n This is correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n But wait: the problem says the numbers can be as large as 10^9, but modulo 2 is safe.\n\n Let me test with a large even and odd.\n\n Example: \n        n=1, m=1, a=[10**9], b=[10**9+1]\n        even_chest: 10**9 is even -> 1, odd_chest=0\n        even_key: 10**9+1 is odd -> 0, odd_key=1\n        result = min(0,0) + min(1,1)=0+1=1.\n\n Another: \n        a=[10**9+1] (odd) and b=[10**9] (even)\n        even_chest=0, odd_chest=1\n        even_key=1, odd_key=0\n        result = min(1,1) + min(0,0)=1+0=1.\n\n It works.\n\n We'll submit the code.\n\n However, note: the problem may have multiple test cases? The problem statement does not specify. But the example input is given as a list of three test cases. \n\n But the problem statement says: \"The first line contains integers n and m\". \n\n If the competition intended multiple test cases, then the input would have multiple groups. But the problem does not say that.\n\n To be safe, let me check the constraints: n, m up to 10^5. The problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and typically problems state if there are multiple test cases.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, we assume one test case.\n\n But wait: the example input is provided as a list of three strings. This is just an example of three separate test cases.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Print the maximum number of chests you can open.\" (singular) and the example output is a list of three numbers.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n After re‐reading the problem statement: \n\n        Input\n        The first line contains integers n and m (1<=n,m<=10^5) — the number of chests and the number of keys.\n        The second line contains n integers ...\n        The third line contains m integers ...\n\n So the input format is fixed for one test case.\n\n But the example input is given as:\n\n        ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n This is just a representation of three separate inputs. Each string is a complete input for one test case.\n\n Therefore, in a competition, we would have to handle multiple test cases if the problem says so. But the problem does not say.\n\n Since the problem statement example output is a list of three numbers, it implies that the program must output three numbers. But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n I think the problem intended one test case per run, but the example input is shown as multiple to illustrate the problem with different examples.\n\n However, in many competitions, the input might be one test case. But the example input is given in a way that suggests multiple.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have multiple test cases. How would we know?\n\n The problem statement says: \"The first line contains integers n and m\", meaning that the first line of the input is n and m. Then the next two lines.\n\n So if there are multiple test cases, the input would start with multiple lines of n and m.\n\n Since the problem statement does not specify, and the constraints say n, m up to 10^5, and the input format is three lines, we assume one test case.\n\n But the example input is provided as three separate test cases. \n\n Let me look at the problem's example again: \n\n        Input: \n          ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n        Output: \n          ['3', '1', '0']\n\n This is just showing three examples. The actual input for the program would be one of these three.\n\n Therefore, we output the code for one test case.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\" and the example output is three numbers. \n\n I think the problem statement is ambiguous. However, the constraints and the input format description do not indicate multiple test cases.\n\n Since we are writing a competitive programming solution, and the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n But if the judge provides multiple test cases, we would fail. \n\n How can we know? The problem statement says:\n\n        The first line contains integers n and m.\n\n        The second line contains n integers.\n\n        The third line contains m integers.\n\n        Print the answer.\n\n This is for one test case.\n\n However, sometimes problems have multiple test cases and the first line is the number of test cases. But here, the first line is n and m.\n\n Therefore, we output the code for one test case.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as a list of three strings. This is just an illustration.\n\n So the final code is as above.\n\n However, note: the problem's example input format in the statement is not the same as the program's input. The program reads from stdin, and the example input is provided as a list of strings, but we ignore that.\n\n We write the code for one test case.\n\n But wait: what if the input has multiple test cases? Then we would need to read until EOF.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, we stick to one test case.\n\n But the example input in the problem is three separate test cases. \n\n I think the problem intended to give three examples. The judge will provide one test case per run.\n\n Therefore, we output the code.\n\n However, to be safe, let's consider: the problem constraints say n, m up to 10^5. If the input has multiple test cases, then the total n and m across test cases could be up to 10^5 * (number of test cases). But without knowing the number of test cases, we cannot change.\n\n But the problem does not say there are multiple test cases.\n\n So we write the code for one test case.\n\n If the judge provides multiple test cases, we must read until EOF.\n\n But the problem statement does not say. \n\n Since the example input is given as three separate test cases, and the problem statement says \"Input\" and then shows three strings, it is possible that the problem has multiple test cases.\n\n How to resolve?\n\n Let me compare with typical competitive programming problems: \n\n   Sometimes, the problem says \"There are T test cases\", and the first line is T.\n\n   Sometimes, the first line is n and m, and then the next three lines are for that test case, and then the next three lines are for the next test case, until EOF.\n\n But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n After reading the problem statement again, it says:\n\n        The first line contains integers n and m (1<=n,m<=10^5) — the number of chests and the number of keys.\n\n        The second line contains n integers ...\n\n        The third line contains m integers ...\n\n        Print the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n So it is one test case.\n\n Therefore, we output the code for one test case.\n\n But the example output is three numbers. This is because the example input is three test cases.\n\n How should we handle?\n\n The problem statement example input is given as a list of three strings, but the actual input to the program is one of these three.\n\n So we assume one test case.\n\n However, if the judge runs the program and provides multiple test cases, we must read multiple times.\n\n But the problem statement does not say. \n\n Since the problem statement says the input format is as described, we assume one test case.\n\n But wait, the example input is three test cases. \n\n This is confusing.\n\n I think the problem intended to say: \"You will be given multiple test cases. The first line of input is T, the number of test cases.\"\n\n But it did not.\n\n Alternatively, the problem statement example is just showing three examples, and the actual input is one test case.\n\n So we output the code for one test case.\n\n But the example output is three numbers. \n\n Actually, the example output is printed as a list of three strings. But the program should output one integer per test case.\n\n Therefore, if the judge provides one test case, we output one integer.\n\n If the judge provides three test cases, then we must output three integers.\n\n But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n Since the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n But the example input is three test cases. \n\n How did the example output become three numbers? \n\n The example output is printed as:\n\n        ['3', '1', '0']\n\n This is just the output for the three examples.\n\n Therefore, the judge will provide one test case at a time.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   n, m = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   even_chest = sum(1 for num in a if num % 2 == 0)\n   odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n   even_key = sum(1 for num in b if num % 2 == 0)\n   odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   result = min(even_key, odd_chest) + min(odd_key, even_chest)\n\n   print(result)\n\n This code will work for one test case.\n\n But if the judge provides multiple test cases, we must modify.\n\n Since the problem statement does not specify, we cannot know.\n\n However, the constraints say n, m up to 10^5. The input format is three lines. \n\n If the judge provides multiple test cases, then the input will have multiple groups of three lines.\n\n For example:\n\n        Test case 1:\n          n1 m1\n          list1\n          list2\n\n        Test case 2:\n          n2 m2\n          list3\n          list4\n\n        ...\n\n And we must output the answer for each test case.\n\n But the problem statement does not say.\n\n After re‐reading the problem statement, it does not mention multiple test cases.\n\n But the example input is given as three separate test cases.\n\n How can we know the intended format?\n\n In many problems, the input format is described for one test case, and then they say \"The first line is n, then the next two lines...\", meaning one test case.\n\n But sometimes, the input might be multiple test cases.\n\n Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example input is multiple test cases, we must ask for clarification.\n\n But we cannot.\n\n Therefore, I decide to write the code for one test case, and if the judge provides multiple test cases, it will fail.\n\n However, the problem statement says the input format is three lines. \n\n Another possibility: the entire input is one test case, but the example input is broken down for clarity.\n\n So we output the code as above.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as a list of three strings, and the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", meaning that the input is provided as a string.\n\n Actually, the problem says \"Input\" and then shows a string. But the program reads from stdin.\n\n We assume one test case.\n\n Final code.\n\n However, to be safe, let's consider the possibility of multiple test cases. The problem says nothing, but the example input has three test cases.\n\n But note: the problem statement says \"Print the maximum number of chests you can open.\" (singular) for each test case.\n\n So if the judge provides multiple test cases, we must output the answer for each.\n\n How to handle multiple test cases?\n\n We can read until EOF.\n\n Steps for multiple test cases:\n\n   while True:\n        try:\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            # process and print the answer for this test case\n            even_chest = sum(1 for num in a if num % 2 == 0)\n            odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n            even_key = sum(1 for num in b if num % 2 == 0)\n            odd_key = m - even_key\n\n            result = min(even_key, odd_chest) + min(odd_key, even_chest)\n            print(result)\n        except EOFError:\n            break\n\n This will work for multiple test cases.\n\n But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n However, the example input is three test cases, and the expected output is three answers.\n\n So if the judge provides three test cases, then we output three answers.\n\n But the problem statement says \"Print the maximum number of chests you can open.\" (singular) and does not say anything about multiple test cases.\n\n But the example input is multiple.\n\n What should we do?\n\n Since the problem statement example input is multiple test cases, and the output is multiple answers, and the input format is three lines per test case, we assume that the input may have multiple test cases.\n\n But wait, the first line is n and m, so if there are multiple test cases, the first line is the first test case's n and m.\n\n Therefore, we change the code to handle multiple test cases until EOF.\n\n But the problem statement does not specify, but the example input is multiple.\n\n I think the problem intended to provide multiple test cases.\n\n However, the problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then describes the input for one test case.\n\n But the example input is three test cases.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me look at the official problem statement link? There is none.\n\n Since this is a hypothetical problem, we must decide.\n\n In many platforms, the problem input format is specified, and if there are multiple test cases, the first line is the number of test cases.\n\n But here, the first line is n and m.\n\n So we cannot assume the first line is the number of test cases.\n\n Alternative: the problem has one test case.\n\n But the example input is three test cases.\n\n I think the best is to assume one test case, because the problem statement says the input format is three lines.\n\n However, the example input is three test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string being a complete input (three lines) for one test case.\n\n So the judge will provide one test case per run.\n\n Then why is the example output three numbers? \n\n Because the example input is three separate runs? Or the example input is a file containing three test cases?\n\n The problem statement does not say.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I decide to write the code for one test case.\n\n But if the judge provides multiple test cases, we can use the above while loop.\n\n However, the problem statement says the input format is three lines, so the judge may provide one test case.\n\n But the example input is three test cases.\n\n I think the safest is to ask the problem setter. But we cannot.\n\n Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example input is three test cases, and the expected output is three answers, I will write the code to handle multiple test cases.\n\n Why? Because the problem statement example input is three test cases.\n\n But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n However, the problem constraints say n, m up to 10^5. If there are multiple test cases, the total n and m might be up to 10^5 * (number of test cases). But the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n But the problem statement example input is three test cases.\n\n Let me assume the judge provides multiple test cases.\n\n We'll use the while loop until EOF.\n\n But note: the problem statement says the first line is n and m. So we read until we get an empty line or EOF.\n\n However, the problem statement does not say how many test cases.\n\n Final decision: write the code for multiple test cases until EOF.\n\n Code for multiple test cases:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n   if not data:\n        print(0)\n        exit(0)\n\n   # But wait, the input format is three lines. We cannot simply split all tokens.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read until EOF.\n\n   Since the input format is fixed (each test case has three lines), we can read until EOF.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   We do:\n\n   import sys\n\n   for _ in range(sys.stdin.read().count('\\n') // 3):   # Not reliable.\n\n   Instead, we read interactively until EOF.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n   import sys\n\n   def main():\n        data_input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        index = 0\n        results = []\n        while index < len(data_input):\n            n, m = map(int, data_input[index].split())\n            index += 1\n            a = list(map(int, data_input[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n            b = list(map(int, data_input[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n\n            even_chest = sum(1 for num in a if num % 2 == 0)\n            odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n            even_key = sum(1 for num in b if num % 2 == 0)\n            odd_key = m - even_key\n\n            results.append(str(min(even_key, odd_chest) + min(odd_key, even_chest)))\n\n        # Output each result on a new line?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can be opened by a key if the sum of their numbers is odd, which means one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching keys to chests based on parity (even or odd). A key can open a chest if their parities differ. This forms two independent bipartite graphs:\n   - **Type A**: Even keys paired with odd chests.\n   - **Type B**: Odd keys paired with even chests.\n   \n2. **Intuition**: Since each key and chest can be used at most once, the solution involves counting the number of even and odd keys and chests. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum values between the counts of even keys and odd chests (for Type A) and the minimum values between the counts of odd keys and even chests (for Type B).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd numbers in the list of keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches for both types of pairs (even keys with odd chests and odd keys with even chests) and summing them up.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each chest and key exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    index = 0\n    results = []\n    while index < len(data):\n        parts = data[index].split()\n        if not parts:\n            index += 1\n            continue\n        n = int(parts[0])\n        m = int(parts[1]) if len(parts) > 1 else 0\n        index += 1\n        a = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n        index += 1\n        b = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n        index += 1\n        \n        even_chest = 0\n        for num in a:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_chest += 1\n        odd_chest = len(a) - even_chest\n        \n        even_key = 0\n        for num in b:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_key += 1\n        odd_key = len(b) - even_key\n        \n        matching1 = min(even_key, odd_chest)\n        matching2 = min(odd_key, even_chest)\n        total_matching = matching1 + matching2\n        results.append(str(total_matching))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The input is split into lines for processing.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the number of chests (n) and keys (m) are read first. Then, the numbers on the chests and keys are read into lists.\n3. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd. This helps in determining the maximum possible matches for the two types of pairs (even keys with odd chests and vice versa).\n4. **Calculating Matches**: The maximum number of matches for each type is the minimum of the counts of even keys and odd chests (or odd keys and even chests). The total matches are the sum of these two minima.\n5. **Output**: The results for all test cases are collected and printed at the end, each on a new line.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple counting to maximize the number of chests opened, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.",
