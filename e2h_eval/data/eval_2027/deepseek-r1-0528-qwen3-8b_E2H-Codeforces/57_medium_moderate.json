His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two numbers n and x in the first line.\n Then two lists: one for the first tour (list a) and one for the second tour (list b).\n\n We know that Vasya's total points (from both tours) is at least x. However, we don't know which participant is Vasya, but we know that there are two integers i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n The problem: we have to find the best and worst place Vasya could have got.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that each participant has two scores (from the two tours). But the assignment of which a_i goes with which b_j is arbitrary.\n\n 2. The total for a participant is the sum of two scores. The ranking is by total points, and ties can be broken arbitrarily (so the jury can assign the order arbitrarily).\n\n 3. We are to consider all possible ways to pair the a's and b's (but note: the problem states that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order, and each participant has one from a and one from b? Actually, the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\", meaning we have two sets of n numbers, but each participant appears once in the first list and once in the second? Not exactly: the input gives two lists of n integers. So there are n participants, each having a score in the first tour and a score in the second tour. However, we don't know which score from the first list goes with which from the second.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\". So actually, we have two arrays of n integers each, and we know that the same participant's two scores are one from the first array and one from the second array. However, the pairing is arbitrary.\n\n 4. Therefore, we can form an array of pairs (a_i, b_j) for all i, j? But wait, that would be n*n pairs. However, note: each participant must have exactly one a and one b. But we are not told which a goes with which b. So we are allowed to assign any a_i to any b_j? Actually, no: the problem says \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\", meaning that the two lists are independent. Each participant is represented by one element from the first list and one from the second. But we are free to assign the a_i to the b_j arbitrarily (like a bipartite matching). However, note: the problem does not require that the same participant's two scores are consecutive or anything. It just gives two lists.\n\n But then note: the example input: \n     5 2\n     1 1 1 1 1\n     1 1 1 1 1\n\n And the output: 1 5.\n\n This means that we are allowed to assign the scores arbitrarily. However, we cannot change the multiset of the first tour scores and the second tour scores.\n\n 5. Important: We are told that Vasya has at least x points. But we don't know which participant is Vasya. However, we know that Vasya is one of the participants, so his total is the sum of one element from the first list and one element from the second list, and that sum is >= x.\n\n 6. How to approach?\n\n We are to consider two scenarios:\n\n - Best place: We want to minimize the number of participants with total points >= Vasya's total (because if we can arrange so that as few as possible have more than Vasya, then Vasya can get a high rank). Actually, we want to maximize Vasya's total (to be as high as possible) and then minimize the number of participants that have a total >= that maximum? Or is it about arranging the other participants' totals to be as low as possible relative to Vasya?\n\n Actually, we can choose which a and b belong to Vasya (as long as their sum is at least x) and then assign the remaining scores arbitrarily to the other participants.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\", meaning that the two lists are fixed. We cannot change the multiset of the two lists.\n\n Let me restate:\n\n We have two multisets: A (first tour scores) and B (second tour scores). There are n participants. We must assign each element of A to one element of B (a bijection). Then the total for a participant is the sum of the assigned pair.\n\n Now, Vasya is one participant. We know that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j >= x. But note: we don't know which participant is Vasya. However, the problem says: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that ai + bj ≥ x\".\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Vasya was present\", so we know that Vasya has two scores (one from A and one from B) and their sum is at least x.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that Vasya must be one specific participant. Actually, we are allowed to choose which pair (a_i, b_j) is Vasya's? Because the teacher doesn't know which is Vasya. So we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya as long as a_i+b_j>=x, and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the condition says \"It is guaranteed that Vasya was present — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that ai + bj ≥ x.\" — so we can choose the pair (a_i, b_j) that we want to assign to Vasya (since we don't know which is his, we can choose the best one for maximizing his total and also the worst one for minimizing his total? Actually, we are going to consider two different scenarios: best and worst.\n\n However, note: we are not forced to fix Vasya's pair arbitrarily. We are to consider all possible assignments and then determine the best and worst place Vasya could have.\n\n But wait: the problem says that the teacher has the two lists. The actual assignment of the two lists to participants is arbitrary (we don't know which a_i is paired with which b_j). So we can choose the pairing arbitrarily.\n\n Therefore, we can:\n\n For the best place scenario:\n   - We want to assign the highest possible total to Vasya (so that he is as high as possible) and then assign the rest so that as few as possible have a total greater than or equal to Vasya's.\n\n But note: we are allowed to assign the entire set arbitrarily. So we can choose the best pair for Vasya (the maximum possible total from the two lists) and then assign the remaining a's and b's to minimize the number of participants with total >= Vasya's.\n\n However, we are constrained by the two multisets A and B.\n\n Alternatively, we can think:\n\n Step 1: Combine the two lists and consider all participants. But note: the pairing is arbitrary, so we can independently sort A and B.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the same participant's two scores are consecutive. But we are allowed to assign arbitrarily.\n\n We can do:\n\n Let S = [a1, a2, ..., an] and T = [b1, b2, ..., bn].\n\n We are going to form a set of n pairs (a_i, b_j). The total for a participant is the sum of the two.\n\n To compute the best and worst place, we need to consider:\n\n  - Best place: We want to maximize Vasya's total and then minimize the number of participants with total >= Vasya's total.\n\n But wait: we don't know which participant is Vasya. Actually, we are allowed to choose which pair is Vasya's. So:\n\n  In the best case:\n    We choose a pair (a, b) for Vasya such that a+b is as large as possible (so we take the maximum possible total from the entire set? Actually, we can assign the two lists arbitrarily, so we can assign the largest a and largest b to Vasya? But wait, the two lists are independent. However, we cannot use the same element twice.\n\n  Actually, we can assign arbitrarily, so we can pick any a and any b for Vasya. So the maximum total for Vasya is max(a) + max(b). But wait: we have to assign the rest without reusing the same element. So if we take the top a and top b for Vasya, then the rest of the a's and b's are fixed.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose any a and any b for Vasya. Therefore, the maximum total for Vasya is indeed max(a) + max(b). Similarly, the minimum total for Vasya is the minimum value of a+b that is at least x? But wait, no: we are free to choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya as long as the sum is at least x. However, for the worst place, we want to minimize Vasya's total (but still at least x) so that he falls behind as many participants as possible.\n\n  But note: the problem states that Vasya's total is at least x. So we must choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j>=x. However, for the worst case, we would choose the minimal total that is >= x.\n\n  However, wait: the problem does not say that Vasya must have the minimal total that is >= x. It says that his total is at least x. So we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j>=x. Therefore, for the worst case, we can choose the smallest total that is >= x (if such exists) to minimize his standing.\n\n  But note: we are not forced to use the minimal total for Vasya. However, to get the worst place, we want to minimize the total of Vasya (as long as it is at least x) so that we can maximize the number of participants with total > Vasya's total.\n\n  However, we cannot arbitrarily choose the minimal total because the assignment must be consistent: we have to assign all a's and b's to distinct participants.\n\n  So the problem becomes:\n\n  We have two multisets A and B. We want to assign each a in A to a distinct b in B. Then, we pick one participant (Vasya) whose total is at least x.\n\n  We are to compute:\n\n    Best place: the highest rank Vasya can achieve (lowest place number)\n    Worst place: the lowest rank Vasya can achieve (highest place number)\n\n  How to compute?\n\n  Idea:\n\n  We can precompute the entire set of possible pairs? That is too expensive (n up to 10^5).\n\n  Alternate approach:\n\n  Step 1: Sort both A and B.\n\n  Step 2: Consider the entire set of participants. The total for a participant is the sum of two scores. We are going to count the number of participants that have a total greater than a given value, etc.\n\n  However, note: we can assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we can form the entire set of n pairs arbitrarily. We are allowed to assign the highest a to the highest b, or the highest a to the lowest b, etc.\n\n  We can use the following:\n\n  Let's form an array C where each element is the sum of an a and a b, but we are free to assign. However, we cannot assign the same a or same b twice.\n\n  We can use a greedy method.\n\n  For the best place:\n\n    We want to maximize Vasya's total. So we choose the maximum total: M = max(A) + max(B). But then we have to assign the rest. However, we are allowed to choose which a and b for Vasya. Then we remove that a and b from the sets and assign the rest optimally to minimize the number of participants with total >= M.\n\n    But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily the rest. The rest of the participants: we have n-1 a's and n-1 b's. We can assign them arbitrarily.\n\n    How many participants (excluding Vasya) can have a total >= M?\n\n    Since M is the maximum possible total (from the entire set), then the only way to get a total >= M is to have the two largest numbers from A and B? Actually, no: if we assign the two largest numbers to Vasya, then the next best total is the next largest a plus the next largest b. But wait: we can also have the same total M? Actually, if there are duplicate maximums, then we might have multiple participants with total M.\n\n    However, note: we removed the two maximums (the one we used for Vasya). Then the remaining maximums are the next ones.\n\n    Actually, we should consider:\n\n      Let M = max(A) + max(B). But what if there are duplicates? Then we might have multiple pairs that can form M. So the number of participants with total >= M is at least 1 (Vasya) and then we can have others if there are duplicates.\n\n    But wait: we are free to assign. So if we assign the two largest to Vasya, then the rest of the participants can only get totals that are <= (second largest in A + second largest in B). So the number of participants with total >= M is exactly 1 (Vasya) if we break the tie arbitrarily? Actually, no: if there are two pairs that can form M, then we can assign one to Vasya and leave the other for another participant. Then that other participant would have total M as well.\n\n    Therefore, we must count the frequency of the maximum total.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      Count the number of pairs (a, b) such that a+b >= M. But note: we are constrained by the fact that we cannot use the same a or b twice.\n\n    Actually, we can use the following:\n\n      Step for best place:\n\n        We choose the maximum total M = max_A + max_B.\n\n        Then, we want to know: how many distinct pairs (a, b) (with a from A and b from B) have a+b >= M? Actually, we are forming a bipartite graph and we want to cover as few participants as possible (so that we can assign the rest arbitrarily) but we are forced to use the entire set.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So we can choose any a and any b for Vasya (the one that gives M). Then, we must assign the remaining n-1 a's and n-1 b's to form n-1 participants.\n\n        The best place for Vasya is determined by how many participants (other than him) have total >= M. Then his rank is (number of participants with total > M) + 1 (because if there are k participants with total > M, then they are above Vasya, and then Vasya is next). But note: if there are participants with total equal to M, then they can be placed arbitrarily. However, in the best scenario, we can assume that the jury places Vasya above all others with the same total. Therefore, we can ignore the ties for the best place? Actually, no: the problem says that the jury can break ties arbitrarily. So we can assume that the jury will put Vasya above the others with the same total.\n\n        Therefore, for the best place:\n\n          We want to minimize the number of participants with total > M.\n\n          Then, the best place is 1 + (# of participants with total > M).\n\n        How to compute the number of participants with total > M? Actually, we can form a bipartite graph and count the maximum matching for the condition a+b >= M. But note: we are allowed to use each element only once.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: after assigning the two largest to Vasya, we are left with two sets A' = A without max_A and B' = B without max_B. Then, what is the maximum number of participants we can form with total >= M? \n\n        Actually, since M is the maximum, the next best total is the second maximum in A and the second maximum in B, but note: we can mix and match. The maximum total we can form from the remaining is (max_A2 + max_B2) or (max_A2 + max_B) or (max_A + max_B2)? Actually, no: we already removed the two maximums. So the remaining maximums are the second and third largest in A and B.\n\n        But wait: we removed the absolute maximums. So the next maximums are the next ones. However, we can form a total of (second_max_A + second_max_B) if they are available.\n\n        However, we cannot form a total >= M from the remaining set because M is the maximum. Therefore, the number of participants with total >= M is exactly 1 (Vasya) and then we can break ties arbitrarily so that Vasya is first.\n\n        But wait: what if there are multiple pairs that form M? Then we can assign one to Vasya and the rest to other participants, making their total M as well. Then we have more than one participant with total >= M.\n\n        Example: \n          A = [10, 10], B = [10, 10], x=20.\n\n          Then M = 20. There are 4 pairs: (10,10) -> 20, (10,10) -> 20, (10,10) -> 20, (10,10) -> 20. But we have two participants. We must assign each a to a distinct b.\n\n          The two participants: one gets (10,10) and the other gets (10,10). Then both have total 20.\n\n          Then the best place: the jury can assign the first place arbitrarily. So if we choose Vasya to be one of them, then the best place is 1 (if the jury puts Vasya first) and the worst place is 2 (if the jury puts the other first).\n\n          However, wait: the problem says that the total results' table sorts by decreasing points. If two participants have the same total, the jury can break the tie arbitrarily. So the best place for Vasya is 1 (if the jury breaks the tie in his favor) and the worst is 2.\n\n        So the best place is 1, and the worst is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the best place is 1 + (# of participants with total > M) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n        The worst place: we have to consider that there is one other participant with total M. Then the worst place is 2.\n\n        How to compute the worst place? We must consider that we choose a pair for Vasya that is the minimal one that is >= x (so that his total is as low as possible) and then count the maximum number of participants that can have total > Vasya's total, and then the worst place is 1 + (# of participants with total > Vasya's total) + (# of participants with total == Vasya's total) [because the ties can be broken arbitrarily to push Vasya to the worst]? Actually, no: in the worst case, we want to maximize the rank (i.e., the place number). The rank is computed by: \n          Let t = Vasya's total.\n          Then the rank is (number of participants with total > t) + (if we break ties arbitrarily, then we can put Vasya anywhere among the ones with total == t). To get the worst rank, we assume that all the participants with total == t are placed after Vasya? No, actually: to get the worst rank, we assume that the jury places all the participants with total > t first, and then all the participants with total == t are placed arbitrarily, and then Vasya is placed last among the ones with total == t. But wait, no: the problem says the table is sorted by decreasing points, and the ties are broken arbitrarily. To get the worst place, we want to minimize Vasya's total (so that as many as possible have a higher total) and also we want to maximize the number of participants that have the same total as Vasya (so that they are placed above him? No, the opposite: the same total can be broken arbitrarily, so we can push Vasya to the last position of the group with the same total). \n\n        Actually, the worst place is:\n\n          Let t0 be the minimal total we can assign to Vasya (which is at least x). Then, we want to count:\n\n          Let k1 = number of participants with total > t0\n          Let k2 = number of participants with total == t0\n\n          Then, the worst place is k1 + k2 + 1? But wait: if there are k1 participants with more, then they are above. Then the group of participants with total == t0: there are k2 of them. The worst case is that we put Vasya at the end of the group of k2, so his place is k1 + k2 + 1.\n\n        However, note: the participants with total == t0 can be broken arbitrarily. In the worst case, we put all the other k2-1 participants above Vasya in the same total group. Then the rank of Vasya is k1 + (k2) [because the first k1 are above, then the next k2 are the ones with total == t0, but Vasya is the last one in that group] so his rank is k1 + k2 + 1? \n\n        Actually, the ranking is:\n\n          Place 1: the first participant (with the highest total)\n          ...\n          Place k1: the last participant with total > t0\n          Then, the next k2 places are for the participants with total == t0.\n\n          So if Vasya is the last one in the group of k2, then his place is k1 + k2 + 1.\n\n        But wait: if there are k2 participants with total == t0, then the first one in the group is at place k1+1, the second at k1+2, ... and the last (Vasya) at k1+k2+1.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify that the same total group is broken in a particular way. We are to assume the worst (for Vasya) so we put him last in the group.\n\n        Therefore, worst_place = (number of participants with total > t0) + (number of participants with total == t0) + 1.\n\n        But note: the total number of participants is n. And we are counting the entire set of participants (including Vasya). However, wait: we are counting the participants with total > t0 and the participants with total == t0 (which includes Vasya). So:\n\n          k1 = number of participants with total > t0\n          k2 = number of participants with total == t0 (this includes Vasya)\n\n        Then the worst place is k1 + (k2) [because the group of k2 includes Vasya, and we want to put Vasya at the end of this group] so the place is k1 + k2 + 1? \n\n        Actually, no: the group of k2 participants (all with total == t0) will occupy the positions from k1+1 to k1+k2. Then Vasya is the last one, so his place is k1+k2+1.\n\n        But note: the total number of participants is n, so the maximum place is n. And k1+k2 <= n (because k1 counts the ones strictly above, and k2 counts the ones equal, and the rest are below). \n\n        However, wait: we are considering the entire set of n participants. But we fixed Vasya's total to t0, and we are counting the others. Actually, the entire set of n participants are the ones we are considering. And the assignment is fixed: we have n participants. We are counting for the entire set.\n\n        But note: we are free to choose the assignment (the pairing) arbitrarily. Therefore, we can choose the minimal total t0 (>=x) for Vasya and then arrange the rest of the participants to maximize the number of participants with total > t0 and minimize the number of participants with total == t0? Actually, no: we are trying to compute the worst place, so we want to minimize Vasya's total and then maximize the number of participants with total > t0 and also maximize the number of participants with total == t0 (so that the group is as big as possible and Vasya is pushed to a worse place). \n\n        Actually, we can control the assignment arbitrarily. So for the worst place:\n\n          We choose the minimal total t0 (>=x) for Vasya (which we can do by choosing the smallest a and the smallest b that together sum to at least x? Not necessarily: we can choose any a and b. To minimize the total, we choose the smallest a and the smallest b? But note: the minimal total that is >= x might be achieved by a small a and a large b, or a large a and a small b.\n\n        However, we can use the following:\n\n          Step for worst place:\n\n            We want to minimize Vasya's total (so that we can have as many participants as possible with a total > Vasya's). But note: we are constrained by the two multisets. We can choose any a and any b for Vasya (as long as the sum is >=x). Then, we assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n            The minimal total for Vasya is the minimal value T_min such that there exists an a in A and b in B with a+b>=x and a+b = T_min.\n\n            However, we can also consider: we want to minimize the total of Vasya, so we choose the minimal T_min (>=x) that can be formed by any a and b.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the minimal T_min (>=x) from the entire set of pairs? However, we must leave the remaining a and b for the other participants.\n\n            Then, we must compute:\n\n              k1 = maximum number of participants (from the remaining n-1) that can have a total > T_min.\n\n              k2 = the rest (the ones with total == T_min) and also note that we must account for the possibility that there are multiple pairs that yield T_min.\n\n            However, we are free to assign arbitrarily. So we can assign the rest of the pairs arbitrarily. Therefore, the maximum number of participants that can have total > T_min is limited by the available a and b.\n\n            Actually, we can use a greedy matching:\n\n              We want to form as many participants as possible with total > T_min.\n\n              We can do:\n\n                Sort A and B.\n\n                Then, for the entire set (without the chosen a and b for Vasya) we can form a bipartite graph and try to count the maximum matching for the condition: a+b > T_min.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. The maximum matching for a+b > T_min is independent of the removal of Vasya's pair? Actually, we have to remove one a and one b (the ones we chose for Vasya).\n\n            Alternatively, we can think:\n\n              Without removing any, we can count the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j > T_min. But then we subtract the one we used for Vasya.\n\n            However, we are free to choose which a and b to remove (as long as their sum is T_min). So we want to remove the pair (a0, b0) such that T_min = a0+b0 and then maximize the number of pairs (from the remaining) that are > T_min.\n\n            Actually, for the worst place, we want to minimize the total of Vasya (so we choose the minimal T_min) and then we want to maximize the number of participants with total > T_min (so that the rank is as bad as possible). But note: we are constrained by the two multisets. The minimal T_min is fixed (we choose the smallest T_min >= x). Then, we remove one occurrence of an a0 and one occurrence of a b0 such that a0+b0 = T_min (and we choose the one that minimizes the damage to the possibility of forming high totals? Actually, to maximize the number of participants with total > T_min, we want to remove a pair that is as small as possible (so that we don't remove a large a or a large b that could be used to form a high total). \n\n            This is getting very complicated.\n\n 7. Alternative Insight:\n\n  We can use the following known solution for similar problems (like CodeForces problems):\n\n    Sort the first list A in non-decreasing order, and the second list B in non-decreasing order.\n\n    Then, consider the entire set of participants. We can form a matrix of n x n, but we don't want to do that.\n\n    Instead, we can use two pointers or binary search.\n\n    Steps for best and worst place:\n\n    Let's define:\n\n      Let C be the array of all possible sums? But we cannot store n*n.\n\n    Another known idea: \n\n      We can use the concept of \"matching\" and \"counting\" the pairs.\n\n    However, note constraints: n up to 10^5, and the numbers up to 10^5.\n\n    Known efficient solution:\n\n      Step 1: Sort A and B.\n\n      Step 2: Precompute the prefix sums for A and B? Or use two pointers.\n\n    For the best place:\n\n      We want to know: what is the maximum total we can assign to Vasya? Then, how many participants (from the entire set) can have a total >= Vasya's total?\n\n      Actually, we can assign arbitrarily, so we can assign the two largest to Vasya, and then the rest. Then, the number of participants with total >= M (where M is the maximum) is the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) (with distinct indices) such that a_i+b_j >= M.\n\n      But note: we are constrained by the two multisets. We can use:\n\n        Let A_sorted = sorted(A)\n        Let B_sorted = sorted(B)\n\n        Then, the maximum total is M = A_sorted[-1] + B_sorted[-1]\n\n        Now, how many participants (in the entire set) can have total >= M? \n\n        Actually, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. The condition for a participant to have total >= M is that the sum of two numbers is at least M. But note: M is the maximum, so the only pairs that can achieve M or more are the ones that use the largest numbers.\n\n        Specifically, we can use:\n\n          Count the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j >= M.\n\n        But wait, we are constrained by distinct indices. We can use each a_i and b_j only once.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Let x = A_sorted[-1], y = B_sorted[-1]. Then, we remove these two.\n\n          Then, the next candidate for a total >= M is to use the next largest a and the next largest b? But note: M is the maximum, so no other pair can exceed M. Therefore, the only pairs that can have total >= M are those that include either x or y (or both) and the rest? Actually, no: because if we use a smaller a and a smaller b, the sum might be less than M.\n\n        Actually, the condition for a participant to have total >= M is that the sum is at least M. Since M is the maximum, then the only pairs that can have total >= M are the pairs that are (x, y) and possibly others that are (x, some b) if x+b>=M, or (some a, y) if a+y>=M, or (x,y) again? But we are using distinct indices.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So we can assign the two largest to Vasya, and then the next best total is the second largest a plus the second largest b, which is < M (because M is the maximum). Therefore, the number of participants with total >= M is exactly 1 (Vasya) unless there are duplicate maximums.\n\n        But wait: if there are multiple pairs that can form M, then we can assign one to Vasya and the others to other participants. Then the number of participants with total >= M is the frequency of the pair (x,y) in the multiset of pairs? Actually, no: the pairs are defined by the multisets. \n\n        Actually, the number of pairs (a,b) (with distinct indices) that have a+b >= M is:\n\n          We can iterate over the a's and for each a, find the minimum b such that a+b >= M.\n\n        But note: we are constrained by the distinct indices.\n\n        This is getting messy.\n\n    After reading known solutions to similar problems (e.g., CodeForces), I recall a problem called \"The Olympiad\" or something similar.\n\n    Here is a known solution approach for this problem:\n\n      Step 1: Read n, x, list A, list B.\n\n      Step 2: Sort A and B.\n\n      Step 3: For the best place:\n\n          We want to find the minimal number of participants that can have a total >= x, but we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. However, note: we are to find the best and worst place for Vasya, who has at least x.\n\n          Actually, we can use:\n\n            Let f(t) = the maximum number of participants that can have total >= t.\n\n            Then, the best place for Vasya is the minimal t (starting from x) such that f(t) is at least 1 (for Vasya) and then the rank is f(t) (if we break ties arbitrarily, we can put Vasya first) but wait, no.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          We are going to consider the entire set of participants and count the number of participants that have total >= x. But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can form n pairs arbitrarily.\n\n        Actually, the problem is equivalent to: \n\n          We have two multisets A and B. We can form a bipartite graph. We are to count the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) (with distinct indices) such that a_i+b_j >= t, for various t.\n\n        But note: we are also free to choose which pair is Vasya's.\n\n        Known efficient method:\n\n          Sort A and B.\n\n          For the best place:\n\n            We want to minimize the rank. The rank is the number of participants with total > Vasya's total plus one (if Vasya is alone) or plus the number of participants with the same total if we break ties arbitrarily (but we can break in our favor).\n\n            Actually, the best place is 1 + (the number of participants that must have a total > Vasya's total). But we can choose Vasya's total to be the maximum possible (so that no one has a total > him).\n\n            So:\n\n              Let M = maximum total (A_sorted[-1] + B_sorted[-1])\n\n              Then, we want to know: how many participants (from the entire set) can have total >= M? \n\n              But note: we can assign arbitrarily, so we can assign the two largest to Vasya. Then, the rest cannot have total >= M (because M is the maximum). So the number of participants with total > M is 0. Then the best place is 1.\n\n            But wait, what if there are duplicate maximums? Then there might be more than one participant with total >= M.\n\n            Example: A = [5,5,1], B = [5,5,1], x=10.\n\n            Maximum total is 10. There are 4 pairs that give 10: (5,5) and there are two 5's in A and two 5's in B.\n\n            How many participants can have total >= 10? We can assign two participants to have total 10: by pairing the two 5's in A with two 5's in B. Then there is one participant left with (1,1) -> 2.\n\n            Then, if we choose Vasya to have total 10, then there is one other participant with total 10. Then the best place is 1 (if the jury breaks the tie in our favor) and the worst is 2.\n\n            Therefore, the best place is 1.\n\n            But note: we are free to choose which pair is Vasya's. We choose one of the 10's. Then, we have to assign the remaining. We can assign one of the remaining 5's to a 5 and form a 10, and then the last one is 2.\n\n            So the number of participants with total >= 10 is 2 (Vasya and one other). Then, the best place is 1 (because we can break the tie arbitrarily to put Vasya first).\n\n            How to compute the best place?\n\n              We want to choose a total t (>=x) for Vasya such that the number of participants with total > t is minimized (ideally 0) and then the best place is 1.\n\n              In general, the best place is 1 + (the number of participants that must have a total > Vasya's total).\n\n              But we can choose Vasya's total",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The key insight is that the pairing of scores from the first and second tours can be arbitrary, allowing us to optimize Vasya's placement by strategically choosing his scores and the remaining participants' scores.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists of integers representing scores from the first and second tours.\n   - Vasya's total score must be at least `x`, and we need to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) positions he can achieve.\n   - Positions are determined by sorting all participants by their total scores (sum of both tours), with ties broken arbitrarily by the jury.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Place**: To maximize Vasya's position, assign him the highest possible total score. Then, minimize the number of other participants with higher or equal scores by leveraging the highest available scores.\n   - **Worst Place**: To minimize Vasya's position, assign him the smallest possible total score that meets or exceeds `x`. Then, maximize the number of participants with higher scores by using the best available scores for others.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Sort both lists of scores to facilitate efficient selection of the highest and lowest scores.\n   - **Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to count the number of participants who can have higher scores than Vasya in the best case and lower scores in the worst case.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time. Counting the participants using two pointers is O(n), leading to an overall O(n log n) complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space is used, as we only need to store the sorted lists and a few counters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    # Best place: minimize the number of participants with higher total\n    best_place = 1\n    j = n - 1\n    count_higher = 0\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[j] > x:\n            count_higher += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if j < 0:\n                break\n        if j < 0:\n            break\n            \n    best_place = count_higher + 1\n    print(f\"{best_place} \", end='')\n    \n    # Worst place: maximize the number of participants with higher total\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    count_lower = 0\n    total_needed = x\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        s = a_list[i] + b_list[j]\n        if s >= x:\n            count_lower += 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n            \n    worst_place = n - count_lower + 1\n    print(worst_place)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total score `x`, and the two lists of scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient counting.\n3. **Best Place Calculation**:\n   - Traverse the sorted lists from the end to count how many participants can have a total score higher than Vasya's optimal score (the highest possible). The best place is then `count_higher + 1`.\n4. **Worst Place Calculation**:\n   - Traverse the sorted lists from the beginning to count how many participants can have a total score at least `x` when paired optimally. The worst place is `n - count_lower + 1`, accounting for those with higher scores and ties.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst places are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and two-pointer techniques to determine the optimal positions Vasya can achieve, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
