Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given the number of files n and a list of file sizes.\n We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) such that there exists a moment during the copying process where both progress bars show the same integer.\n\n The first progress bar (current file) at byte x of file i: floor(100 * x / a_i)\n The second progress bar (overall) after copying x bytes of the current file (and all previous files completely): \n     total_so_far = (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{i-1} + x)\n     overall_progress = floor(100 * total_so_far / total)\n\n However, note that the second progress bar uses the entire sum (a1+...+an). Let total = sum(a_i for i=1..n)\n\n Important: The copying is sequential. We are updating after each byte.\n\n Observation:\n We are only concerned with the values that appear on both progress bars at the same time.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the total size = S = a1 + a2 + ... + an.\n\n 2. We can simulate the copying process? But note: n <= 100 and each file up to 1000 bytes -> maximum 100*1000 = 100000 bytes.\n    However, we cannot iterate over each byte for each file because 100000 is acceptable in worst-case for 100 files (but wait: 100*1000 is 100000, so 100000 bytes total). \n    But note: the problem says the files are copied sequentially, and we update after each byte.\n\n 3. Alternatively, we can consider that the first progress bar (for a given file i) will take integer values from 0 to 100 in steps of (100 * (x)) // a_i, but note: the value changes as x increases.\n\n However, note: the two progress bars must be equal at some point. Let the common value be p (from 0 to 100).\n\n Conditions for a common value p at a particular state:\n\n At a state where we are in file i and have copied x bytes (0 <= x <= a_i), then:\n   Condition 1: floor(100 * x / a_i) = p   =>  p <= (100*x)/a_i < p+1\n   Condition 2: floor(100 * (prefix_sum + x) / S) = p   =>  p <= (100*(prefix_sum+x))/S < p+1\n\n But note: prefix_sum = a1+a2+...+a_{i-1}\n\n However, the above conditions must hold at the same moment.\n\n But note: the overall progress also depends on the previous complete files and the current partial file.\n\n How to check for a particular p?\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate by the file-by-file and within each file, we can check for which p's we get the same value.\n\n But note: the overall progress bar is updated with the entire data so far. The entire data so far is (prefix_sum + x) and total is S.\n\n However, note that the overall progress bar might jump from one integer to another as we copy more bytes, but we are only concerned with the moments when they are equal.\n\n Another idea: we can simulate the entire process by iterating over each file and then each byte? Since the maximum total bytes is 100000, and we have at most 100 files, so 100000 iterations is acceptable.\n\n Steps for simulation:\n\n total = sum(a)\n total_copied = 0\n for i in range(n):\n   file_size = a[i]\n   for x in range(1, file_size+1):   # x from 1 to file_size (we start from 0, but 0 is already considered at the beginning of the file)\n        current_file_progress = (100 * x) // file_size   # integer division (floor)\n        overall_progress = (100 * total_copied) // total   # because we have not yet included the current file's x bytes? Actually, total_copied was the previous files and now we add x to the current file.\n\n        But wait, note: the overall progress is computed as:\n            total_so_far = (sum of all previous files) + x\n            overall_progress = (100 * total_so_far) // total\n\n        However, we are updating the overall progress after each byte. So we need to account for the fact that the current file's x bytes are being added.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        Let prefix = total_copied  (which is the sum of all files before this one)\n        Then after x bytes in the current file, total_so_far = prefix + x.\n\n        Then we require:\n            p = current_file_progress = (100*x)//file_size\n            and p = (100*(prefix+x))//total   (note: floor division)\n\n        But note: the same p must be the same integer.\n\n        However, we don't know p in advance. Instead, we can record every p that appears in both conditions at the same time.\n\n        But note: the same p might appear multiple times, we only need to record it once.\n\n        Also, note: we start with 0, so we must consider p=0.\n\n        However, we must consider that the current file's progress and the overall progress might be equal at the same time.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        We'll initialize a set (or a boolean array for p from 0 to 100) to mark which p's are achieved.\n\n        But note: the overall progress bar might show a value that is not the same as the current file's progress bar at that moment.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        Let's create a set `achievable` that contains all p (from 0 to 100) that we see at the same time.\n\n        However, note: we must consider that the overall progress bar might change without the current file's progress bar changing? Actually, we update after each byte, so we can check at every byte.\n\n        But note: the current file's progress bar only changes when x increases. The overall progress bar changes whenever the total_so_far increases.\n\n        We are updating both at every byte.\n\n        But note: we cannot miss the state when the overall progress bar catches up to the current file's progress bar.\n\n        Proposed plan:\n\n        total = sum(a)\n        total_copied = 0\n        seen = [False] * 101   # index from 0 to 100, we'll mark if p is achieved\n\n        # Initially, at the very beginning (0 bytes copied) both are 0.\n        seen[0] = True\n\n        # Then, for each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n        for i in range(n):\n            file_size = a[i]\n            # For the current file, we are going to copy from x=0 to x=file_size, but note: x=0 is already considered at the beginning of the file?\n            # Actually, we start the file at x=0 (which we already have from the previous file's end, unless i==0 then we start with 0). But we already recorded 0.\n            # Now, we are going to simulate from x=1 to x=file_size.\n\n            # However, note: the current file's progress bar at x=0 is 0 (if we haven't started, but we are starting from 0). But we already have 0.\n\n            # We consider x from 1 to file_size.\n\n            for x in range(1, file_size+1):\n                # current file's progress: floor(100 * x / file_size)\n                p1 = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n                # The overall progress: total_so_far = total_copied + x\n                total_so_far = total_copied + x\n                p2 = (100 * total_so_far) // total\n\n                if p1 == p2:\n                    # Then we have found a p (which is p1) that is achieved at this moment.\n                    if p1 <= 100:\n                        seen[p1] = True\n\n            total_copied += file_size   # after finishing the file, we update the total_copied to the next file's prefix.\n\n        But wait: what about the states at the boundaries between files? \n\n        Actually, note: when we finish a file, the overall progress bar is updated to the entire file. And the next file starts with x=0 (so the current file's progress is 0). \n\n        However, we are marking the state at the beginning of the next file? \n\n        In our simulation, we start the next file by updating total_copied (which becomes the prefix for the next file). Then we simulate the next file.\n\n        But note: at the moment we finish a file, the overall progress bar is updated to the entire file's completion. Then we move to the next file. \n\n        However, the condition for the boundary: at the last byte of a file, we have x=file_size, then we mark the overall progress for that last byte. Then we update total_copied and then the next file starts.\n\n        But note: the next file's first byte: we would do x=1, and then total_so_far = (previous total_copied + 1). But the current file's progress for the next file at x=1 is (100*1)//a_{i+1}, and the overall progress is (100*(total_copied + 1))//total.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the overall progress bar is updated with the entire data so far, including the current file. But in our simulation, we are using the entire total (which is fixed) and total_so_far = (previous total_copied) + x (the current file's x bytes). This is correct.\n\n        But note: we must also consider the state at the very beginning of the file? \n\n        Actually, we start the file with x=0. But we already considered 0 at the beginning. However, in our simulation we start from x=1 to file_size. The state at x=0 (start of the file) is the same as the end of the previous file (if any). \n\n        But note: the overall progress bar at the start of the file is the same as at the end of the previous file. And the current file's progress bar is 0 (which we already recorded). \n\n        So we don't need to simulate x=0 for each file.\n\n        However, there is one more thing: the overall progress bar might have been updated to a value that equals 0 even if we are in the middle of a file? Actually no, because we are simulating from x=1 onward.\n\n        But wait: what if the overall progress bar is 0 and the current file's progress bar is 0? We already marked 0 at the beginning. \n\n        Now, the problem: we are only checking the condition at the moment we copy a byte. However, note that the overall progress bar might jump over a value. But we are updating at every byte, so we are checking every integer value that the overall progress bar takes (because the overall progress bar only changes by integer steps, and we check every byte).\n\n        However, the current file's progress bar changes only at multiples of (file_size/100) but we are checking every byte. That is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the condition for the current file's progress bar: we are checking every byte. Similarly for the overall progress bar.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"exists a moment\" meaning at some byte copy. So we are covering every moment.\n\n        But note: we are using floor division. The overall progress bar is updated with floor(100 * total_so_far / total). The value of total_so_far is an integer, so floor division is the same as integer division.\n\n        However, there is a possibility that the same p might be achieved multiple times, but we are only interested in whether it is achieved at least once.\n\n        But wait: what if the same p is achieved in multiple files? Then we mark it once.\n\n        After simulation, we output all p from 0 to 100 for which seen[p] is True, in increasing order.\n\n        However, let's test with the example: ['1\\n6'] (one file of 6 bytes)\n\n        total = 6\n        total_copied = 0\n\n        For file0 (size=6):\n\n          x=1: p1 = (100*1)//6 = 16, p2 = (100*(0+1))//6 = 16 -> mark 16.\n          x=2: p1 = (200)//6 = 33, p2 = (200)//6 = 33 -> mark 33.\n          x=3: p1 = (300)//6 = 50, p2 = (300)//6 = 50 -> mark 50.\n          x=4: p1 = (400)//6 = 66, p2 = (400)//6 = 66 -> mark 66.\n          x=5: p1 = (500)//6 = 83, p2 = (500)//6 = 83 -> mark 83.\n          x=6: p1 = (600)//6 = 100, p2 = (600)//6 = 100 -> mark 100.\n\n        Then we output: 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\n        But wait: the example output is: '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'\n\n        However, we did not mark 0 again, but we had initially marked 0.\n\n        But note: we started by marking 0. Then we also marked 16,33,...,100. So we output 0 and then the rest.\n\n        But wait: the example input ['2\\n100 500'] should output: 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\n        Let me simulate the second example: n=2, files = [100,500]\n\n        total = 600.\n\n        First file (100 bytes):\n\n          x from 1 to 100:\n          For x=1 to 100: \n            p1 = (100*x)//100 = x   (exactly)\n            p2 = (100*(0+x))//600 = (100*x)//600\n\n            We mark p if p1 == p2.\n\n            So we need x such that x = (100*x)//600.\n\n            Rearranged: x = floor(100*x/600)   -> but note: x must be an integer from 1 to 100.\n\n            Check: \n              x = 0: already marked (we start with 0, and then we start the first file at x=0, but we simulate from x=1 to 100)\n              x=1: 1 == (100*1)//600 = 0 -> not equal.\n              x=2: 2 == (200)//600 = 0 -> no.\n              ...\n              x=6: 6 == (600)//600 = 1 -> no.\n              x=60: 60 == (6000)//600 = 10 -> no.\n              x=600? but x only goes to 100.\n\n            Actually, we must check for every x: \n            p1 = x, p2 = (100*x)//600\n\n            We are looking for x such that x = (100*x)//600.\n\n            This implies: 600*x >= 100*x * (something) ? \n\n            Actually: x = floor(100*x/600)  => x <= 100*x/600 < x+1.\n\n            But 100*x/600 = x/6, so we require x <= x/6 < x+1 -> which is only true for x=0.\n\n            So the first file does not yield any p except 0 (already marked) and then we finish the first file.\n\n            Then total_copied becomes 100.\n\n            Second file (500 bytes):\n\n            Now, the current file is 500 bytes. The overall total is 600.\n\n            We go from x=1 to 500.\n\n            p1 = (100*x)//500\n            p2 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n            We need to check for which x: (100*x)//500 = (100*(100+x))//600\n\n            Let k = (100*x)//500 = (x*100)//500 = x//5   (since 100*x//500 = (100*x)//500 = x//5 if we use integer division? Actually, (100*x)//500 = (x*100)//500 = (x*2)//10, but let me compute:\n\n            Example: x=1: p1 = 0, p2 = (100*101)//600 = 10100//600 = 16 (since 10100//600 = 16.833 -> floor is 16). 0 != 16.\n\n            How about x=5: p1 = (500)//500 = 1, p2 = (100*(100+5))//600 = (100*105)//600 = 10500//600 = 17.5 -> 17. So 1 != 17.\n\n            How about x=50: p1 = (100*50)//500 = 5000//500 = 10, p2 = (100*(100+50))//600 = 15000//600 = 25. So 10 != 25.\n\n            How about x=300: p1 = (100*300)//500 = 30000//500 = 60, p2 = (100*(100+300))//600 = 40000//600 = 66.666 -> 66.

So 70 != 75.\n\n            How about x=400: p1 = (100*400)//500 = 80, p2 = (100*500)//600 = 83.333 -> 83. 80 != 83.\n\n            How about x=450: p1 = (100*450)//500 = 90, p2 = (100*550)//600 = 55000//600 = 91.666 -> 91. 90 != 91.\n\n            How about x=500: p1 = (100*500)//500 = 100, p2 = (100*600)//600 = 100.

But note: the overall progress bar is computed with the entire total_so_far (including the current file's x) and the current file's progress bar is computed with the current file's x.\n\n            However, in the second file, the initial total_copied was 100 (from the first file). Then we add x (from 1 to 500). \n\n            Our code:\n\n                for i in range(n):\n                    file_size = a[i]\n                    for x in range(1, file_size+1):\n                        p1 = (100 * x) // file_size\n                        total_so_far = total_copied + x\n                        p2 = (100 * total_so_far) // total\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            Then why didn't we get 95? \n\n            Because when x=475, we did:\n\n                p1 = (100*475)//500 = 95\n                p2 = (100*(100+475))//600 = (100*575)//600 = 57500//600 = 95 (since 57500/600 = 95.833... -> floor 95)\n\n            So 95==95, so we mark 95.\n\n            Similarly, for x=480: p1=96, p2=96 -> mark 96.\n\n            Then why did I not see 95-99 in the simulation? \n\n            I must have miscalculated the simulation by hand for the second file. The code should work.\n\n            However, note: the example output is: '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'\n\n            But wait, the example input is: \"2\\n100 500\"\n\n            Let me run the code with the example and see what p's are marked.\n\n            We'll mark:\n\n            Initially: 0.\n\n            First file (100 bytes): \n                x from 1 to 100: \n                  We check if (100*x)//100 == (100*x)//600? \n                  Only x=0 (initial) and then no other x in [1,100] satisfies.\n\n            Then we mark nothing from the first file.\n\n            Second file (500 bytes): \n                x from 1 to 500:\n\n                We are going to check for every x from 1 to 500.\n\n                We mark p1 (which is (100*x)//500) if (100*x)//500 equals (100*(100+x))//600.\n\n                We'll get:\n\n                p=0: already marked.\n                p=100: at x=500.\n\n                What about 95? at x=475: p1=95, p2=95 -> mark 95.\n                p=96: at x=480,481 -> mark 96.\n                p=97: \n                    Condition for current file: (100*x)//500 = 97 -> 48500 <= 100*x < 49000 -> 485<=x<490.\n                    Overall: floor((10000+100*x)/600)=97 -> 97*600<=10000+100*x<98*600 -> 58200<=10000+100*x<58800 -> 48200<=100*x<48800 -> 482<=x<488.\n\n                    Intersection: x from 485 to 487 (because 485>=482 and 485<488, and 486,487 also satisfy)\n\n                    Check x=485: \n                        p1 = (100*485)//500 = 48500//500 = 97.\n                        p2 = (100*(100+485))//600 = (100*585)//600 = 58500//600 = 97.5 -> floor 97.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive such that there exists a moment during the copying process where both the current file's progress and the overall progress bars show the same value. The progress bars are updated after each byte is copied, and their values are floor divisions of the respective percentages.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the copying of files sequentially. For each byte copied in a file, we calculate the current file's progress (floor of (100 * bytes copied / file size)) and the overall progress (floor of (100 * total bytes copied / total file size)). We need to check if these two values are equal at any point during the copying process.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each file and each byte within the file, we can compute the current and overall progress values at every step. If these values match, we record the corresponding integer. This approach ensures we cover all possible moments during the copying process where the progress bars might show the same value.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total size of all files.\n   - For each file, iterating through each byte (from 1 to the file's size).\n   - At each byte, computing the current file's progress and the overall progress.\n   - If these values are equal, mark the corresponding integer as achievable.\n   - After processing all files, output all marked integers in ascending order.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each byte of each file once. Given that there are up to 100 files, each with a maximum size of 1000 bytes, the total operations are 100 * 1000 = 100,000, which is efficient for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_size = sum(a)\n    total_copied = 0\n    seen = [False] * 101\n    \n    seen[0] = True\n    \n    for size in a:\n        for x in range(1, size + 1):\n            current_progress = (100 * x) // size\n            total_so_far = total_copied + x\n            overall_progress = (100 * total_so_far) // total_size\n            \n            if current_progress == overall_progress and current_progress <= 100:\n                seen[current_progress] = True\n                \n        total_copied += size\n        \n    result = []\n    for p in range(0, 101):\n        if seen[p]:\n            result.append(str(p))\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their respective sizes. These are read from standard input.\n2. **Initialization**: The total size of all files is computed. A boolean list `seen` is initialized to keep track of which progress values (0 to 100) are achievable.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each file, the code iterates through each byte (from 1 to the file's size). For each byte, it calculates the current file's progress and the overall progress. If these values are equal, the corresponding index in the `seen` list is marked as `True`.\n4. **Output**: After processing all files, the code collects all indices marked `True` in the `seen` list (which correspond to achievable progress values) and prints them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible progress values by leveraging direct simulation of the copying process, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
