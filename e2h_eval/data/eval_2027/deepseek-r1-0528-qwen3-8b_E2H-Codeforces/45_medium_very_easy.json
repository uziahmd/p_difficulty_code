There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) from 2 to 10^18.\n\n In a knockout tournament, the total number of games is fixed (n-1). But the winner's path is the number of games he plays.\n\n The twist: the tournament grid must follow the rule that two players can play only if their number of previous games differs by at most one.\n\n Let's denote by f(n) the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n\n Consider that the tournament is structured in rounds. We can think of building a bracket such that the winner goes through as many rounds as possible, but with the constraint on the difference of games played.\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire tournament has n-1 games. We want to maximize the number of games for the winner.\n\n How can we model the tournament?\n\n We can consider that the tournament progresses in a way that we have two halves (or more generally, groups) that are balanced in terms of the number of games played so far.\n\n Actually, the problem is similar to building a complete binary tree with n leaves, but we are allowed to have a nearly complete tree? However, note the constraint: two players can only play if their previous games differ by at most one.\n\n This constraint is typical in double-elimination or other structured tournaments, but here it is a knockout and the rule is about the number of games already played.\n\n Another idea: the winner must win k games. Then, the tournament must have at least 2^k players? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, we can use a recursive structure:\n\n Let F(k) be the minimum number of players needed for a tournament where the winner plays k games (and wins all) under the given rule.\n\n How do we form a tournament for k games?\n\n The last game is the k-th game of the winner. To get there, the winner must have won k-1 games and then one more.\n\n But how many players are required?\n\n The rule says that when the winner is about to play his k-th game, his opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\n So the entire tournament must have two parts:\n   - The part that leads to the winner's k-th game: which includes the winner and the opponent for the k-th game.\n   - The rest of the tournament to produce the winner's k-1 games and the opponent's (k-1 or k-2) games.\n\n Actually, let's define:\n   F(0) = 1   [the winner without any game]\n   F(1) = 2   [one game between two players]\n\n For k games, the winner must have played k-1 games before the final. Now, the tournament can be broken into two subtrees:\n\n   Option 1: The opponent in the k-th game has played k-1 games (so the same as the winner).\n   Option 2: The opponent in the k-th game has played k-2 games.\n\n However, note that the rule applies at every game. But actually, the entire structure must satisfy that the two players in the k-th game have either the same number of previous games or differ by one.\n\n But we are constructing the minimal number of players to achieve k games for the winner.\n\n We can define F(k) recursively:\n\n   F(0) = 1\n   F(1) = 2\n\n   For k >= 2:\n      The winner must come from a subtree that had F(k-1) players (if we require the same level) OR from a subtree that had F(k-2) players (if we allow the opponent to have one less).\n\n   However, note: the winner's k-1 games were played in a tournament that requires F(k-1) players. And the opponent's k-1 (if same) or k-2 (if one less) must be provided by a tournament that requires F(k-1) or F(k-2) respectively.\n\n   But actually, the entire tournament must include:\n        winner's path: F(k-1) players (to give the winner k-1 wins)\n        opponent's path: for k-1 (same) -> F(k-1) OR for k-2 (opponent) -> F(k-2)\n\n   However, we cannot simply add because the tournament has to have distinct players (except the winner and the opponent, who are distinct). Also, the two subtrees must be disjoint.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of players for k games is:\n        F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-1)   [if we take two subtrees each of size F(k-1)] \n        But wait, if we have two subtrees of F(k-1) each, then the winner of the first subtree has played k-1 games and the winner of the second subtree (if the opponent is from the same) would also have k-1 games. Then the k-th game is between two players with k-1 games.\n\n        Alternatively, we could have one subtree of F(k-1) and one subtree of F(k-2). Then the opponent has played k-2 games (which is allowed). Then the total is F(k-1) + F(k-2).\n\n   But note: we are trying to minimize the number of players for k games. So we have two possibilities:\n\n        Possibility 1: Use two subtrees of F(k-1) -> total = F(k-1) + F(k-1) = 2 * F(k-1)\n        Possibility 2: Use one subtree of F(k-1) and one subtree of F(k-2) -> total = F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n   Which one gives the minimal? Actually, the minimal number of players required is the minimum over these two? However, we want to know the maximum k (number of games for the winner) that can be achieved with n players.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define F(k) as the minimal number of players needed to have a tournament where the winner plays k games.\n\n   Then:\n        F(0) = 1\n        F(1) = 2\n\n        F(k) = min(2 * F(k-1), F(k-1) + F(k-2))   ??? \n\n   But wait, we are not minimizing the structure arbitrarily. We need to satisfy the rule. Actually, both structures are valid, but we want to know the minimal players for k games.\n\n   Let's compute small values:\n\n        k=0: 1 player -> no game\n        k=1: 2 players -> 1 game\n\n        For k=2: \n            Possibility 1: two subtrees of F(1)=2 -> total 4 players. Then the winner of each subtree has 1 game, and they play the final -> winner plays 2 games.\n            Possibility 2: one subtree of F(1)=2 and one subtree of F(0)=1 -> total 3 players. Then the winner of the first subtree (2 players) has 1 game, and the winner of the second subtree (1 player) has 0 games. They play the final: this is allowed because the difference is 1. Then the winner of the final (if he wins) has 2 games.\n\n        So F(2) = 3.\n\n        For k=3:\n            Possibility 1: two subtrees of F(2)=3 -> total 6.\n            Possibility 2: one subtree of F(2)=3 and one subtree of F(1)=2 -> total 5.\n\n        So F(3) = 5.\n\n        For k=4:\n            Possibility 1: two subtrees of F(3)=5 -> total 10.\n            Possibility 2: one subtree of F(3)=5 and one subtree of F(2)=3 -> total 8.\n\n        So F(4)=8.\n\n        But wait, the example: Input 10 -> Output 4. Because with 10 players, the maximum games the winner can play is 4.\n\n        So if we let F(k) be the minimal number of players for k games, then we can find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n        The sequence is: \n            k:  0 -> 1\n                1 -> 2\n                2 -> 3\n                3 -> 5\n                4 -> 8\n                5 -> 13\n                6 -> 21\n                ...\n\n        This looks familiar: it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n        Actually, F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)   (with F(0)=1, F(1)=2) doesn't match the standard Fibonacci. \n\n        Standard Fibonacci: \n            Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, Fib(8)=21.\n\n        Our sequence: \n            k=0: 1\n            k=1: 2\n            k=2: 3\n            k=3: 5\n            k=4: 8\n            k=5: 13\n            k=6: 21\n\n        So our F(k) = Fib(k+2)   [because Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, ...]\n\n        Let me check: \n            k=0: Fib(2)=1 -> matches.\n            k=1: Fib(3)=2 -> matches.\n            k=2: Fib(4)=3 -> matches.\n            k=3: Fib(5)=5 -> matches.\n\n        Therefore, F(k) = Fib(k+2) [where Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, ...]\n\n        Then, the problem reduces to: find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n        Example: \n            Input n=2: Fib(k+2) <= 2 -> k+2 <= 3 (since Fib(3)=2) -> k=1 -> output 1.\n            Input n=3: Fib(k+2) <= 3 -> k+2 <= 4 (Fib(4)=3) -> k=2 -> output 2.\n            Input n=4: Fib(k+2) <= 4 -> Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5 -> so k+2=4 -> k=2 -> output 2.\n\n        But wait, the example input 10: \n            We need the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) <= 10.\n            Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13 -> so k+2=6 -> k=4 -> output 4.\n\n        However, note: the above recurrence defines F(k) as the minimal number of players for k games. Therefore, if we have n players, the maximum k (number of games) is the maximum integer such that F(k) <= n.\n\n        Since F(k) = Fib(k+2) (with Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1), we can say:\n\n            We want the largest k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        We are going to generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, and count the index.\n\n        But note: n can be up to 10^18, so we need an efficient way to generate Fibonacci numbers until we reach a value > n.\n\n        Let me define:\n            fib[0] = 0\n            fib[1] = 1\n            fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]\n\n        Then, we are looking for the largest k such that fib[k+2] <= n.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set:\n            We want k such that fib[k+2] <= n.\n\n        Then the answer is k.\n\n        Example: n=10 -> k+2 = 7 would be 13 (too big), k+2=6: fib[6]=8 <=10 -> k=4.\n\n        But wait, what if we have n=8? Then k+2=6 -> k=4.\n\n        What if we have n=9? Then k+2=6:8<=9, k+2=7:13>9 -> k=4.\n\n        What if we have n=13? Then k+2=7:13<=13 -> k=5.\n\n        So the plan:\n\n          Let a, b = 0, 1\n          We are going to iterate to compute the Fibonacci numbers until we get a number > n.\n\n          We are interested in index i (starting from 0) and then we use i+2.\n\n          Actually, we want the sequence starting from index 0: \n            index 0: 0\n            index 1: 1\n            index 2: 1\n            index 3: 2\n            index 4: 3\n            index 5: 5\n            index 6: 8\n            index 7: 13\n\n          Then, if we are at index i, then the corresponding F(k) is fib[i] = fib(i) [standard].\n\n          But we defined F(k) = fib(k+2). So when we have computed fib[i] and i>=2, then F(k) for k = i-2 is fib[i].\n\n          Alternatively, we can set:\n\n            Let i=0: fib0=0\n            i=1: fib1=1\n            i=2: fib2=1 -> corresponds to k=0 (i-2=0) -> F(0)=1\n            i=3: fib3=2 -> corresponds to k=1 (i-2=1) -> F(1)=2\n            i=4: fib4=3 -> corresponds to k=2 (i-2=2) -> F(2)=3\n\n          So we want the maximum i such that fib[i] <= n and i>=2? Actually, we can go beyond i=2.\n\n          Actually, we can define:\n\n            Let fib0 = 0, fib1 = 1, then fib2 = 1, fib3 = 2, etc.\n\n            Then F(k) = fib_{k+2} = fib_{k+2}\n\n          So we want the maximum k (nonnegative integer) such that fib_{k+2} <= n.\n\n          Then k = i - 2, where i is the index of the last Fibonacci number <= n (and i>=2).\n\n          But note: we might have multiple consecutive Fibonacci numbers. We just need the index i such that fib_i <= n and fib_{i+1} > n, then k = i-2.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Initialize:\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            index = 1   (current index, we start from fib1=1)\n\n          Then, while b <= n:\n            a, b = b, a+b\n            index += 1\n\n          Then, the last Fibonacci number <= n was the previous one (a). Then the index of that last one is index-1.\n\n          But note: we started with a=0, b=1 (index0 and index1). Then after first iteration: a=1, b=1 (index2). Then next: a=1, b=2 (index3). Then a=2, b=3 (index4)... \n\n          Actually, let me reframe:\n\n          We want to generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            count = 0\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            # We are going to iterate until b > n\n\n            while b <= n:\n                # Remember the current index and the Fibonacci number?\n                # But we don't care about the exact index, we care about the relation to k.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note that we are interested in the Fibonacci numbers at positions 2, 3, 4, ... (since k>=0).\n\n          Since we have F(k) = fib_{k+2}, and fib_{k+2} is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n\n          We can precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, and then the index i (starting from 0) of the last Fibonacci number <= n is i0, then k = i0 - 2.\n\n          However, note: the Fibonacci sequence we are generating:\n\n            fib0 = 0\n            fib1 = 1\n            fib2 = 1\n            fib3 = 2\n            fib4 = 3\n            fib5 = 5\n            fib6 = 8\n            fib7 = 13\n\n          We want the largest index i (>=2) such that fib_i <= n.\n\n          Then k = i - 2.\n\n          Example: n=10\n            i=0: 0 <=10 -> continue\n            i=1: 1<=10 -> continue\n            i=2: 1<=10 -> continue\n            i=3: 2<=10 -> continue\n            i=4: 3<=10 -> continue\n            i=5: 5<=10 -> continue\n            i=6: 8<=10 -> continue\n            i=7: 13>10 -> stop. Then the last index i for which fib_i<=10 is i=6. Then k = 6-2 = 4.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            index = 1   (because we have generated two numbers: index0 and index1)\n\n            Actually, we can keep a counter for the index.\n\n            Let i = 0, fib_i = 0\n            i = 1, fib_i = 1\n\n            Then we start from i=2 and go up.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            i = 0\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            while True:\n                if a > n: break   # but a is the previous, we want to check the current b?\n                # Instead, we can do:\n\n            Better:\n\n            i = 0\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            # We want to record the index i for which fib_i <= n, and then the next one exceeds.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            count = 0   # will count the number of Fibonacci numbers generated (starting from 0)\n            while b <= n:\n                a, b = b, a+b\n                count += 1\n\n            Then, at the end, the last Fibonacci number we generated was b (which is > n) and the previous one (a) was the last <= n.\n\n            But note: our sequence:\n\n            Initially: a=0, b=1 -> count=0 (we haven't entered the loop body yet) -> then we enter the loop.\n\n            Step 1: condition: 1<=n -> true. Then update: a=1, b=0+1=1, count=1.\n            Step 2: condition: 1<=n -> true. Then update: a=1, b=1+1=2, count=2.\n            Step 3: condition: 2<=n -> true (if n>=2). Then update: a=2, b=1+2=3, count=3.\n\n            Then we stop when b>n.\n\n            Then the last Fibonacci number that was <= n is a (from the previous step) and the index of that a is count (because we did 'count' iterations, and the first two were indices 0 and 1, then the next index is count).\n\n            Actually, the index of a is count (if we consider that we start at index0 for the initial a=0, then after one iteration, a becomes the fib1=1, and the index of that is 1?).\n\n            Let me map:\n\n            count: 0 -> a=0 (fib0)\n            count: 1 -> a=1 (fib1)\n            count: 2 -> a=1 (fib2)\n            count: 3 -> a=2 (fib3)\n\n            So the index of a is count (the number of iterations) but note: we started with a=0 (fib0) and then we update.\n\n            Actually, the variable 'a' at the beginning of the loop is the previous Fibonacci number (which is fib_{count}), and then we update to the next.\n\n            After the update, we have a new a (which is the old b) and then set b to the next.\n\n            But wait, we are counting the number of iterations. We want the index of the last Fibonacci number <= n.\n\n            In the loop, we are updating and then increasing count. So after the update, the new a is the Fibonacci number at index = count (if we consider that the initial state (before the loop) is index0 and index1). \n\n            Actually, the Fibonacci numbers we generate in the loop:\n\n            Iteration 0 (first time in the loop):\n                Check b (which is 1) <= n -> yes.\n                Then set a = 1, b = 1 (so now a is fib1, and we are about to check the next condition with the new b=1, but then we increase count to 1).\n\n            Then the next iteration:\n                Check b=1 <= n -> yes.\n                Then set a=1, b=2, count=2.\n\n            Then next:\n                Check b=2 <= n -> yes.\n                Then set a=2, b=3, count=3.\n\n            Then next:\n                Check b=3 <= n -> yes.\n                Then set a=3, b=5, count=4.\n\n            Then next: if n=5, then condition holds and then set a=5, b=8, count=5.\n\n            Then next: if n=5, then 8>5 -> break.\n\n            Then the last a=5 is the last Fibonacci number <=5, and its index is count? \n\n            Actually, the index of 5 is 5? But standard Fibonacci: \n                fib0:0, fib1:1, fib2:1, fib3:2, fib4:3, fib5:5 -> so index5.\n\n            So the index of the last a (which is 5) is count=5.\n\n            Then k = index - 2 = 5-2 = 3.\n\n            But wait, with 5 players: \n                F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=5, so the minimal number of players for 3 games is 5. \n                Therefore, with 5 players, the winner can play 3 games.\n\n            But the example input n=5 should output 3.\n\n            However, the example input n=10 outputs 4.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                a, b = 0, 1\n                count = 0   # we haven't done any iteration\n                while b <= n:\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n                    count += 1\n\n                Then the last Fibonacci number we have (that is <= n) is stored in a, and the index of that is count (if we consider the standard Fibonacci indexing: fib_0, fib_1, ...).\n\n                Then k = count - 2.\n\n            But wait, what if n=1? Then we break immediately (b=1 is not <=1? Actually, n=1, then condition: 1<=1 -> true. Then update: a=1, b=1, count=1. Then next: condition: 1<=1 -> true. Then a=1, b=2, count=2. Then condition 2<=1 fails. Then k=2-2=0.\n\n            For n=1: There is 1 player. Then the winner hasn't played any game? But the problem states n>=2.\n\n            According to the problem: n>=2.\n\n            Let's test with n=2:\n\n                a=0, b=1 -> 1<=2 -> true: then a=1, b=1, count=1.\n                then condition: 1<=2 -> true: then a=1, b=2, count=2.\n                then condition: 2<=2 -> true: then a=2, b=3, count=3.\n                then condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n                Then k=3-2=1 -> correct.\n\n            But wait, why do we get 3 iterations? \n\n            Actually, the Fibonacci sequence for n=2:\n\n                fib0:0, fib1:1, fib2:1, fib3:2, fib4:3.\n\n            We break when we try to set b=3 (which is >2). Then the last a is 2 (which is fib3). Then k = 3 (the index of fib3) minus 2 -> 1.\n\n            However, the index of the last a (2) is 3? Yes.\n\n            But note: we are counting the number of iterations (which is the index of the Fibonacci number we just generated for a). Actually, the variable 'a' is updated to the next Fibonacci number at the beginning of the next iteration.\n\n            Alternatively, we can avoid counting the iterations and use the index.\n\n            Since n can be very large (up to 10^18), we cannot use recursion. We'll use iterative Fibonacci generation.\n\n            We want the index i (starting from 0) of the last Fibonacci number <= n, then k = i - 2.\n\n            But note: the Fibonacci number at index i is fib_i.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                a, b = 0, 1\n                i = 0\n                while b <= n:\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n                    i += 1\n\n                Then i is the index of the last generated a (which is the Fibonacci number at index i-1) because:\n\n                Initially: a=0 (fib0), b=1 (fib1) -> i=0, then we enter the loop and set a=fib1, b=fib2, and i=1.\n\n            Let me run for n=2:\n\n                i=0, a=0, b=1 -> condition: 1<=2 -> enter.\n                    a,b = 1, 1 -> i=1\n                Then condition: 1<=2 -> enter.\n                    a,b = 1, 2 -> i=2\n                Then condition: 2<=2 -> enter.\n                    a,b = 2, 3 -> i=3\n                Then condition: 3<=2 -> false.\n\n                Then k = i - 2 = 3-2=1.\n\n            But wait, the index of the last a (which is 2) is i-1? Because we updated a to the next Fibonacci number and then increased i.\n\n            Actually, the variable a is the Fibonacci number at index = i (if we consider that initially a was fib0 and then we update). \n\n            At the start of the loop body, we have a = fib_{i} and b = fib_{i+1}? \n\n            Let me see:\n\n                Start: a=fib0, b=fib1, i=0.\n\n                Then we update: a = fib1, b = fib2, i=1.\n\n                Then we update: a = fib2, b = fib3, i=2.\n\n                Then we update: a = fib3, b = fib4, i=3.\n\n            Then at the moment we break, we have a = fib3 (which is 2) and i=3. Then we want the index of 2 is 3, and then k=3-2=1.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                a, b = 0, 1\n                i = 0\n                while b <= n:\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n                    i += 1\n\n                Then answer = i - 2\n\n            But wait, for n=3:\n\n                Start: a=0, b=1, i=0 -> condition: 1<=3 -> true.\n                    a=1, b=1, i=1 -> condition: 1<=3 -> true.\n                    a=1, b=2, i=2 -> condition: 2<=3 -> true.\n                    a=2, b=3, i=3 -> condition: 3<=3 -> true.\n                    a=3, b=5, i=4 -> condition: 5<=3 -> false.\n\n                Then answer = 4-2 = 2.\n\n            And for n=4:\n\n                Start: a=0, b=1 -> true -> a=1, b=1, i=1.\n                Then: a=1, b=1 -> true -> a=1, b=2, i=2.\n                Then: a=1, b=2 -> true -> a=2, b=3, i=3.\n                Then: a=2, b=3 -> true (3<=4) -> a=3, b=5, i=4 -> then 5<=4 -> false.\n\n                Then answer = 4-2 = 2.\n\n            Example n=10:\n\n                Start: a=0, b=1 -> true -> a=1, b=1, i=1.\n                Then: a=1, b=1 -> true -> a=1, b=2, i=2.\n                Then: a=1, b=2 -> true -> a=2, b=3, i=3.\n                Then: a=2, b=3 -> true -> a=3, b=5, i=4.\n                Then: a=3, b=5 -> true -> a=5, b=8, i=5.\n                Then: a=5, b=8 -> true -> a=8, b=13, i=6.\n                Then: 13<=10 -> false.\n\n                Then answer = 6-2 = 4.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            However, note: the Fibonacci sequence we are generating is the standard one (starting 0,1,1,2,3,5,...). And the minimal players for k games is the Fibonacci number at index k+2.\n\n            Then, the condition is: we want the largest k such that Fib(k+2) <= n.\n\n            And we are computing the index i (from the Fibonacci sequence) of the last Fib number <= n. But note: the last Fib number we generated (a) is Fib_i, and we break when the next Fib number (b) is > n. Then the last Fib number <=n is a, which is Fib_i.\n\n            Then we have: Fib_i <= n, and Fib_{i+1} > n.\n\n            Then we set k+2 = i? \n\n            Actually, the Fib number at index i is Fib_i, and we know that the minimal players for k games is Fib_{k+2}. \n\n            Then, if Fib_i <= n, then k+2 <= i? \n\n            But note: the minimal players for k games is Fib_{k+2}. We want the maximum k such that Fib_{k+2} <= n.\n\n            Then k+2 is the index of the Fib number that is <= n. But note: we have Fib_{k+2} = Fib_i, then k+2 = i? \n\n            However, our sequence: \n                Fib0:0, Fib1:1, Fib2:1, Fib3:2, Fib4:3, Fib5:5, Fib6:8, Fib7:13.\n\n            And we break when we are about to generate Fib_{i} (which is the one we just updated to) and then the next is Fib_{i+1} which is > n.\n\n            Actually, in the loop:\n\n                We break when the next Fibonacci number (which would be Fib_{i}) is greater than n? \n\n            Let me reassign:\n\n            We start with:\n                a = Fib0, b = Fib1, i=0.\n\n            Then, in the loop we update:\n                a = Fib1, b = Fib2, i=1.\n\n            Then we break when b (which is Fib2) is > n? \n\n            But wait, in the condition we check 'b <= n'. \n\n            We want to include all Fibonacci numbers that are <= n.\n\n            After the update, we have a = Fib_i, and b = Fib_{i+1}. Then we check if b (Fib_{i+1}) <= n.\n\n            Then, if we break, then Fib_{i+1} > n, and Fib_i <= n.\n\n            Then the largest index j such that Fib_j <= n is j = i.\n\n            Then we have: Fib_i <= n and Fib_{i+1} > n.\n\n            Then the maximum k is such that Fib_{k+2} <= n. Then k+2 <= i? \n\n            Actually, we want the largest k with Fib_{k+2} <= n. \n\n            Since Fib_i <= n and Fib_{i+1} > n, then k+2 must be the index i (because Fib_{i} is the last one <= n). Then k = i - 2.\n\n            But wait: \n\n            Example n=10: \n                Fib6 = 8 <=10, Fib7=13>10 -> so the last index j with Fib_j<=10 is j=6.\n\n            In our algorithm, we break when we are about to set b to Fib7 (which is 13) and then we have i=6 (because we did 6 updates?).\n\n            Actually, let me run the loop for n=10 again with tracking i and the values:\n\n                i=0: a=0, b=1 -> 1<=10 -> update: a=1, b=1, i=1.\n                i=1: a=1, b=1 -> 1<=10 -> update: a=1, b=2, i=2.\n                i=2: a=1, b=2 -> 2<=10 -> update: a=2, b=3, i=3.\n                i=3: a=2, b=3 -> 3<=10 -> update: a=3, b=5, i=4.\n                i=4: a=3, b=5 -> 5<=10 -> update: a=5, b=8, i=5.\n                i=5: a=5, b=8 -> 8<=10 -> update: a=8, b=13, i=6.\n                i=6: a=8, b=13 -> 13<=10 -> false, break.\n\n            Then we break at i=6, and then we return i-2=4.\n\n            But note: the last Fib number <=10 is 8, which is Fib6. Then k+2=6 -> k=4.\n\n            So the algorithm returns the index i (which is the index of the last Fib number <=n) and then k = i-2.\n\n            However, we broke at i=6, and the last Fib number <=n is a (which is 8) and that is Fib6.\n\n            So the index of the last Fib number <=n is i (which is 6). Then k+2 = 6 -> k=4.\n\n            Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n                a, b = 0, 1\n                i = 0\n                while b <= n:\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n                    i += 1\n\n                print(i-2)\n\n            But wait, what if n is very small, like n=1? (but n>=2 per the problem, so we don't have to worry about n=0 or 1).\n\n            However, let me test with n=2:\n\n                a=0, b=1 -> 1<=2 -> update: a=1, b=1, i=1.\n                Then: 1<=2 -> update: a=1, b=2, i=2.\n                Then: 2<=2 -> update: a=2, b=3, i=3.\n                Then: 3<=2 -> false.\n                Then print(3-2)=1.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            But wait, what if n=1? (even though n>=2) but just for curiosity: \n                a=0, b=1 -> 1<=1 -> update: a=1, b=1, i=1.\n                Then: 1<=1 -> update: a=1, b=2, i=2.\n                Then: 2<=1 -> false -> output 2-2=0.\n\n            The problem states n>=2, so we are safe.\n\n            However, note: the Fibonacci sequence we are using includes 0. But the minimal players for k games is defined for k>=0, and for k=0, we need 1 player.\n\n            But the problem says there are n players (at least 2). So k=0 is not allowed because the winner must play at least one game (if n>=2, then at least one game is played by the winner).\n\n            But our formula: k=0 means 0 games. With n>=2, the winner must play at least one game, so k>=1.\n\n            Our algorithm for n=2 returns k=1, which is correct.\n\n            Therefore, code:\n\n            Read n (as integer)\n\n            if n==0: ... but n>=2.\n\n            Then:\n\n            a, b = 0, 1\n            count = 0   # we are going to count the index i (which is the index of the last Fib number <= n)\n\n            But wait, in",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that the tournament follows a specific rule. The rule states that two players can only play against each other if the number of games each has already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) games follows the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players needed for \\( k \\) games is the \\( (k+2) \\)-th Fibonacci number. For example:\n   - 0 games require 1 player.\n   - 1 game requires 2 players.\n   - 2 games require 3 players.\n   - 3 games require 5 players, and so on.\n\n2. **Insight**: The problem reduces to finding the largest \\( k \\) such that the \\( (k+2) \\)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the given number of players \\( n \\). This is because the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, allowing us to efficiently compute the solution even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until we find the first number that exceeds \\( n \\). The index of the last Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to \\( n \\) gives us \\( k+2 \\), from which we derive \\( k \\) by subtracting 2.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\( O(\\log n) \\) time because the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially. Each iteration computes the next Fibonacci number, and the loop terminates once the Fibonacci number exceeds \\( n \\). The space complexity is \\( O(1) \\) as we only store a few variables during the computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    count = 0\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        count += 1\n    print(count - 2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `a = 0` (Fibonacci number at index 0) and `b = 1` (Fibonacci number at index 1).\n2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as the current Fibonacci number (`b`) is less than or equal to \\( n \\). In each iteration, we update `a` and `b` to the next Fibonacci numbers and increment the count.\n3. **Termination**: The loop exits when the next Fibonacci number would exceed \\( n \\). At this point, the count holds the index of the last valid Fibonacci number, which is \\( k + 2 \\).\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is obtained by subtracting 2 from the count, giving the maximum number of games the winner can play under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to solve the problem in logarithmic time, making it suitable for very large values of \\( n \\).",
