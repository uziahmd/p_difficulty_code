При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` (the received message) and we need to determine if it could be the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message `s` with an overlapping error.\n\n Conditions for the error:\n  - The two messages are identical (so the original was `s` and `s`).\n  - There is a positive overlap (at least one character) but the entire overlap must be identical and the overlapped part must be at the end of the first message and the beginning of the second.\n\n However, note:\n  - If the entire string is just two copies of `s` without any overlap (i.e., t = s+s) then that is not considered an error. So we must avoid that.\n  - Also, if the string doesn't have an overlap as described, then output \"NO\".\n\n Steps:\n\n Let n = len(t)\n\n We are looking for a non-empty string s such that:\n   t = A + B, where A is the first part and B is the second part, and there exists an integer k (1 <= k < len(s)) such that:\n        A ends with the last k characters of s and B starts with the first k characters of s.\n\n Actually, note: the two messages are the same, so the entire t should be broken into two parts that are both `s`, but with an overlap of some length.\n\n Another way to think:\n   Let s be the base string. Then the transmitted string would be s + s, but with an overlap of some positive length (at least 1 and less than len(s)).\n   So the resulting string t must be of the form: \n        t = s[0: len(s)-k] + s[k:] + s[k:]   ??? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \n        \"the two messages are identical\" -> so the two messages are s and s.\n        \"they get merged by overlapping\", meaning the last part of the first s matches the beginning of the second s.\n\n So, if the first s is from index0 to index (n1-1) and the second s is from index n1 to index (n1+n2-1), then the overlapping part is the suffix of the first s and the prefix of the second s.\n\n Actually, the entire t is built as:\n        t = s[0: len(s)] + s[overlap_length:]\n\n But note: the problem states that the two messages are identical. So the entire t must be the concatenation of two s's, but with the last `overlap_length` characters of the first s being the same as the first `overlap_length` characters of the second s.\n\n Therefore, we can also say: t must be such that if we break it into two parts (each being a copy of s) then the two copies must have an overlap.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: \n   Let s be the base string. Then the total length of t is: |s| + |s| - overlap = 2*|s| - overlap.\n\n But we don't know s. We are given t.\n\n We can try to find an s and an overlap k (with 1<=k<|s|) such that:\n   t = s + s[k:]\n\n And note: the entire t must be exactly s + s[k:].\n\n Also note: the problem says that if the entire string is two copies of s (without any real overlap, i.e., k=0) then that is not an error. So we require k>=1 and k < |s|.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: 'abcabc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\n Why? Because if we break 'abcabc' into two 'abc', then there is no overlap (k=0) which is not allowed. But wait, we can also break it differently?\n\n Actually, the problem says: the two messages are identical. So the entire t must be formed by two copies of the same s. But note that the example 'abcabc' is exactly two copies of 'abc'. \n\n However, the problem states: \n        \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друг на друга двух сообщений.\" \n        -> That means if the entire second message is overlapped by the first (so that the two messages become one copy of s? Actually, no: the entire second message being overlapped would mean that the first s is s and the second s is entirely contained in the overlap. But note: the condition says the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message.\n\n But wait, the example: \n        \"abcd\": NO -> because if we break into two parts, the two parts must be two identical strings. However, if we break 'abcd' as 'a' and 'bcd', then they are not identical. Similarly, if we break as 'ab' and 'cd', then they are different. So how do we relate?\n\n Actually, the problem says: the two messages are identical. Therefore, the entire t must be built from two copies of the same string s. But note: the overlapping condition requires that the end of the first s and the beginning of the second s match.\n\n However, note that the two copies must be the same s. So the entire t must be such that it is the concatenation of two s's, but with the last k characters of the first s matching the first k of the second s.\n\n How to check?\n\n We can iterate over possible lengths of s. Since t is at most 100 characters, we can try:\n\n   Let n = len(t)\n   Then, the length of s must be at least ceil(n/2) + 1? Actually, the length of t is 2 * len(s) - k, so len(s) = (n + k) / 2. Since k>=1 and k < len(s), then:\n\n        n = 2 * len(s) - k  =>  len(s) = (n + k) / 2, and k is at least 1 and at most len(s)-1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: \n        The entire string t must be partitioned into two parts of length L (the first part) and the rest (the second part). But note: the second part must start with the overlapping part, and the first part must end with the same overlapping part.\n\n   But note: the two parts are both s. So the entire t must be two copies of s, but with the second copy having an overlap of k (so the first copy is s, the second copy is s[k:]).\n\n   Therefore, we can also say: t must be equal to s + s[k:], and s must be of length m, then t has length m + (m - k) = 2*m - k.\n\n   Conditions: \n        k must be between 1 and m-1.\n\n   Also, note: the entire t must be built from two copies of s. So the first m characters of t should be s, and the next m-k characters of t should be s[k:].\n\n   But wait, what if we don't know m? We can iterate over possible m (the length of s) such that 2*m - k = n, and k in [1, m-1]. Then m must satisfy: \n        m = (n + k) / 2, so n+k must be even, and m must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most floor(n/2)+something? Actually, the minimal m is when k is maximum (k=m-1) then n = 2*m - (m-1) = m+1 -> m = n-1. The maximal m is when k is minimal (k=1) then n = 2*m - 1 -> m = (n+1)//2.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible split points.\n\n Another approach:\n\n   Since the entire t must be two copies of s with an overlap, then t must be periodic with a period of m (the length of s) but with a shift. However, note the overlap.\n\n   Actually, the condition is that t can be written as:\n        t = s + s[k:]   (for some k, 1<=k<m)\n\n   Then, the string t must have the property that the first m characters (s) and the last m characters (which would be s) must have an overlap of k. But note: the second s is only the part from k to the end.\n\n   We can try to find an integer m (length of s) such that:\n        m >= ceil((n+1)/2) and m <= n-1   (because k>=1 and k<m, then m must be at least 2 and the length of t is 2*m - k, so m must be at least (n+1)//2 and at most n-1)\n\n   Then, we require:\n        t[0:m] == s (obviously, because the first s is s)\n        and the second part of t (from index m to the end) must be s[k:] (which is the same as s without the first k characters).\n\n   But note: the entire t is of length 2*m - k. So the second part is from index m to index (2*m - k - 1). The length of the second part is m - k.\n\n   However, we don't know k. But note: the second part must be the last m-k characters of s. And the second part is the substring t[m: 2*m - k] (but wait, the total length is 2*m - k, so the second part goes from index m to index 2*m-k-1, which is m-k characters).\n\n   Now, note: the second part is s[k:]. And s is the first m characters. So we can write:\n\n        t[0:m] = s\n        t[m: m + (m-k)] = s[k:]\n\n   But the entire string t is s + s[k:], so the length is m + (m-k) = 2*m - k.\n\n   Therefore, we have:\n\n        Let m be the length of s, then the total length n = 2*m - k.\n\n        Then, k = 2*m - n.\n\n        Conditions: \n            k must be in [1, m-1]  =>  1 <= 2*m - n <= m-1.\n\n        Then, we can express m in terms of n and k, but we can iterate on m.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        For a candidate m (which must satisfy: m >= (n+1)//2 and m <= n-1, and also 2*m - n must be an integer between 1 and m-1):\n\n            Let k = 2*m - n\n\n            Then, we require:\n                Condition 1: k must be an integer (which it is by definition) and 1 <= k <= m-1.\n\n            Then, we break t into two parts:\n                Part1 = t[0:m]   -> this is s\n                Part2 = t[m: m + (m-k)]   -> but note: the total length is n, so m + (m-k) = 2*m - k = n, so the second part is t[m:]\n\n            But wait, the second part should be s[k:] which is the last m-k characters of s. However, note: the second part is of length m-k, and we have s = t[0:m], so s[k:] is t[k:m].\n\n            Therefore, we must have: \n                t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n            However, note: the second part is the last m-k characters of s, and s is t[0:m]. So the second part should be t[k:m] (because s[k:] is from index k to m-1, which is m-k characters). But our t[m:] is the substring from index m to the end, and its length is n-m = (2*m - k) - m = m-k, which matches.\n\n            So condition: t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n        But wait, we must be cautious: the second part of t is the continuation of s, so it is s[k:]. And s is the first m characters, so s[k:] is t[k:m] (if k is within [0, m)). \n\n        Therefore, the condition is: t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n        However, note: k = 2*m - n, so we can compute k from m.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n        Let n = len(t)\n        For m in range(ceil((n+1)/2), n):   # m from (n+1)//2 to n-1 (inclusive)\n            k = 2*m - n\n            if k < 1 or k >= m:   # because k must be in [1, m-1]\n                continue\n\n            # Then, we break t into:\n            #   s = t[0:m]\n            #   expected_second_part = t[k:m]   (which is the part of s from k to the end)\n            #   actual_second_part = t[m:]      (the rest of the string)\n\n            if t[m:] == t[k:m]:\n                Then, we found a candidate: s = t[0:m]\n\n                Print \"YES\"\n                Print s and break out of the loop.\n\n        If no m satisfies, then print \"NO\"\n\n   But wait: what if there are multiple possibilities? We can output any.\n\n   Example: \n        t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n        What is m? \n            We know the original s is \"abrakadabra\", so m = 11.\n\n            Then, k = 2*11 - 23 = 22 - 23 = -1 -> wait, that doesn't work.\n\n        Let me recalculate: \n            The example says: \n                Input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'\n                Output: 'YES\\nabrakadabra'\n\n            How long is t? 23 characters.\n\n            Then, if s = \"abrakadabra\", then the second part should be s[k:] with k being the overlap. \n\n            How much overlap? In the example, the two messages are \"abrakadabra\" and \"abrakadabra\". The overlap is the last few characters of the first and the first few of the second.\n\n            The example says: \n                \"abrakadabra\" and then \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap of 1: becomes \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (so k=1)\n                or an overlap of 4: becomes \"abrakadabrakadabra\"\n\n            But the given string is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 23 characters. \n\n            If we break it: \n                First part: \"abrakadabra\" (11 chars)\n                Second part: \"brakadabra\" (12 chars) -> but wait, the second part should be s[k:] and k=1, so s[1:] is \"brakadabra\" -> but then the entire string would be \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabracadabra\"? \n\n            Actually, wait: \n                Original s = \"abrakadabra\"\n                With k=1: \n                    First part: s = \"abrakadabra\"\n                    Second part: s[1:] = \"brakadabra\"\n                    Then the entire string is \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabracadabra\" -> but that is 22 characters, not 23.\n\n            Let me count: \n                s = \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters)\n                s[1:] = \"brakadabra\" (10 letters)\n                So total: 11+10=21, but the example string is 23.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the example is using an overlap of 0? But that is not allowed.\n\n            Let me check the example again: \n                Example says: \n                    \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> YES, abrakadabra\n\n            How did they get that? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"abrakadabra\" and then \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap of 1 gives \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\".\n\n            Let me break the example string:\n                \"abrakadabra\" (first 11) -> then the next 12? \n                Then the next part is 12 characters: \"brabrambrakadabra\"? \n\n            Wait, let me write the example string: \n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            Break it as:\n                First 11: \"abrakadabra\"\n                Then the next 12: \"brabrambrakadabra\" -> that doesn't look like s[1:].\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the example string is built by:\n                s = \"abrakadabra\"\n                Then the second message is s, and the overlap is 1, so the entire string is s + s[1:] -> \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabracadabra\" (21 characters)\n\n            But the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 23 characters.\n\n            Let me count the example input: \n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> \n                a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a -> 23 letters.\n\n            Now, if we break it as:\n                First part: 11 letters -> \"abrakadabra\"\n                Second part: 12 letters -> \"brabrambrakadabra\" -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the example is built by two copies of s with an overlap of 1, but the second copy is the full s? Then the entire string would be s + s[1:] (which is 11+10=21). \n\n            Or maybe the example input string is actually \"abrakadabra\" + \"abrakadabra\" with an overlap of 1, but then the result is \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> 21.\n\n            I see: the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n                ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', ...]\n\n            Let me check the example output: \n                ['YES\\nabrakadabra', ...]\n\n            So the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", and we are to output \"YES\" and then \"abrakadabra\".\n\n            How can that be? \n\n            Let me assume that the base string s is \"abrakadabra\", and the entire string is built by two copies of s with an overlap of 11? But wait, the condition says the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message (which is 11). So maximum overlap is 10.\n\n            Alternatively, the example might be built by two copies of s with an overlap of 10? Then:\n                s = \"abrakadabra\", overlap k=10, then the second part is s[10:] = \"a\" (since the 10th index is the last but one? Actually, in Python, indexing: s[10:] is the 11th character (0-indexed, so from index10 to the end) -> the 10th index is 'a', and then the rest is 'bra'? \n\n            Wait, let's index \"abrakadabra\":\n                indices: 0:a,1:b,2:r,3:a,4:k,5:a,6:d,7:a,8:b,9:r,10:a\n\n            So s[10:] is \"a\", and the entire string would be \"abrakadabra\" + \"a\" -> \"abrakadabraa\" (12 characters) -> not 23.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the example input string is \"abrakadabra\" repeated twice with an overlap of 1, but then the total length is 11 + 10 = 21, but the example input is 23.\n\n            I think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the example:\n\n            The example says: \n                \"abrakadabra\" and then \"abrakadabra\" can be merged to give:\n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap of 1) or \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap of 4).\n\n            But wait, the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 23 letters. \n\n            Let me break the example input with an overlap of 1:\n                s1 = \"abrakadabra\"\n                s2 = \"abrakadabra\"\n                With overlap 1: we remove the first 1 character of s2 and append it to s1? No, the rule is: the two messages are sent and then the last k characters of the first are merged with the first k of the second.\n\n            Actually, the resulting string is: s1 + s2[k:] (because the first k characters of s2 are merged with the last k of s1, so we keep the last k of s1 and then add the rest of s2).\n\n            But note: the example says the result can be \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (overlap of 1) and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (overlap of 4).\n\n            For overlap of 1: \n                s1 = \"abrakadabra\"\n                s2 = \"abrakadabra\"\n                Then the merged string is: s1 + s2[1:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabracadabra\" -> 21 characters.\n\n            For overlap of 4:\n                s1 = \"abrakadabra\"\n                s2 = \"abrakadabra\"\n                Then the merged string is: s1 + s2[4:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"dabra\" = \"abrakadabrada\" -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\n            Let me compute s2[4:] for s2=\"abrakadabra\":\n                s2[4:] = 'dabra' -> then total string is \"abrakadabra\" + \"dabra\" -> \"abrakadabra\" has 11 letters, plus 5 -> 16.\n\n            The example says the result for overlap 4 is \"abrakadabrakadabra\", which is 20 characters.\n\n            Let me check: \n                \"abrakadabrakadabra\" -> \n                It breaks as: \n                    First part: \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters)\n                    Then the next part: \"brakadabra\" (11 letters) -> wait, but then the overlap was 4, so we should have kept the first 4 of the second part and merged? \n\n            Actually, the rule: the two messages are sent and then the last k characters of the first message are merged with the first k characters of the second. This means the resulting string is:\n\n                [first message without the last k characters] + [second message] \n\n            OR\n\n                [first message] + [second message without the first k characters] ?\n\n            The problem says: \n                \"the two messages are identical\" and \"the end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second\".\n\n            The example: \n                Two messages \"abrakadabra\" and \"abrakadabra\", with k=1: \n                    The first message's last 1 character is 'a', and the second message's first 1 character is 'a'. So we merge: the last 'a' of the first message and the first 'a' of the second message become one 'a'? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            How is that built?\n                Original: \"abrakadabra\" and \"abrakadabra\"\n                With k=1: \n                    We take the first message: \"abrakadabra\", and then we take the second message without its first character? But then the second message without the first character is \"brakadabra\", so the entire string becomes \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabracadabra\", which is 21.\n\n            But wait, the example output is 23. \n\n            Let me check the example input string: \n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n            This string is 23 characters. \n\n            Maybe the example intended to show two different examples? The problem says:\n\n                \"По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s.\"\n\n            So the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", and we must find s.\n\n            How about if s = \"abrakadabra\" and the entire string is two copies of s with an overlap of 11? But the condition says the overlap must be positive and less than the length (which is 11) -> so k must be from 1 to 10.\n\n            Alternatively, the example input might be built by three copies? \n\n            Let me think: the problem says two consecutive transmissions. So two copies.\n\n            Another possibility: the example input is actually built by two copies of s, but s is not \"abrakadabra\". \n\n            Let me try to find an s such that:\n\n                t = s + s[k:]   and k>=1, k < len(s)\n\n            and the total length is 23.\n\n            Then: len(t) = 2*m - k = 23.\n\n            So 2*m - k = 23, and 1<=k<=m-1.\n\n            Then m = (23 + k) / 2, so k must be odd (because 23+k must be even). And k>=1, k<=m-1.\n\n            Since m = (23+k)/2, then k <= m-1 => k <= (23+k)/2 - 1 => 2*k <= 23 + k - 2 => k <= 21.\n\n            So k can be from 1 to 21, and odd. Then m = (23+k)/2 must be an integer.\n\n            Let k=1: m=(24)/2=12 -> then s = t[0:12] and the second part is t[12:], and we require t[12:] == s[1:] (because k=1)\n\n            s = t[0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" -> wait, but t[0:12] is \"abrakadabra\" (11 characters?) because the string is 23 characters. \n\n            Actually, the string is 23 characters, so t[0:12] is the first 12 characters: \"abrakadabra\" is 11, so we take 12: \n\n                t[0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" + the next character? \n\n            The first 11: \"abrakadabra\", then the 12th character is 'b' (because the next character after \"abrakadabra\" is 'r' in the next word? Actually, the example input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", so:\n\n                indices: \n                  0:a,1:b,2:r,3:a,4:k,5:a,6:d,7:a,8:b,9:r,10:a,11:b,12:r,13:a,14:k,15:a,16:d,17:a,18:b,19:r,20:a\n\n            So t[0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" + 'b' (at index11) -> \"abrakadabra\" is 11 characters, so index11 is the 12th character: that is 'b'.\n\n            Then s = \"abrakadabra\" is not correct because we took 12 characters.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the base string s is \"abrakadabra\" (11) and the entire string is built by two copies of s with an overlap of 1, but then the total length is 11 + (11-1)=21, which is not 23.\n\n            I think there is a mistake in the example. \n\n            Let me look at the example outputs provided in the problem:\n\n            Input examples: \n                ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n            Expected Output: \n                ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n            The second example: \n                Input: 'acacacaca' -> Output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n            Let me check: \n                s = \"acaca\", length=5, then total length = 2*5 - k = 10 - k = 10 (if k=0) or 9 (if k=1) ... but the input is 9 characters.\n\n            Wait, the input 'acacacaca' is 9 characters.\n\n            Then for s=\"acaca\", m=5, then k=2*5 - 9 = 1 -> which is in [1,4]. Then the second part is t[5:] = \"caca\", and s[1:] = \"caca\". So t[5:]==\"caca\" and s[1:]=\"caca\", so they match.\n\n            So the example works.\n\n            Now, for the first example: \n                t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (23 characters)\n\n            We need to find an m such that 2*m - k = 23, and k=2*m-23 is between 1 and m-1.\n\n            Then m must be at least ceil((23+1)/2)=12, and at most 22 (because k>=1 => 2*m-23>=1 => 2*m>=24 => m>=12, and k<=m-1 => 2*m-23<=m-1 => m<=22).\n\n            Then we iterate m from 12 to 22.\n\n            Let m=12: k=2*12-23=24-23=1 -> valid (1<=1<=11). Then we require:\n                s = t[0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" (but wait, we have 12 characters: \n                    t[0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" (the first 11) + the next one: the 12th character is 'b' (as above) -> \"abrakadabra\" is 11, so the 12th is the next letter.\n\n            Actually, the string is: \n                \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> \n                Let me break it: \n                    [0:12] = \"abrakadabra\" + 'b' -> \"abrakadb\" is not matching.\n\n            Alternatively, maybe the example input string is actually 21 characters? \n\n            But the example input is given as \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 23.\n\n            After checking: \n                \"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters.\n                Then \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" = \"abrakadabra\" + \"brabrambrakadabra\" -> but wait, that's 11 + 12 = 23.\n\n            How did the example output use s = \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters)? \n\n            Then for s=\"abrakadabra\", m=11, then k=2*11 - 23 = 22-23=-1 -> invalid.\n\n            So that candidate m=11 is not valid.\n\n            Then why did the example output \"YES\\nabrakadabra\"?\n\n            There must be another candidate. \n\n            Let me try m=13: \n                k=2*13-23=26-23=3 -> valid (3<=12). Then s=t[0:13] and then check t[13:] == t[3:13]\n\n            What is t[0:13]? \n                The first 13 characters: \"abrakadabrabr\" (from index0 to index12)\n\n            Then t[3:13] = \"kadabra\" (from index3 to index12) -> but wait, let me extract:\n\n                t[0:13] = \"abrakadabrabr\" -> \n                t[3:13] = from index3 to index12: \"k\" at index3, then 'a','d','a','b','r','a','b','r' -> \"kadabrabr\"\n\n            Then the second part of t is t[13:] = from index13 to the end: \n                The whole string: \n                0:a,1:b,2:r,3:a,4:k,5:a,6:d,7:a,8:b,9:r,10:a,11:b,12:r,13:a,14:k,15:a,16:d,17:a,18:b,19:r,20:a\n                So t[13:] = \"akadabra\"\n\n            Now, is \"akadabra\" equal to \"kadabrabr\"? No.\n\n            m=14: k=2*14-23=28-23=5 -> valid (5<=13). \n                s = t[0:14] = \"abrakadabrabra\"\n                Then the second part is t[14:] = \"kadabra\" (from index14 to 20: 7 characters)\n                And we require t[14:] == t[5:14] (which is from index5 to index13: 8 characters) -> wait, the length of the second part is 23-14=9, but t[5:14] is 9 characters? Actually, from index5 to index13 inclusive is 9 characters.\n\n            Let me compute:\n                t[5:14] = from index5 to index13: \n                    index5: 'a', index6:'d', index7:'a', index8:'b', index9:'r', index10:'a', index11:'b', index12:'r', index13:'a' -> \"adabrabra\"\n\n            But t[14:] is \"kadabra\" (index14 to 20: 7 characters) -> \"kadabra\"\n\n            They are not equal.\n\n            m=15: k=2*15-23=30-23=7 -> valid (7<=14)\n                s = t[0:15] = \"abrakadabrabra\" + the next char? Actually, 15 characters: \n                t[0:15] = \"abrakadabrabrat\" -> wait, the 15th character is at index14, which is 'a' (from the example string: index14 is 'a').\n\n            Then the second part is t[15:] = \"dabra\" (from index15 to 20: 6 characters)\n            And we require t[15:] == t[7:15] (from index7 to 14: 7 characters) -> wait, the length of the second part is 23-15=8, but t[7:15] is 8 characters. \n\n            But the second part is 8 characters, and t[15:] is 8 characters? Actually, from index15 to the end is 23-15=8 characters.\n\n            Now, t[7:15] = from index7 to index14: \n                index7: 'a', index8:'b', index9:'r', index10:'a', index11:'b', index12:'r', index13:'a', index14:'k' -> \"abrarabrk\" -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\n            This is getting messy.\n\n            Let me try a different approach: \n\n            We know that the entire string t is built as s + s[k:], so the string must have a prefix s and a suffix that is s[k:].\n\n            Also, note that s must appear at the beginning and the second occurrence of s must appear at the end, but with an overlap.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the following observation:\n\n            The entire string t must be such that if we remove the overlapping part from the second occurrence of s, then we get the first occurrence.\n\n            Another idea: \n                Let s be a prefix of t, and also a suffix of t? Not necessarily, because the second part is s[k:], so s appears at the beginning and then the second part is s without the first k characters.\n\n            We can try to find a prefix s (of length m) such that the entire string t is composed of s and then s[k:] (with k>=1 and k<m). \n\n            Then, the condition is that the second part (from index m to the end) must be a substring of s starting at index k.\n\n            We can iterate over all possible overlaps k (from 1 to n//2) and then set m = (n + k)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlapping error. The overlap must be a positive number of characters less than the length of `s`. If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by two copies of the same string `s` with an overlap of at least one character but less than the length of `s`. The total length of `t` will be `2*len(s) - overlap_length`, where `overlap_length` is between 1 and `len(s)-1`.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `m` of `s`, we can compute the required overlap length `k` as `2*m - len(t)`. This `k` must be a positive integer less than `m`. We then check if the substring from the start of `t` to `m` (i.e., `t[0:m]`) matches the substring from `k` to `m` in `t` (i.e., `t[k:m]`). If it does, then `t` can be formed by two copies of `s = t[0:m]` with an overlap of `k`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over all possible lengths `m` of `s` such that `m` is at least `(len(t) + 1) // 2` and at most `len(t) - 1`. For each `m`, we calculate `k = 2*m - len(t)`. If `k` is within the valid range (1 ≤ `k` < `m`), we verify if the second part of `t` (from index `m` onwards) matches the expected suffix of `s` (from index `k` to the end of `s`).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks all possible lengths `m` from approximately `len(t)/2` to `len(t)-1`. For each `m`, it performs a substring comparison which is O(n). Thus, the overall complexity is O(n^2), which is efficient given the constraint that the length of `t` does not exceed 100.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    found = False\n    for m in range((n + 1) // 2, n):\n        k = 2 * m - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= m:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n        if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read from standard input.\n2. **Initialization**: The length of `t` is stored in `n`, and `found` is initialized to `False` to track if a valid `s` is found.\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths**: The loop runs from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n - 1` to consider all possible lengths `m` for `s`.\n4. **Calculating Overlap**: For each `m`, compute `k` as `2*m - n`. If `k` is not within the valid range (1 ≤ `k` < `m`), skip to the next iteration.\n5. **Checking Validity**: The substring `t[m:]` (the part of `t` after the first `m` characters) is compared with `s_candidate[k:]` (the part of `s` after the first `k` characters). If they match, print \"YES\" and `s_candidate`, then exit.\n6. **Output Result**: If no valid `s` is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible candidates for `s` by leveraging the properties of string concatenation and overlap, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
