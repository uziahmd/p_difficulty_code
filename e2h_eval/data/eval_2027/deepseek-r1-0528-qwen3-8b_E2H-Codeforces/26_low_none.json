    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers: A, B, C, D (with 1 <= A <= B <= C <= D <= 500000)\n\n We are to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B\n   B <= y <= C\n   C <= z <= D\n\n And the triangle is non-degenerate, meaning that the sides satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\n However, note the conditions on the sides: \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D]\n\n The triangle inequalities for sides (x, y, z) are:\n   x + y > z\n   x + z > y\n   y + z > x\n\n But note: since x <= y <= z (because x<=B<=y and y<=C<=z, so x<=y<=z), then the strictest condition is x+y>z.\n The other two (x+z>y and y+z>x) are automatically satisfied because:\n   - Since x<=y<=z, then x+z >= x+y >= y+y > y (if x>=1, but wait: if x=1, y=2, z=3: 1+3=4>2 -> true. Actually, because x<=y<=z, then:\n        x+z >= x+y >= y+y = 2y >= y+z? Not exactly, but let's check:\n\n   Actually, the conditions become:\n        x+y > z   (because x+y must be greater than the largest side)\n        x+z > y   -> but x>=1 and z>=y, so x+z >= 1+y >= y+1 > y (since y>=B>=A>=1, so y>=1). Similarly, y+z >= y+x >= x+x = 2x, but wait: we know y>=x and z>=y, so y+z >= x+x = 2x, and we require 2x > x? That's always true. However, the condition x+z>y: since x>=1 and z>=y, then x+z >= 1+y. Since y>=B>=1, then 1+y>y. So indeed the other two conditions are redundant.\n\n Therefore, the only condition we need to check is x+y>z.\n\n So the problem reduces to: count the triples (x,y,z) with:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]\n   z in [C, D]\n   such that x+y>z.\n\n We can break down the counting as follows:\n\n Let F(x,y) = the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y. Then we require z <= min(D, x+y-1) and z>=C.\n\n Then for fixed x,y, the number of valid z is: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) provided that min(D, x+y-1) >= C.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n   Let L = max(C, 0) ... but we have a lower bound C and upper bound D.\n\n   Count_z = max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)   if x+y-1 >= C, else 0.\n\n Then the total count is the sum over x from A to B, and for each x, sum over y from B to C of Count_z.\n\n However, note: the ranges are large (up to 500000) and the direct double loop would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which can be up to (500000)^2, which is too slow.\n\n We need a more efficient way.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can fix x and y, and then the condition is z < x+y, and z in [C, D]. \n\n But note: the condition is equivalent to z <= min(D, x+y-1).\n\n So for fixed x and y, the valid z are from C to min(D, x+y-1). The number of z is: \n   If x+y-1 < C: 0.\n   Else: min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1.\n\n Now, we want to compute:\n   Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} [min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1]   [for those (x,y) for which x+y-1 >= C]\n\n We can split the inner sum over y (for fixed x) into two parts:\n   Part 1: y from B to some upper limit Y1 (if exists) such that x+y-1 <= D, then use (x+y-1) - C + 1 = x+y - C.\n   Part 2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The key insight is recognizing that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the most restrictive condition is \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) within specified ranges where the triangle inequality \\(x + y > z\\) holds. The ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are given by \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\), \\(B \\leq y \\leq C\\), and \\(C \\leq z \\leq D\\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Since \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the other two triangle inequalities (\\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\)) are automatically satisfied if \\(x + y > z\\) holds. Thus, we only need to ensure \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Counting**: For each pair \\((x, y)\\), the valid \\(z\\) values must satisfy \\(C \\leq z \\leq \\min(D, x + y - 1)\\). The number of valid \\(z\\) values for each \\((x, y)\\) is \\(\\max(0, \\min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)\\).\n\n4. **Optimization**: Directly iterating over all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values would be computationally expensive for large ranges (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)). Instead, we use mathematical summation formulas to compute the counts efficiently:\n   - For fixed \\(x\\), determine the range of \\(y\\) values where \\(x + y > z\\) for all \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\).\n   - Sum the valid \\(z\\) counts for each \\((x, y)\\) pair using arithmetic series properties to avoid nested loops.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total = 0\n\n    low_y = B\n    high_y = C\n\n    # First part: y from B to min(C, D - x + 1) but note we have x+y>z and z>=C.\n    # We can split the problem into two parts for y:\n    # 1. When y is small enough so that x+y-1 < D, then the condition is x+y > z for all z in [C, D] is equivalent to x+y > D (since z can be up to D).\n    # 2. When y is large enough so that x+y-1 >= D, then the condition is automatically satisfied for all z in [C, D].\n\n    # Alternatively, we can break the problem by fixing x and determining the minimum y required such that x + y > D (since z can be as large as D). \n    # Then, for y from B to min(C, D - x) (i.e., when x + y <= D), the condition becomes x + y > z for all z in [C, D], which simplifies to x + y > D (because if x + y > D, then certainly x + y > z for all z <= D). However, note that if x + y > D, then all z in [C, D] are valid because z <= D < x + y.\n\n    # Actually, let's reframe:\n    # For fixed x and y, the condition is z < x + y. Since z is at least C, we require x + y > z_min where z_min is the smallest z (C) but also must consider the upper bound D. So the condition is simply that x + y > D? Not exactly: we require z < x + y, and z can be as large as D. So if x + y > D, then all z in [C, D] are valid. If x + y <= D, then z must be less than x + y, i.e., z from C to x + y - 1.\n\n    # But note: the condition for validity is x + y > z. So for a fixed (x, y):\n    #   If x + y <= D, then z can be from C to min(D, x + y - 1). The count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n    #   If x + y > D, then all z in [C, D] are valid, so the count is D - C + 1.\n\n    # Now, we can split the y range for a fixed x:\n    #   Let y_low = B\n    #   Let y_high = C\n    #   Condition for x + y > D: y > D - x. But since y <= C, we can define:\n    #       Case 1: y from B to min(C, D - x) (if D - x >= B) then the condition x + y <= D holds, so we count the z values from C to x + y - 1.\n    #       Case 2: y from max(B, D - x + 1) to C, then x + y > D, so all z in [C, D] are valid.\n\n    # However, note: D - x might be fractional? No, they are integers.\n\n    # But there is another way: the total number of triangles without the triangle inequality is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1). Then subtract the invalid ones? But invalid means x + y <= z. This might be more complex.\n\n    # Let me stick to the direct method:\n\n    # For a fixed x, let:\n    #   Let L = D - x + 1   (then if y >= L, then x + y > D, so all z are valid)\n    #   Then, for y from B to min(C, L-1) (inclusive), the condition is that z must be from C to x+y-1. The count for each such y is (x + y - 1 - C + 1) = x + y - C, provided x + y - 1 >= C, otherwise 0.\n\n    # So for y in [B, min(C, L-1)]:\n    #   If x + y - 1 < C, then no valid z. Otherwise, the count for this y is (x + y - C).\n\n    # But note: it's easier to split the y range at the point where x + y > D.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can compute:\n    #   Let y1 = max(B, D - x + 1)   [start of case 2]\n    #   Then for y from B to min(C, D - x): \n    #       count_z = max(0, x + y - C)   [but note: if x+y-1 < C, then x+y-C could be negative, so we need to check: actually, if x+y-1 < C, then no valid z, so count_z=0. But if x+y-1 >= C, then count_z = (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y-C.]\n\n    # Actually, the condition for having any valid z is x+y-1 >= C, i.e., y >= C - x + 1. So for y from max(B, C - x + 1) to min(C, D - x): the count for z is (x+y - C). And for y from max(B, C - x + 1) to min(C, D - x), we have two segments? \n\n    # Let me restructure:\n\n    # For fixed x, the valid y must be at least ceil(C - x + 1) but since y is integer, y >= max(B, C - x + 1). Then, for y in [max(B, C - x + 1), min(C, D - x)] (if any), the count of z is (x + y - C). Additionally, for y in [max(B, D - x + 1), C] (if any), the count of z is (D - C + 1).\n\n    # So the steps for fixed x:\n    #   Step 1: Determine the lower bound for y: y_low_bound = max(B, C - x + 1)\n    #   Step 2: Determine the upper bound for the first segment: y_segment1_high = min(C, D - x)\n    #   Step 3: If y_low_bound <= y_segment1_high, then we have a segment from y_low_bound to y_segment1_high, and the count for each y in this segment is (x + y - C). We can sum this segment using the arithmetic series formula.\n\n    #   Step 4: The second segment is from y_segment2_low = max(B, D - x + 1) to y_segment2_high = C. But note: if y_segment2_low > C, then no second segment. Also, the second segment might overlap with the first? Actually, the first segment goes up to D-x, and the second starts at D-x+1, so they are disjoint.\n\n    # However, note: the condition for the first segment is y <= D - x, and the second segment is y >= D - x + 1. So they are indeed disjoint.\n\n    # Now, how to compute the sum for the first segment?\n    #   The sum for y from L to R (inclusive) of (x + y - C) is:\n    #       = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n    #   Where:\n    #       L = y_low_bound, R = y_segment1_high\n    #       first term = x + L - C\n    #       last term = x + R - C\n    #       number of terms = R - L + 1\n\n    # Similarly, the second segment: for each y from y_segment2_low to y_segment2_high, the count is (D - C + 1). The number of terms is (y_segment2_high - y_segment2_low + 1).\n\n    # But wait, what if the entire range of y doesn't start from B? Our y ranges are from B to C. So we must ensure our segments respect B and C.\n\n    # Let me define:\n    #   y_low = B\n    #   y_high = C\n\n    # For fixed x:\n    #   Segment 1: y from L1 = max(B, C - x + 1, D - x + 1) ??? No, wait: the first segment is for y <= D - x, so L1 = max(B, C - x + 1) and R1 = min(C, D - x). But note: we must ensure that y is at least B. Actually, we already set L1 = max(B, C - x + 1). Then R1 = min(C, D - x). If L1 > R1, then no first segment.\n\n    #   Segment 2: y from L2 = max(B, D - x + 1) to R2 = C. But note: if D - x + 1 > C, then no second segment.\n\n    # However, note: the condition for the first segment is y <= D - x, and the second segment is y >= D - x + 1. Also, the first segment requires y >= C - x + 1 for the existence of any valid z (otherwise, even if y <= D - x, we might have no valid z if x+y-1 < C). But wait, the first segment condition is automatically covered by setting L1 = max(B, C - x + 1). \n\n    # Actually, we must enforce both conditions for the first segment: y must be at least C - x + 1 and at most D - x. So L1 = max(B, C - x + 1) and R1 = min(C, D - x). \n\n    # But note: if C - x + 1 > D - x, then L1 = C - x + 1 and R1 = min(C, D - x) which might be less than L1, so no first segment.\n\n    # Similarly, for the second segment, we require y >= D - x + 1 and y <= C, and also note that in the second segment, the condition for valid z is automatically satisfied (all z in [C, D] are valid) provided that y >= D - x + 1. But note: we also need to ensure that x + y > D, which is true by y >= D - x + 1.\n\n    # However, there's a catch: what if x + y > D but x + y <= z for some z in [C, D]? No, because z <= D < x + y, so z < x + y always holds. So the second segment is valid.\n\n    # Steps for fixed x:\n    #   L1 = max(B, C - x + 1)\n    #   R1 = min(C, D - x)\n    #   If L1 <= R1:\n    #       num_terms1 = R1 - L1 + 1\n    #       first_term1 = x + L1 - C\n    #       last_term1 = x + R1 - C\n    #       sum1 = num_terms1 * (first_term1 + last_term1) // 2\n    #   Else:\n    #       sum1 = 0\n\n    #   L2 = max(B, D - x + 1)\n    #   R2 = C\n    #   If L2 <= R2:\n    #       num_terms2 = R2 - L2 + 1\n    #       sum2 = num_terms2 * (D - C + 1)\n    #   Else:\n    #       sum2 = 0\n\n    #   Then add sum1 + sum2 to total.\n\n    # But wait: what about y values between B and C that are not covered by either segment? We have defined two segments based on y relative to D - x and C - x + 1. Note that the entire y range is from B to C. We must cover all y in [B, C]. However, note that if a y value is not in either segment, then it might be because it does not meet the condition for the first segment (i.e., y < C - x + 1) or the second segment (y < D - x + 1). But if y < C - x + 1, then even if y <= D - x, the condition x + y > z for all z in [C, D] fails because x + y - 1 < C (so no valid z). So such y values should not contribute. Similarly, if y < D - x + 1, but y >= C - x + 1, then we use the first segment. \n\n    # Therefore, the above two segments cover all valid y ranges.\n\n    # However, note: the first segment requires y <= D - x and y >= C - x + 1. The second segment requires y >= D - x + 1 and y >= B (and y <= C). There might be y values between B and C that are less than C - x + 1, which we correctly ignore because they don't contribute.\n\n    # Now, we iterate x from A to B and accumulate the counts.\n\n    # But note: the above approach might have an issue: the first segment's condition for valid z is x + y > z, which is equivalent to z < x + y. Since z ranges from C to D, the condition is only satisfied if x + y > D (which is the second segment) or if x + y <= D but still greater than the maximum z (D)? Actually, no: if x + y <= D, then z can only go up to x + y - 1. But if x + y - 1 < C, then no valid z. That is why we set L1 = max(B, C - x + 1) — ensuring that x + y - 1 >= C (so that there exists at least one z).\n\n    # Let's test with the example: \"1 2 3 4\"\n    #   A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4\n    #   x can be 1 or 2.\n\n    #   For x=1:\n    #       L1 = max(2, 3-1+1) = max(2,3) = 3\n    #       R1 = min(3, 4-1) = min(3,3)=3\n    #       Segment1: y=3, count_z = 1+3-3 = 1 -> valid z from 3 to 3 (only 3) -> 1 triangle: (1,3,3)\n    #       L2 = max(2, 4-1+1)=max(2,4)=4 -> no second segment.\n    #       Total for x=1: 1.\n\n    #   For x=2:\n    #       L1 = max(2, 3-2+1)=max(2,2)=2\n    #       R1 = min(3, 4-2)=min(3,2)=2\n    #           Segment1: y=2, count_z = 2+2-3 = 1 -> valid z from 3 to 2?

But note: if x+y-1 < C, then the count is negative, but we already ensured L1 >= C - x + 1, so x+y-1 >= C-1 + 1? Actually, L1 = max(B, C-x+1), so for y>=L1, we have y>=C-x+1, so x+y >= x + (C-x+1) = C+1, hence x+y-1 >= C, so the count is non-negative.\n\n    # But wait: what if x+y-1 == C-1? Then the count would be (x+y-C) = (C-1 - C + 1) = 0? Actually, if x+y-1 == C-1, then the count is (x+y-C) = (C-1 - C + 1) = 0, which is correct because then z must be at least C, but x+y-1 = C-1 < C, so no valid z. But note: our L1 is set to max(B, C-x+1). For x+y-1 to be >= C, we require y >= C - x + 1. So when y = C - x + 1, x+y-1 = C-1, which is less than C. Therefore, we must adjust the condition for the first segment.\n\n    # Correction: The condition for the first segment must ensure that x+y-1 >= C, i.e., y >= C - x + 1. But note that the count for z is (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y-C, which is valid only if x+y-1 >= C. However, if y = C - x + 1, then x+y-1 = C-1, so the count is (C-1 - C + 1) = 0. But the arithmetic series formula still holds because we are including y from L1 to R1, and the count for each y is (x+y-C). \n\n    # However, the arithmetic series formula assumes that each term is positive. But in our case, if x+y-C is negative, then we should not count that y. But note: we set L1 = max(B, C-x+1). Then for y = C-x+1, x+y-C = x + (C-x+1) - C = 1, which is positive. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the derivation:\n\n    # The count for z is: min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1, but only if x+y-1 >= C. In the first segment, we are assuming x+y <= D, so min(D, x+y-1) = x+y-1, and then the count is (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y-C. \n\n    # Now, if y = C - x + 1, then x+y-C = x + (C-x+1) - C = 1, which is positive. So the count is 1. But let's check: x+y-1 = C-1, so z must be <= C-1, but z starts at C. So there are no z values. \n\n    # There's a contradiction. \n\n    # Let me recalculate: \n    #   Condition: z < x+y, and z in [C, D].\n    #   The smallest z is C, so we require C < x+y. Therefore, the condition for having at least one z is x+y > C, i.e., y > C - x. Since y is integer, y >= C - x + 1.\n\n    # But note: the count is the number of integers z in [C, min(D, x+y-1)]. This is:\n    #   If min(D, x+y-1) < C: 0.\n    #   Else: min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1.\n\n    # For y = C - x + 1, then x+y-1 = x + (C-x+1) - 1 = C, so min(D, C) - C + 1 = C - C + 1 = 1. So there is one z (z=C) if C <= D, which it is. But wait, the condition for the triangle is x+y > z, and here z=C, and x+y = C+1 > C, so it is valid.\n\n    # Example: x=2, y=3, C=3: then x+y=5, z can be 3,4,..., up to min(D,4) (if D>=4). But wait, in our first example with x=2, y=3: \n    #   The condition is x+y=5 > z, so z can be 3 or 4 (if D>=4). But in the example input \"1 2 3 4\", D=4, so z can be 3 or 4. \n\n    # Correction: The count for z is (min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) = (min(D, 4) - 3 + 1) = (4-3+1)=2 for (2,3) in the example.\n\n    # But wait, in the example x=2, y=3: \n    #   The first segment condition: y <= D - x -> 3 <= 4-2 -> 3<=2 -> false, so it falls into the second segment? \n    #   For x=2, y=3: \n    #       First segment: R1 = min(3, 4-2)=min(3,2)=2, so y=3 is not in the first segment.\n    #       Second segment: L2 = max(2, 4-2+1)=max(2,3)=3, so y=3 is included. Then the count for the second segment is (D-C+1)=2.\n\n    # So the example (2,3,3) and (2,3,4) are counted in the second segment.\n\n    # Therefore, the condition for the first segment is y <= D - x, and the second segment is y >= D - x + 1. \n\n    # Now, going back to the example with x=1, y=3 (from the first example): \n    #   D=4, x=1, y=3: \n    #       First segment: y <= D-x -> 3 <= 3, so yes. Then count_z = 1+3-3=1, which is correct.\n\n    # The confusion earlier was due to the condition for the first segment being y <= D-x, not y <= something else.\n\n    # So the algorithm is correct.\n\n    # Let's code accordingly.\n\n    # Note: We must be cautious with integer boundaries and the arithmetic series formula.\n\n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    for x in range(A, B+1):\n        # Segment 1: y from max(B, C - x + 1) to min(C, D - x)\n        low_y1 = max(B, C - x + 1)\n        high_y1 = min(C, D - x)\n\n        if low_y1 <= high_y1:\n            n1 = high_y1 - low_y1 + 1\n            first_val = x + low_y1 - C\n            last_val = x + high_y1 - C\n            sum_seg1 = n1 * (first_val + last_val) // 2\n        else:\n            sum_seg1 = 0\n\n        # Segment 2: y from max(B, D - x + 1) to C\n        low_y2 = max(B, D - x + 1)\n        high_y2 = C\n\n        if low_y2 <= high_y2:\n            n2 = high_y2 - low_y2 + 1\n            sum_seg2 = n2 * (D - C + 1)\n        else:\n            sum_seg2 = 0\n\n        total_triangles += sum_seg1 + sum_seg2\n\n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution involves iterating over each possible value of \\(x\\) in the range \\([A, B]\\).

When y is small enough so that x+y-1 < D, then the condition is x+y > z for all z in [C, D] is equivalent to x+y > D (since z can be up to D).\n    # 2. When y is large enough so that x+y-1 >= D, then the condition is automatically satisfied for all z in [C, D].\n\n    # Alternatively, we can break the problem by fixing x and determining the minimum y required such that x + y > D (since z can be as large as D). \n    # Then, for y from B to min(C, D - x) (i.e., when x + y <= D), the condition becomes x + y > z for all z in [C, D], which simplifies to x + y > D (because if x + y > D, then certainly x + y > z for all z <= D). However, note that if x + y > D, then all z in [C, D] are valid because z <= D < x + y.\n\n    # Actually, let's reframe:\n    # For fixed x and y, the condition is z < x + y. Since z is at least C, we require x + y > z_min where z_min is the smallest z (C) but also must consider the upper bound D. So the condition is simply that x + y > D? Not exactly: we require z < x + y, and z can be as large as D. So if x + y > D, then all z in [C, D] are valid. If x + y <= D, then z must be less than x + y, i.e., z from C to x + y - 1.\n\n    # But note: the condition for validity is x + y > z. So for a fixed (x, y):\n    #   If x + y <= D, then z can be from C to min(D, x + y - 1). The count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n    #   If x + y > D, then all z in [C, D] are valid, so the count is D - C + 1.\n\n    # Now, we can split the y range for a fixed x:\n    #   Let y_low = B\n    #   Let y_high = C\n    #   Condition for x + y > D: y > D - x. But since y <= C, we can define:\n    #       Case 1: y from B to min(C, D - x) (if D - x >= B) then the condition x + y <= D holds, so we count the z values from C to x + y - 1.\n    #       Case 2: y from max(B, D - x + 1) to C, then x + y > D, so all z in [C, D] are valid.\n\n    # However, note: D - x might be fractional? No, they are integers.\n\n    # But there is another way: the total number of triangles without the triangle inequality is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1). Then subtract the invalid ones? But invalid means x + y <= z. This might be more complex.\n\n    # Let me stick to the direct method:\n\n    # For a fixed x, let:\n    #   Let L = D - x + 1   (then if y >= L, then x + y > D, so all z are valid)\n    #   Then, for y from B to min(C, L-1) (inclusive), the condition is that z must be from C to x+y-1. The count for each such y is (x + y - 1 - C + 1) = x + y - C, provided x + y - 1 >= C, otherwise 0.\n\n    # So for y in [B, min(C, L-1)]:\n    #   If x + y - 1 < C, then no valid z. Otherwise, the count for this y is (x + y - C).\n\n    # But note: it's easier to split the y range at the point where x + y > D.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can compute:\n    #   Let y1 = max(B, D - x + 1)   [start of case 2]\n    #   Then for y from B to min(C, D - x): \n    #       count_z = max(0, x + y - C)   [but note: if x+y-1 < C, then x+y-C could be negative, so we need to check: actually, if x+y-1 < C, then no valid z, so count_z=0. But if x+y-1 >= C, then count_z = (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y-C.]\n\n    # Actually, the condition for having any valid z is x+y-1 >= C, i.e., y >= C - x + 1. So for y from max(B, C - x + 1) to min(C, D - x): the count for z is (x+y - C). And for y from max(B, C - x + 1) to min(C, D - x), we have two segments? \n\n    # Let me restructure:\n\n    # For fixed x, the valid y must be at least ceil(C - x + 1) but since y is integer, y >= max(B, C - x + 1). Then, for y in [max(B, C - x + 1), min(C, D - x)] (if any), the count of z is (x + y - C). Additionally, for y in [max(B, D - x + 1), C] (if any), the count of z is (D - C + 1).\n\n    # So the steps for fixed x:\n    #   Step 1: Determine the lower bound for y: y_low_bound = max(B, C - x + 1)\n    #   Step 2: Determine the upper bound for the first segment: y_segment1_high = min(C, D - x)\n    #   Step 3: If y_low_bound <= y_segment1_high, then we have a segment from y_low_bound to y_segment1_high, and the count for each y in this segment is (x + y - C). We can sum this segment using the arithmetic series formula.\n\n    #   Step 4: The second segment is from y_segment2_low = max(B, D - x + 1) to y_segment2_high = C. But note: if y_segment2_low > C, then no second segment. Also, the second segment might overlap with the first? Actually, the first segment goes up to D-x, and the second starts at D-x+1, so they are disjoint.\n\n    # However, note: the condition for the first segment is y <= D - x, and the second segment is y >= D - x + 1. So they are indeed disjoint.\n\n    # Now, how to compute the sum for the first segment?\n    #   The sum for y from L to R (inclusive) of (x + y - C) is:\n    #       = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n    #   Where:\n    #       L = y_low_bound, R = y_segment1_high\n    #       first term = x + L - C\n    #       last term = x + R - C\n    #       number of terms = R - L + 1\n\n    # Similarly, the second segment: for each y from y_segment2_low to y_segment2_high, the count is (D - C + 1). The number of terms is (y_segment2_high - y_segment2_low + 1).\n\n    # But wait, what if the entire range of y doesn't start from B? Our y ranges are from B to C. So we must ensure our segments respect B and C.\n\n    # Let me define:\n    #   y_low = B\n    #   y_high = C\n\n    # For fixed x:\n    #   Segment 1: y from L1 = max(B, C - x + 1, D - x + 1) ??? No, wait: the first segment is for y <= D - x, so L1 = max(B, C - x + 1) and R1 = min(C, D - x). But note: we must ensure that y is at least B. Actually, we already set L1 = max(B, C - x + 1). Then R1 = min(C, D - x). If L1 > R1, then no first segment.\n\n    #   Segment 2: y from L2 = max(B, D - x + 1) to R2 = C. But note: if D - x + 1 > C, then no second segment.\n\n    # However, note: the condition for the first segment is y <= D - x, and the second segment is y >= D - x + 1. Also, the first segment requires y >= C - x + 1 for the existence of any valid z (otherwise, even if y <= D - x, we might have no valid z if x+y-1 < C). But wait, the first segment condition is automatically covered by setting L1 = max(B, C - x + 1). \n\n    # Actually, we must enforce both conditions for the first segment: y must be at least C - x + 1 and at most D - x. So L1 = max(B, C - x + 1) and R1 = min(C, D - x). \n\n    # But note: if C - x + 1 > D - x, then L1 = C - x + 1 and R1 = min(C, D - x) which might be less than L1, so no first segment.\n\n    # Similarly, for the second segment, we require y >= D - x + 1 and y <= C, and also note that in the second segment, the condition for valid z is automatically satisfied (all z in [C, D] are valid) provided that y >= D - x + 1. But note: we also need to ensure that x + y > D, which is true by y >= D - x + 1.\n\n    # However, there's a catch: what if x + y > D but x + y <= z for some z in [C, D]? No, because z <= D < x + y, so z < x + y always holds. So the second segment is valid.\n\n    # Steps for fixed x:\n    #   L1 = max(B, C - x + 1)\n    #   R1 = min(C, D - x)\n    #   If L1 <= R1:\n    #       num_terms1 = R1 - L1 + 1\n    #       first_term1 = x + L1 - C\n    #       last_term1 = x + R1 - C\n    #       sum1 = num_terms1 * (first_term1 + last_term1) // 2\n    #   Else:\n    #       sum1 = 0\n\n    #   L2 = max(B, D - x + 1)\n    #   R2 = C\n    #   If L2 <= R2:\n    #       num_terms2 = R2 - L2 + 1\n    #       sum2 = num_terms2 * (D - C + 1)\n    #   Else:\n    #       sum2 = 0\n\n    #   Then add sum1 + sum2 to total.\n\n    # But wait: what about y values between B and C that are not covered by either segment? We have defined two segments based on y relative to D - x and C - x + 1. Note that the entire y range is from B to C. We must cover all y in [B, C]. However, note that if a y value is not in either segment, then it might be because it does not meet the condition for the first segment (i.e., y < C - x + 1) or the second segment (y < D - x + 1). But if y < C - x + 1, then even if y <= D - x, the condition x + y > z for all z in [C, D] fails because x + y - 1 < C (so no valid z). So such y values should not contribute. Similarly, if y < D - x + 1, but y >= C - x + 1, then we use the first segment. \n\n    # Therefore, the above two segments cover all valid y ranges.\n\n    # However, note: the first segment requires y <= D - x and y >= C - x + 1. The second segment requires y >= D - x + 1 and y >= B (and y <= C). There might be y values between B and C that are less than C - x + 1, which we correctly ignore because they don't contribute.\n\n    # Now, we iterate x from A to B and accumulate the counts.\n\n    # But note: the above approach might have an issue: the first segment's condition for valid z is x + y > z, which is equivalent to z < x + y. Since z ranges from C to D, the condition is only satisfied if x + y > D (which is the second segment) or if x + y <= D but still greater than the maximum z (D)? Actually, no: if x + y <= D, then z can only go up to x + y - 1. But if x + y - 1 < C, then no valid z. That is why we set L1 = max(B, C - x + 1) — ensuring that x + y - 1 >= C (so that there exists at least one z).\n\n    # Let's test with the example: \"1 2 3 4\"\n    #   A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4\n    #   x can be 1 or 2.\n\n    #   For x=1:\n    #       L1 = max(2, 3-1+1) = max(2,3) = 3\n    #       R1 = min(3, 4-1) = min(3,3)=3\n    #       Segment1: y=3, count_z = 1+3-3 = 1 -> valid z from 3 to 3 (only 3) -> 1 triangle: (1,3,3)\n    #       L2 = max(2, 4-1+1)=max(2,4)=4 -> no second segment.\n    #       Total for x=1: 1.\n\n    #   For x=2:\n    #       L1 = max(2, 3-2+1)=max(2,2)=2\n    #       R1 = min(3, 4-2)=min(3,2)=2\n    #           Segment1: y=2, count_z = 2+2-3 = 1 -> valid z from 3 to 2?

This is derived from the fact that z must be between C and x+y-1 (inclusive). The number of z values is (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y-C. But note: if x+y-1 < C, then the count is negative, but we already ensured L1 >= C - x + 1, so x+y-1 >= C-1 + 1? Actually, L1 = max(B, C-x+1), so for y>=L1, we have y>=C-x+1, so x+y >= x + (C-x+1) = C+1, hence x+y-1 >= C, so the count is non-negative.\n\n    # But wait: what if x+y-1 == C-1?

Actually, if x+y-1 == C-1, then the count is (x+y-C) = (C-1 - C + 1) = 0, which is correct because then z must be at least C, but x+y-1 = C-1 < C, so no valid z. But note: our L1 is set to max(B, C-x+1). For x+y-1 to be >= C, we require y >= C - x + 1. So when y = C - x + 1, x+y-1 = C-1, which is less than C. Therefore, we must adjust the condition for the first segment.\n\n    # Correction: The condition for the first segment must ensure that x+y-1 >= C, i.e., y >= C - x + 1. But note that the count for z is (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y-C, which is valid only if x+y-1 >= C. However, if y = C - x + 1, then x+y-1 = C-1, so the count is (C-1 - C + 1) = 0. But the arithmetic series formula still holds because we are including y from L1 to R1, and the count for each y is (x+y-C). \n\n    # However, the arithmetic series formula assumes that each term is positive. But in our case, if x+y-C is negative, then we should not count that y. But note: we set L1 = max(B, C-x+1). Then for y = C-x+1, x+y-C = x + (C-x+1) - C = 1, which is positive. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the derivation:\n\n    # The count for z is: min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1, but only if x+y-1 >= C. In the first segment, we are assuming x+y <= D, so min(D, x+y-1) = x+y-1, and then the count is (x+y-1 - C + 1) = x+y-C. \n\n    # Now, if y = C - x + 1, then x+y-C = x + (C-x+1) - C = 1, which is positive. So the count is 1. But let's check: x+y-1 = C-1, so z must be <= C-1, but z starts at C. So there are no z values. \n\n    # There's a contradiction. \n\n    # Let me recalculate: \n    #   Condition: z < x+y, and z in [C, D].\n    #   The smallest z is C, so we require C < x+y. Therefore, the condition for having at least one z is x+y > C, i.e., y > C - x. Since y is integer, y >= C - x + 1.\n\n    # But note: the count is the number of integers z in [C, min(D, x+y-1)]. This is:\n    #   If min(D, x+y-1) < C: 0.\n    #   Else: min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1.\n\n    # For y = C - x + 1, then x+y-1 = x + (C-x+1) - 1 = C, so min(D, C) - C + 1 = C - C + 1 = 1. So there is one z (z=C) if C <= D, which it is. But wait, the condition for the triangle is x+y > z, and here z=C, and x+y = C+1 > C, so it is valid.\n\n    # Example: x=2, y=3, C=3: then x+y=5, z can be 3,4,..., up to min(D,4) (if D>=4). But wait, in our first example with x=2, y=3: \n    #   The condition is x+y=5 > z, so z can be 3 or 4 (if D>=4). But in the example input \"1 2 3 4\", D=4, so z can be 3 or 4. \n\n    # Correction: The count for z is (min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) = (min(D, 4) - 3 + 1) = (4-3+1)=2 for (2,3) in the example.\n\n    # But wait, in the example x=2, y=3: \n    #   The first segment condition: y <= D - x -> 3 <= 4-2 -> 3<=2 -> false, so it falls into the second segment? \n    #   For x=2, y=3: \n    #       First segment: R1 = min(3, 4-2)=min(3,2)=2, so y=3 is not in the first segment.\n    #       Second segment: L2 = max(2, 4-2+1)=max(2,3)=3, so y=3 is included. Then the count for the second segment is (D-C+1)=2.\n\n    # So the example (2,3,3) and (2,3,4) are counted in the second segment.\n\n    # Therefore, the condition for the first segment is y <= D - x, and the second segment is y >= D - x + 1. \n\n    # Now, going back to the example with x=1, y=3 (from the first example): \n    #   D=4, x=1, y=3: \n    #       First segment: y <= D-x -> 3 <= 3, so yes. Then count_z = 1+3-3=1, which is correct.\n\n    # The confusion earlier was due to the condition for the first segment being y <= D-x, not y <= something else.\n\n    # So the algorithm is correct.\n\n    # Let's code accordingly.\n\n    # Note: We must be cautious with integer boundaries and the arithmetic series formula.\n\n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    for x in range(A, B+1):\n        # Segment 1: y from max(B, C - x + 1) to min(C, D - x)\n        low_y1 = max(B, C - x + 1)\n        high_y1 = min(C, D - x)\n\n        if low_y1 <= high_y1:\n            n1 = high_y1 - low_y1 + 1\n            first_val = x + low_y1 - C\n            last_val = x + high_y1 - C\n            sum_seg1 = n1 * (first_val + last_val) // 2\n        else:\n            sum_seg1 = 0\n\n        # Segment 2: y from max(B, D - x + 1) to C\n        low_y2 = max(B, D - x + 1)\n        high_y2 = C\n\n        if low_y2 <= high_y2:\n            n2 = high_y2 - low_y2 + 1\n            sum_seg2 = n2 * (D - C + 1)\n        else:\n            sum_seg2 = 0\n\n        total_triangles += sum_seg1 + sum_seg2\n\n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()",
