Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n The idea is to find the minimum d such that the entire street [0, l] is covered by the lanterns' light.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. Consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the edges (from 0 to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to l).\n\n How to approach:\n - The entire street must be covered. The coverage of a lantern at position a with radius d is [a-d, a+d].\n - The problem reduces to ensuring that the union of these intervals covers [0, l].\n\n We can break the problem into:\n a) The left edge: from 0 to the first lantern. The first lantern must cover from 0 to its position. \n    Therefore, we require d >= (first_lantern_position - 0) / 2. But note: if the first lantern is at 0, then no need.\n\n However, note that the lanterns can be arranged arbitrarily. We have to cover the entire street.\n\n Approach:\n Let's consider the gaps:\n\n 1. Gap at the beginning: from 0 to the first lantern (a0). The required d for the first segment is a0/2.\n 2. Gap in the middle: between two consecutive lanterns at positions a[i] and a[i+1]. The gap is from a[i] to a[i+1]. \n    The condition for covering the gap is that the right lantern must extend to the right by at least half the gap? Actually, \n    the two lanterns together must cover the entire gap. The left lantern covers up to a[i]+d, the right lantern covers from a[i+1]-d.\n    We require a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d, which implies d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n\n 3. Gap at the end: from the last lantern (last_a) to l. The required d for the last segment is (l - last_a) / 2.\n\n Then, the answer is the maximum of these three values (because we need to cover the worst-case gap).\n\n However, note that the lanterns might already cover the gaps if placed appropriately. But we are to find the minimal d that covers the entire street.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n   Sorted: [2,5]\n   First gap: from 0 to 2 -> requires d >= 2/2 = 1.\n   Second gap: between 2 and 5 -> requires d >= (5-2)/2 = 1.5.\n   Third gap: from 5 to 5 (if l=5) then (5-5)=0 -> requires 0, but wait: the street ends at 5, so we require the last lantern to cover from 5 to 5? Actually, the street is [0,5]. The last lantern is at 5, so it covers [5-d, 5+d]. To cover 5, we need d>=0, but the gap is from the last lantern to the end? Actually, the gap is from the last lantern to l (which is 5) is 0. So the maximum is 1.5.\n\n But the example output is 2.0.\n\n Wait, let me check the example: \n   \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> Output: 2.0\n\n Why is that?\n\n Let me reexamine: \n   The lantern at 2 covers [2-d, 2+d]. The lantern at 5 covers [5-d, 5+d].\n   The entire street [0,5] must be covered.\n\n   Conditions:\n     0 must be <= 2+d -> d>=2 (from the leftmost part: 0 to 2)\n     5 must be >= 5-d -> automatically satisfied if d>=0, but wait: the rightmost part is 5, and we require that the rightmost point 5 is covered by the last lantern: 5-d <= 5 -> always true, but also the left side of the last lantern must cover from 5-d to 5+d. However, the critical point is that the gap between 2 and 5 must be covered.\n\n   The gap between 2 and 5 is 3 units. The two lanterns together must cover this. The left lantern extends to 2+d, the right lantern extends to 5-d. We require 2+d >= 5-d -> 2d >= 3 -> d>=1.5.\n\n   But also the left edge: from 0 to 2 must be covered. The left lantern must cover from 0 to 2: so we require 2-d <= 0? Actually, the left lantern covers from 2-d to 2+d. To cover 0, we need 2-d <= 0 -> d>=2. However, wait: the condition for covering 0 is that 0 is within [2-d, 2+d]. Since 0<=2+d is always true (because d is positive and 2+d>=2>0), the issue is that the left lantern must extend to the left to 0. The leftmost point 0 must be <= 2+d (which is okay) and also the lantern must start at most at 0. Actually, the condition is: the leftmost point 0 must be >= (2-d) or not? \n\n   Actually, the condition for covering 0 is that the leftmost lantern must cover 0. The leftmost lantern is at 2. The coverage extends from 2-d to 2+d. So 0 must be >= 2-d? Not exactly: the condition is that the interval [2-d, 2+d] must include 0. This requires 2-d <= 0 <= 2+d. The right inequality is always true, but the left one requires d>=2.\n\n   Similarly, the rightmost point 5 must be included. The last lantern is at 5, so we require 5-d <= 5 <= 5+d. The left inequality is always true (since d>=0) and the right one is also true. But wait, the condition for the right edge is that the entire street up to l (5) must be covered. The last lantern covers [5-d, 5+d]. Since the street ends at 5, we require that 5 is covered, so 5-d <= 5 (true) and also that the left side of the last lantern's coverage must meet the requirement from the previous lantern? Actually, the last lantern doesn't have to cover beyond 5, but the entire street must be covered. The point 5 is covered by the last lantern as long as d>=0, but the gap between the second last lantern and the last lantern is covered by both.\n\n   However, note: the example input has two lanterns at 2 and 5. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3. The left lantern at 2 must cover from 2-d to 2+d. The right lantern at 5 must cover from 5-d to 5+d.\n\n   The entire street [0,5] must be covered. The leftmost part [0,2] must be covered by the first lantern: so 2-d <= 0 -> d>=2. \n   The gap [2,5] must be covered: the first lantern covers up to 2+d, the second lantern covers from 5-d. We require 2+d >= 5-d -> d>=1.5.\n   The rightmost part [5,5] is covered by the second lantern as long as 5-d <= 5, which is always true.\n\n   But note: the condition for the left edge is d>=2, and for the middle gap d>=1.5. Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of these requirements: 2.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n   Steps:\n   1. Read n and l.\n   2. Read the list of n integers (lantern positions) and sort them.\n   3. Check the left edge: from 0 to the first lantern. The required d for the left edge is (first_lantern - 0) / 2. But actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to first_lantern. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is first_lantern, so the lantern must extend at least (first_lantern - 0) / 2 to the left. However, if the lantern is at position a0, then to cover 0 we require that the left boundary of the first lantern (a0 - d) is <= 0, so d >= a0 (if we only consider the left edge). But wait: the condition is that the entire segment [0, a0] must be covered. The first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The coverage of the first lantern is [a0-d, a0+d]. The left part 0 must be >= a0-d? Actually, the condition is that 0 must be in [a0-d, a0+d]. Since a0-d <= 0 <= a0+d, and we know a0>=0, the critical condition is 0>=a0-d -> d>=a0. However, note that the lantern might be at 0, then a0=0, then d>=0. But wait: if the lantern is at 0, then the left edge is 0, so we don't need any extension to the left. However, the condition is that the entire street must be covered, so the left edge is 0, and the first lantern is at 0: then the left edge is covered. So the condition for the left edge is: d must be at least (first_lantern - 0) / 1? Actually, we can think of the left edge: the farthest point to the left is 0. The first lantern must cover from 0 to its own position. The amount of extension needed to the left is (first_lantern - 0) / 2? Actually, the entire segment from 0 to first_lantern must be covered by the first lantern? Not necessarily: the first lantern covers [first_lantern-d, first_lantern+d]. The point 0 must be in that interval, so first_lantern-d <= 0 <= first_lantern+d. The right inequality is always true because d>=0 and 0<=first_lantern. The left inequality gives d>=first_lantern. \n\n   But wait: if we set d = first_lantern, then the first lantern covers [0, 2*first_lantern]. However, that might be too much. Actually, we don't require the first lantern to cover the entire segment from 0 to first_lantern by itself. We require that the entire street is covered. The first lantern only needs to cover from 0 to first_lantern+d, but there might be other lanterns. However, the left edge (from 0 to the first lantern) must be covered by the first lantern or by a combination of lanterns? Actually, the first lantern is the leftmost, so the only way to cover the left edge is by the first lantern. Similarly, the right edge must be covered by the last lantern.\n\n   Therefore, the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the next lantern (if any) or to the end. But note: the first lantern is the leftmost, so there's no lantern to the left. So the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least the first lantern's position. The condition is that the leftmost point 0 must be within [first_lantern-d, first_lantern+d]. The condition for 0 is: first_lantern-d <= 0. Since first_lantern>=0, we have d>=first_lantern.\n\n   Similarly, the last lantern must cover the right edge: so the last lantern must extend to the right enough to cover l. Condition: last_lantern+d >= l -> d>= (l - last_lantern).\n\n   And for the gaps between two consecutive lanterns at positions a[i] and a[i+1]:\n        The gap is from a[i] to a[i+1]. The left lantern covers up to a[i]+d, the right lantern covers from a[i+1]-d. We require a[i]+d >= a[i+1]-d -> d>= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   Therefore, the candidate values for d are:\n        candidate1 = a[0]   (to cover the left edge: from 0 to a[0])\n        candidate2 = l - a[-1]   (to cover the right edge: from a[-1] to l)\n        candidate3 = (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2   for each consecutive pair i\n\n   Then, the answer is the maximum of these candidates.\n\n   But wait: in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\", \n        candidate1 = 2 (from the first lantern at 2)\n        candidate2 = 5-5 = 0\n        candidate3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n   Then the maximum is 2, which matches the sample.\n\n   Another example: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        First, sort the list: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n        candidate1 = 0 (from the first lantern at 0) -> so left edge requires d>=0\n        candidate2 = 15-15 = 0\n        candidate3 = max( (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 )\n                   = max(1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5\n\n        Then the answer is 2.5.\n\n   However, the sample output is 2.5.\n\n   But wait: let me check the example with d=2.5 for the sorted list [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]:\n\n   - The lantern at 0: covers [-2.5, 2.5] -> so from -2.5 to 2.5. The street starts at 0, so we cover [0,2.5] (but 2.5 is beyond the first lantern at 3? Actually, the next lantern is at 3, so we need to cover from 0 to 3.\n\n   With d=2.5, the first lantern covers [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5, 2.5]. The next lantern at 3: [0.5, 5.5]. The gap from 2.5 to 3 is from 2.5 to 3: the next lantern starts at 0.5? Actually, the first lantern's right end is 2.5 and the second lantern's left end is 0.5 (from 3-2.5=0.5). But 0.5 is less than 2.5, so the entire segment from 0 to 5 is covered by the first two lanterns? \n\n   Actually, the first lantern covers [0,2.5] and the second lantern covers [0.5,5.5]. The union from 0 to 5.5 is [0,5.5] which covers [0,15]? Not yet, because the street is [0,15]. We have more lanterns.\n\n   Let's check the entire coverage with d=2.5:\n\n   - Lantern at 0: [-2.5, 2.5] -> covers [0,2.5]\n   - Lantern at 3: [0.5,5.5] -> covers [0.5,5.5] (so from 0.5 to 5.5)\n   - Lantern at 5: [2.5,7.5] -> covers [2.5,7.5]\n   - Lantern at 7: [4.5,9.5] -> covers [4.5,9.5]\n   - Lantern at 9: [6.5,11.5] -> covers [6.5,11.5]\n   - Lantern at 14: [11.5,16.5] -> covers [11.5,16.5] (which goes beyond 15, so covers up to 15)\n   - Lantern at 15: [12.5,17.5] -> covers [12.5,17.5] (also beyond 15)\n\n   Now, check the gaps:\n     From 0 to 3: covered by first two.\n     From 3 to 5: covered by second and third.\n     From 5 to 7: covered by third and fourth.\n     From 7 to 9: covered by fourth and fifth.\n     From 9 to 14: covered by fifth and sixth? \n          Fifth lantern at 9: [6.5,11.5] -> so covers up to 11.5, and the sixth at 14: [11.5,16.5] -> so they meet at 11.5. Then from 11.5 to 14 is covered by the sixth lantern.\n     From 14 to 15: covered by the seventh lantern (at 15) and the sixth lantern: the sixth lantern goes to 16.5, so from 11.5 to 16.5 covers [11.5,15] and the seventh lantern covers [12.5,17.5] so they overlap.\n\n   But wait, what about the gap from 2.5 to 3? The first lantern ends at 2.5, and the second lantern starts at 0.5? Actually, the second lantern is at 3, so its coverage starts at 3-2.5=0.5. So the entire segment from 0.5 to 2.5 is covered by both the first and second lanterns. The first lantern's coverage goes to 2.5, and the second lantern's coverage starts at 0.5, so there is no gap.\n\n   However, the requirement for the middle gaps is that the two adjacent lanterns must cover the gap between them. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3 units. The condition is: d >= (3-0)/2 = 1.5. We have 2.5 which is >=1.5, so it's okay.\n\n   But why did we get 2.5 as the maximum candidate? Because the gap between 9 and 14 is 5 units, so (14-9)/2 = 2.5.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and l.\n   Step 2: Read the list of lantern positions and sort it.\n   Step 3: \n        candidates = []\n        # Left edge: from 0 to the first lantern\n        if n == 0:\n            # But n>=1 per the problem, so skip\n            pass\n        else:\n            candidates.append(lanterns[0] - 0)   # Actually, we want d>= (first_lantern - 0) for the left edge? But note: the condition is that the first lantern must extend to the left by at least (first_lantern - 0) to cover 0? \n            # Actually, the condition for the left edge is that the first lantern must cover 0, which requires d >= (first_lantern - 0) / 1? No, wait: the first lantern is at `a0`. The leftmost point 0 must be covered. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0. The lantern must extend at least a0 to the left to cover 0? But the coverage is symmetric: the lantern covers [a0-d, a0+d]. The condition for 0 to be included is: a0-d <= 0 -> d >= a0. So yes, we require d >= a0.\n\n        However, wait: the above reasoning for the left edge was that the first lantern must cover 0, which requires d>=a0. But in the example \"2 5\": the first lantern is at 2, so d>=2. But note: the entire street must be covered. The first lantern being at 2, the next lantern at 5, and the gap between them is 3, which requires d>=1.5. The maximum of 2 and 1.5 is 2.\n\n        Similarly, the right edge: the last lantern must cover the point l, so we require d >= (l - last_lantern). Because the last lantern is at `last`, and to cover l we require last + d >= l -> d>= (l-last).\n\n        For the gaps between two consecutive lanterns: we require d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n        So the candidates are:\n            candidate_left = a[0]   # because d must be at least a[0] to cover from 0 to a[0]\n            candidate_right = l - a[-1]\n            candidate_gap = for i in range(n-1): (a[i+1]-a[i])/2\n\n        Then answer = max(candidate_left, candidate_right, max(candidate_gap))\n\n   But wait: in the example \"7 15\", \n        candidate_left = 0 (because the first lantern is at 0) -> 0\n        candidate_right = 15 - 15 = 0\n        candidate_gap = [ (3-0)/2, (5-3)/2, (7-5)/2, (9-7)/2, (14-9)/2, (15-14)/2 ] = [1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5] -> max is 2.5.\n\n        Then answer = 2.5.\n\n   However, consider a case where the first lantern is not at 0, but the left edge is covered by a lantern that is not the first? Actually, the problem states that the street is from 0 to l, and the lanterns are given. The first lantern is the leftmost. So the left edge must be covered by the leftmost lantern.\n\n   But wait: what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then the leftmost lantern must cover from 0 to its position. The condition is that the leftmost lantern must extend left by at least (its position) to cover 0. However, if there is a gap from 0 to the first lantern, then the leftmost lantern must cover that gap. The condition is that the leftmost lantern's coverage must extend from 0 to its position. The leftmost lantern is at `a0`, so the distance from 0 to a0 is a0. The lantern must extend at least a0 to the left to cover 0. But wait, the lantern can also be extended to the right, but the left edge is only concerned with the left side. The condition is: the leftmost point 0 must be in [a0-d, a0+d]. Since a0>=0, the condition is a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0.\n\n   Similarly, for the right edge: the last lantern must cover the right edge, so the condition is a_n-1 + d >= l -> d>= (l - a_n-1).\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n   candidates = []\n   candidates.append(a[0])   # for left edge\n   candidates.append(l - a[-1])   # for right edge\n   for i in range(len(a)-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        # The minimal d to cover this gap is gap/2\n        candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n   Then, answer = max(candidates)\n\n   But wait: what if there are multiple lanterns and the left edge is covered by a lantern that is not the first? Actually, the first lantern is the leftmost, so there is no lantern to the left. The left edge must be covered by the first lantern.\n\n   However, consider: the first lantern is the leftmost, so the left edge (from 0 to the first lantern) must be covered by the first lantern. Similarly, the right edge must be covered by the last lantern.\n\n   But wait: what if there are two lanterns, one at 1 and one at 3, and the street is from 0 to 4. The left edge from 0 to 1 must be covered by the first lantern. The condition for the first lantern is d>=1. The gap between 1 and 3: d>= (3-1)/2 = 1. The right edge from 3 to 4: d>= (4-3)=1. So the answer is 1. But what if we set d=1?\n        First lantern: [0,2] (from 0 to 2) -> covers [0,2]\n        Second lantern: [2,4] -> covers [2,4]\n        The entire street [0,4] is covered.\n\n   Now, according to our algorithm:\n        a = [1,3]\n        candidate_left = 1\n        candidate_right = 4-3 = 1\n        candidate_gap = (3-1)/2 = 1\n        answer = 1 -> correct.\n\n   However, consider an alternative: what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the left edge requires 0, and the gap from 0 to the next lantern (say 2) requires (2-0)/2=1, and the right edge (if l=4 and last lantern at 2) then (4-2)=2. Then the answer would be 2. But wait: if the lanterns are at [0,2] and the street is [0,4], then the last lantern is at 2, so the right edge is from 2 to 4: requires d>=2. The gap from 0 to 2: (2-0)/2=1, and the left edge is 0. So the maximum is 2. With d=2, the first lantern covers [-2,2] (so [0,2]), the second lantern covers [0,4]. Then the entire street [0,4] is covered.\n\n   But note: the first lantern at 0 with d=2 covers [0-2, 0+2] = [-2,2] which covers [0,2]. The second lantern at 2 with d=2 covers [0,4] (since 2-2=0 and 2+2=4). So the entire street is covered.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left edge is that the first lantern must cover 0, which requires d>=a0 (the first element). But what if the first lantern is at 0? Then d>=0, which is fine.\n\n   But wait: the condition for the left edge is d>=a0. If the first lantern is at 0, then d>=0. Then the gap between 0 and the next lantern (if exists) is (next_lantern - 0)/2, and the right edge condition (if the last lantern is not at l) is (l - last_lantern). \n\n   Example: n=1, l=10, and the lantern at 5. Then:\n        candidate_left = 5\n        candidate_right = 10-5 = 5\n        candidate_gap = [] (since n=1, no consecutive gaps)\n        Then answer = 5.\n\n   Check: d=5, the lantern at 5 covers [0,10] (because 5-5=0, 5+5=10). Correct.\n\n   Another example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 0. Then:\n        candidate_left = 0\n        candidate_right = 10-0 = 10\n        candidate_gap = [] \n        Then answer = 10.\n\n   Check: d=10, the lantern at 0 covers [-10,10] -> covers [0,10]. Correct.\n\n   One more: n=1, l=10, lantern at 10. Then:\n        candidate_left = 10\n        candidate_right = 10-10=0\n        candidate_gap = []\n        Then answer = 10.\n\n   Check: d=10, the lantern at 10 covers [0,20] -> covers [0,10]. Correct.\n\n   But wait: for the left edge when the lantern is at 10, the left edge from 0 to 10: the lantern at 10 must cover 0, so d>=10 (correct). The right edge: 10 to 10 is covered (requires 0). The gap: none.\n\n   However, consider: n=1, l=10, lantern at 5. Then d=5, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the lantern is at 5 and the street is [0,10]? The lantern at 5 with d=5 covers [0,10]. So the condition for the left edge is that the first lantern (which is the only one) must cover from 0 to 5: so d>=5 (because 5-d<=0 -> d>=5). The right edge: 5+d>=10 -> d>=5. So the minimal d is 5.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm works.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left edge is that the first lantern must cover the left edge. The condition is d>=a0 (the position of the first lantern). But note: the entire left edge is from 0 to a0. The lantern at a0 must cover from 0 to a0. The distance from a0 to 0 is a0. The lantern must extend at least a0 to the left to cover 0. But wait, the lantern's coverage is symmetric, so the leftmost point it covers is a0-d. We require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0. This is correct.\n\n   Similarly, the right edge: the last lantern must cover from a_last to l. The distance from a_last to l is l - a_last. The lantern must extend at least (l - a_last) to the right, so d>= (l - a_last).\n\n   And the gaps: between two consecutive lanterns, the condition is that the two lanterns together must cover the entire gap. The left lantern covers up to a_i + d, the right lantern covers from a_{i+1}-d. We require a_i+d >= a_{i+1}-d -> d>= (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2.\n\n   Therefore, we compute:\n\n   candidates = [a[0]]   # left edge\n   candidates.append(l - a[-1])   # right edge\n   for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n   Then, answer = max(candidates) if candidates is not empty.\n\n   But note: the problem says n>=1, so we don't have to worry about n=0.\n\n   However, let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n        n=7, l=15, sorted a = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n        candidates = [0, 15-15=0, (3-0)/2=1.5, (5-3)/2=1.0, (7-5)/2=1.0, (9-7)/2=1.0, (14-9)/2=2.5, (15-14)/2=0.5] -> max is 2.5.\n\n   Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n        n=2, l=5, sorted a=[2,5]\n        candidates = [2, 5-5=0, (5-2)/2=1.5] -> max=2.\n\n   But wait: in the example \"2 5\", the left edge candidate is 2, but the gap candidate is 1.5, so the maximum is 2.\n\n   However, note: the left edge candidate is 2, which is the first lantern's position. The condition for the left edge is that the first lantern (at 2) must cover 0, so d>=2. The gap condition is d>=1.5, and the right edge condition is 0. Therefore, we need d>=2.\n\n   But wait: the gap condition is for the gap between the two lanterns, and the left edge condition is independent.\n\n   The entire street must be covered by the union of the lanterns. The left edge condition is necessary because the first lantern must cover from 0 to 2. The gap condition is for the gap between 2 and 5, which is 3 units, requiring d>=1.5. However, the left edge condition is more strict (d>=2). Therefore, the minimal d is 2.\n\n   So the code:\n\n   Steps:\n      n, l = map(int, input().split())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      a.sort()\n\n      candidates = []\n\n      # Left edge: from 0 to the first lantern\n      candidates.append(a[0])\n\n      # Right edge: from the last lantern to l\n      candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n\n      # Middle gaps\n      for i in range(len(a)-1):\n          gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n          candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n      ans = max(candidates)\n\n   However, wait: the left edge condition is that d must be at least a[0] (the first lantern's position) because the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. Similarly, the right edge condition is that d must be at least (l - a[-1]). And the gaps require d at least (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n   But note: in the example with two lanterns at [2,5] and l=5, the left edge condition is 2, which is greater than the gap condition 1.5, so the maximum is 2.\n\n   However, consider a case where the left edge condition is not the maximum, but the gap condition is. For example: n=2, l=10, a=[1,9]. \n        Left edge: d>=1\n        Right edge: d>=10-9=1\n        Gap: (9-1)/2=4\n        Then d>=4.\n\n   Check: with d=4, \n        First lantern at 1: [1-4, 1+4] = [-3,5]\n        Second lantern at 9: [5,13]\n        The entire street [0,10] is covered? \n            From 0 to 5: covered by the first lantern (since 0>=-3 and 0<=5, and 10 is 10 which is <=13 and >=5? Actually, 10 is covered by the second lantern? The second lantern covers [5,13] so 10 is in [5,13]. But what about the point 5? It is covered by both. The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm returns 4, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: the condition for the left edge is d>=1, but 4>=1 is true. The condition for the right edge is d>=1, and 4>=1 is true. The gap condition is d>=4, so the minimal d is 4.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n   candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n   for i in range(len(a)-1):\n        candidates.append((a[i+1]-a[i])/2.0)\n\n   print(\"{:.9f}\".format(max(candidates)))\n\n   However, note: the problem says the answer must have absolute or relative error <= 1e-9. Using float formatting to 9 decimal places should be safe.\n\n   But wait: what if the maximum candidate is negative? The problem constraints say n>=1, l>=1, and ai in [0,l]. So the left edge candidate is non-negative (a[0]>=0), the right edge candidate is non-negative (l>=a[-1]), and the gaps are non-negative (a[i+1]>=a[i]). So no negative.\n\n   However, let's run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" -> [0,3,5,7,9,14,15] -> max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> output \"2.500000000\"\n\n   Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> [2,5] -> max(2,0,1.5) = 2 -> output \"2.000000000\"\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street from `0` to `l` are covered by the lanterns. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` on either side of its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to ensure that every segment of the street from `0` to `l` is covered by at least one lantern's light. The key observation is that the entire street must be covered by the union of the intervals `[a_i - d, a_i + d]` for all lantern positions `a_i`. \n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left Edge Coverage**: The leftmost point `0` must be covered by the first lantern (the one with the smallest position). This requires that the lantern's light extends at least to `0`, so `d` must be at least the position of the first lantern.\n   - **Right Edge Coverage**: Similarly, the rightmost point `l` must be covered by the last lantern (the one with the largest position). This requires `d` to be at least `(l - last_lantern_position)`.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: Between any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. For two lanterns at positions `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the minimal `d` required to cover the gap is `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Sorting the lantern positions to easily access the first and last positions and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - Calculating three candidate values for `d`: the left edge requirement, the right edge requirement, and the maximum gap requirement between any two consecutive lanterns.\n   - The minimal `d` that covers the entire street is the maximum of these three candidates.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\ncandidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\nfor i in range(len(a) - 1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\nans = max(candidates)\nprint(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`, followed by the positions of the `n` lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate processing the leftmost and rightmost positions and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - The first candidate is the position of the first lantern, ensuring the left edge (`0`) is covered.\n   - The second candidate is `(l - last_lantern_position)`, ensuring the right edge (`l`) is covered.\n   - For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is divided by 2 to determine the minimal `d` needed to cover the gap between them.\n4. **Result Determination**: The maximum value among all candidates gives the minimal `d` required to light the entire street. The result is printed with a precision of 9 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to ensure complete coverage of the street by the lanterns' light, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to derive the solution.",
