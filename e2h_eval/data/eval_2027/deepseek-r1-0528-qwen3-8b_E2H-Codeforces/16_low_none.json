Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two points: home (x1, y1) and university (x2, y2), and n lines (each with a, b, c) that define the roads.\n\n The key observation: \n We are only allowed to move from one block to another if they share a nonzero length border. This is equivalent to moving across an intersection of two or more roads? Actually, note: the roads divide the plane into blocks. The movement condition is that the common border is nonzero. This means that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by a single road? Actually, no: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n But note: the common border between two blocks is a segment of a road? Actually, the roads are infinite lines. The plane is divided by n lines. The boundaries between blocks are parts of these lines. Two blocks are adjacent if they share a portion of a road (which is an open segment). However, the problem states: \"if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it is not allowed to move in one step\".\n\n In fact, the movement is allowed only when the two blocks share an entire open segment (i.e., part of a road) of positive length. This is the same as saying: two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road? Actually, no: because multiple roads might separate two blocks. \n\n However, note: the problem is about crossing from one block to another by stepping over a road? Actually, the movement condition is defined by having a nonzero common border. So two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by a single road? Not necessarily: consider three roads. Actually, the standard planar graph division by lines: each line adds edges (segments) that separate the regions. But note: two blocks may be separated by more than one road? Actually, no: because the blocks are defined by the arrangement of lines. The adjacency is defined by being separated by a single road.\n\n Explanation: \n When you are in a block, to move to an adjacent block, you must cross one road (exactly one road). However, the problem does not require that we count the number of roads crossed, but the minimum number of steps (where a step is moving from one block to an adjacent block). \n\n But note: the problem does not require crossing roads one by one. Actually, the steps are defined as moving from one block to another (adjacent by a nonzero border). Each such step crosses one road. Therefore, the entire journey from home to university will involve crossing a set of roads. However, the catch: we are allowed to take a step that crosses one road at a time.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we cross each road at most once? Actually, the roads are fixed and the blocks are fixed. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross? But wait: we cannot necessarily cross any road independently. The minimal steps might be the number of roads that separate the two points? However, note: sometimes we can cross multiple roads at the same time (if two roads meet at a point, then crossing one road and then the other might be considered two steps, but what if we cross two roads at the same time? Then we would be stepping from a block that is on the same side of both roads to a block that is on the opposite side for both? Actually, no: the movement condition is that we must have a nonzero common border. Crossing two roads at the same time is not allowed because the common border would be a single point (the intersection) which has zero length.\n\n Therefore, each step must cross exactly one road. And the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads we must cross to get from home to university.\n\n However, wait: is that always true? Consider: if we cross one road, we go from one side of that road to the other. To get from home to university, we must end up on the correct side of every road that separates them. But note: the two points (home and university) are either on the same side or opposite sides of a given road.\n\n For a given road i: \n   Let f_i(x,y) = a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i.\n   Then, the two points have values:\n        d1_i = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i\n        d2_i = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i\n\n   If d1_i and d2_i have the same sign (or zero, but guaranteed they don't lie on the road) then the road doesn't separate the two points.\n\n   If they have opposite signs, then the road separates the two points.\n\n Now, note: the minimal steps (crossing roads) is the number of roads that separate the two points? But wait",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (i.e., moving from one block to an adjacent block sharing a nonzero boundary segment). The key insight is that each road separating the two points must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of such roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home point from the university point. Each road is defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). For each road, we determine if the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides of the road. \n2. **Key Insight**: If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to reach the university. The minimal number of steps required is simply the count of such roads.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, increment the step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0) or (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, it calculates the value of the line equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Determining Separation**: If the signs of these values differ, the road separates the two points, and a step count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads gives the minimal steps needed, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the solution. The algorithm is optimal with linear time complexity relative to the number of roads.",
