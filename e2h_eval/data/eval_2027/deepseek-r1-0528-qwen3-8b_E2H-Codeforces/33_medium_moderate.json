You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements.

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to use each element in s at most once, and we can choose arbitrary positions to replace.\n Since we want the maximum value, we should try to replace digits from left to right (because a digit in a more significant position has more impact).\n However, note: we cannot introduce leading zeros. So if we have a number that starts with a non-zero digit, we must be cautious.\n\n Approach:\n 1. We are given two strings: the first is the number 'a' (without spaces) and the second is the sequence 's'.\n 2. We are allowed to use each digit in 's' at most once, and we can choose which positions to replace arbitrarily (each replacement uses one occurrence of a digit from s).\n\n Observation:\n Since we want the maximum number, we would prefer to use the largest available digits from s as early as possible, but note:\n - We cannot put a zero at the beginning (unless the number is zero, but the problem states no leading zeroes and the input doesn't have leading zeroes).\n\n However, we are not forced to use all operations. We can choose any subset.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can sort the sequence s in descending order (so we have the biggest digits first) but note: we are going to assign from left to right.\n\n But wait: we don't necessarily need to use the biggest digit for the first position. Consider: \n   Example: a = \"1024\", s = \"010\"\n   Possibilities: \n        Operation 1: replace the first digit with '1' -> but that doesn't change the number? \n        But note: we have two zeros. However, we can use at most one per operation.\n\n However, the example output for ['1024\\n010'] is '1124'. How?\n   We can replace the first digit: originally '1', and we have a '1' in s? Actually, s='010' has one '1'? No, wait: the example input is given as two examples.\n\n Let me clarify the example: \n   Example 1: Input \"1024\" and \"010\" -> Output \"1124\"\n\n Explanation: \n   We can use two operations (the sequence s has three digits). We are allowed to use each element at most once, so we can choose two of them.\n\n   The idea: \n   - We have two zeros and one '1'. We can use the '1' to replace the first digit: then we get '1' (same) and then we can use a zero to replace the next digit? \n     But replacing the second digit (which is 0) with 0 doesn't change. Alternatively, we can use the zero to replace the third digit (which is 2) -> becomes 1, then 0, then 4 -> wait that gives 1004 which is less.\n\n   Actually, the example output is \"1124\". How?\n   They replaced the first digit: originally '1' becomes '1' (no change) and then they replaced the second digit (which is 0) with nothing? Or wait, maybe they used two zeros? \n\n   Let me read the example again: \n        Input: \n            First line: '1024'\n            Second line: '010'\n\n        Output: '1124'\n\n   Steps: \n        Operation 1: Replace the first digit (which is 1) with the digit '1' (from s) -> no change, but then Operation 2: Replace the second digit (which is 0) with the digit '1' (from s)? But wait, s only has two zeros and one '1'. \n\n   Actually, the example input says the second line is \"010\", meaning the digits are ['0','1','0'].\n\n   But note: the problem says \"each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation\". So we have three elements.\n\n   We can choose two operations: \n        Operation 1: replace the first digit with the largest available digit that is at least as big as the current digit? Not necessarily: we want maximum value.\n\n   Alternate approach: we can use greedy matching from left to right.\n\n   We want to assign the largest available digit from s that is greater than the current digit at that position, but if there's no digit greater, then we can use a digit equal to the current one (if we have to, but wait: sometimes we might want to save a larger digit for later? Actually, we are going to process from left to right and we want the entire number to be as large as possible.\n\n   However, consider: \n        We have a fixed multiset of digits in s. We can use at most one per position, but we can skip some.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit in s.\n\n   But note: the operations are independent and we can choose any positions arbitrarily. However, the catch is: we can only use each digit once.\n\n   We are going to try to improve the number from left to right.\n\n   For each position i (from left to right) in the number a (index 0 to n-1):\n        We look at the current digit d = a[i]\n        We want to see if we have any digit in s that is greater than d. If yes, we use the largest such digit and remove it from our multiset. Then we set that position to that digit.\n\n        But what if we don't have any digit greater than d? Then we can leave it as is, or if we have a digit equal to d, we can use it to keep the same? However, wait: if we use an equal digit, then we are not improving, but we might be using up a digit that could be used elsewhere? Actually, no: because if we don't use it here, we might use it later to replace a digit that is smaller. But note: we are going from left to right, and we want the leftmost digits to be as large as possible.\n\n        However, consider: \n            a = \"123\", s = \"321\"\n            We want to maximize the number. \n            At the first digit: \n                current digit is '1'. In s we have digits: ['3','2','1']\n                The largest digit in s that is > '1' is '3'. So we use '3' at the first digit -> then we have the remaining s = ['2','1'] and the rest of the number is \"23\".\n                Now the number becomes \"323\". \n            Alternatively, if we don't use the '3' at the first digit, then we could use the '3' at the second digit? But that would give \"133\", which is less than \"323\".\n\n        So the plan: \n            We want to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit, and if there is none, then we use the same digit (if we have one) but wait: actually, using the same digit doesn't harm, but we might be able to use a digit that is the same for a later position? \n\n        However, let's think: \n            Example: a = \"199\", s = \"987\"\n            We have three digits: 9,8,7.\n            First digit: current '1'. We can replace with 9 -> then we have two digits left: 8,7 and the rest is \"99\". Then the number becomes \"999\", which is the maximum.\n\n        But now consider: a = \"199\", s = \"987\" but if we don't use the 9 at the first digit, then we can use 9 at the second digit: \n            First digit: leave as 1, then second digit: replace 9 with 9 -> no change, then third digit: replace 9 with 9 -> no change. That gives \"199\", which is worse.\n\n        However, what if we have multiple same digits? \n            Example: a = \"199\", s = \"999\" -> then we can replace the first digit with 9, then the number becomes \"999\".\n\n        But wait: what if we have a = \"199\", s = \"999\", but we don't use the first 9? Then we can use the two 9s for the two 9s in the original number? That doesn't help.\n\n        So the greedy from left to right with the largest available digit that is greater than the current one is correct.\n\n        However, what if we have: a = \"123\", s = \"321\" (same as above) -> we use the 3 for the first digit and get \"323\". But wait, what if we use the 3 for the second digit? Then we would have \"133\", which is less than \"323\". So we want to use the 3 at the first digit.\n\n        But now consider: a = \"123\", s = \"123456\" (many digits). We want to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one, but if we have multiple, we use the largest one.\n\n        However, there is a catch: we are allowed to use each digit only once, and we have a multiset.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        Let a_str = string of the number a (without spaces)\n        Let s_str = string of the sequence s\n\n        Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit in s_str.\n\n        Step 2: Traverse the digits of a_str from left to right.\n\n        For each digit d in a_str:\n            We want to find the smallest digit in s that is greater than d, because we want to use the minimal necessary improvement? Actually, we want the maximum overall number.\n\n            However, note: we are going to use the best available digit that is greater than d. But if there are multiple, we want to use the largest one? Because we are trying to maximize the entire number.\n\n            But wait: if we use a larger digit at the current position, then we free up the smaller ones for the subsequent positions. And since the subsequent positions are less significant, having a larger digit now is better than saving a larger digit for the future? \n\n            Example: \n                a = \"123\", s = \"4321\"\n                Option 1: Use the largest digit (4) at the first position: then we get \"423\", and then we can use 3 for the second? But wait, we already used 4. Then we have 3,2,1. Then the second digit: we can use 3 (since 2<3) -> \"433\", then third: use 2? -> \"433\" vs \"432\" -> same as if we didn't use the 3 at the second.\n\n            Actually, we don't care about the future: we are going to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one, because we want the current digit to be as high as possible.\n\n            However, what if by using a very large digit at the current position, we lose the opportunity to use it for a more significant position? But we are processing from left to right, so the current position is the most significant available.\n\n            Therefore, we should use the largest digit that is greater than d (if exists) to maximize the current digit.\n\n            But wait: consider two possibilities for the same digit in s: \n                Example: a = \"123\", s = \"999\"\n                We have three 9s. \n                We can use one 9 for the first digit -> \"923\", then two 9s left. Then the second digit: we can replace 2 with 9 -> \"993\", then third: 3->9 -> \"999\". \n                But if we use the 9s from largest to smallest, we use the largest available.\n\n            However, what if we have: a = \"123\", s = \"919\"\n                Possibilities:\n                    Option 1: Use the first 9 for the first digit: then we get \"923\", then we have the remaining digits \"19\". Then for the second digit: we can use 9 (but wait, we already used one 9, so we have one 9 left? Actually, we have two 9s? No: the s was \"919\", so we have two 9s and one 1. After using one 9, we have one 9 and one 1. Then for the second digit: we can use 9 (since 2 < 9) -> \"993\", then the last digit: we have 1, and 3>1, so we don't use anything -> \"993\".\n\n                But wait, what if we use the 9 at the second digit first? Then we would have: \n                    First digit: use 1? -> but 1 is less than 1? no. Actually, we have two 9s and one 1. For the first digit, we can use 9. Then we use the other 9 at the second digit. Then the third digit: we have 1, which is less than 3, so we don't use it.\n\n                The result is the same: \"993\".\n\n            However, consider: a = \"123\", s = \"991\"\n                Same as above.\n\n            But consider: a = \"123\", s = \"989\"\n                Possibilities:\n                    We have two 9s and one 8.\n                    Option 1: Use the first 9 for the first digit: then we get \"923\", then we have one 9 and one 8. Then for the second digit: we can use 9 -> \"993\", then third digit: we have 8, but 3>8? No, so we don't use it. Result: \"993\".\n                    Option 2: Use the 8 for the first digit? -> 8 is less than 9, so we wouldn't do that.\n\n            So the algorithm is:\n\n            We'll maintain a multiset (or sorted list) of the digits in s, but we want to quickly get the largest digit that is greater than the current one.\n\n            However, note: we are going to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one. But if there are multiple, we use the largest. Why largest? Because we want the current digit to be as high as possible.\n\n            But wait: what if we use a very large digit at the current position and then we don't have a digit to use at a later position that requires a large digit? Actually, we are going to process from left to right and we want the entire number to be as large as possible.\n\n            However, consider: \n                a = \"129\", s = \"999\"\n                We have three 9s.\n                We want to replace the first digit: we can use 9 -> then the number becomes \"929\", then we can use the remaining two 9s to replace the second and third digits: \n                    Second digit: 2 -> 9 (because 9>2) -> becomes \"999\"\n                    Third digit: 9 -> 9 (we don't need to, but we can use the last 9 to make it 9, but it's already 9) -> \"999\"\n\n            But if we had: a = \"129\", s = \"988\"\n                We have two 8s and one 9.\n                First digit: use 9 -> then the rest is \"88\". Then the second digit: 2 -> 8 (since 8>2) -> \"989\", then the third digit: 9 -> we don't have a digit greater than 9? We have 8, which is less, so we leave it -> \"989\".\n\n            This is the maximum.\n\n            However, what if we use the 8s first? \n                First digit: 1 -> we can use 9 (largest available) so we use 9. Then the rest is 88.\n\n            So the algorithm is:\n\n            Step 1: Count the digits in s (as a frequency map or as a sorted list)\n\n            We can use a frequency array for digits from '0' to '9'. Then we can traverse the digits of a from left to right.\n\n            For each digit d in a:\n                We try to find the largest digit available (from '9' down to d+1) that is present. But wait: we want the largest digit that is greater than d. \n\n            However, we are constrained by the available digits.\n\n            We can do:\n\n            Let freq be an array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) counting the frequency in s.\n\n            Then for each position i (from 0 to n-1) in a:\n                Let current_digit = int(a[i])\n                We want to see if there is a digit x (from 9 down to current_digit+1) that has freq[x] > 0.\n\n                If we find one, then we take the largest one (which is the first we find when going from 9 down to current_digit+1) and set the current digit to that digit, and decrease the frequency of that digit by one.\n\n                Otherwise, we leave the current digit as is.\n\n            But wait: what if we have a digit equal to the current_digit? We don't use it because we are only looking for digits greater than current_digit. However, we might want to use a digit equal to the current_digit if we have a larger digit available? \n\n            Actually, no: because if we have a larger digit, we should use it. But if we don't have a larger digit, then we can leave the digit as is. However, what if we have a digit equal to the current_digit? We can use it to replace the current_digit without changing the value, but then we are using a digit that might be useful for a later position? \n\n            Example: a = \"123\", s = \"222\"\n                We have three 2s. \n                First digit: current_digit=1. We can replace with 2 (since 2>1). Then the number becomes \"223\", and we have two 2s left. Then the second digit: 2, we don't need to replace (since 2==2). Then the third digit: 3, we don't have a digit greater than 3, so we leave it. Result: \"223\".\n\n            But what if we don't use a 2 at the first digit? Then we can use the two 2s at the second and third digits? \n                Original: \"123\"\n                First digit: leave as 1 -> then second digit: 2 -> we can replace with 2 (no change) -> then third digit: 3 -> no change. Result: \"123\", which is worse.\n\n            So we should use the 2 at the first digit.\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily. We are not forced to use a digit if we don't want to. But in this case, using a digit that is greater than the current one is beneficial. \n\n            But consider: a = \"123\", s = \"111\"\n                We have three 1s. \n                First digit: 1 -> we can replace with 1? But that doesn't change the value. However, if we do that, then we have two 1s left. Then the second digit: 2 -> we don't have a digit greater than 2 (we have 1s), so we leave it. Then the third digit: 3 -> same. Result: \"123\".\n\n                Alternatively, we can skip the first digit and use the 1s for the second and third? But that doesn't help because 1 is less than 2 and 3. \n\n            So the rule: only use a digit from s if it is strictly greater than the current digit? \n\n            However, wait: what if we have a = \"123\", s = \"222\", and we use one 2 for the first digit (to make it 2) and then we have two 2s for the second and third? The second digit is 2, so we don't need to use a 2 (leaving the 2) and the third digit is 3, so we don't use. Then we have two 2s unused. But that's okay.\n\n            But what if we have a = \"123\", s = \"333\"? \n                First digit: 1 -> we can use 3 (greater) -> becomes \"323\", then we have two 3s. Then second digit: 2 -> we can use 3 (greater) -> \"333\", then third digit: 3 -> no change. Result: \"333\".\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n            We'll create an array `freq` for digits 0 to 9.\n\n            Steps:\n                Read the two lines.\n\n                Let a_str = first line, s_str = second line.\n\n                Build freq for s_str: \n                    freq = [0]*10\n                    for char in s_str:\n                        digit = int(char)\n                        freq[digit] += 1\n\n                Then, we traverse each digit in a_str:\n\n                For each character c in a_str:\n                    d = int(c)\n                    # We want to try to replace d with a digit from 9 down to d+1 (if available)\n                    found = False\n                    for candidate in range(d+1, 10):\n                        if freq[candidate] > 0:\n                            # Use one occurrence of candidate\n                            freq[candidate] -= 1\n                            # We set the current digit to candidate (as a character) and break\n                            # But note: we are building a new string. We can't modify the original string easily, so we will build a list of characters and then join.\n\n                    If we don't find any candidate, then we leave the digit as is.\n\n            However, this approach uses a loop from d+1 to 9 for each digit. Since d+1 to 9 is at most 10 iterations, and the length of a_str can be up to 10^5, the total operations would be 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n            But wait: what if we have many digits that are the same and we are going to use many replacements? \n\n            However, note: we are only allowed to use each digit once. The frequency array will account for that.\n\n            But there is a catch: what if we have a digit that is the same as the current one? We are not using it. But sometimes we might want to use a digit that is the same as the current one if we are going to get stuck later? \n\n            Example: a = \"199\", s = \"999\"\n                Without using the same digit, we use the 9s for the first digit and then the next two digits. But if we use a 9 for the first digit, then we have two 9s left. Then for the second digit: we have 9 (current) and we can use a 9 (same) but that doesn't help. However, the algorithm above only replaces if the candidate is greater.\n\n            But consider: a = \"19\", s = \"99\"\n                We want to replace the first digit (1) with 9 -> then the second digit is 9, and we have one 9 left. Then we can use the 9 for the second digit? But wait, the second digit is 9, and we are not forced to replace if the candidate is greater. We can also leave it. So the result is \"99\", which is the maximum.\n\n            But what if we have: a = \"19\", s = \"88\"\n                Then we cannot replace the first digit because 8<9? Actually, 8 is less than 9, so we don't use it. Then the first digit remains 1, and the second digit is 9, which we cannot change because 8<9. So the result is \"19\".\n\n            However, consider: a = \"19\", s = \"98\"\n                We have one 9 and one 8.\n                For the first digit: we can use 9 (since 9>1) -> then the second digit: we have 8, and the current digit is 9 -> we cannot use 8 (because 8<9) so we leave it. Result: \"99\".\n\n            But wait, what if we use the 8 for the first digit? That would be worse because 8<9, so we wouldn't do that.\n\n            However, what if we have: a = \"19\", s = \"89\"\n                Then we have one 8 and one 9.\n                We can use the 9 for the first digit -> then the second digit: 9, and we have 8 -> no change. Result: \"99\".\n                Or we can use the 8 for the first digit? Then we get \"89\", which is worse.\n\n            But what if we have: a = \"19\", s = \"89\", and we are allowed to choose the order? We are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily (any position). So we can choose the best one.\n\n            Our algorithm: for the first digit, we look for the largest digit greater than 1 (which is 9). We use 9. Then we are done.\n\n            Now, what if we have a = \"19\", s = \"99\", and we are allowed to use both 9s? Then we use one for the first digit and one for the second. But the second digit is 9, so we don't need to use the second 9 because 9==9. However, we can use it if we want? But using it doesn't change the value.\n\n            But note: the problem says we can perform a series of replacements. We are allowed to use not all elements. So we don't have to use the second 9.\n\n            However, the problem does not require us to use all elements. So leaving the second digit as 9 is acceptable.\n\n            But wait: what if we have a = \"19\", s = \"99\", and we use the two 9s? Then we get \"99\", which is the same as using only one.\n\n            So the algorithm above is:\n\n                For each digit in a_str (from left to right):\n                    d = int(c)\n                    for x from d+1 to 9:\n                        if freq[x] > 0:\n                            use x, update freq[x] -= 1\n                            break out of the inner loop.\n\n            But wait: what if we have a = \"123\", s = \"9876543210\", and we want to replace the first digit with 9, then the second digit with 8, etc.?\n\n            Example: \n                a = \"123\", s = \"9876543210\"\n                First digit: 1 -> use 9 -> then a becomes \"923\", and s becomes \"876543210\"\n                Second digit: 2 -> use 8 -> then a becomes \"983\", and s becomes \"76543210\"\n                Third digit: 3 -> use 7 -> then a becomes \"987\"\n\n            But wait, we have to use the largest available digit that is greater than the current one. However, the largest available digit that is greater than 1 is 9, which we used. Then the largest available digit that is greater than 2 is 8, then the largest available digit that is greater than 3 is 7.\n\n            This produces \"987\", which is the maximum.\n\n            However, what if we have a = \"123\", s = \"9999999999\" (ten 9s)? Then we can replace every digit with 9, getting \"999\".\n\n            But note: we cannot change a digit to a digit that is not in s. And we cannot use the same digit twice. But wait, we have ten 9s, so we can use one 9 per digit.\n\n            However, the algorithm above uses the first candidate from 9 down to d+1. But note: we are iterating from d+1 to 9, and we take the first candidate we find (which is the largest candidate from 9 down to d+1). But wait, we iterate from d+1 to 9, so we are going from low to high? Actually, no: we iterate from d+1 to 9, so we start at d+1 and go to 9. That means we are checking from the smallest candidate above d to the largest. But we want the largest candidate.\n\n            Correction: we should iterate from 9 down to d+1.\n\n            Example: \n                a = \"123\", s = \"9876543210\"\n                First digit: d=1, we iterate from 2 to 9: the first candidate we find is 9 (if we iterate from 9 down to 2) but wait, we are iterating from d+1 to 9 (which is 2 to 9) so we start at 2 and go to 9. We will find 9 at the end. But we want to use the largest candidate (which is 9) and not the smallest (which is 2). \n\n            So we should reverse the iteration: from 9 down to d+1.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate from 9 down to d+1 and break at the first available.\n\n            Let me fix the inner loop:\n\n            for candidate in range(9, d, -1):   # from 9 down to d+1 (since d is included as the lower bound, but we stop at d+1? Actually, we want to check from 9 down to d+1.\n\n            But note: the range in Python for range(9, d, -1) goes from 9 down to d+1 (exclusive of d). So we want to check from 9 down to d+1.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            candidate_found = None\n            for digit_val in range(9, d, -1):\n                if freq[digit_val] > 0:\n                    candidate_found = digit_val\n                    break\n\n            Then if candidate_found is not None, use it.\n\n            But note: the above loop goes from 9 down to d+1 (because the step is -1 and the stop condition is d, so it stops at d+1).\n\n            Example: d=1 -> we check 9,8,...,2.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            However, we must note: if we have multiple candidates, we want the largest one (which is the first one we find when going from 9 downwards).\n\n            So the corrected algorithm:\n\n            Read a_str and s_str.\n\n            freq = [0]*10\n            for char in s_str:\n                digit = int(char)\n                freq[digit] += 1\n\n            result_chars = []\n            for c in a_str:\n                d = int(c)\n                candidate_found = None\n                # Check from 9 down to d+1\n                for x in range(9, d, -1):\n                    if freq[x] > 0:\n                        candidate_found = x\n                        break\n\n                if candidate_found is not None:\n                    # Use this candidate\n                    result_chars.append(str(candidate_found))\n                    freq[candidate_found] -= 1\n                else:\n                    # No candidate found, so we use the original digit\n                    result_chars.append(c)\n\n            Then print ''.join(result_chars)\n\n            But wait: what if we have a digit that is the same as the current one? We are not using it. However, we are allowed to use the same digit? \n\n            But note: the problem says we can replace the digit with sj. The same digit is allowed? Yes, but we are only replacing if the candidate is greater. \n\n            However, consider: what if we have a = \"19\", s = \"11\" (two ones). Then we can replace the first digit with 1 (same) and then the second digit with 1 (same). But that doesn't change the number. \n\n            But wait: the problem says we can perform replacements arbitrarily. However, we are allowed to use each element at most once. \n\n            The issue: if we use a digit that is the same, then we are effectively wasting a replacement that could be used elsewhere. \n\n            Example: a = \"19\", s = \"11\"\n                Option 1: Use one 1 for the first digit: then the number becomes \"19\" (unchanged) and we have one 1 left. Then we can use the second 1 for the second digit: but the second digit is 9, and 1 is less than 9, so we don't use it. Result: \"19\".\n\n                Option 2: Skip the first digit and use the two 1s for the second digit? But the second digit is 9, and 1<9, so we don't use them. Result: \"19\".\n\n            So using the same digit doesn't help.\n\n            But what if we have a = \"19\", s = \"91\" (one 9 and one 1). Then we use the 9 for the first digit -> \"99\", which is better.\n\n            So the algorithm is correct: we only use a digit if it is strictly greater.\n\n            However, there is a catch: sometimes we might want to use a digit that is the same to reserve a larger digit for a more significant position? \n\n            Example: \n                a = \"129\", s = \"19\"\n                We have one 1 and one 9.\n                Option 1: Use the 9 for the first digit: then the number becomes \"929\", and we have one 1 left. Then for the second digit: 2 -> we don't have a digit greater than 2 (only 1) -> leave it. Then the third digit: 9 -> leave it. Result: \"929\".\n                Option 2: Use the 1 for the first digit (even though 1==1) to save the 9 for the second digit? Then the first digit becomes 1 (same) and then we use the 9 for the second digit: then the number becomes \"199\", which is greater than \"929\"? \n                    Compare: 199 vs 929 -> 929 is greater.\n\n            So Option 1 is better.\n\n            But wait, what if we have: a = \"129\", s = \"991\" (two 9s and one 1). Then we have two 9s. \n                Option 1: Use the first 9 for the first digit: then we have one 9 and one 1. Then the second digit: 2 -> we can use 9 -> becomes \"999\", then the third digit: 9 -> no change. Result: \"999\".\n                Option 2: Use the 1 for the first digit: then we have two 9s. Then the second digit: 2 -> use 9 -> \"199\", then the third digit: 9 -> no change. Result: \"199\", which is worse.\n\n            So the algorithm above (using the largest available digit that is strictly greater) is correct.\n\n            But wait: what if we have a = \"123\", s = \"132\" (one 1, one 3, one 2). \n                Option: \n                    First digit: 1 -> we can use 3 (largest candidate) -> then the number becomes \"323\", and we have one 1 and one 2 left. Then the second digit: 2 -> we can use 2? no, because we are only using digits strictly greater. But wait, we have a 2. However, 2 is not greater than 2. Then we leave it. Then the third digit: 3 -> no candidate. Result: \"323\".\n\n                Alternatively, if we use the 2 for the first digit? Then we get \"223\", then we have 1 and 3. Then the second digit: 2 -> we can use 3 (greater) -> \"233\", then the third digit: 3 -> no. Result: \"233\", which is less than \"323\".\n\n            But wait, the algorithm above uses the largest candidate (which is 3) for the first digit. So it produces \"323\".\n\n            However, what if we don't use the 3 for the first digit? Then we can use the 3 for the second digit? \n                First digit: use the 2 (which is greater than 1) -> then the number becomes \"223\", and then the second digit: use 3 -> \"233\", and then the third digit: 3 -> no. Result: \"233\".\n\n            But \"323\" is greater than \"233\", so the algorithm's choice is better.\n\n            However, what if we have a = \"123\", s = \"231\" (same multiset: one 2, one 3, one 1). Then the algorithm:\n                First digit: 1 -> we can use 3 (largest candidate) -> then the number becomes \"323\", and the rest of s is \"21\". Then the second digit: 2 -> we can use 2? no (because 2==2) -> leave it. Then the third digit: 3 -> no. Result: \"323\".\n\n            But wait, what if we use the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by performing a series of digit replacements using digits from a provided sequence. Each digit in the sequence can be used at most once, and we can choose any position in the original number to replace. The goal is to make the number as large as possible by strategically using the available digits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to replace digits in the original number with digits from the sequence such that the resulting number is maximized. The key observation is that replacing a digit in a more significant position (leftmost) with a larger digit has a greater impact on the overall value of the number. Therefore, we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits first with the largest possible digits from the sequence.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each digit in the original number, starting from the left, we look for the largest digit in the sequence that is greater than the current digit. If found, we replace the current digit with this larger digit and remove one occurrence of it from the sequence. This ensures that each replacement contributes maximally to increasing the number's value.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a frequency array to keep track of the available digits in the sequence. This allows efficient checking and updating of digit counts. We iterate through each digit of the original number from left to right. For each digit, we check from the largest digit down to the next digit above the current one to find a suitable replacement. If found, we replace the digit and decrement its count in the frequency array.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit of the original number once (O(n) where n is the length of the number). For each digit, it checks up to 9 possible digits (from 9 down to the current digit + 1), leading to an overall time complexity of O(9 * n) which simplifies to O(n) since 9 is a constant. The space complexity is O(1) for the frequency array (fixed size 10 for digits 0-9).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    freq = [0] * 10\n    for char in s_str:\n        digit = int(char)\n        freq[digit] += 1\n            \n    result_chars = []\n    for c in a_str:\n        d = int(c)\n        candidate_found = None\n        for x in range(9, d, -1):\n            if freq[x] > 0:\n                candidate_found = x\n                break\n                \n        if candidate_found is not None:\n            result_chars.append(str(candidate_found))\n            freq[candidate_found] -= 1\n        else:\n            result_chars.append(c)\n            \n    print(''.join(result_chars))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the original number and the sequence of digits from standard input.\n2. **Frequency Array Initialization**: A frequency array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) is initialized to zero. This array is populated by counting each digit in the sequence.\n3. **Processing Each Digit**: For each digit in the original number, the code checks from the largest digit (9) down to the digit immediately greater than the current digit. If a larger digit is found in the sequence, it is used to replace the current digit, and its count in the frequency array is decremented.\n4. **Result Construction**: The modified digits are collected into a result list, which is then joined into a string and printed as the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number's value by leveraging a greedy strategy, ensuring the most significant digits are replaced first with the largest available digits from the sequence.",
