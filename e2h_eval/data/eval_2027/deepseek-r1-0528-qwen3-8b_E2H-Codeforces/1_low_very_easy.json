The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We have k rings. The first ring goes along the edge, the second 2 cells away, etc.\n\n For the i-th ring (starting from i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n But note: the ring is the border of this inner rectangle, and it has a width of 1 cell.\n\n The number of cells in the i-th ring is the perimeter of the inner rectangle, but note that the corners are counted once and the formula for the perimeter of an a x b rectangle is 2*a + 2*b, however, we must account for the fact that the ring is 1 cell wide and the entire border is included.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \"each ring has a width of 1 cell\", meaning that for the inner rectangle of size a x b, the ring consists of:\n   top row: a cells\n   bottom row: a cells\n   left and right columns: but without the corners (already counted) so each side is (b-2) cells.\n\n Actually, we can compute the number of cells for a ring as:\n   If the current inner rectangle has dimensions a x b, then the ring (the border) has:\n     total = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because the four corners are counted twice if we do 2a+2b]\n\n But wait, let's break it down:\n   Without corners, we would have:\n     top: a\n     bottom: a\n     left: (b-2)   [excluding the two corners already in top and bottom]\n     right: (b-2)\n\n   So total = a + a + (b-2) + (b-2) = 2a + 2b - 4.\n\n Alternatively, the entire border of an a x b grid is 2a+2b-4? Actually, the standard way to compute the border (without subtracting) is: \n   The top and bottom: 2a\n   The sides: 2*(b-2) because the top and bottom rows are already accounted for.\n\n So indeed: 2a + 2*(b-2) = 2a + 2b - 4.\n\n But note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate. So for the first ring, the inner rectangle is w x h (so a=w, b=h). Then the number of cells for the first ring is 2*w + 2*h - 4.\n\n However, we are only drawing k rings. We must stop when the next ring would require a negative dimension (but the input constraint ensures k is such that the rings are valid).\n\n Steps:\n   Read w, h, k.\n   We'll consider the rings from i=0 to i=k-1 (0-indexed). For the i-th ring (0-indexed), the inner rectangle has:\n        a_i = w - 4*i\n        b_i = h - 4*i\n\n   But note: the condition for having a ring is that the inner rectangle must be at least 1x1 (so that the ring exists). The problem states k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we don't have to worry about negative or zero.\n\n   Then the number of cells for the i-th ring (0-indexed) is:\n        cells_i = 2 * a_i + 2 * b_i - 4   [if a_i>=1 and b_i>=1 and the ring is drawn]\n\n   However, note: the problem says the first ring goes along the edge, which is the outermost. The second one is 2 cells away, so we subtract 4*(i) for the i-th ring (0-indexed).\n\n   But wait: the example: \n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> Output: 8.\n\n        For i=0: \n            a0 = 3, b0 = 3\n            cells0 = 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6 + 6 - 4 = 8. -> matches.\n\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n            a0 = 7, b0 = 9\n            cells0 = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28 -> matches.\n\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n            First ring (i=0): 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 28.\n            Second ring (i=1): \n                a1 = 7 - 4*1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate after adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed inside the previous one, starting from the edge of the plate. The first ring goes along the outer edge, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that each ring corresponds to the border of a rectangle that is progressively smaller by 4 cells in both dimensions (2 cells on each side) for each subsequent ring. The number of cells in each ring is calculated using the formula for the perimeter of the inner rectangle minus the corners, which are counted twice. Specifically, for an inner rectangle of size \\(a \\times b\\), the number of cells in the ring is \\(2a + 2b - 4\\).\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 0 to \\(k-1\\) (0-indexed), compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle as \\(w - 4i\\) and \\(h - 4i\\). Then, apply the perimeter formula to find the number of cells for that ring. Summing these values gives the total number of gilded cells.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(k\\) rings exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(k)\\), which is efficient given the constraints \\(k \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\) and \\(w, h \\leq 100\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        a = w - 4 * i\n        b = h - 4 * i\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * a + 2 * b - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three integers \\(w\\), \\(h\\), and \\(k\\) from standard input, representing the dimensions of the plate and the number of rings to add.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 0 to \\(k-1\\), the program calculates the dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting \\(4 \\times i\\) from both \\(w\\) and \\(h\\). This adjustment accounts for the cells occupied by previous rings.\n3. **Check Validity**: If at any point the inner rectangle dimensions become non-positive, the loop breaks early as further rings would not be valid.\n4. **Calculate Cells**: For each valid ring, the number of cells is computed using the formula \\(2a + 2b - 4\\), which effectively calculates the perimeter of the inner rectangle while adjusting for corner overlaps.\n5. **Output Result**: The total number of gilded cells across all rings is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and careful handling of geometric constraints.",
