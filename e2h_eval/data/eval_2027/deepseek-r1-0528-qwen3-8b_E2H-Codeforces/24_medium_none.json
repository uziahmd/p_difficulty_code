She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n The cursor starts at `pos` and we need to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r`.\n\n There are two types of operations:\n  1. Move the cursor left or right (if there are unclosed tabs in that direction) one step per second.\n  2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (one operation per second).\n\n After closing, the range [a, b] is updated (the remaining tabs). However, note that the problem does not require simulating the closure but rather to plan the minimal seconds.\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n Since we are only concerned with the segment [l, r], we must close:\n   - All tabs with indices < l (to the left)\n   - All tabs with indices > r (to the right)\n\n The cursor starts at `pos`. We have two directions to move: left and right.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the current set of tabs is already [l, r] (i.e., l == 1 and r == n, but more precisely if the segment [l, r] covers all the tabs? Actually, we are only leaving [l, r]. But note: initially we have [1, n]. So if [l, r] is the entire range, then we do nothing.\n\n However, note: the example input \"5 2 1 5\" -> output 0.\n\n Let's break down the problem:\n\n We need to close two parts: left part (from 1 to l-1) and right part (from r+1 to n). But note: the operations allow closing either side from the cursor.\n\n We can think of two main strategies:\n\n Option 1: \n   - First, move the cursor to the leftmost tab in the desired segment (which is `l`). Then close the left part (all tabs to the left of `l`). Then, if necessary, move the cursor to the rightmost tab (which is `r`) and close the right part.\n\n Option 2:\n   - Alternatively, we might close the right part first.\n\n However, we can also mix the operations: for example, we might close one side without moving to the end of the other side.\n\n But note: after closing one side, the boundaries update. However, the problem is symmetric and we can consider the following:\n\n Let's define:\n   left_closing: the operation to close all tabs to the left of the cursor. This requires that the cursor is at least at `l` (so that when we close the left, we don't accidentally close some part of the desired segment). Similarly, for the right.\n\n Actually, we must ensure that when we close the left part, the cursor must be at a position >= `l` (so that the left part we close is from the current left boundary (which is initially 1) to `cursor-1`, and we want to avoid closing any part of [l, r]). Similarly, for the right, the cursor must be at most `r`.\n\n However, note the operation definition: \n   - Closing the left: closes all tabs from [a, i-1]. Initially, a=1, so if we are at a cursor i, then it will close from 1 to i-1. But if i is less than l, then we might close some part of [l, r]? Actually, we cannot do that because we are only allowed to leave [l, r]. So we must ensure that we don't close any part of [l, r].\n\n Therefore, we must close the left part only when the cursor is at a position i such that i-1 is still above the desired segment? Actually, no: the operation closes from the current minimum index (which is the smallest index of an unclosed tab) to i-1. Initially, the minimum index is 1. But as we close, the minimum index changes.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to close the left part only when the cursor is at a tab that is not the leftmost (so that there are tabs to the left). But we must not close any part of [l, r]. Therefore, we must have the cursor at a position at least `l` (so that when we close the left, we only close from the current left boundary (which initially is 1) up to l-1). Similarly, for the right, we must have the cursor at a position at most `r`.\n\n How do we handle?\n\n Let me consider the two independent actions: closing left and closing right.\n\n Conditions for closing left without affecting [l, r]:\n   - The cursor must be at a tab with index >= l (so that the left part we close does not include l or above).\n\n Conditions for closing right without affecting [l, r]:\n   - The cursor must be at a tab with index <= r.\n\n Now, the problem becomes: we have two operations (close left and close right) and we can move the cursor. We start at `pos`. We have to cover two intervals: [1, l-1] and [r+1, n].\n\n We can do:\n\n Case 1: If the entire set of tabs is already [l, r] (i.e., if l == 1 and r == n), then answer 0.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we need to close some tabs.\n\n There are two possibilities: we can close the left part and then the right part, or the right part and then the left part, or we can interlace the movements and closures.\n\n However, note that we can close one side without necessarily going to the very end of the other side. But observe:\n\n To close the left part, we must move the cursor to at least `l` (because if we are at a position < l, then when we close the left, we would close the desired segment [l, r] as well). Similarly, to close the right part, we must move the cursor to at most `r`.\n\n So the steps are:\n\n Step 1: Move the cursor to the left boundary of the desired segment (l) OR to the right boundary (r)? Actually, we have two sides to close.\n\n We can break the problem into two independent segments: left segment (from 1 to l-1) and right segment (from r+1 to n). But note: the closure operations are from the current cursor.\n\n However, we can also consider:\n\n Option A: \n   - Close the left part: we must get the cursor to at least `l` (so that we can close the left without affecting [l, r]). Then, if the right part is still open, we have to close the right part: we must get the cursor to at most `r` (so that we can close the right without affecting [l, r]).\n\n But note: after closing the left, the boundaries change. The new left boundary becomes `l` (since we closed everything from 1 to l-1). Then, to close the right, we must be at a position <= `r`. However, after closing the left, we are at `l` (if we moved there) and then we can move to the right to close the right.\n\n However, we might not necessarily move to `l` first. We could close the left from a position that is beyond `l` (but then we would have to move to `l` anyway). Actually, the minimal way is to move the cursor to `l` and then close the left, then move to `r` and close the right.\n\n Alternatively, we might not need to go all the way to `l` if we can use the same movement to also prepare for the right closure.\n\n But note: the operations are defined as moving one step at a time and closing one side (which is a whole side) in one second.\n\n Let's analyze with the example: \"6 3 2 4\"\n\n Steps:\n   Start at 3 (n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4)\n\n   Operation 1: Move left to 2 (1 second). Now cursor at 2.\n   Operation 2: Close left (from 1 to 1) -> leaves tabs [2,6] (so now the left boundary is 2). This is valid because we are at 2, so closing left removes [min_index, 1] (min_index is 2? Actually, initially min_index is 1, but after closing left, the remaining tabs are from 2 to 6, so min_index becomes 2). But wait, the operation says: \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\", and the cursor is at 2. The left part is from min_index (which is 1) to 2-1 (which is 1). So we remove tab 1. Then the next state: tabs [2,6] and cursor at 2.\n\n   Then, we need to close the right part (tabs 5 and 6). So we need to move the cursor to 4 (because we must be at most 4 to not close any desired tab). \n        From 2, move right to 3 (1 sec), then to 4 (1 sec) -> total 2 more seconds. Then close the right (1 sec).\n\n   Total: 1 (move left) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move right) + 1 (close right) = 5 seconds.\n\n Another way: \n   Operation 1: Move right to 4 (2 seconds). Then close the right (1 second) -> but wait, after closing the right, we are left with [1,4]. Then we need to close the left. But we are at 4, and we need to close the left from 1 to 1 (because l=2). But if we close the left from 4, we remove [1,3] -> which includes 2 and 3 (desired) and 1. That would remove too much.\n\n So we cannot close the right from 4 if we want to keep [2,4]. Because closing the right from 4 removes [5,6] (which is okay) but then we still have to close the left from 1 to 1 (without affecting [2,4]). \n\n Alternatively, after moving to 4, we can close the right (1 second) and then move the cursor back to 2 to close the left? Then we would do:\n   Move to 4: 1 (from 3 to 4) -> 1 sec\n   Close right: 1 sec (now tabs [1,4])\n   Then move from 4 to 2: 2 moves (2 seconds)\n   Then close left: 1 sec (from 1 to 1) -> now tabs [2,4]\n\n   Total: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\n But wait, after closing the right, the right boundary becomes 4, so when we move from 4 to 2, we are still within [1,4] and the closure operation for left (from 1 to 1) is safe.\n\n However, note: the closure operation for left is defined as closing [a, i-1]. After closing the right, the left boundary is still 1 (because we didn't close the left). Then when we are at 2, we close [1,1] (which is okay).\n\n So both orders are possible.\n\n But note: we might not need to go to the very ends. For example, if we are already at a position that allows us to close one side without moving, we can do that.\n\n We can consider:\n\n Let d_left = distance from pos to l (if we need to close the left, we must be at l or beyond, but we can also be beyond? Actually, we must be at least at l to close the left without affecting [l, r]. Similarly, for the right, we must be at most at r.\n\n However, we can also consider: if we are already at a position from which we can close one side, then we can do that.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If the current cursor is already at a position >= l and <= r, then we don't need to move for the closure of the sides? But wait, we still have to close the sides.\n\n Actually, we can close a side from any position as long as there are tabs to close on that side and we don't close the desired segment.\n\n Therefore, the problem can be broken down into:\n\n - The left part (from 1 to l-1) must be closed. We can close it from any position i such that i >= l (so that the closure doesn't remove any part of [l, r]).\n - Similarly, the right part (from r+1 to n) must be closed. We can close it from any position i such that i <= r.\n\n We have two independent operations, but we can combine the movements.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   Option 1: Close left first, then right.\n        Steps:\n          a. Move the cursor from `pos` to `l` (if `pos` is to the left of `l`, then we have to move right; if `pos` is to the right of `l`, then we don't need to move for the left closure? Actually, if we are at a position > l, then we are already at a position that is >= l, so we can close the left from there. But wait, what if we are at a position between l and r? Then we can close the left without moving? Only if we are at a position >= l. However, if we are at a position < l, we must move to at least l to close the left.\n\n        Actually, to close the left, we must be at a position >= l. So if `pos` < l, we must move right until we reach at least l. But note: we don't necessarily have to go to `l`; we can stop at the first position that allows the closure? However, to close the left, we need to be at a position that is at least l (so that the closure doesn't remove any part of [l, r]). But we can stop at any position >= l. However, to minimize the total steps, we should consider the minimal movement.\n\n        However, note: after closing the left, the left boundary becomes l, and then we can move freely within [l, ...] (until we close the right). But we have to eventually get to a position <= r to close the right.\n\n        Similarly, for the right: if `pos` > r, then we must move left until we are <= r.\n\n        But we can also consider: maybe we can do one closure without moving to the extreme, then move for the other closure.\n\n        Actually, we can consider two strategies:\n\n        Strategy 1: \n          - Move to l (if needed) and close left (if the left part exists).\n          - Then move to r (if needed) and close right (if the right part exists).\n\n        Strategy 2:\n          - Move to r (if needed) and close right.\n          - Then move to l and close left.\n\n        And also, we might consider a mixed strategy: if we are already in the segment [l, r], then we can close one side without moving (if the entire left part is to the left of l and we are at a position >= l, we can close the left without moving; similarly for the right). But if we are outside the segment, we have to move.\n\n        Actually, the initial position might be outside [l, r]. There are three cases:\n\n        Case A: pos is in [l, r]\n            Then we don't need to move to get to [l, r] for the closure. However, we still have to close the two sides if they exist.\n\n            Subcase A1: Left part exists (l > 1) and right part exists (r < n)\n                We can choose to close left first: then we must move from `pos` to l (if pos < l, then we move right? But wait, if pos is in [l, r] then we are at least at l. So actually, we are at a position >= l, so we can close the left from `pos` (if we haven't closed it already). Similarly, for the right.\n\n                However, note: if we are at `pos` (in [l, r]), we can close the left and the right from this position? Actually, no: \n                  - To close the left: we must be at a position >= l. We are, so we can close the left (if there is anything to the left, i.e., if l>1).\n                  - To close the right: we must be at a position <= r. We are, so we can close the right (if there is anything to the right, i.e., if r<n).\n\n                But wait: if we close both from the same position, then we do two operations (each taking 1 second). Then the total time is 2.\n\n                However, consider: if we do that, then we don't need to move. So total seconds = 2.\n\n                Example: n=10, pos=5, l=4, r=6. Then we can close left (from 1 to 3) and right (from 7 to 10) from the same position 5. So 2 seconds.\n\n                But what if we have to move for one of them? Actually, if we are in [l, r], then we are both >= l and <= r, so we can close both.\n\n                However, wait: the operation for closing left is defined as closing the left part from the current cursor. But if we are at 5, then closing left would close [1,4] (from a=1 to i-1=4). But we want to keep [4,6]. So we are about to close tab 4 (which is the left boundary) -> that's not allowed.\n\n                Correction: the closure operation for left: closes [a, i-1]. Here, a is the current minimum index of unclosed tabs (which is 1). So if we are at 5, then we close [1,4]. This removes the desired tab 4? Then that is invalid.\n\n                So we cannot close the left from 5 if l=4 because it would remove the desired tab 4.\n\n                Similarly, we cannot close the right from 5 if r=6 because we would close [7,10] (which is okay, because 5<=6). But for the left, we must not close the desired segment.\n\n                Therefore, the condition for closing the left is: we must be at a position i such that i-1 < l (so that the closure doesn't remove the desired segment). Actually, no: the closure removes [a, i-1]. We require that [a, i-1] does not intersect [l, r]. \n\n                In fact, we require that the closure operation does not remove any tab in [l, r]. \n\n                For the left closure: we remove [a, i-1] and we require that [a, i-1] ∩ [l, r] = empty. Since [l, r] is the desired segment, the left closure is safe if and only if i-1 < l (so that the last tab we remove is l-1, which is below l). Similarly, for the right closure: we require that i+1 > r (so that the first tab we remove is r+1). \n\n                But wait, the closure operation for the left is defined as removing from the current minimum index (a) to i-1. Initially, a=1, but after some operations, a might change. However, we are planning the minimal steps.\n\n                Alternatively, we can think: we must close the left part (from 1 to l-1) and the right part (from r+1 to n). The closure operations are atomic and remove entire contiguous segments.\n\n                Therefore, we must have the cursor at a position that is to the right of l (so that the left closure doesn't remove l) OR we can close the left from a position that is exactly at l? Actually, if we are at l, then the left closure would remove [a, l-1]. Since l-1 is the last tab we want to remove (because l is kept), that is acceptable. \n\n                But note: the problem says \"close all the tabs to the left of the cursor\". If the cursor is at l, then the left closure removes [a, l-1]. The desired segment starts at l, so that is okay.\n\n                Similarly, for the right: if we are at r, then the right closure removes [r+1, b] (with b being the current maximum, which initially is n). That is okay.\n\n                Therefore, the conditions for closure are:\n\n                  - To close the left: the cursor must be at a position i such that i >= l (so that we don't remove any part of [l, r]) and we must have at least one tab to the left (i.e., the current minimum index a is less than i). But note: the closure operation does not require that we are at the left boundary of the desired segment, just that we don't remove any part of [l, r]. So we can be anywhere from l to ... (but we don't need to go beyond r for the left closure).\n\n                Similarly, for the right: the cursor must be at a position i such that i <= r and there is at least one tab to the right.\n\n                However, we must also consider that we might have multiple ways to close the sides.\n\n        Let me reframe:\n\n        We have two operations to perform: \n          Operation L: close left (if there are any tabs to the left of the cursor that are not in [l, r] and the cursor is at a position that doesn't remove [l, r])\n          Operation R: close right\n\n        The conditions for L: the cursor must be at a position >= l (so that the closure doesn't remove [l, r]), and the cursor must not be at the left boundary (but the left boundary is initially 1, and we are at >= l, so we are not at the left boundary? Actually, the operation will remove from the current minimum index (which is initially 1) to i-1. Since i>=l, then the removal stops at i-1 which is >= l-1. But we must not remove [l, r]. The removal [1, i-1] must not include any part of [l, r]. The smallest index in [l, r] is l, so we require that i-1 < l, i.e., i <= l. \n\n        Wait, let me clarify:\n\n          The closure operation for left removes [a, i-1]. We require that [a, i-1] does not contain any element in [l, r]. Since [l, r] starts at l, we require that i-1 < l, i.e., i <= l.\n\n        Similarly, for the right: we require that [i+1, b] does not contain any element in [l, r]. The largest element in [l, r] is r, so we require that i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1? Actually, no: we require that the closure doesn't remove [l, r]. The closure removes [i+1, b]. We require that [i+1, b] does not include any element from [l, r]. Since [l, r] goes up to r, we require that i+1 > r, i.e., i >= r+1. But wait, if we are at i = r, then we remove [r+1, b] (which is safe). So for the right closure, we can be at i <= r (and we require that there is at least one tab to the right, i.e., i < b). However, the condition to not remove [l, r] is automatically satisfied if i <= r: because the closure removes from i+1 to b, and i+1 is at least r+1 (if i=r, then i+1 = r+1) and since r is the upper bound of [l, r], there's no overlap.\n\n        Actually, the condition for the left closure is: the cursor must be at a position i such that i <= l (so that the last removed tab is i-1 = l-1, which is less than l). Similarly, for the right closure: the cursor must be at a position i such that i >= r (so that the first removed tab is i+1 = r+1). \n\n        But wait, what if we are at a position i that is greater than l? Then the left closure would remove from a to i-1, which includes l (if i-1 >= l). That is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, to close the left part, we must be at a position i <= l (so that we don't remove any part of [l, r]). Similarly, to close the right part, we must be at a position i >= r.\n\n        This is the key insight.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        We have to close two sides:\n\n        Condition for left closure: cursor must be at i <= l.\n        Condition for right closure: cursor must be at i >= r.\n\n        Additionally, we must have at least one tab to the left (for left closure) and at least one tab to the right (for right closure). But note: if there is no left part (l==1) then we don't need to close the left. Similarly, if there is no right part (r==n) then we don't need to close the right.\n\n        So the problem reduces to:\n\n        We start at `pos`. We must:\n\n          - If the left part exists (l > 1): we must move the cursor to a position <= l (and then close the left) OR we can also consider that we might close the left from a position that is already <= l? But wait, we might be already in the segment [l, r] (then we are at a position >= l and <= r). Then we must move left to at most l to close the left.\n\n          Similarly, for the right.\n\n        However, note: we can also close the left from a position that is not the entire left part? Actually, no: the closure operation is atomic and closes all tabs to the left. So we can only close the entire left part (from the current minimum to i-1) in one operation.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal steps are:\n\n        Let left_needed = (l > 1)   [if true, we need to close the left]\n        Let right_needed = (r < n)  [if true, we need to close the right]\n\n        Then, we can consider:\n\n        Case 1: Neither left nor right needed -> 0.\n\n        Case 2: Only left needed.\n            Then we must move the cursor to a position <= l (if we are not already at a position <= l). The minimal steps to get to a position <= l is:\n                If pos > l: we need to move left (pos - l) steps.\n                Then we do one operation to close the left.\n\n            But note: we don't necessarily have to go to l. We can stop at any position <= l. However, the minimal number of moves is (pos - l) if we move left.\n\n            Example: n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=8 (so only left needed). Then we must move from 5 to 3 (2 steps) and then close the left (1 step) -> total 3.\n\n            But wait, what if we are already at a position <= l? Then we don't need to move. Then we just do the closure.\n\n        Case 3: Only right needed.\n            Then we must move the cursor to a position >= r (if we are not already at a position >= r). The minimal steps to get to a position >= r is:\n                If pos < r: we need to move right (r - pos) steps.\n            Then one operation to close the right.\n\n        Case 4: Both left and right needed.\n\n        Now, we have two operations and we might be able to do them in any order, and we might share some movement.\n\n        Possibilities:\n\n        Option A: Close left first, then right.\n            Steps for left: \n                If pos > l, then we move left to l (|pos-l| steps) and then close left (1 second).\n                Then, from l, we need to move to a position >= r (if l < r) -> that requires (r - l) steps, then close right (1 second).\n\n            Total: |pos-l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n        Option B: Close right first, then left.\n            Steps for right:\n                If pos < r, then we move right to r (|pos-r| steps) and then close right (1 second).\n                Then, from r, we need to move to a position <= l (if r > l) -> that requires (r - l) steps, then close left (1 second).\n\n            Total: |pos-r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n\n        Option C: We might be able to use a single movement that satisfies both? Not exactly, because the conditions are opposite.\n\n        However, note: if we are already in [l, r] (so l <= pos <= r), then:\n\n            Option A: \n                Move left from pos to l: (pos - l) steps, then close left (1), then move from l to r: (r - l) steps, then close right (1). Total: (pos-l) + 1 + (r-l) + 1.\n\n            Option B:\n                Move right from pos to r: (r-pos) steps, then close right (1), then move from r to l: (r-l) steps, then close left (1). Total: (r-pos) + 1 + (r-l) + 1.\n\n            But note: we don't have to go all the way to l or r if we can do one closure and then the other without moving the full distance? Actually, after closing one side, the boundaries change and the other closure condition might be met by the same position.\n\n            However, the closure operations change the boundaries. After closing the left, the left boundary becomes l, and the cursor is at l. Then we can close the right from l? Only if l >= r? That is, if the segment [l, r] is empty? Actually, if we close the left, then the remaining tabs are [l, n] (if we started with [1, n]). Then to close the right, we must be at a position >= r. But after closing the left, we are at l. If l >= r, then the entire segment [l, r] is just [l] (if l==r) or empty if l>r (but l<=r by input). Actually, we know l<=r. So if we close the left and then we are at l, then we must move to r (if l < r) to close the right.\n\n            Similarly, if we close the right first, we are at r, and then we must move to l (if r > l) to close the left.\n\n        But wait, we might not need to go to the very ends. We only need to meet the condition for the closure: for left closure we must be <= l, for right closure we must be >= r.\n\n        However, if we are in [l, r] (so l<=pos<=r), then:\n\n          Option A: \n            We close left: we must be at a position <= l. Since we are at pos (>=l), we must move left to l (distance = pos - l). Then we close left. Then we are at l. Then we must close the right: we must be at a position >= r. Since l <= r, we are at l and need to go to r (distance = r - l). Then close right.\n\n          Option B:\n            Similarly, we move right from pos to r (distance = r-pos), then close right, then move from r to l (distance = r-l) (if r>=l, which it is) and then close left.\n\n        But note: if we are already at the boundary, then the distances are minimized.\n\n        However, we might be able to close one side without moving to the boundary? Actually, no: the closure condition requires being at a specific side. For left, we must be <= l. The minimal movement is to go to l (if we are to the right of l). Similarly, for the right, we must be >= r, so minimal movement is to go to r.\n\n        Therefore, the total steps for both left and right when starting in [l, r] is:\n\n          Option A: (pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n          Option B: (r - pos) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        But note: we can choose the order that minimizes the total movement.\n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n          Option A: \n            Steps = (pos - l) + (r - l) + 2   [if we do left first then right]\n\n          Option B:\n            Steps = (r - pos) + (r - l) + 2    [if we do right first then left]\n\n        However, wait: the movement from l to r is (r-l) and from r to l is (r-l) (same). But the initial movement to the first closure is different.\n\n        But note: in Option A, the initial movement is from pos to l (distance = pos - l), then from l to r (distance = r - l). In Option B, the initial movement is from pos to r (distance = r - pos), then from r to l (distance = r - l).\n\n        Then, we can also consider: what if we don't go to the boundary but to a point that allows both closures? Actually, we cannot: the two closures require being at opposite sides.\n\n        Therefore, we must move to one boundary and then to the other.\n\n        However, there is a possibility to do both closures without going to both boundaries? For example, if we are already at l, then we can close the left (0 moves) and then move to r to close the right (r-l moves). Similarly, if we are already at r, then we can close the right (0 moves) and then move to l to close the left (r-l moves). But if we are in the middle, we have to move to one boundary first.\n\n        Actually, we can combine the two movements: \n\n        In Option A, we are moving from pos to l (if pos>l) and then from l to r (if r>l). The total movement for the cursor is (pos - l) + (r - l). Similarly, in Option B, the total movement is (r - pos) + (r - l).\n\n        Then add 2 for the two closure operations.\n\n        But note: we might not need to traverse the entire [l, r] if we are doing two separate closures. The closure operations do not require that we are at the boundary of the entire segment, just that we are at the boundary of the closure (<=l for left, >=r for right).\n\n        However, we are forced to be at one boundary for each closure.\n\n        Now, we can compare:\n\n          Option A: (pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n          Option B: (r - pos) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        But note: (r-l) is common. Then we are adding (pos-l) vs (r-pos). We choose the minimum of these two.\n\n        Actually, we don't necessarily have to do the entire (r-l) movement. Because:\n\n          Option A: \n            Step 1: Move from pos to l (if pos>l, else 0)\n            Step 2: Close left (1 second)\n            Step 3: Move from l to r (if we are at l and we need to be at r to close the right) -> but note: after closing the left, the left boundary becomes l, but the right boundary is still n. Then we need to be at a position >= r to close the right. So we must move from l to r (if l < r). The distance is (r-l).\n\n          Similarly, Option B: \n            Step 1: Move from pos to r (if pos<r, else 0)\n            Step 2: Close right (1 second)\n            Step 3: Move from r to l (if r>l, else 0) -> distance (r-l) if we are at r and need to be at l (if l<=r, then we are at r and need to go to l: if l<r then we move left (r-l) steps, but if l==r then we don't move). However, note: if l==r, then after closing the right (from r) we are done? Actually, if l==r, then the desired segment is a single tab. Then we must close the left and the right. But wait, if we close the right from r, then we remove [r+1, n]. Then we are at r, and then we must close the left: but to close the left, we must be at a position <= l (which is r). So we can close the left from r (if r>=l, which it is). Then we don't need to move. So the movement for the left closure is 0.\n\n        Therefore, we must break down by the existence of left and right parts.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n        Let left_exist = (l > 1)\n        Let right_exist = (r < n)\n\n        Case 1: not left_exist and not right_exist -> 0.\n\n        Case 2: only left_exist -> \n            steps = abs(pos - l) + 1   [because we move from pos to l (if pos>l) or from pos to l (if pos<l? But wait, if pos<l, then we cannot close the left from a position <l? \n\n            Actually, to close the left, we must be at a position <= l. If",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend to leave only the tabs from `l` to `r` inclusive open in her browser. The solution involves analyzing the initial position of the cursor and the segment `[l, r]` to decide the optimal sequence of operations (moving the cursor or closing tabs) required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - The browser initially has `n` tabs, with the cursor at position `pos`.\n   - Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`.\n   - Operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right (one tab per second) or closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor (one operation per second).\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left Closure**: To close tabs to the left of `l`, the cursor must be at a position `<= l`. The minimal movement is from `pos` to `l` if `pos > l`.\n   - **Right Closure**: To close tabs to the right of `r`, the cursor must be at a position `>= r`. The minimal movement is from `pos` to `r` if `pos < r`.\n   - **Combined Operations**: If both left and right closures are needed, the optimal strategy involves either:\n     - Moving to `l` first, then to `r`, or\n     - Moving to `r` first, then to `l`.\n   - The total time is the sum of movements and closure operations (each closure takes 1 second).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Check if no closures are needed (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`). If so, answer is 0.\n   - For left closure only: move cursor to `l` (if necessary) and perform the closure.\n   - For right closure only: move cursor to `r` (if necessary) and perform the closure.\n   - For both closures: compute the minimal steps by considering both possible orders (left then right, or right then left) and choose the one with fewer steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    left_exist = (l > 1)\n    right_exist = (r < n)\n    \n    if not left_exist and not right_exist:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if left_exist and not right_exist:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(steps)\n        return\n        \n    if not left_exist and right_exist:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(steps)\n        return\n        \n    if left_exist and right_exist:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If the desired segment `[l, r]` covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n- **Single Closure Handling**: \n  - If only left tabs need closing (`l > 1`), the cursor moves to `l` (if `pos` is not already there) and performs the closure (1 second).\n  - Similarly, if only right tabs need closing (`r < n`), the cursor moves to `r` (if `pos` is not already there) and performs the closure (1 second).\n- **Dual Closure Handling**: \n  - Compute the steps for two scenarios: moving to `l` first then to `r`, or moving to `r` first then to `l`.\n  - The minimal steps between these two scenarios is chosen as the answer, adding 2 seconds for the two closure operations.\n\nThis approach efficiently minimizes the number of operations by leveraging the initial cursor position and the segment boundaries to determine the optimal path for closure operations.",
