Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (l, r, cost)\n We need two vouchers i and j such that:\n   (1) They don't intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n   (2) The sum of their durations is exactly x: (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x.\n\n Let d_i = r_i - l_i + 1 (duration of voucher i)\n\n Then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n We want to minimize cost_i + cost_j.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since the total duration is fixed (x), for each voucher i with duration d, we look for a voucher j with duration x-d.\n\n However, we also have the condition that the two vouchers do not intersect. This means:\n   Condition 1: if we take voucher i first and j second, then we require r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i.\n\n But note: the two vouchers can be taken in any order. So we have two cases:\n\n   Case 1: i ends before j starts -> r_i < l_j\n   Case 2: j ends before i starts -> r_j < l_i\n\n We can precompute:\n\n   For each distinct duration d (from 1 to maybe 200000, but we only care about those that appear), we want to store the vouchers by duration and also by their l and r.\n\n However, note: the constraints on days (up to 200000) and n up to 200000.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Group vouchers by duration. But note: there might be many different durations (from 1 to 200000) but we only consider those that are in [1, x-1] (since d and x-d must be positive and <= 200000? Actually, since x<=200000, d from 1 to 200000, then x-d from 1 to 200000 as well, but note: if d > x, then we skip? Actually, we only consider d <= x, because if d > x then x-d would be negative which doesn't make sense. So we only consider durations d such that d <= x.\n\n  2. For each duration d that we have, we store a list of (l, r, cost) for that duration.\n\n  3. Now, for each voucher i (with duration d_i) we want to find a voucher j (with duration x - d_i) such that they do not intersect.\n\n  But note: we cannot iterate over all pairs because n is up to 200000.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n  We can preprocess for each duration d, and then for each d, we can sort the vouchers by some key. Then, for a given voucher (l, r, cost) with duration d, we want to find a voucher j with duration d' = x-d that satisfies:\n\n      Condition 1: r < l   (if we assume voucher i has [l_i, r_i] and j has [l_j, r_j], then one way is r_i < l_j, and the other is r_j < l_i)\n\n  But note: we don't know which voucher is taken first. So we can consider:\n\n      Option 1: i comes before j -> then we require r_i < l_j.\n      Option 2: j comes before i -> then we require r_j < l_i.\n\n  However, we don't know the order. But note: the problem does not specify an order. The condition is that they don't intersect, meaning that either the first ends before the second starts or vice versa.\n\n  We can break the problem into two separate cases? Actually, we can reframe:\n\n      We want to avoid having two intervals that overlap. That is, we require that the two intervals are disjoint.\n\n  Another idea: Instead of grouping by duration and then by something else, we can try to use two pointers or segment trees / Fenwick trees? But note the constraints.\n\n  Alternatively, we can:\n\n      Step 1: Precompute an array for each duration d (if exists) of the vouchers, and for each duration d, we might want to record the minimal cost for a voucher that ends by a certain day? Or we can record the minimal cost for a voucher of duration d that ends at day <= some value.\n\n  However, note: the condition for non-intersection is about the start and end of the two.\n\n  Let me try to fix the two durations: d and d2 = x-d.\n\n  We have two sets: set1 = all vouchers with duration d, set2 = all vouchers with duration d2.\n\n  We want to find two vouchers (a from set1, b from set2) such that either:\n      a's interval ends before b starts: a.r < b.l\n      OR\n      b's interval ends before a starts: b.r < a.l\n\n  And we want to minimize a.cost + b.cost.\n\n  How to do this efficiently?\n\n  Idea:\n\n      For each duration d, we can store two sorted lists (or one list and then use two passes):\n\n        List1: all vouchers of duration d, sorted by l (start day) and also we might want to consider by r (end day) for the condition.\n\n      Then, for a fixed pair (d, d2) we want to:\n\n        For every voucher a in set1, we need to check in set2 for two things:\n\n          Condition1: find a voucher b in set2 such that b.l > a.r. We want the minimal cost for such a b.\n\n          Condition2: find a voucher b in set2 such that b.r < a.l. We want the minimal cost for such a b.\n\n      Then the candidate for a is min( min_cost_from_condition1, min_cost_from_condition2 ) and then we take the minimum candidate over a.\n\n      But note: we have to consider both orders. Actually, the condition is symmetric in the sense that we are considering both possibilities (a being first or b being first). But wait: the two conditions above are independent.\n\n      However, note: condition1 corresponds to a being first and condition2 corresponds to b being first.\n\n      But the problem does not assign an order. So we are allowed to take either.\n\n      But note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive? Not necessarily: if the two intervals are disjoint, then one of them must hold. However, it is possible that both hold? Actually no: if both hold then the intervals are separated by two gaps? Actually, no: the conditions are:\n\n          Condition1: a.r < b.l\n          Condition2: b.r < a.l\n\n        If both hold, then we have a.r < b.l and b.r < a.l. Then we have a.r < b.l and b.r < a.l, so a.r < b.l <= b.r < a.l, which implies a.r < a.l, which is impossible (because a.l <= a.r). So they are mutually exclusive.\n\n      Therefore, for a given pair (a, b), only one condition can hold.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      Precompute for each duration d (that appears) a data structure that allows us to query:\n\n        Query1: Given a value t (which would be a.r), find the minimal cost of a voucher in set2 (for duration d2 = x-d) that has l > t.\n\n        Query2: Given a value t (which would be a.l), find the minimal cost of a voucher in set2 (for duration d2) that has r < t.\n\n      But note: the set2 is for a fixed duration d2. However, we are going to do this for each d and d2 = x-d. But we can precompute for each duration d (and then for d2 = x-d) we need to have the set2.\n\n  However, note: the problem says that we have two vouchers (two different ones) and the two durations must sum to x.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Step 1: Read input and group by duration.\n\n      Step 2: For each duration d (from 1 to max_duration, but we only consider d <= x and d2 = x-d exists and is positive and <= max_duration), we have two sets: set_d and set_{x-d}.\n\n      But note: we cannot iterate over every d and then for every d2 = x-d, because the number of distinct durations might be large.\n\n  Alternatively, we can:\n\n      Let's create a dictionary mapping duration -> list of (l, r, cost)\n\n      Then, we can iterate over each distinct duration d that is <= x, and let d2 = x-d. Then if d2 exists in the dictionary, we process the pair (d, d2).\n\n      But note: if d == d2, then we must choose two different vouchers from the same list? Yes, but the problem allows two different vouchers (so same duration is allowed if we have two separate ones). But then we have to be careful: we cannot use the same voucher twice.\n\n      However, the problem states: choose two distinct vouchers.\n\n      So we need to consider:\n\n          Case A: d != d2: then we have two distinct groups, and we just need to combine one from d and one from d2.\n\n          Case B: d == d2: then we have the same group. Then we need to choose two different vouchers from the same group that are disjoint and the total duration is 2*d = x.\n\n      But wait: the total duration is d + d2 = x, so if d==d2, then 2*d = x -> d = x/2. So we must have x even.\n\n      So:\n\n          For d from 1 to floor(x/2) (inclusive) we consider:\n\n            d1 = d, d2 = x-d.\n\n            Then if d1 == d2 and x is even, then we are in case B.\n\n          However, we can simply iterate d from 1 to x//2 (both inclusive) and if d != x-d, then we consider two separate groups. Otherwise, if d == x-d, then we consider the same group.\n\n      But note: what if x is odd? Then d != x-d for all d.\n\n  Now, how to handle each case?\n\n      Case 1: d != d2.\n\n        We have two groups: group1 (duration d) and group2 (duration d2).\n\n        We want to find two vouchers a from group1 and b from group2 such that either a.r < b.l or b.r < a.l.\n\n        We can precompute for group2:\n\n            We want to quickly answer: \n                Query1: For a given a (with r = a_r), find the minimal cost in group2 for a voucher with l > a_r.\n                Query2: For a given a (with l = a_l), find the minimal cost in group2 for a voucher with r < a_l.\n\n        Similarly, we could also do the same by fixing group1 and querying group2, but note: the conditions are symmetric.\n\n        Steps for Case 1:\n\n            Preprocessing for group2 (duration d2):\n\n                We have a list L2 of (l, r, cost) for group2.\n\n                We can create two arrays:\n\n                    Array1 for Query1: We want to quickly find, for a threshold t (which is a_r from group1), the minimal cost among all vouchers in group2 with l > t.\n\n                    Array2 for Query2: We want to quickly find, for a threshold t (which is a_l from group1), the minimal cost among all vouchers in group2 with r < t.\n\n            How to build these?\n\n                For Query1 (by l):\n\n                    Sort group2 by l (the start day). Then, we can also extract the minimal cost for all vouchers with l >= some value.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can sort group2 by l and then create a suffix minimum array for cost: from the largest l to the smallest, we keep the minimal cost seen so far (but backwards). Actually, we want for a given t, the minimal cost for any voucher with l > t.\n\n                    Steps for Query1:\n\n                        Sort group2 by l (in increasing order).\n                        Then, we can create an array min_cost_from_suffix: \n                            Let sorted_group2 = sorted(group2, key=lambda x: x[0])   # by l\n                            Then, we traverse from last element to first, and maintain an array suffix_min[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n                        Then, for a given t, we want the first index j in sorted_group2 such that l_j > t. Then the answer is suffix_min[j] (if exists).\n\n                Similarly, for Query2 (by r):\n\n                    Sort group2 by r (in increasing order) and then create a prefix minimum array for cost.\n\n                    Then, for a given t, we want the last index j in sorted_group2 such that r_j < t. Then the answer is the prefix_min[j] (if exists).\n\n            Then, for each voucher a in group1 (duration d):\n\n                candidate1 = minimal cost from group2 (using Query1) for l > a.r (if exists)\n                candidate2 = minimal cost from group2 (using Query2) for r < a.l (if exists)\n\n                Then the candidate for a is min(candidate1, candidate2) (if both exist, then the minimal of the two; if one doesn't exist, then use the other)\n\n                Then update the global answer with a.cost + candidate (if candidate is not infinity)\n\n            But wait: note that the two conditions are independent and we are allowed to take either. So we consider both.\n\n      Case 2: d == d2 (so x is even and d = x/2)\n\n        Then we are taking two vouchers from the same group (duration d). We need two distinct vouchers (so two different ones) that are disjoint.\n\n        Conditions: either the first ends before the second starts (voucher1: [l1, r1], voucher2: [l2, r2]) -> r1 < l2, or r2 < l1.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Sort the entire group by l (start day). Then, for each voucher i (with start l_i, end r_i, cost c_i), we want to find another voucher j (j != i) such that either:\n\n                r_i < l_j   OR   r_j < l_i.\n\n            But note: we are in the same group, so the duration is fixed (d). Then the condition for disjointness is:\n\n                Without loss of generality, assume we take two vouchers i and j. Then we require that the intervals do not overlap.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Option A: i is first, then j must start after i ends: l_j > r_i.\n\n                Option B: j is first, then i must start after j ends: l_i > r_j.\n\n            However, note: the condition is symmetric.\n\n            We can break the set of vouchers (same duration d) into two parts: those that start after a given voucher ends, and those that end before a given voucher starts.\n\n            But note: we cannot use the same voucher twice.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                We can precompute for the group (same duration d):\n\n                    Sort by l (start day) and then by r (end day) might help.\n\n                However, we can do:\n\n                    Let the group be G.\n\n                    We want to find for each voucher i in G:\n\n                      Candidate1: a voucher j in G (j != i) such that l_j > r_i.\n\n                      Candidate2: a voucher j in G (j != i) such that r_j < l_i.\n\n                Then the candidate for voucher i is the minimal cost between the minimal cost found in Candidate1 and Candidate2 (if they exist).\n\n                Then we update the global answer with the minimal cost from all i.\n\n            How to do Candidate1?\n\n                Sort G by l (start day). Then for a voucher i, we require j with l_j > r_i.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Sort G by l, and then we can also extract the minimal cost for vouchers that have l >= some value.\n\n                    Specifically, we can:\n\n                        Sort by l, then create a suffix minimum array for cost (like in Case1 Query1).\n\n                    Then for voucher i, we find the first j such that l_j > r_i, and then get the minimal cost from j to the end.\n\n            Similarly, for Candidate2:\n\n                We require j such that r_j < l_i.\n\n                We can sort G by r (end day) and then create a prefix minimum array for cost (like in Case1 Query2).\n\n            Then, for each voucher i, we do:\n\n                candidate1 = suffix_query(r_i)   (minimal cost in G for l > r_i, excluding i? But note: our suffix array includes all. We must be careful: we are including i? \n\n                However, we are storing all vouchers in the group. We cannot use the same voucher twice.\n\n                So we need to exclude i from the query? \n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    When building the suffix array, we include all. Then, when processing voucher i, we use the entire group including i. Then we might pick i itself? But we must not.\n\n                How to handle exclusion?\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                      Build two arrays for the entire group (without removing any) and then when querying for candidate1 for voucher i, we are looking for j != i. \n\n                    But note: the condition for candidate1: we require l_j > r_i. Since the voucher i has l_i and r_i (with r_i = l_i + d - 1). Note that l_i <= r_i. So for candidate1, we require j to have l_j > r_i. Since r_i >= l_i, then l_j > r_i >= l_i, so j is a different voucher (because if j=i, then l_i > r_i is false). So if we use the entire group, then the query for candidate1 will not include i because i's l_i <= r_i, so i is not included in the set {j: l_j > r_i}. Similarly, for candidate2: we require r_j < l_i. Again, i's r_i = l_i + d - 1 >= l_i, so i's r_i is not less than l_i. So i is excluded naturally.\n\n                Therefore, we can use the entire group for building the arrays.\n\n            Steps for Case2:\n\n                Let G be the list of (l, r, cost) for duration d (which is x/2).\n\n                Sort G by l (for candidate1) and by r (for candidate2).\n\n                Build:\n\n                  sorted_by_l = sorted(G, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                  suffix_min_l = an array of minimal cost from the end of sorted_by_l.\n\n                  sorted_by_r = sorted(G, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                  prefix_min_r = an array of minimal cost from the beginning of sorted_by_r.\n\n                Then, for each voucher (l_i, r_i, cost_i) in G:\n\n                  candidate1: \n                    In sorted_by_l, find the first index j such that l_j > r_i. Then candidate1 = suffix_min_l[j] (if exists)\n\n                  candidate2:\n                    In sorted_by_r, find the last index j such that r_j < l_i. Then candidate2 = prefix_min_r[j] (if exists)\n\n                Then candidate = min(candidate1, candidate2) if at least one exists, then total cost = cost_i + candidate, and update the global answer.\n\n            However, note: we are iterating over the same group and we are considering each voucher i. But the same pair (i, j) and (j, i) are considered twice? \n\n                In candidate1: we are requiring j to have l_j > r_i. Then the pair (i, j) is considered when we are at i. Similarly, candidate2: we require j to have r_j < l_i, then the pair (j, i) is considered when we are at j. \n\n                But note: the condition for candidate1 and candidate2 are independent and we are allowed to take either order. However, the same pair is considered twice: once as (i, j) and once as (j, i). But that's okay because we are updating the total cost for the pair (i, j) as cost_i + cost_j and for (j, i) as cost_j + cost_i, which is the same.\n\n                However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice. But note: we are processing each voucher i separately and we are only considering j != i (because of the condition on l_j > r_i or r_j < l_i, and as argued i is excluded). But also, we are not storing the pair (i, j) twice because the two conditions are for two different j's.\n\n                Actually, we are considering two different j's for the same i? Not necessarily. The two conditions are independent and the same j might satisfy both? But we are looking for the minimal cost from the two sets. Then we are combining the two sets.\n\n            But note: we are updating the global answer for the pair (i, j) for each i. However, we are only adding the cost_i and the minimal cost from the other set. We are not storing the entire graph.\n\n            However, we are only interested in the minimal total cost.\n\n            But wait: is it possible that the same pair (i, j) is found multiple times? \n\n                In candidate1 for i: we get j (if exists) and then total cost = cost_i + cost_j.\n                In candidate1 for j: we get i? No, because for j, candidate1 requires l_i > r_j. But we know that for i and j, if candidate1 for i holds (r_i < l_j) then for j, candidate1 requires l_i > r_j. But note: r_j = l_j + d - 1, and we have r_i < l_j, so r_j = l_j + d - 1 > l_j + (d-1) ??? Actually, we don't have direct relation between r_i and l_i and l_j and r_j. But note: the condition for candidate1 for i is satisfied, but for j, the condition candidate1 is l_i > r_j. However, we have r_j = l_j + d - 1, and we know that l_j > r_i, so l_i (which is <= r_i) < l_j, so l_i < l_j <= r_j (because l_j <= r_j). Therefore, l_i <= r_j. So candidate1 for j will not include i.\n\n                Similarly, candidate2 for i requires r_j < l_i, and candidate2 for j requires r_i < l_j. These are the same conditions as the two cases.\n\n            Therefore, each pair (i, j) (with i and j distinct) will be considered twice: once at i (via candidate1 or candidate2) and once at j (via the other candidate). But the total cost is the same (cost_i+cost_j). \n\n            To avoid double counting, we could consider each unordered pair only once. However, the problem does not require that and we are only concerned with the minimal total cost.\n\n            But note: if we update the global answer for each pair twice, we are still getting the same minimal value.\n\n            However, we can update the global answer for each candidate we find. Since we are iterating over every voucher, and the same pair might be found in two different iterations, but that's okay.\n\n            But note: the same pair (i, j) is found at i and at j. Then we update the global answer twice with the same value. That's acceptable as long as we take the minimum.\n\n            However, we don't want to consider the same pair twice if we can avoid it, but the minimal value is the same. But if we update twice, we are doing redundant work. But the problem size is 200000, and the group might be large, but note: the total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but the group for a particular duration might be large.\n\n            But note: in Case2, we are only processing the group for d = x/2. The size of that group is at most 200000. Then we do two binary searches per voucher (one for candidate1 and one for candidate2) and each binary search is O(log n). So the total for Case2 is O(n log n) for that group.\n\n      After processing both cases, we output the minimal total cost found, or -1 if none.\n\n  Implementation details:\n\n      We'll create:\n\n        d_groups = defaultdict(list)   # key: duration, value: list of (l, r, cost)\n\n      Then, we iterate over each voucher (l, r, cost) and compute d = r-l+1, and append (l, r, cost) to d_groups[d].\n\n      Then, we consider:\n\n        ans = a very large number (like 10**18)\n\n        For d in d_groups:\n\n            d2 = x - d\n\n            If d2 < d: continue   # to avoid duplicate processing (because d and d2 are symmetric, and we want to consider each unordered pair once). But wait, what if d==d2? Then we don't skip.\n\n            Actually, we can iterate d from 1 to x//2 (inclusive) and:\n\n                if d == d2:\n                    process Case2 (same group) for duration d (which is x/2, so x must be even and d==x/2)\n                else:\n                    if d2 in d_groups:\n                        process Case1 for (d, d2)\n\n            But note: if we iterate d from 1 to x//2, then we cover all pairs without duplication.\n\n            However, if d > x-d, then we skip. So we iterate d from 1 to floor(x/2) and then d2 = x-d, and if d2 >= d, then we process. But wait, we want to process each unordered pair once.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate d from 1 to x//2 (integer division) and then:\n\n                if d == d2: \n                    process Case2 for d (only if x is even and d==x/2, but note d*d==x -> d=x/2, so x must be even)\n                else:\n                    if d2 in d_groups and d2>=d: then process Case1 for (d, d2) [but note: if d2 < d, then we would have already processed (d2, d) when d was d2? But we are iterating d from 1 to x//2, so d2 = x-d >= d (because d <= x//2) ]\n\n            Actually, if d <= x//2, then d2 = x-d >= d (if x is even, then when d = x/2, d2 = x/2; if x is odd, then d2 > d). \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                for d in range(1, x//2+1):\n                    d2 = x - d\n                    if d == d2:\n                        # then we process Case2 for duration d (if d exists in d_groups)\n                        if d in d_groups:\n                            process_case2(d_groups[d])\n                    else:\n                        if d2 in d_groups:\n                            process_case1(d_groups[d], d_groups[d2])\n\n            But wait: what if d2 is greater than x//2? Then we skip d2 because we only iterate d from 1 to x//2. However, note: if d <= x//2, then d2 = x-d >= x - x//2. If x is even, then x//2 = d, and d2 = d. If x is odd, then x//2 is floor, so d2 = x-d >= ceil(x/2) which is >= floor(x/2)+1. So d2 is always >= d (and if d2 is greater than x//2, then we haven't iterated d2 because our loop goes only to x//2). \n\n            But note: we are only required to consider pairs (d, d2) with d <= d2 (to avoid duplicates). And in our iteration, we are ensuring that we process each pair (d, d2) only when d <= d2.\n\n            However, in Case1, we are processing (d, d2) and we have two groups. But note: the two groups are independent and we are only processing the pair (d, d2) once.\n\n      However, wait: what if d is not in the dictionary but d2 is? Then we skip. But we are iterating d from 1 to x//2, and then checking if d2 exists. But if d2 is not in the dictionary, we skip.\n\n      Also, note: we must consider that the two vouchers must be distinct and from the two groups. \n\n      But note: there's a catch: the condition for Case1: we require that the two vouchers are disjoint. We built two data structures for group2 (d2) to answer the queries. However, we did not consider the possibility that the same voucher appears in both groups? No, because the groups are for different durations (unless d==d2, which we handled separately).\n\n      Steps for Case1 (d != d2):\n\n          We have two groups: group_d = d_groups[d] and group_d2 = d_groups[d2]\n\n          We want to build two data structures for group_d2:\n\n            DS1: keyed by l (start) for Query1 (find minimal cost in group_d2 with l > given_value)\n            DS2: keyed by r (end) for Query2 (find minimal cost in group_d2 with r < given_value)\n\n          Then, for each voucher in group_d (with l_i, r_i, cost_i):\n\n            candidate1 = DS1.query(r_i)   (minimal cost in group_d2 with l > r_i)\n            candidate2 = DS2.query(l_i)   (minimal cost in group_d2 with r < l_i)\n\n            Then candidate = min(candidate1, candidate2)   (taking the minimal cost from the two conditions, if one doesn't exist, we ignore that candidate)\n\n            Then update global_ans = min(global_ans, cost_i + candidate)\n\n          But note: candidate1 and candidate2 might be None (meaning no voucher found). We should set them to a very large number if not found.\n\n      Steps to build DS1 for group_d2 (for Query1):\n\n          We want to answer: given a value t, find the minimal cost in group_d2 for which l > t.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Sort group_d2 by l (the start day). Then, we can remove duplicates? No, we have to consider each voucher separately.\n\n            Then, we want to ignore the ones with l <= t. Then the rest (l>t) we want the minimal cost.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                sorted_d2_by_l = sorted(group_d2, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                Then, we can create an array of the costs and then do a suffix minimum.\n\n            Example:\n\n                sorted_d2_by_l = [(l0, r0, c0), (l1, r1, c1), ...] sorted by l.\n\n                Then, we can create an array min_suffix[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n                Then, for a given t, we need to find the smallest index i such that l_i > t. Then the answer is min_suffix[i] (if i exists).\n\n            How to find the smallest index i such that l_i > t? We can do a binary search (since the list is sorted by l).\n\n          Similarly for DS2 (Query2):\n\n            We want to answer: given a value t, find the minimal cost in group_d2 for which r < t.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Sort group_d2 by r (the end day). Then, we can create a prefix minimum array.\n\n                Then, for a given t, we need to find the largest index i such that r_i < t. Then the answer is the prefix_min[i] (if i exists).\n\n            How to find the largest index i such that r_i < t? We can do a binary search (on the sorted list by r) for the last element that is < t.\n\n      Implementation for DS1:\n\n          def build_ds1(group):\n              if not group:\n                  return None\n              sorted_group = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])   # by l\n              # Extract the l's and the costs\n              # Then, create an array for the minimal cost from the current index to the end (suffix min)\n              n = len(sorted_group)\n              arr = sorted_group\n              min_suffix = [0]*n\n              min_suffix[-1] = arr[-1][2]\n              for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n                  min_suffix[i] = min(arr[i][2], min_suffix[i+1])\n\n              # Also, we need the list of l's for binary search\n              l_list = [arr[i][0] for i in range(n)]\n\n              return (l_list, min_suffix, arr)   # we don't need arr? Actually, we can use l_list and min_suffix.\n\n          Then, the query function for DS1:\n\n          def query_ds1(l_list, min_suffix, t):\n              # Find the first index i such that l_list[i] > t.\n              lo, hi = 0, len(l_list)-1\n              pos = -1\n              while lo <= hi:\n                  mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                  if l_list[mid] > t:\n                      pos = mid\n                      hi = mid-1\n                  else:\n                      lo = mid+1\n\n              if pos == -1:\n                  return None   # no voucher found\n\n              return min_suffix[pos]\n\n          Similarly for DS2:\n\n          def build_ds2(group):\n              if not group:\n                  return None\n              sorted_group = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])   # by r\n              n = len(sorted_group)\n              arr = sorted_group\n              min_prefix = [0]*n\n              min_prefix[0] = arr[0][2]\n              for i in range(1, n):\n                  min_prefix[i] = min(arr[i][2], min_prefix[i-1])\n\n              r_list = [arr[i][1] for i in range(n)]\n\n              return (r_list, min_prefix)\n\n          Then, query_ds2(r_list, min_prefix, t):\n              # Find the last index i such that r_list[i] < t.\n              lo, hi = 0, len(r_list)-1\n              pos = -1\n              while lo <= hi:\n                  mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                  if r_list[mid] < t:\n                      pos = mid\n                      lo = mid+1\n                  else:\n                      hi = mid-1\n\n              if pos == -1:\n                  return None\n              return min_prefix[pos]\n\n      However, note: the entire group might be large, and we are building two DS for each d2 that exists. But note: the total distinct durations is at most 200000, but the total number of vouchers is 200000. So we are building DS for each distinct duration that is in the range [1, x] and that is used as d2 (and d from 1 to x//2). The total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but the total number of vouchers is 200000, so the sum of the sizes of the groups is 200000.\n\n      Therefore, we are building DS for each distinct duration that is needed (each d and d2). But note: we are building DS for d2 only if d2 exists and d<=x//2. And the total number of distinct durations is at most 200000, but we are building at most (number of distinct durations) * 2? Actually, we are building for each distinct duration that is d (from 1 to x//2) and then for d2 (if exists) and then for each d2 we build two DS? Actually, no: in Case1, we build two DS for d2 (group_d2) once and then use it for all vouchers in group_d. Similarly, in Case2 we build two DS for the same group (for candidate1 and candidate2) but actually we can build two DS for the same group (for Case2) once and then use it for all vouchers in the group.\n\n      But note: the same duration d might appear as d2 for multiple d (for example, if we have d=1 and d2=5, then d=5 and d2=1, but we are only processing when d<=5//2? Actually, we are iterating d from 1 to x//2, and then d2 = x-d. So we are building DS for d2 only for the specific d2 we need. \n\n      However, we must be cautious: the total amount of work is the sum_{d in [1, x//2]} [size(d2)] * log(size(d2)) for building the sorted arrays and then the queries. But note: the total number of vouchers is 200000, and the groups are disjoint. The sum of the sizes of the groups is 200000. Therefore, the total work for building all DS is O(200000 * log(200000)), which is acceptable.\n\n  But wait: we are building two DS for each distinct duration that is used as d2. And the same duration d2 might be used for multiple d (as long as d = x-d2, and d<=x//2). For example, if we have d=1, then d2=x-1; d=2, then d2=x-2; etc. But if x-1 is the same as x-2? Only if 1=2, no. So each d2 is unique for a fixed x",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently accessing all vouchers of a specific duration.\n2. **Check for Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d` (from 1 to `x//2`), we check if there exists another duration `d2 = x - d`. If such a `d2` exists, we then look for pairs of vouchers (one from duration `d` and one from duration `d2`) that do not overlap.\n3. **Non-overlapping Condition**: Two vouchers do not overlap if either the first ends before the second starts or the second ends before the first starts. To efficiently check this, we preprocess the vouchers of duration `d2` to quickly find the minimal cost voucher that starts after a given end date or ends before a given start date.\n4. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: For each voucher in duration `d`, we use binary search on the preprocessed data of duration `d2` to find the minimal cost voucher that satisfies the non-overlapping condition. This ensures our solution is efficient even for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it));

If found, we process the pairs:\n   - **Case 1 (Different Durations)**: For each voucher in duration `d`, we use binary search on the preprocessed data of duration `d2` to find the minimal cost voucher that does not overlap with the current voucher.\n   - **Case 2 (Same Duration)**: If `d` equals `d2`, we ensure there are at least two vouchers and use binary search to find non-overlapping pairs within the same duration group.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all possible pairs, the minimal total cost is printed. If no valid pair is found, -1 is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and binary search, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.",
