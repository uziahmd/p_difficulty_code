Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, this problem is about navigating between two points in a plane divided by n infinite lines (roads). The key observation is that the roads divide the plane into regions (blocks) and we can move from one block to another if they share a common border (i.e., the blocks are adjacent). However, moving across an intersection (a point where two or more roads meet) without having a nonzero boundary segment is not allowed.\n\nBut note: the movement condition is defined by having a nonzero common border. This implies that two blocks are adjacent (and hence can be moved in one step) if they share a segment (not just a point) of their boundaries.\n\nHowever, note that the entire plane is divided by n lines. The regions are convex polygons (or unbounded regions) and the graph of regions is such that crossing a road takes you from one region to another. But the problem does not require us to count crossings of roads but steps (each step being a move from one block to an adjacent block). \n\nBut here's a catch: the problem says we cannot move from one block to another if their common border is zero. So if two blocks only meet at a single point (like two regions adjacent at an intersection) then we cannot move in one step? Actually, the problem states: \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\". So we must have a positive length shared boundary.\n\nHowever, note that the entire structure is built from straight lines. Two adjacent regions share a portion of one of the roads. Therefore, the common border is a segment (or part of a line) and is of nonzero length (unless the two regions only meet at a single point). But wait: two regions might meet at a single point if that point is the intersection of multiple roads and the two regions are separated by several roads. However, note that two regions are adjacent if they share a common edge (which is a segment of one road). And two regions that are adjacent by a segment of a road are connected by one step.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require us to traverse the entire graph of regions. We are only concerned with the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nObservation: Each road is an infinite line. The entire plane is divided by these n lines. The home and university are given as points, and they lie in two distinct blocks (unless the same block, then 0 steps, but guaranteed not on any road and the input doesn't say they are the same, so we assume they are in different blocks).\n\nWe can think of each road as a separator. The movement from one block to another requires crossing one or more roads? Actually, note: when you cross one road, you go from one block to an adjacent block. But then, to get from home to university, you have to cross a set of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut note: the problem doesn't ask for the number of roads crossed, but the number of steps (each step being a move from one block to an adjacent block). However, observe:\n\nEach step crosses one road? Actually, no: because a step moves from one block to an adjacent block, and the adjacent block is separated by exactly one road (the common border is a segment of one road). Therefore, each step corresponds to crossing one road. However, wait: what if two regions are separated by two roads? Then you would need two steps? Actually, the graph of regions is such that two regions that are separated by k roads require k steps (because you must cross each road once). But note: the entire set of roads defines a planar graph, and the dual graph is built from the arrangement.\n\nHowever, note that the roads are linear and the arrangement is such that the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that must be crossed to go from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do we determine which roads separate the two points? \n\nActually, consider: \nFor each road (line), check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, then that road must be crossed an odd number of times (at least once) to go from home to university. But note: we are allowed to take a path that goes through the same road multiple times? However, the problem asks for the minimum steps.\n\nBut note: the movement is defined by adjacent blocks. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of road crossings, and since each step is crossing one road, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points (i.e., the roads for which the two points are on opposite sides).\n\nHowever, wait: is it that simple? Let me test with the example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n\nThis means: home (1,1), university (-1,-1), 2 roads: \nFirst road: 0*x + ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing the home to the block containing the university in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to an adjacent block that shares a common border of nonzero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each road (infinite line) divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university lie in specific blocks (regions) defined by these roads. The minimal number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points. A road separates the two points if they lie on opposite sides of the road.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check whether the home and university points are on opposite sides. If they are, crossing this road is necessary to reach the university. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required, as each step corresponds to crossing one such road.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating over each road and determining the side of each point relative to the road. This is done using the line equation \\(aix + biy + ci = 0\\). For a point \\((x, y)\\), the sign of \\(ai*x + bi*y + ci\\) indicates which side of the line the point lies on.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    index = 5\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the code checks the position of both the home and university relative to the line defined by the road. The sign of the expression \\(ai*x + bi*y + ci\\) determines which side of the line the points lie on.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, it is counted as a separating road. The total count of such roads gives the minimal steps needed, as each step crosses one road.\n4. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the count of roads that separate the home and university points.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and points, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
