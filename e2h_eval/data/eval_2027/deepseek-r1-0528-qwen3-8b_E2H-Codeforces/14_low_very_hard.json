He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n How to count trailing zeros in n!?\n   The number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). \n   Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n        f(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\n But note: We are given m (the exact number of trailing zeros) and we want to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the problem does not ask for the n that have at least m zeros, but exactly m zeros.\n\n Observation:\n   The function f(n) is non-decreasing. Moreover, it increases only at multiples of 5. Also, note that the same value of f(n) might be achieved for consecutive n.\n\n Example: \n   Input m=1 -> Output: 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9\n\n Why?\n   f(4) = 0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2.\n\n So, the n's that have exactly m zeros form a contiguous interval? Not necessarily.\n\n Actually, from the example: for m=1, we get n from 5 to 9. Then for m=2, we would get n from 10 to 14, because:\n   f(10)=2, f(11)=2, f(12)=2, f(13)=2, f(14)=2, then f(15)=3.\n\n However, note that sometimes the trailing zeros jump by more than one when n crosses a multiple of a higher power of 5.\n\n Example: \n   Consider m=6. \n   We know that f(25)=6 (because 25//5=5, 25//25=1 -> total 6). But what about n=24? \n   f(24)=4 (since 24//5=4, 24//25=0 -> 4)\n   Then n=25: f(25)=6. So there is a jump from 4 to 6. Therefore, there is no n with f(n)=5.\n\n Thus, not every m from 0 up to some maximum will appear. Some m might be skipped.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, but we are interested in the exact m.\n\n 2. However, note: the problem says \"exactly m\", so we must check which n satisfy f(n)=m.\n\n 3. But note: the function f(n) is non-decreasing and we know that for a fixed m, the set of n with f(n)=m is an interval [L, R] if it exists, or empty.\n\n    Actually, it is either empty or an interval of consecutive integers.\n\n    Why consecutive? Because once we reach a value m, then until the next multiple of 5 (or higher power) the trailing zeros remain the same.\n\n 4. How to find the range [L, R] for a given m?\n\n    We can use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and then the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n    Then the n's that have exactly m zeros are from (the smallest n such that f(n)=m) to (the smallest n such that f(n)=m+1 - 1).\n\n    But note: the smallest n such that f(n) >= m is the lower bound for our interval. However, we must ensure that the smallest n with f(n)=m is exactly the first n0 for which f(n0)=m.\n\n    Alternatively, we can define:\n        L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and then we must check that f(L) == m? Not necessarily: because if we skip m, then f(L) might be > m.\n\n    So we need to find:\n        low_bound = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n        high_bound = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n    Then, if f(low_bound) == m, then the numbers from low_bound to high_bound-1 have exactly m zeros.\n\n    However, if f(low_bound) != m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros.\n\n    But wait, is it possible that f(n) jumps over m? Yes, as we saw with m=5.\n\n    Therefore",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such integers \\( n \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of times 5 appears in the prime factorization of the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   where each term accounts for higher powers of 5.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( f(L) \\geq m \\) and the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( f(R) \\geq m + 1 \\). The integers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( f(n) = m \\) will lie between \\( L \\) and \\( R-1 \\), provided \\( f(L) = m \\). If \\( f(L) > m \\), then no such \\( n \\) exists.\n\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: Special cases include when \\( m = 0 \\) (no trailing zeroes) or when \\( m \\) is such that no \\( n \\) satisfies the condition (e.g., \\( m = 5 \\) as shown in the example).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if m == 0:\n        print(1)\n        print(\"1\")\n        return\n        \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 1)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    L = low\n    \n    zeros_L = count_trailing_zeros(L)\n    if zeros_L != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    high_bound = 0\n    low2 = 0\n    high2 = 5 * (m + 2)\n    while low2 < high2:\n        mid = (low2 + high2) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m + 1:\n            low2 = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high2 = mid - 1\n            \n    R = low2\n    \n    if L >= R:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    k = R - L\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, range(L, R))))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **main()**:\n   - **Input Handling**: Reads the input value \\( m \\) from standard input.\n   - **Special Case for \\( m = 0 \\):** Directly outputs the result since only \\( n = 1 \\) has no trailing zeroes.\n   - **Binary Search for Lower Bound \\( L \\)**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m \\).\n   - **Validation Check**: Ensures \\( f(L) = m \\). If not, outputs 0 as no \\( n \\) exists for the given \\( m \\).\n   - **Binary Search for Upper Bound \\( R \\)**: Finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( f(n) \\geq m + 1 \\).\n   - **Result Calculation**: The valid \\( n \\) values are from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\). The count and list of these values are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for \\( n \\) using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zero count function \\( f(n) \\). The solution handles edge cases and ensures correctness by validating the bounds found during the search.",
