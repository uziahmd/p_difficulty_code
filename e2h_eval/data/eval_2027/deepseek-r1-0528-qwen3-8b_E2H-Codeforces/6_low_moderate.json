Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (l, r, cost)\n We need two vouchers i and j such that:\n   (1) They don't intersect: either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.\n   (2) The sum of their durations is exactly x: (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x.\n\n We are to minimize the total cost (cost_i + cost_j).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Note: The duration of a voucher i is d_i = r_i - l_i + 1.\n\n 2. We are looking for two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x.\n\n 3. The condition of non-intersection: \n        Condition 1: if we take voucher i first and then j (so i is [l_i, r_i] and j is [l_j, r_j]), then we require r_i < l_j OR r_j < l_i.\n\n    But note: the two vouchers are independent. We can consider two cases:\n        Case A: The first voucher ends before the second starts (voucher i is [l_i, r_i] and voucher j is [l_j, r_j] with r_i < l_j).\n        Case B: The second voucher ends before the first starts (voucher j is [l_j, r_j] and voucher i is [l_i, r_i] with r_j < l_i).\n\n    However, note that the problem does not specify order. So we can think of the two intervals as two arbitrary ones.\n\n 4. We can restructure the problem by grouping vouchers by their duration.\n\n    Let's define an array `by_duration` where for each duration d (from 1 to max_duration, which is at most 200000), we store the best (lowest cost) voucher(s) for that duration, but also we need to know the interval [l, r] to check for disjointness.\n\n    However, note: two vouchers of the same duration might have different intervals.\n\n 5. We are going to iterate over all pairs of durations (d, x-d). For each pair, we want to pick one voucher of duration d and one of duration x-d such that they do not intersect.\n\n    But the number of distinct durations might be up to 200000, so we cannot iterate over every pair of durations (which would be O(max_duration^2)).\n\n 6. Alternative approach:\n\n    Precompute for each duration d (if there is at least one voucher) the following:\n\n        Let's say we have a list for each duration d: \n            list_d = [(l, r, cost)] for all vouchers with duration d.\n\n        Then we want to find, for two durations d1 and d2 (with d1+d2=x), the minimal cost of a pair (v1 from d1, v2 from d2) that satisfies the non-intersection condition.\n\n    But note: the condition for non-intersection is about the intervals. We cannot simply use the minimal cost for d1 and minimal cost for d2 because the minimal cost voucher for d1 might conflict with the minimal cost voucher for d2.\n\n 7. We need to quickly check for two sets of intervals (for fixed d1 and d2) if there exists a pair (i in d1, j in d2) that does not intersect.\n\n    Alternatively, we can preprocess for each duration d:\n\n        We want to quickly query: given a set of intervals (for a fixed d), and a target set of intervals (for duration x-d), what is the minimum total cost of two intervals (one from d and one from x-d) that do not intersect?\n\n    But note: the condition is: either (r_i < l_j) or (r_j < l_i). \n\n    Actually, we can break into two cases:\n\n        Case 1: The first voucher (from d) must end before the second (from x-d) starts: so we require r_i < l_j.\n\n        Case 2: The second voucher (from x-d) must end before the first (from d) starts: so we require r_j < l_i.\n\n    But note: the two vouchers are independent. We can consider:\n\n        For a voucher i in d, we want to find a voucher j in x-d such that either:\n            (a) r_i < l_j   OR\n            (b) r_j < l_i\n\n    However, the two conditions are symmetric. But note: in the condition (a) the voucher i must end before j starts, and in (b) j must end before i starts.\n\n    Actually, the condition for non-intersection is that the two intervals do not overlap. This can be checked by:\n\n        Two intervals [a, b] and [c",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-intersecting travel vouchers such that the sum of their durations equals exactly `x` and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping vouchers by their durations and then checking for valid pairs between these groups.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: We first categorize all vouchers based on their duration (i.e., `ri - li + 1`). For each duration, we store the cheapest voucher available. This helps in quickly accessing the most economical option for any given duration.\n2. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each possible pair of durations `(d, x - d)`, we check if there exists at least one voucher in each group that does not intersect. The non-intersection condition is satisfied if either the end of the first voucher is before the start of the second or vice versa.\n3. **Efficient Query Handling**: To efficiently determine if a voucher from one group can be paired with a voucher from another group without intersection, we preprocess the stored vouchers. Specifically, for each duration, we maintain:\n   - A list of intervals sorted by their start date.\n   - A separate list sorted by their end date.\n4. **Binary Search for Non-Intersection**: Using binary search on the preprocessed lists, we can quickly find if there exists a voucher in one group that ends before a voucher in the other group starts (or vice versa), ensuring minimal computational overhead.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_right, bisect_left\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it))\n    x = int(next(it))\n    vouchers = []\n    max_day = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(next(it))\n        r = int(next(it))\n        cost_val = int(next(it))\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val))\n        max_day = max(max_day, r)\n    \n    max_duration = max_day\n    duration_map = {}\n    for (l, r, cost_val) in vouchers:\n        dur = r -

This allows efficient binary search operations later.\n4. **Finding Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d`, the algorithm checks if there exists a complementary duration `x - d`. Using the preprocessed dictionaries, it checks if there are non-intersecting vouchers between the two groups using binary search, ensuring minimal computational time.\n5. **Output the Result**: The minimal cost of valid pairs is tracked and printed. If no valid pair is found, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only relevant voucher pairs, leveraging sorting and binary search to handle large input sizes within feasible time complexity.",
