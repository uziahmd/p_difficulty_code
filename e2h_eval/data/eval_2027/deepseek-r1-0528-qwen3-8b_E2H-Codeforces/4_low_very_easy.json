The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given: \n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   string A (Nikephoros' sequence) and string B (Polycarpus' sequence)\n\n Since the sequences are cyclic, we can think of the i-th round (0-indexed) as:\n   a = A[i % len(A)]\n   b = B[i % len(B)]\n\n But note: n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the n rounds into complete cycles of the two sequences. However, note that the two sequences have different lengths.\n\n Let L1 = len(A), L2 = len(B). The combined cycle would be LCM(L1, L2) but since L1, L2 <= 1000, the LCM might be too large to consider as a cycle (but actually we can use the concept of overlapping cycles).\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the outcome for one full cycle of both sequences (i.e., the least common multiple of m and k) and then multiply by the number of complete cycles, and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\n However, note: the round i uses index i % m for A and i % k for B. The state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds? Actually, the pair (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the LCM of m and k. But note: n can be up to 2e9, and m, k <= 1000, so LCM(m,k) is at most 1000*1000 = 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n    However, note: if we do one full cycle (LCM(m,k) rounds) then we can count the wins for each player in that cycle.\n\n    But wait: we don't need to know the entire cycle, because the outcome of a round depends on the two items. We can precompute the outcomes for all pairs (a, b) and then for each round i, we know the outcome.\n\n 2. However, the total number of rounds n might be huge (2e9) but the sequences are only up to 1000. So we can consider:\n\n    Let T = LCM(len(A), len(B))\n\n    Then, we can break the n rounds into:\n        full_cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n    Then, the total losses for Nikephoros = full_cycles * (losses in one T-round cycle for Nikephoros) + (losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephoros)\n    Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n 3. But wait: in one round, the outcome is:\n        If A[i] vs B[j] (where j = i mod len(B)):\n\n        We can define a function that returns:\n          -1 if A wins (then B loses, so we add to Polycarpus' red spots)\n          0 if draw\n          1 if B wins (then A loses, so we add to Nikephoros' red spots)\n\n        Actually, let's define:\n\n        Outcome(a, b):\n            if (a, b) is one of: ('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R') -> then a wins (so b loses) -> return -1 (meaning a wins, so we add to Polycarpus' red spots)\n            if (b, a) is one of: ('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R') -> then b wins -> return 1 (meaning b wins, so we add to Nikephoros' red spots)\n            else: 0 (draw)\n\n        But note: the problem says:\n            Rock beats Scissors -> so if a='R' and b='S', then a wins.\n            Similarly, if a='S' and b='P', then a wins.\n            If a='P' and b='R', then a wins.\n\n        So the outcome for (a, b) is:\n            if a == b: 0\n            else if (a, b) is ('R','S') or ('S','P') or ('P','R'): then a wins -> outcome = -1 (meaning Polycarpus loses, so we count a loss for Polycarpus and a win for Nikephoros) but wait, no: \n            Actually, the problem says: the loser gets a red spot.\n\n            So if a wins, then b loses -> so we add one to Polycarpus' red spots.\n            If b wins, then a loses -> so we add one to Nikephoros' red spots.\n\n        Therefore, we can define:\n\n        outcome =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the challenge is to efficiently compute the results for a large number of rounds without iterating through each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The key observation is that the sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds respectively, so the combined cycle repeats every `LCM(m, k)` rounds.\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of processing each of the `n` rounds one by one, we can break down the problem into cycles. For each cycle of length `T = LCM(m, k)`, we precompute the number of wins for each player. The total losses for each player are then calculated by multiplying the wins per cycle by the number of complete cycles and adding the results from the remaining rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length.\n   - For each position in the cycle, determine the outcome of the round (win for Nikephoros, win for Polycarpus, or draw).\n   - Use these outcomes to calculate the total losses for each player over all rounds by leveraging the periodicity of the sequences.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` (up to 2 billion) by focusing on the periodic nature of the sequences. The LCM computation and cycle processing are feasible since the sequence lengths are at most 1000, making the LCM manageable (up to 1,000,000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    if m == 0 or k == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    T = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    nike_losses_per_cycle = 0\n    poly_losses_per_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            poly_losses_per_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            nike_losses_per_cycle += 1\n            \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    total_nike_loss = full_cycles * nike_losses_per_cycle\n    total_poly_loss = full_cycles * poly_losses_per_cycle\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n            \n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            total_poly_loss += 1\n        else:\n            total_nike_loss += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{total_nike_loss} {total_poly_loss}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the two sequences `A` (Nikephoros' moves) and `B` (Polycarpus' moves).\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The combined cycle length `T` is computed as the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of `A` and `B`.\n3. **Cycle Processing**: For each position in the cycle `T`, the outcome of the round is determined based on the current moves from `A` and `B`. Wins for each player are counted.\n4. **Total Losses Calculation**: The total losses for each player are computed by multiplying the wins per cycle by the number of complete cycles (`full_cycles`). The remaining rounds are processed individually to account for any partial cycle.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed, representing the number of red spots on their bodies after `n` rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
