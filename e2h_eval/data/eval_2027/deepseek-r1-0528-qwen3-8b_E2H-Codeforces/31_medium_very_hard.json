Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\nWe are given:\n  n and x: two integers in the first line.\n  a list of n integers (the found cards)\n\nWe can assume that Vanya had infinitely many cards with every integer from -x to x (so we can choose any card with absolute value <= x).\n\nGoal: We have some found cards. We want to find the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum is zero.\n\nLet S be the sum of the found cards.\n\nWe need to achieve a total sum of 0, so the sum of the additional cards must be -S.\n\nWe are allowed to choose any number of cards (each having an integer between -x and x) and we want the minimum number of cards to achieve a total of -S.\n\nNote: We can also use the fact that we have negative and positive numbers available.\n\nWhat is the maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards? \nEach card can be at most x (in absolute value). So the maximum absolute sum we can get with k cards is k*x.\n\nBut note: we are not limited to positive or negative only, we can mix.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: What is the minimum nonnegative integer k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each |ai|<=x) for which a1+a2+...+ak = T, where T = -S.\n\nBut note: We don't necessarily have to use the maximum absolute value on each card. However, we can use the concept of the coin problem or the Frobenius number, but note that we have both positive and negative coins (from -x to x). Actually, we can think of it as: we want to represent T with k moves, and each move can add any integer between -x and x.\n\nHowever, note: the problem is symmetric. The minimal k must satisfy:\n\n1. The absolute value of T must be at most k*x (since the maximum absolute value we can get from k cards is k*x, and we can also get negative).\n\nBut is that sufficient? Not exactly, because we might not be able to get every integer between -k*x and k*x? Actually, no: because we have all integers from -x to x available, we can form any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] with k cards? \n\nWait, consider: with one card, we can form any integer from -x to x. With two cards, we can form from -2x to 2x? Actually, no: with two cards, the minimum sum is -2x and the maximum is 2x, but can we form every integer in between?\n\nYes, because we have consecutive integers from -x to x. In fact, the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers from -k*x to k*x, provided that k*x >= 0 (which it is). Why? Because we can adjust by 1 using the available numbers. For example, if we have two cards, we can form every integer from -2x to 2x by starting with (0,0) and then adjusting by ±1 if x>=1? Actually, we have 1 available if x>=1.\n\nBut note: the available numbers are from -x to x. The set of numbers is contiguous. Then the set of sums with k cards is contiguous from -k*x to k*x. This is because the gcd of the numbers from -x to x is 1 (if x>=1) and the set is symmetric. So by the Coin Problem, we can form every integer in the range [-k*x, k*x] as long as k*x is sufficiently large? Actually, for k=1: [-x, x] is contiguous. For k=2: we can form from -2x to 2x, but note: we can form every integer? \n\nExample: x=1, k=2: then we have [-2,2]. But we can form every integer in between? \n-2: (-1,-1)\n-1: (-1,0) or (0,-1) but wait, 0 is included? Actually, the set of numbers includes 0. So yes, we can form every integer from -2 to 2.\n\nBut what if x=2? Then with k=1: [-2,-1,0,1,2]. With k=2: the smallest sum is -4, largest 4. Can we form every integer in between? \nWe know we can form 0 (with two zeros) and then we can form 1 by (1,0) or (-1,2) etc. Actually, the step is 1 because we have consecutive integers (including 0 and 1). So the set of achievable sums is indeed contiguous.\n\nTherefore, condition for k: we require that k*x >= |T|, and also k must be at least ceil(|T|/x). However, note that we can also use negative and positive to adjust. But wait: the minimal k must be at least ceil(|T|/x) because the maximum absolute change per card is x.\n\nBut note: we can also use negative cards to go negative. So the condition is just that the total absolute value we need to cover (which is |T|) must be at most k*x. And since we can form every integer in [-k*x, k*x], then k must be at least ceil(|T| / x) if T is nonzero? Actually, no: we might have T=0, then k=0. But if T is nonzero, then we need at least ceil(|T|/x) because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) to cover the gap.\n\nHowever, wait: is that the minimal k? Consider:\n\nWe have to achieve T (which is negative or positive). We can use positive cards to cover positive T, negative for negative T.\n\nBut note: the minimal k must satisfy k*x >= |T|. So k_min = ceil(|T|/x). But wait, what if |T| is 0? Then k_min=0.\n\nBut there's a catch: sometimes we might need more than ceil(|T|/x) because we are constrained by the fact that we cannot use fractional cards and the cards are integers. However, note that the condition k*x >= |T| is necessary and sufficient (because we can form every integer in the range). So the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\nBut wait, consider T=3 and x=2: then k_min = ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. And 2*2=4>=3 -> yes, we can form 3 with two cards: 2+1 (but wait, 1 is allowed because x=2, so we have 1 available). But note: the available numbers are from -2 to 2. So 3 is not directly available, but we can use two cards: 2 and 1? Actually, 2+1=3, and both 1 and 2 are in [-2,2]. So yes.\n\nBut what if T=4 and x=2? Then k_min = ceil(4/2)=2. And 2*2=4, so we can do two 2's.\n\nNow, what if T=5 and x=2? Then k_min = ceil(5/2)=3. Then 3*2=6>=5, so we can form 5 with three cards: 2+2+1=5.\n\nBut wait, is that always true? The condition is k*x >= |T|, and we can form every integer in [-k*x, k*x]. So the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T|/x). However, note: we are allowed to use negative cards as well, so we can also form negative T by subtracting.\n\nBut wait, the above reasoning assumed that we can form every integer in the interval. That is true if we have all integers from -x to x. Then the set of sums is the set of integers from -k*x to k*x. Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Then we are looking for a sum of T (which is negative). Then we can use negative cards. The same condition applies: we need the absolute value of T to be at most k*x.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat: what if we already have some cards? Actually, no, because the problem states that we are going to add k cards (from the infinite set) to the existing set (which has sum S). We need the total sum to be 0, so the added cards must sum to -S = T.\n\nBut note: the problem does not say that we can remove any cards. We are only adding. So we cannot change the existing set. Therefore, T is fixed.\n\nHowever, there's another consideration: maybe we don't have to use the minimal k that satisfies k*x >= |T|? Consider:\n\nWhat if we have an existing set with sum S, and we are allowed to add any cards (from the infinite set). We want the minimum number of cards to make the total sum zero.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to choose any cards (any integer from -x to x). So the problem is: represent T (which is -S) as a sum of k integers, each in [-x, x], and we want the smallest k.\n\nThis is the classic \"representing T as a linear combination\" with bounded coefficients. However, note that we can use any integer in the range, so we are effectively asking: what is the minimum k such that T is in the set of integers from -k*x to k*x? And we know that set is contiguous, so the condition is simply k*x >= |T|.\n\nTherefore, the minimal k is:\n\nIf T == 0: then k = 0.\n\nElse: k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\nBut wait, what if T is not divisible by something? Actually, because we can use any integer in [-x, x], the parity doesn't matter. The only constraint is the absolute value.\n\nHowever, let's test with T=1 and x=1: ceil(1/1)=1 -> works.\nT=2 and x=1: ceil(2/1)=2 -> works (two 1's, or one 2? but wait, x=1 so the available numbers are from -1 to 1. Then we cannot use a 2. So we have to use two 1's: 1+1=2. So that matches.\n\nBut wait, what if T=2 and x=2: ceil(2/2)=1 -> we can use one card: 2. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T=3 and x=2: ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. But with two cards, the maximum we can get is 4, and we can get 3 by 2+1. But 1 is allowed because |1|<=2.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nHowever, note: the problem statement says:\n\nIn the second sample: \nInput: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\nSo n=2, x=3, and the found cards are [-2, -2] -> sum S = -4, so T = 4.\n\nThen k_min = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2.\n\nBut wait, why the answer is 2? Because with two cards, we can get up to 6 (if we use two 3's: 3+3=6) and 4 is within [ -6, 6] and we can form 4: for example, 3+1=4, but 1 is allowed (|1|<=3). Alternatively, we can use two 2's: 2+2=4. But wait, the problem says: He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value. \n\nWait, the requirement for a single card is that the card must be 4? But 4 is greater than 3 (x=3), so we cannot use a single card of 4. Therefore, we must use two cards.\n\nSo the formula still holds: k_min = ceil(|T|/x). \n\nBut wait, is that always the case? Let me check with T=4 and x=3: ceil(4/3)=2. And indeed, we can form 4 with two cards (each card at most 3 in absolute value). \n\nBut wait, what if T=5 and x=3? Then ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. But with two cards, the maximum is 6, and 5 is less than 6. How to form 5? 3+2=5, and 2 is allowed. So yes.\n\nWhat if T=7 and x=3? Then ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. Then 3*3=9>=7, and we can form 7: 3+3+1=7.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that even though k_min = ceil(|T|/x) is the minimal k, we might not be able to form T with k_min cards? \n\nNo, because the set of achievable sums with k_min cards is the entire interval [-k_min*x, k_min*x]. Since |T| <= k_min*x (by definition of k_min being the ceiling of |T|/x, meaning k_min-1 would give (k_min-1)*x < |T|, so k_min is the smallest integer satisfying k_min*x>=|T|), and we know the set is contiguous, then T is in the interval and can be achieved.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Example: T=-5, x=3. Then k_min = ceil(5/3)=2. But with two cards, we can form -5? The minimum sum with two cards is -6, so -5 is in the range. We can form -5 by -3-2. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n2. Read the list of n integers (found cards).\n3. Compute S = sum(found_cards)\n4. T = -S\n\n5. If T == 0:\n        print(0)\n   Else:\n        k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\nBut wait, let's check with the first sample: \nInput: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\nFound cards: [-1,1,2] -> sum S = 2, so T=-2.\nThen k = ceil(|-2|/2) = ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1.\n\nThat matches the first sample.\n\nSecond sample: \nInput: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\nS = -4, T=4, k=ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Example: \nn=1, x=5, found card: [10] -> wait, but the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\" and x=5, so the found cards are within [-5,5]. So we don't have to worry about numbers beyond x.\n\nBut note: the found cards are given and they are within [-x,x]. However, the sum S might be larger than x in absolute value? Yes, because we have multiple cards.\n\nBut the above reasoning holds.\n\nHowever, wait: there's a catch. The problem does not require that we use only the minimal k that satisfies k*x>=|T|, but we must also consider that we might have an existing set that already has a sum S, and we are only adding cards. \n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any cards (from the infinite set) and we are not constrained by the existing cards except for the goal (to make the total sum zero). So the above formula should work.\n\nBut wait, what if we have a large T? The above formula is just k = ceil(|T|/x). \n\nHowever, there's an alternative: sometimes we might be able to use fewer cards by combining positive and negative? But note, the condition is that the absolute value must be at most k*x, and we are allowed to use any sign. The minimal k is still the ceiling of |T|/x.\n\nBut wait, consider: T=5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=2. But wait, 2*3=6, so we can form 5. But what if T=4 and x=3: ceil(4/3)=2, and we can form 4. \n\nBut note: the above reasoning is based on the fact that the set of achievable sums is contiguous. However, there's a known fact: when you have all integers from -x to x, the set of k-card sums is the set of all integers from -k*x to k*x. This is because the set of available numbers generates the entire set of integers (since we have 1) and the total range is symmetric.\n\nBut wait, is that true for k=1? Yes. For k=2: \nWe can form 0 (0+0) and then we can adjust by 1. Actually, we can form every integer because the generating set is symmetric and the gcd is 1.\n\nHowever, there is a known theorem: the set of integers that can be represented as a sum of k integers from [-x,x] is the set of integers in the interval [-k*x, k*x] that are congruent to k mod 2? No, because we have both positive and negative and 0, so we can adjust arbitrarily.\n\nActually, the generating set is symmetric and contains consecutive integers (if x>=1) so the set is contiguous.\n\nBut wait, if x=0? Then we can only use 0. Then T must be 0. Otherwise, we cannot form a nonzero T. But the problem states x>=1.\n\nSo the solution is:\n\nRead n and x.\nRead the list of n integers.\n\ntotal = sum(list)\nT = -total\n\nif T == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # We need the minimal k such that k*x >= abs(T)\n    # k_min = ceil(|T|/x)\n\n    k = abs(T) // x\n    if abs(T) % x != 0:\n        k += 1\n\n    print(k)\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? We take absolute value, so it's the same.\n\nHowever, let me test with T=5, x=3: \nabs(T)=5, 5//3=1, remainder 2 -> so k=2. Correct.\n\nT=4, x=3: 4//3=1, remainder 1 -> k=2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T=6, x=3: 6//3=2, remainder 0 -> k=2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T=0? Then we skip to 0. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the total S is very large? The computation of T = -S might be negative, but we take absolute value so that's okay.\n\nHowever, note: the problem constraints say n and x are at most 1000, and the numbers are integers. The absolute value of T might be as large as 1000 * 1000 = 1000000 (if n=1000 and each card is 1000). Then k = ceil(1000000/x) and x>=1, so k is at most 1000000, which is acceptable because we are doing integer arithmetic.\n\nBut wait, is that the entire story? \n\nConsider: what if we can use the existing cards to cancel out without needing to reach the exact T? \n\nWait, no: we are allowed to only add cards. We cannot change the existing set. So the total sum must become 0 by adding cards that sum to -S.\n\nBut note: there's an alternative way: maybe we can use negative cards to cancel the positive ones and vice versa, but the minimal number of cards is determined by the absolute value we need to cover.\n\nHowever, wait: what if the existing set has a sum S and we can use cards that are not necessarily all positive or all negative? We are free to choose any integers from -x to x. So the problem is: represent T (=-S) as a sum of k integers, each in [-x, x].\n\nAnd the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T|/x) because:\n\n- Each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) so we need at least ceil(|T|/x) cards.\n\nBut note: we can also use negative contributions to cancel. However, the minimal k must be at least ceil(|T|/x) because the maximum absolute change per card is x.\n\nMoreover, we can achieve the target with k_min cards because the set of achievable sums is contiguous. \n\nBut wait, there is a catch: what if T is negative? Then we are effectively requiring a negative sum. But the same condition applies: the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x). \n\nHowever, note that the problem statement example: \nFirst sample: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2'] -> T=-2, and we use one card: -2. But wait, the absolute value of T is 2, and x=2, so ceil(2/2)=1.\n\nBut wait, the second sample: ['2 3\\n-2 -2'] -> T=4, ceil(4/3)=2.\n\nBut wait, what if T=0? Then we don't need any card.\n\nBut wait, what if the existing set already has a sum of 0? Then T=0, so we output 0.\n\nHowever, what if the existing set has a sum that is not zero, but we can form T=0 by adding a set of cards that sum to T? \n\nWait, no: T is defined as -S. So if S is not zero, T is not zero.\n\nBut wait, what if we can use the existing cards to cancel out by adding negative cards? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"the minimum number of cards does he need to find\" (additional cards). We cannot change the existing ones.\n\nBut wait, let me read the problem again: \"Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?\"\n\nSo we start with the found cards (n cards) and then we can find more cards (from the infinite set) to add.\n\nTherefore, the above reasoning holds.\n\nBut wait, I just thought: what if the existing set already has a sum that is zero? Then T=0, so we don't need to add any card.\n\nBut what if the existing set doesn't have a sum of zero? Then we need to add cards.\n\nBut wait, there's a twist: what if we can use the same card value multiple times? Yes, because we have infinitely many.\n\nBut wait, the above formula is based solely on the absolute value of T and x.\n\nHowever, consider: what if T=1 and x=1000? Then ceil(1/1000)=1. So we add one card of 1. Correct.\n\nBut what if T=1 and x=2? Then ceil(1/2)=1. Correct.\n\nBut what if T=1 and x=1? Then ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T=0? Then we don't add any.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Then we are effectively requiring a negative sum. Example: T=-1, x=1: ceil(1/1)=1, so we add one card of -1. Correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"the minimum number of cards\". So we are only concerned with the count.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue: sometimes we might need to use more than one card to cover the gap because of the sign? \n\nWait, no: because we can use negative cards to cover negative T and positive cards for positive T. \n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. So if T is positive, we can use positive and negative cards? Actually, we want the total of the added cards to be T (positive). We can use positive cards to add and negative cards to subtract? But then that would require more than the minimal k? \n\nWait, no: because we are minimizing the number of cards. Why would we use negative cards to help achieving a positive T? That would only increase the total. Similarly, for negative T we don't want to use positive cards. \n\nBut wait, consider T=4, x=3. We can use two cards: 3+1=4 (both positive). Or we could use 4 cards: 1+1+1+1, but that's worse. Or we could use 5 cards: 3+1+0+0+0, but that's more. \n\nBut what if T=2 and x=3? Then ceil(2/3)=1. So we can use one card of 2. But wait, 2 is in the range [-3,3]. So one card is enough.\n\nBut wait, what if T=5 and x=3? Then ceil(5/3)=2. But wait, 5 is positive and we can use two cards: 3+2=5. So that's two cards.\n\nBut what if T=5 and x=2? Then ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. Then we need three cards: maximum we can get with two cards is 4 (if we use two 2's). But wait, we need 5. So we have to use three cards: 2+2+1=5.\n\nBut wait, 1 is allowed because x=2 (so |1|<=2). So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, what if T=5 and x=1? Then ceil(5/1)=5. We need five cards of 1 (each card can only be 1 or -1 or 0). So 1+1+1+1+1=5.\n\nNow, what if T=-5 and x=1? Then ceil(5/1)=5, and we use five cards of -1.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, there's a different perspective: \n\nWe are trying to minimize k, and we know that the total absolute value we must cover is |T|. Each card can contribute up to x (in absolute value). So the minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|. \n\nThis is equivalent to k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\nBut wait, is that always true? Consider T=0, then k=0. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T is very large? The same formula.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: the set of achievable sums with k cards is contiguous from -k*x to k*x. Therefore, if k*x >= |T|, then T is in that interval and we can form it. And if k*x < |T|, then we cannot form T.\n\nTherefore, the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Then |T| is positive, and the same reasoning.\n\nBut wait, what if we have T=0? Then k=0.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimum number of cards\", and if we already have a sum of 0, we don't need to add any.\n\nBut wait, the problem states: \"the following is a competitive programming problem\".\n\nI think we are good.\n\nHowever, wait: the problem says \"the numbers on the found cards\" are given, and they are n integers. But note: the found cards might include zeros? Yes, and zeros don't change the sum.\n\nBut our formula does not care about the composition, only the total sum.\n\nBut wait, what if the existing set has a sum S, and we are allowed to add any cards (from -x to x). Then the minimal k is ceil(|-S|/x) = ceil(|S|/x).\n\nBut wait, what if we can use the existing set to our advantage? Actually, no: we are only adding. The existing set is fixed.\n\nBut wait, consider: what if the existing set has a sum S, and we are allowed to choose cards arbitrarily. Then we need to add a set of cards that sums to -S.\n\nBut wait, there's a different idea: sometimes we might be able to use fewer cards by using negative cards to cancel positive ones and positive cards to cancel negative ones, but that doesn't reduce the minimal k because the net effect is still we need to cover the absolute value |S|.\n\nBut wait, what if S is positive? Then we need to cancel by negative cards. But the minimal number of cards to cancel a positive S is at least ceil(S/x) because the most negative we can get per card is -x, so we need at least ceil(S/x) cards. Similarly, if S is negative, we need ceil(|S|/x) positive cards.\n\nBut note: we can also use a mix. For example, to cancel S=5 and x=3, we could use two cards: one -3 and one -2, so two cards. But wait, that's still two cards, which is the same as ceil(5/3)=2.\n\nBut wait, what if we use one card: -3 and then we still have 2 left. Then we need another card: -2. So two cards. \n\nBut wait, we can also use two cards: 3 and -8? Wait, no, because we cannot use -8 (since x=3). \n\nSo the minimal k is still ceil(|S|/x). \n\nTherefore, the code is:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal = sum(cards)\nT = -total\n\nif T == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = abs(T) / x\n    # k is a float, we need the ceiling of the division\n    # Alternatively, use integer math: \n    # k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x   -> but wait, this is ceiling division for positive numbers.\n\n    # But note: we are dealing with positive absolute value.\n    # Ceiling of a/b for positive a and b: (a + b - 1) // b\n\n    k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n    # But wait, if abs(T) is divisible by x, then (abs(T) + x - 1) // x = (abs(T)//x) because (abs(T))//x * x = abs(T), then (abs(T)+x-1)//x = abs(T)//x + (x-1)//x -> but integer division: \n    # Example: a=5, x=3 -> (5+3-1)=7, 7//3=2 -> correct.\n    # Example: a=6, x=3 -> (6+3-1)=8, 8//3=2 -> but 6//3=2, so that's correct.\n\n    # But wait, what if a=0? Then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (if x>=1). But we handled T==0 separately.\n\n    print(k_min)\n\nWait, but wait: the ceiling of |T|/x is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|. \n\nThe formula (|T| + x - 1) // x is the ceiling of |T|/x for positive |T| and positive x.\n\nBut wait, let me test:\n\n|T|=5, x=3: (5+3-1)//3 = (7)//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n|T|=4, x=3: (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2 -> correct.\n\n|T|=3, x=3: (3+3-1)//3 = 5//3=1 -> wait, 5//3 is 1? Then 1*3=3 which is >=3 -> correct. But wait, (3+3-1)=5, 5//3=1 (floor division). But we want ceiling(3/3)=ceiling(1)=1. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what if |T|=2, x=3: (2+3-1)//3 = (4)//3=1 -> correct, because 1*3>=2.\n\nBut wait, what if |T|=0? Then we don't use this branch.\n\nSo we can write:\n\nif T == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n    print(k_min)\n\nBut wait, let me test with the examples:\n\nExample 1: n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> T=-2, |T|=2, (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2=1 -> prints 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2: n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> T=4, (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3=2 -> prints 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test: T=1, x=1 -> (1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1 -> correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? The absolute value is positive, so it doesn't matter.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative and large? Example: T=-10, x=3: |T|=10, (10+3-1)//3 = 12//3=4. Then 4*3=12>=10 -> correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T=-10, x=4: (10+4-1)//4=13//4=3 (since 13//4=3 in integer floor division). Then 3*4=12>=10 -> correct.\n\nBut wait, is there a case where the ceiling division by integer floor division (a+b-1)//b doesn't work? \n\nActually, for positive a and b, the ceiling of a/b is (a-1)//b + 1, or equivalently (a+b-1)//b.\n\nBut note: if a is divisible by b, then (a+b-1)//b = (a//b)*b + b -1 // b = a//b + (b-1)//b -> but (b-1)//b is 0, so we get a//b. But wait, that is the floor. \n\nWait, no: \n\nLet a = q*b + r, 0<=r<b.\n\nThen (a+b-1)//b = (q*b + r + b - 1)//b = q + (r+b-1)//b.\n\nNow, if r=0, then (0+b-1)//b = (b-1)//b = 0 (since b-1 < b). Then total is q.\n\nBut if r>0, then (r+b-1)//b: since r>=1, then r+b-1 >= b, so (r+b-1)//b = 1 (if r+b-1 < 2*b, which it is because r < b, so r+b-1 < 2*b-1). Then total is q+1.\n\nSo indeed, (a+b-1)//b gives the ceiling of a/b.\n\nBut wait, when a=0, then (0+b-1)//b = (b-1)//b = 0, which is the ceiling of 0. But we don't use that because we have T==0 handled separately.\n\nTherefore, the code is:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    t_abs = abs(s)  # actually, we need -s, but absolute value of s is the same as |T|\n    # But wait: T = -s, so |T| = |s|\n    k = (t_abs + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the example, we have T=-s, so the absolute value we need is |s|. But wait, no: the target sum for the additional cards is -s, so the absolute value is |s|. So yes.\n\nBut wait, the variable s is the sum of the found cards. Then T = -s, so |T| = |s|. So we can use |s|.\n\nBut wait, if s is negative, then T is positive, and |T| = -s (positive). But wait, the absolute value of s is |s|, which is positive. So we can use |s|.\n\nBut wait, note: the variable s is the sum, which can be negative or positive. Then |T| = |s|.\n\nTherefore, we can simplify:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nif s == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # We need to cover |s| (because T = -s, so |T|=|s|)\n    k = (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nBut wait, wait, wait: let me clarify:\n\nWe have s = sum(found_cards). Then the additional cards must sum to -s.\n\nThe absolute value of the target is | -s | = |s|.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Yes.\n\nBut wait, what if s is negative? Then |s| is positive, and we need to cover that positive amount with positive cards (or",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. Each card he finds must have an integer value between -x and x (inclusive). The solution involves calculating the sum of the already found cards and then determining the smallest number of cards required to balance this sum to zero by adding cards with appropriate values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Given `n` found cards and a maximum absolute value `x` for any card, we first compute the sum `S` of these found cards.\n   - The goal is to find the minimal number of additional cards such that their sum is `-S`, making the total sum zero.\n   - Each additional card can contribute any integer value from `-x` to `x`. The challenge is to cover the deficit `-S` with the fewest cards possible.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The minimal number of cards needed is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the deficit divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` towards reducing the deficit (either positively or negatively).\n   - For example, if the deficit is 5 and `x` is 3, the minimal number of cards is 2 (since 3 + 2 = 5, and both values are within the allowed range).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Calculate the sum `S` of the found cards.\n   - If `S` is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the absolute value of `S` (the deficit) and use ceiling division to determine the minimal number of cards required. The ceiling division is efficiently calculated using integer arithmetic: `(abs(S) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    cards = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    s = sum(cards)\n    if s == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        deficit = abs(s)\n        k = (deficit + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card). It then reads the list of `n` integers representing the found cards.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum `S` of the found cards is computed. If `S` is zero, the output is `0` since no additional cards are needed.\n- **Deficit Handling**: If `S` is non-zero, the absolute value of `S` (the deficit) is calculated. The minimal number of cards required to balance the deficit is found using ceiling division: `(deficit + x - 1) // x`. This formula ensures that even if the deficit isn't perfectly divisible by `x`, the result is rounded up to the next integer, providing the minimal number of cards needed.\n- **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of additional cards required to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently addresses the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
