Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) with integer sides such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition: for any three sides (a, b, c) we must have a+b>c, and similarly for the other two.\nBut note: we have fixed ordering: x <= y <= z. Therefore, the strictest condition is x+y>z (because x<=y<=z implies that x+z>y and y+z>x are automatically satisfied if x+y>z).\n\nSo the problem reduces to: count the number of triples (x,y,z) with \n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D] \nsuch that x+y>z.\n\nWe can break the problem by fixing z (which is the largest side) and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z.\n\nBut note: the ranges are large (up to 500000). We cannot iterate over each z and then over each x and y.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nTotal triangles without the triangle condition is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1). Then subtract the degenerate ones? But note: we are only allowed to consider non-degenerate, which requires the triangle inequality. However, the direct count of the condition x+y>z is more straightforward.\n\nBut note: the condition for a triangle is x+y>z, and we have x<=y<=z. The other conditions are automatically satisfied because x<=z and y<=z, so x+z>=x+y>z>=y => x+z>y, and similarly y+z>=y+x>z>=x => y+z>x.\n\nSo we need to count:\n   Sum_{z from C to D} [number of pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y>z]\n\nHowever, the constraints (each range up to 500000) mean that the total number of z is at most 500000, but for each z we cannot iterate over all x and y (which would be about (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) per z, and that product might be up to 500000*500000 which is too big).\n\nWe need to count the pairs (x,y) for a fixed z such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C].\n\nWe can precompute the number of pairs (x,y) satisfying x+y>z by using prefix sums or two pointers?\n\nLet me reframe: For a fixed z, we want:\n   Count(z) = number of x in [A,B] and y in [B,C] such that x+y>z.\n\nWe can fix x and then y must be > z-x. But note that y is in [B, C] and also we know that x+y>z.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z and subtract from the total pairs.\n\nTotal pairs for a fixed z is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) if we ignore the condition.\n\nBut note: the condition on x and y is independent, but the condition x+y>z couples them.\n\nWe can do:\n\nCount(z) = (number of pairs (x,y) with x+y>z) = total pairs - (number of pairs with x+y<=z)\n\nBut note: the ranges are independent, so we can compute the pairs with x+y<=z by:\n\nFor a fixed z, we require:\n   x >= A, x <= B, y >= B, y <= C, and x+y<=z.\n\nWe can iterate over x from A to B, and for each x, the condition on y is:\n   y <= min(C, z-x) and y >= B.\n\nBut then we have to sum over x. Alternatively, we can use two pointers or precomputation.\n\nBut note: we are iterating over z from C to D (which is about 500000) and for each z we iterate over x from A to B (which is about 500000). That would be O( (D-C+1)*(B-A+1) ) which is 500000*500000 = 250e9, which is too slow.\n\nWe need a better way.\n\nLet's try to fix x and y and see for how many z (from C to D) the condition x+y>z holds? But wait, we are iterating by z. Alternatively, we can change the order.\n\nAnother idea: Instead of iterating over z, we can precompute the set of pairs (x,y) and then for each pair (x,y) count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y (and also note that z must be at least C and at most D). But then we have to consider that x,y are in their respective intervals.\n\nBut the total pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which is up to 500000*500000 = 250e9, which is too many to iterate.\n\nWe need to use mathematical formulas.\n\nConsider: We want to count for each z (from C to D) the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z.\n\nWe can invert the problem: For each pair (x,y) (with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]), the condition is x+y>z, i.e., z < x+y.\n\nThen the total count is the sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)   [but wait, we are counting the z from C to min(D, x+y-1)]\n\nBut then we are doing it for every pair (x,y) and that is too slow.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix x and then consider the y's. Then for each x, we want to count the pairs (y) in [B, C] such that y > z - x, and then for each z we would have to aggregate. But again, we are iterating over x and then over y, and then over z? Not efficient.\n\nWait, we can do:\n\nLet F(z) = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y>z.\n\nWe can write F(z) = number of x in [A, B] and y in [B, C] such that y > z - x.\n\nFor a fixed x, let T(x) = { y in [B, C] such that y > z - x }.\n\nThen for each x, we require y > max(B-1, z-x) [actually y must be at least B and greater than z-x]. So the lower bound for y is L_x = max(B, z-x+1) [if we consider integers] and upper bound is C.\n\nBut note: if z-x+1 <= B, then the condition becomes y>=B, but we require y>B-1 (which is always true for y>=B). Actually, we require y>=max(B, z-x+1) and y<=C.\n\nSo the number of y for a fixed x and z is:\n   If z-x+1 <= B: then y from B to C -> (C-B+1)\n   Else: y from max(B, z-x+1) to C -> (C - max(z-x, B-1)) \n\nBut wait, if we define L = max(B, z-x+1), then the number of y is max(0, C - L + 1).\n\nThen F(z) = sum_{x=A}^{B} max(0, C - max(B-1, z-x) + 1)   [Wait, note: when we set L = max(B, z-x+1), then the count is max(0, C - (z-x) if z-x+1 <= B? Let me correct:]\n\nActually, we can write:\n   Let low_bound = max(B, z-x+1)\n   Then the number of y is max(0, C - low_bound + 1)\n\nBut note: if z-x+1 > C, then no y satisfies.\n\nBut then we have to sum this for x from A to B.\n\nNow, we need to do this for every z from C to D. The total operations would be (D-C+1) * (B-A+1) which is about 500000 * 500000 = 250e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\nWe need to optimize further.\n\nLet me try to swap the summations: Instead of iterating over z and then over x, we can iterate over x and then for each x, we determine the range of z for which the condition holds.\n\nFor a fixed x, we want to count the number of z in [C, D] such that there exists a y in [B, C] with y > z-x.\n\nBut note: the condition on y is independent of z? Actually, for a fixed x, the condition is: there exists y in [B, C] such that y > z-x.\n\nBut note: we are counting the entire triple (x,y,z). Alternatively, we can think:\n\nTotal = sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} [number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y]\n\nBut note: the condition is z < x+y, and z must be at least C and at most D.\n\nSo for a fixed (x,y), the number of z is:\n   z_min = C\n   z_max = min(D, x+y-1)\n   Then the count is max(0, z_max - C + 1)   [if x+y-1 >= C]\n\nBut then the total number of triangles is:\n   Total = sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)\n\nBut now we have to iterate over x and y. The total pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be up to 500000*500000 = 250e9, which is too slow.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nHow about we fix the sum s = x+y, then the condition is z < s, and we know that s ranges from (A+B) to (B+C). Then for a fixed s, the number of (x,y) pairs such that x+y=s, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C] is:\n   For x from max(A, s-C) to min(B, s-B): then y = s-x must be in [B,C]. Actually, x must be at least max(A, s-C) and at most min(B, s-B). But note: y = s-x must be between B and C.\n\nBut then for each s, the number of z is max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1) [if s-1 >= C, otherwise 0].\n\nThen the total is:\n   Total = sum_{s = s_min}^{s_max} [count(s) * max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)]\n\nwhere s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C.\n\nNow, how to compute count(s) quickly?\n\nFor a fixed s, the condition on x is:\n   x >= max(A, s-C)   [since y=s-x <= C => x>=s-C]\n   x <= min(B, s-B)   [since y=s-x>=B => x<=s-B]\n   and also x must be in [A,B].\n\nBut note: we must also have y in [B,C] -> so x must be in [s-C, s-B] and also in [A,B]. So:\n   x_low = max(A, s-C)\n   x_high = min(B, s-B)\n\nThen if x_low <= x_high, then count(s) = x_high - x_low + 1, else 0.\n\nBut note: the condition on y: y = s-x must be an integer and in [B, C]. This is ensured by x being in [s-C, s-B] and then y is between s-(s-B)=B and s-(s-C)=C.\n\nNow, we can iterate s from s_min = A+B to s_max = B+C, and for each s, we compute count(s) and then multiply by the number of z (which is max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)).\n\nBut the range of s is from (A+B) to (B+C). The length of this interval is (B+C - A - B + 1) = (C-A+1). Since A>=1, C<=500000, then C-A+1 can be up to 500000. So we are iterating over about 500000 s values, and for each s we do constant time work. Then the total time is O(C-A+1) which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C. The length is (B+C - A - B + 1) = (C-A+1). Since A<=B<=C, then C-A+1 can be as large as 500000, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious because A, B, C, D are given and we are iterating from s_min to s_max. The worst-case is about 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D.\n\n2. s_min = A+B\n3. s_max = B+C\n\n4. Initialize total_triangles = 0.\n\n5. For s from s_min to s_max:\n      x_low = max(A, s-C)\n      x_high = min(B, s-B)\n      if x_low <= x_high:\n          count_s = x_high - x_low + 1\n      else:\n          count_s = 0\n\n      # Now, the condition on z: z must be in [C, D] and z < s.\n      # The smallest z is C, the largest z is min(D, s-1).\n      if s-1 < C:\n          # Then no z satisfies z>=C and z < s.\n          count_z = 0\n      else:\n          # The z must be from C to min(D, s-1)\n          low_z = C\n          high_z = min(D, s-1)\n          if low_z <= high_z:\n              count_z = high_z - low_z + 1\n          else:\n              count_z = 0\n\n      total_triangles += count_s * count_z\n\n6. Print total_triangles.\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me test with the example: \"1 2 3 4\"\n\nHere, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns_min = 1+2 = 3, s_max = 2+3 = 5.\n\ns=3:\n   x_low = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n   x_high = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n   count_s = 1\n   count_z: s-1=2, then z from 3 to min(4,2) -> but 3<=min(4,2)=2 is false -> count_z=0.\n\ns=4:\n   x_low = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n   x_high = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n   count_s = 2-1+1 = 2\n   count_z: s-1=3, then z from 3 to min(4,3)=3 -> count_z=1 (only z=3)\n   contribution = 2*1 = 2\n\ns=5:\n   x_low = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n   x_high = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n   count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=4, then z from 3 to min(4,4)=4 -> count_z=2 (z=3,4)\n   contribution=1*2=2\n\nTotal = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Matches the first example.\n\nSecond example: \"1 2 2 5\"\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\ns_min = 1+2=3, s_max=2+2=4.\n\ns=3:\n   x_low = max(1,3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n   x_high = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n   count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=2, then z from 2 to min(5,2)=2 -> count_z=1 (z=2)\n   contribution=1\n\ns=4:\n   x_low = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n   x_high = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n   count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=3, then z from 2 to min(5,3)=3 -> count_z=2 (z=2,3)\n   contribution=2\n\nTotal=1+2=3. Matches.\n\nThird example: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\nA=B=C=D=500000.\n\ns_min = 500000+500000=1000000, s_max=500000+500000=1000000.\n\ns=1000000:\n   x_low = max(500000,1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n   x_high = min(500000,1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000\n   count_s=1\n   count_z: s-1=999999, then z from 500000 to min(500000,999999)=500000 -> count_z=1\n   total=1.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut note: the ranges for s might be large, but the length is (B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C-A+1, which is at most 500000 (since A<=B<=C, then C-A<=500000). So the loop runs at most 500000 times, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note that the condition for x_low and x_high must be computed correctly.\n\nLet me check the boundaries:\n\nx must be in [A, B] and y = s-x must be in [B, C].\n\nConditions for y: B <= s-x <= C  => s-C <= x <= s-B.\n\nAlso, x must be in [A, B]. So x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\nThis is correct.\n\nCode:\n\nWe read the input as four integers.\n\nNote: The input may have multiple lines? The example input is given as three separate strings, but the problem says the first line contains four integers.\n\nBut the example input is provided as:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is one line. So we read one line.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nimport sys\n\ndata = sys.stdin.readline().split()\nA = int(data[0]); B = int(data[1]); C = int(data[2]); D = int(data[3])\n\nThen do the above.\n\nBut wait: the example input has three test cases? Actually, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first line contains four integers.\n\nBut the example input is given as:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nThis is confusing. Actually, the example input format in the problem is:\n\nInput\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut that is just showing multiple examples. The actual input is one line.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"The first line\", meaning one line of input.\n\nSo we assume one line of four integers.\n\nBut wait, the example input is provided as a list of strings. In competitive programming, we usually read one line.\n\nBut the example input is given as three separate lines? Or is it one line with four numbers?\n\nLooking at the example: \n   Input: ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nThis is ambiguous. However, the problem states: \"The first line contains four integers\".\n\nSo we read one line. But the example output is provided as three separate outputs.\n\nActually, the example input has three test cases. But the problem says the input is one line.\n\nWait, the example input is:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the problem says: \"Input\" and then lists three strings. This might be a representation of multiple test cases, but the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\nLooking back: the problem says \"The first line contains four integers\". So we assume one test case per execution.\n\nBut the example input is provided as three separate lines? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\nInput\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 2 5\n500000 500000 500000 500000\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says:\n\nInput\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D (1≤A≤B≤C≤D≤5⋅10^5) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\nSo there is only one line.\n\nBut the example input is provided as three lines. This is a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps they meant to show three examples?\n\nIn the problem statement, the example input is given as:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the example output is:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nSo they are showing three separate inputs and outputs.\n\nBut the problem says the input is one line.\n\nClarification: I think the example input was given in a list for clarity, but the actual input is one line. However, the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\nBut wait, the constraints say that the input is one line. So we assume one test case.\n\nBut the example input has three test cases. This is confusing.\n\nActually, looking at the problem statement: it says \"Input\" and then shows:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut the problem description says \"The first line\", meaning one line.

However, the problem says \"The first line\", so if there are multiple test cases, we must read until EOF.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't say there are multiple test cases.\n\nI think the example input was intended to be three separate examples, but the problem input is one line.\n\nTherefore, we assume one test case.\n\nBut the sample input in the problem statement is given as three separate lines. So the judge might provide multiple test cases.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The first line\" (singular) contains four integers.\n\nSo we assume one test case.\n\nBut the example input is provided as three test cases. This is likely a formatting issue in the problem statement.\n\nTo be safe, we should check the problem statement again. It says:\n\n\"Input\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D (1≤A≤B≤C≤D≤5⋅10^5) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\"\n\nSo we read one line.\n\nHowever, the example input is provided as three lines.

This is confusing.\n\nAfter reading the problem statement again: It says \"The first line\", meaning one line. So the input is one line.\n\nBut the example input is shown as three lines.

So maybe the problem actually has multiple test cases, and the input format is multiple lines, each containing four integers.\n\nBut the problem says: \"The first line\", so we must clarify.\n\nLooking at the constraints: \"1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D ≤ 5·10^5\", and the input format is not specified beyond the first line.\n\nBut the example input has three lines. And the output has three answers.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem intended to have multiple test cases. But the problem statement did not specify.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says \"The first line\", which typically means the first and only line.\n\nBut the example input is three lines. This is contradictory.\n\nI'll ask for clarification, but since I can't, I must rely on the constraints.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Print the number of triangles...\". So one answer per test case.\n\nAnd the example input is three lines, so three test cases.\n\nTherefore, the input can have multiple test cases. Each test case is one line of four integers.\n\nBut the problem says \"The first line\", so if there is only one test case, then yes. But if there are multiple, then each line is a test case.\n\nWait, the problem says \"The first line\", meaning the first line of the input. But if there are multiple test cases, then the first line is the first test case, the second line the second, etc.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the constraints: the numbers are up to 500000, and the input size is one line. But the example input is three lines.\n\nI think the problem intended to have multiple test cases, but the statement is not clear.\n\nBut the problem statement says: \"The first line contains four integers\". \n\nThis implies that the entire input consists of one line. \n\nBut the example input is three lines. \n\nTherefore, I suspect the example input was provided incorrectly.\n\nBut wait, the example input is provided as a list of strings. Maybe the judge's input is one line, and the example input is just showing three examples.\n\nSo I will assume one test case per execution.\n\nBut the problem statement example input is three lines, and the example output is three numbers. \n\nThere are two possibilities:\n\n1. The problem has multiple test cases and we must read until EOF.\n\n2. The problem has one test case, and the example input is three separate examples.\n\nBut the problem statement does not say anything about multiple test cases.\n\nHowever, the constraints on the numbers (each up to 500000) and the fact that the input is provided in one line (according to the problem) suggest one test case.\n\nBut the example input is three lines. \n\nAfter re‐reading the problem statement: It says \"Input\" and then gives a list of three strings. This is likely a formatting issue.\n\nBut note: the problem statement says:\n\nInput\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nThis is not standard. Usually, we write:\n\nInput:\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 2 5\n500000 500000 500000 500000\n\nBut the problem says \"The first line\", so the first line is \"1 2 3 4\".\n\nSo the entire input is one line? Or three lines?\n\nThe problem statement uses a list representation, which might be just for showing multiple examples.\n\nBut the problem says \"The first line\", so we assume one line.\n\nBut the example input has three lines. \n\nTo resolve, I will look at the sample tests:\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 -> Output 4\nSample Input 2: 1 2 2 5 -> Output 3\nSample Input 3: 500000 500000 500000 500000 -> Output 1\n\nSo the problem has three test cases. But the problem statement says \"The first line\", so if there are three test cases, then there are three lines.\n\nThis suggests that the input has multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases.\n\nHowever, the constraints say that each test case has four integers in the range [1, 500000].\n\nSo we must read until EOF, and for each test case, read a line of four integers.\n\nBut the problem says \"The first line\", so if there is only one test case, then we read one line. If there are multiple, then we read multiple.\n\nBut the problem statement does not specify.\n\nBut the example input is three lines, so we must handle multiple test cases.\n\nSo the input format is: multiple lines, each containing four integers.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"The first line\", which is misleading.\n\nI think the problem intended to say that the input consists of several lines, each containing four integers.\n\nBut the statement says \"The first line\", which is incorrect if there are multiple test cases.\n\nGiven the example input, we assume multiple test cases.\n\nWe can read until EOF.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"The first line\", so I'm confused.\n\nSince the problem statement example input is three lines and the output is three answers, we assume that the input can have multiple test cases.\n\nHow to handle:\n\nWe read lines until there are no more. For each line, we split into four integers and process.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints say the integers are in the range [1, 500000] and the input is one line. But the example input is three lines.\n\nSo we decide to read from stdin until EOF.\n\nCode adjustment:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.split()\n        if len(parts) < 4:\n            continue\n        A = int(parts[0]); B = int(parts[1]); C = int(parts[2]); D = int(parts[3])\n        # Then compute the answer for (A, B, C, D)\n\nBut wait, the problem says the first line contains four integers, but if there are multiple test cases, then each line contains four integers.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"The first line\", which might imply that there is only one line.\n\nBut the example input is three lines.\n\nSo we go by the example.\n\nWe'll read all lines and process each.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints say the integers are up to 500000, and the range of s is (C-A+1) which is at most 500000, and the total number of test cases is not specified.\n\nBut the input size: the total numbers is 4 * (number of test cases). The problem doesn't specify the number of test cases, but the constraints on integers are independent.\n\nBut note: the problem statement says \"Input\" and then shows three test cases. The constraints say that each test case has four integers.\n\nWe assume that the input ends when EOF is reached.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"The first line\", so if the judge provides one test case, then we read one line. If the judge provides three, then we read three.\n\nBut the problem statement example input is three.\n\nSo we write the code to read all test cases.\n\nBut note: the problem statement says \"The first line\", so if there is only one test case, we must read one line. But if there are multiple, then multiple lines.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    # We don't know how many test cases, so we'll read until EOF, but the input is space separated? No, the input is lines.\n\n    # Actually, the input is given as multiple lines, each with four integers.\n\n    # But the example input is given as a list of strings, each string being \"1 2 3 4\", etc.\n\n    # We can read line by line.\n\n    # Let's read lines.\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    results = []\n    for line in lines:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.split()\n        if len(parts) != 4:\n            # Skip if not four integers\n            continue\n        A = int(parts[0]); B = int(parts[1]); C = int(parts[2]); D = int(parts[3])\n        # Process one test case\n\n        # Compute the answer for (A, B, C, D)\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n\n        total_triangles = 0\n\n        # We iterate s from s_min to s_max\n        # But note: s_min and s_max might be large, but the range is (C-A+1) which is at most 500000, so we can iterate.\n        for s_val in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n            # Condition for x: must be in [A, B] and also s_val-C <= x <= s_val-B, so x in [max(A, s_val-C), min(B, s_val-B)]\n            x_low = max(A, s_val - C)\n            x_high = min(B, s_val - B)\n            if x_low <= x_high:\n                count_s = x_high - x_low + 1\n            else:\n                count_s = 0\n\n            # Condition for z: z in [C, D] and z < s_val\n            if s_val - 1 < C:\n                count_z = 0\n            else:\n                low_z = C\n                high_z = min(D, s_val-1)\n                if low_z <= high_z:\n                    count_z = high_z - low_z + 1\n                else:\n                    count_z = 0\n\n            total_triangles += count_s * count_z\n\n        results.append(str(total_triangles))\n\n    # Output each result on separate lines.\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nBut wait, the example input is three lines, so we are processing three test cases and outputting three lines.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"The first line\", but our code reads multiple lines.\n\nHowever, the problem example input is three lines, so we output three lines.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"Input\" and then shows three lines.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we need an optimized mathematical approach.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for three sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) (with \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\)), the triangle inequality simplifies to \\(x + y > z\\). The other inequalities (\\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\)) are automatically satisfied when \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\) and \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\), we determine the range of valid \\(z\\) values (from \\(C\\) to \\(\\min(D, s-1)\\)) and the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs that sum to \\(s\\). The total number of valid triangles is the sum over all possible sums \\(s\\) of the product of the number of \\((x, y)\\) pairs and the number of valid \\(z\\) values for each \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over all possible sums \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\).\n   - For each \\(s\\), compute the number of valid \\(x\\) values (and thus \\(y = s - x\\)) such that \\(x\\) is in \\([A, B]\\) and \\(y\\) is in \\([B, C]\\).\n   - For each \\(s\\), compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values (from \\(C\\) to \\(\\min(D, s-1)\\)).\n   - Multiply the counts of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs and valid \\(z\\) values for each \\(s\\) and accumulate the result.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm iterates over \\(O(C - A)\\) possible sums \\(s\\), which is efficient since \\(C - A\\) can be up to 500,000 (as per constraints). Each iteration involves constant-time operations, making the overall complexity \\(O(C - A)\\), which is acceptable for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    results = []\n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.split()\n        if len(parts) < 4:\n            continue\n        try:\n            A = int(parts[0])\n            B = int(parts[1])\n            C = int(parts[2])\n            D = int(parts[3])\n        except Exception:\n            continue\n        \n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n        total_triangles = 0\n        \n        for s_val in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n            x_low = max(A, s_val - C)\n            x_high = min(B, s_val - B)\n            if x_low <= x_high:\n                count_s = x_high - x_low + 1\n            else:\n                count_s = 0\n                \n            if s_val - 1 < C:\n                count_z = 0\n            else:\n                low_z = C\n                high_z = min(D, s_val - 1)\n                if low_z <= high_z:\n                    count_z = high_z - low_z + 1\n                else:\n                    count_z = 0\n                    \n            total_triangles += count_s * count_z\n            \n        results.append(str(total_triangles))\n        \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, processing each line as a separate test case. Each line contains four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n\n2. **Sum Range Calculation**: For each test case, the minimum and maximum possible sums \\(s\\) (denoted as \\(s_{\\text{min}}\\) and \\(s_{\\text{max}}\\)) are calculated based on the given ranges for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n3. **Counting Valid Pairs and Z Values**: For each sum \\(s\\) from \\(s_{\\text{min}}\\) to \\(s_{\\text{max}}\\):\n   - **Valid \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) Pairs**: The number of valid \\(x\\) values (and corresponding \\(y = s - x\\)) is determined by ensuring \\(x\\) lies within \\([A, B]\\) and \\(y\\) within \\([B, C]\\).\n   - **Valid \\(z\\) Values**: The number of valid \\(z\\) values (from \\(C\\) to \\(\\min(D, s-1)\\)) is calculated to ensure \\(z < s\\).\n\n4. **Result Accumulation**: The product of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs and valid \\(z\\) values for each \\(s\\) is added to the total count of non-degenerate triangles.\n\n5. **Output**: The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all valid triangles by leveraging mathematical insights and careful range calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
